1
00:02:20,542 --> 00:02:22,373
I've won 3 games consecutively.

2
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:25,287
He doesn't wanna play then.

3
00:02:40,833 --> 00:02:42,289
Some guy has all the luck!

4
00:02:42,292 --> 00:02:43,031
I said you must win.

5
00:02:43,083 --> 00:02:44,368
Hold it!

6
00:02:45,167 --> 00:02:46,828
Have guts to play a big game?

7
00:02:49,458 --> 00:02:50,823
I won't be scared!

8
00:02:51,292 --> 00:02:53,408
Dad, tell him not to!

9
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:57,412
Don't be afraid? He'll win!

10
00:02:57,708 --> 00:02:59,414
You're always on his side.

11
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,285
What's the matter?

12
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:04,663
Enough money?

13
00:03:06,083 --> 00:03:07,664
After this one, definitely.

14
00:03:16,292 --> 00:03:18,829
Take it! You'll win, Rick!

15
00:03:21,625 --> 00:03:23,286
Ok! I accept it!

16
00:03:26,875 --> 00:03:27,705
Last game!

17
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:29,323
You said so every time.

18
00:03:30,292 --> 00:03:31,782
Good boy!

19
00:03:38,458 --> 00:03:39,458
Uncle cheung!

20
00:03:40,542 --> 00:03:42,022
Big brother shing is waiting for you.

21
00:03:42,292 --> 00:03:43,577
Big brother shing!

22
00:03:43,833 --> 00:03:44,833
He's out there!

23
00:03:50,042 --> 00:03:52,249
Keep on playing!

24
00:03:54,583 --> 00:03:57,450
It's not my fault!
I do as your dad said.

25
00:03:57,458 --> 00:03:58,698
Start...

26
00:04:12,333 --> 00:04:14,949
I'm running out of luck.

27
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:16,914
No hope for the gold bracelet.

28
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,706
These are the excessive.

29
00:04:52,708 --> 00:04:53,868
Haven't you bought
what I told you to?

30
00:04:53,875 --> 00:04:56,241
Don't worry. Here it is.

31
00:04:57,625 --> 00:04:59,206
Now no one owes anything to no one!

32
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:05,539
Big brother shing!
You know that I retired long ago.

33
00:05:05,667 --> 00:05:07,953
This time it's my son!

34
00:05:07,958 --> 00:05:09,744
You're experienced.

35
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:11,741
Otherwise, I wouldn't
come to see you.

36
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:13,365
It's because of your son.

37
00:05:13,375 --> 00:05:16,742
I'm afraid that I couldn't handle.

38
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:19,036
Cheung, what had happened to you?

39
00:05:19,042 --> 00:05:20,907
You used to be straightforward!

40
00:05:20,917 --> 00:05:22,873
Why are you so sluggish now?

41
00:05:23,875 --> 00:05:25,365
Maybe it's because I'm old!

42
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:27,286
I'm not telling you
to murder someone.

43
00:05:27,292 --> 00:05:29,283
Just smuggle a boy here for me.

44
00:05:29,292 --> 00:05:30,657
What's the difficulty?

45
00:05:30,667 --> 00:05:31,998
Do you refuse me?

46
00:05:33,542 --> 00:05:37,205
I can introduce you
to another guy!

47
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:39,832
No need for that!
I've got lots of guy!

48
00:05:39,833 --> 00:05:41,619
I must find one that is reliable.

49
00:05:41,625 --> 00:05:44,822
Yes or no?

50
00:05:45,167 --> 00:05:47,624
Even if I find others,

51
00:05:47,625 --> 00:05:49,741
you've known this case already.

52
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:54,247
If there's anything wrong later,
you'll be suspected!

53
00:05:59,417 --> 00:06:01,248
Don't refuse me!

54
00:06:05,292 --> 00:06:08,159
Your business is good here!

55
00:06:08,458 --> 00:06:10,369
Got any guy making trouble here?

56
00:06:10,375 --> 00:06:12,240
Tell me if there is any!

57
00:06:19,292 --> 00:06:20,292
Thank you!

58
00:06:40,708 --> 00:06:42,244
What does it mean?

59
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:43,410
It's for you!

60
00:06:43,417 --> 00:06:45,177
Haven't you said that
you liked it very much?

61
00:06:45,375 --> 00:06:47,616
I won't take it if it was
won from gambling.

62
00:06:47,625 --> 00:06:49,490
Don't be childish!

63
00:06:53,458 --> 00:06:57,155
Rick, come over here!

64
00:07:01,958 --> 00:07:03,238
What's the matter, uncle cheung?

65
00:07:03,292 --> 00:07:04,292
Sit down!

66
00:07:05,417 --> 00:07:07,123
Quarreling again with lap?

67
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:09,206
She is spoiled.

68
00:07:09,208 --> 00:07:10,493
Just joking!

69
00:07:12,333 --> 00:07:15,746
Rick, I want your help.

70
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:17,115
What can I do for you?

71
00:07:17,125 --> 00:07:18,535
I want you to be my driver!

72
00:07:18,542 --> 00:07:19,622
Driver!

73
00:07:19,625 --> 00:07:21,240
No problem! When?

74
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:23,664
There maybe danger!

75
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:26,740
We'll help a guy immigrate illegally.

76
00:07:28,833 --> 00:07:31,290
I'll do anything for you.

77
00:07:32,042 --> 00:07:33,042
Thank you!

78
00:07:43,292 --> 00:07:45,658
I rejected his proposal!

79
00:07:45,667 --> 00:07:48,079
What have you rejected?

80
00:07:48,083 --> 00:07:53,498
I refused to marry you!

81
00:07:55,125 --> 00:07:56,581
You're beautiful and sweet.

82
00:07:56,583 --> 00:07:59,541
So kind that you'll bring
luck to husband!

83
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:01,536
But I don't have that luck!

84
00:08:07,958 --> 00:08:10,825
This chain has no use now!

85
00:08:11,542 --> 00:08:13,203
No one need you!

86
00:08:13,208 --> 00:08:14,323
Just go away, stupid chain!

87
00:08:16,917 --> 00:08:18,282
Why did you throw it away?

88
00:08:19,417 --> 00:08:21,703
Pick it back for me!

89
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,160
Don't you know me?

90
00:08:51,375 --> 00:08:52,740
Getting prettier every day.

91
00:08:53,167 --> 00:08:54,373
Is your dad home?

92
00:09:07,333 --> 00:09:10,825
Long time no see, cheung!

93
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,365
It's not bad here!

94
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:15,535
How is your business?

95
00:09:15,542 --> 00:09:16,873
So so...

96
00:09:23,292 --> 00:09:26,079
Why looking for me
in such an urgency?

97
00:09:26,083 --> 00:09:27,823
Old trick.

98
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:34,824
Wasn't you retired already?

99
00:09:34,833 --> 00:09:36,164
I'm helping a friend!

100
00:09:47,417 --> 00:09:49,078
Isn't here sheung shui?

101
00:09:49,083 --> 00:09:50,823
We'll be in yuen long soon.

102
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:54,082
Then it is castle peak.

103
00:09:54,083 --> 00:09:55,698
And then tsuen wan, kwai chung.

104
00:09:59,708 --> 00:10:02,666
Do you have any
audio-tape of Theresa tang?

105
00:10:02,667 --> 00:10:03,827
No.

106
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:11,207
This is viceroy,
an American brand.

107
00:10:11,208 --> 00:10:12,914
I've smoked that before.

108
00:10:12,917 --> 00:10:15,124
Now I'm a malboro man.

109
00:10:15,833 --> 00:10:18,290
Hong Kong is not that modern.

110
00:10:18,292 --> 00:10:20,032
Similar to shenzhen.

111
00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:22,661
Does this car
have air-conditioner?

112
00:10:22,667 --> 00:10:25,158
My dad's benz has air-conditioner!

113
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:31,870
Young man, you're smart!

114
00:10:31,875 --> 00:10:34,537
You'll succeed in Hong Kong.

115
00:10:34,833 --> 00:10:37,745
Haven't you thought
of doing anything?

116
00:10:37,917 --> 00:10:41,239
I want to be a singer.

117
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:43,286
Singing in a concert
at the Hong Kong coliseum

118
00:10:43,292 --> 00:10:45,248
some days.

119
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:49,164
Good ambition!

120
00:10:49,458 --> 00:10:52,325
But you got to have
connection to be a singer.

121
00:10:53,083 --> 00:10:55,540
I'll make it with
the help of my dad.

122
00:10:55,542 --> 00:10:57,328
Who's he? Lee ka-shing?

123
00:10:57,333 --> 00:10:59,039
No, he isn't!

124
00:10:59,042 --> 00:11:00,498
He's law man-shing!

125
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:01,580
Haven't you heard of him?

126
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:26,494
What are you doing?

127
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:27,740
Police!

128
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:38,993
Take him to the headquarters!

129
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,082
- Ok!
- Thanks.

130
00:11:51,583 --> 00:11:53,369
Clever trick!

131
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:57,162
Let's have some drinks, cheung?

132
00:11:57,458 --> 00:11:58,823
We're in a hurry.

133
00:11:59,167 --> 00:12:00,452
Release me then!

134
00:12:00,708 --> 00:12:03,950
There's no need to hurry!

135
00:12:08,542 --> 00:12:11,284
Young man, stop before the store!

136
00:12:12,708 --> 00:12:14,790
Good, I'm thirsty!

137
00:12:29,208 --> 00:12:30,072
Let's go.

138
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:32,324
Be gentle. It's painful.

139
00:12:32,917 --> 00:12:34,282
Let's go.

140
00:12:35,667 --> 00:12:36,782
Rick, come and have some drinks!

141
00:12:36,792 --> 00:12:39,078
No, thanks! I wait here!

142
00:12:45,583 --> 00:12:47,039
Two bottles of soft drink!

143
00:12:47,042 --> 00:12:48,122
Release me!

144
00:13:02,833 --> 00:13:06,280
Cheung, you're too selfish.

145
00:13:06,292 --> 00:13:09,124
Why don't you tell me that
he's law's son?

146
00:13:09,125 --> 00:13:11,741
He's wealthy but
you give me so little!

147
00:13:16,667 --> 00:13:18,203
Why don't you take me to my dad?

148
00:13:20,625 --> 00:13:22,991
Take me to my dad at once!

149
00:13:23,333 --> 00:13:24,733
What are you still
waiting for here?

150
00:13:37,917 --> 00:13:39,623
How much do you want?

151
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,740
At least this figure!

152
00:13:58,333 --> 00:13:59,573
Cheung, you listen.

153
00:13:59,583 --> 00:14:01,915
If I didn't get any benefit

154
00:14:01,917 --> 00:14:04,249
I'd rather arrest him.

155
00:14:05,542 --> 00:14:07,624
Ok, I tell shing when I see him.

156
00:14:07,625 --> 00:14:08,910
It's better to tell him now!

157
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:15,500
Come!

158
00:14:24,625 --> 00:14:26,661
Young man, be patient!

159
00:14:32,792 --> 00:14:34,874
Hello, brother shing!
It's me, cheung!

160
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:37,824
Your son is alright.

161
00:14:39,667 --> 00:14:42,204
The cop here wants more money.

162
00:14:42,208 --> 00:14:43,823
Can you do that?

163
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:45,535
Do you agree?

164
00:14:45,667 --> 00:14:47,703
Ok...

165
00:15:02,375 --> 00:15:05,412
Trying to fool me?

166
00:15:06,167 --> 00:15:09,534
You cunning old fox.

167
00:15:09,833 --> 00:15:12,745
Tang, I didn't mean that...

168
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:14,866
I don't want to foul it up.

169
00:15:14,875 --> 00:15:16,035
Aren't you fooling me?

170
00:15:16,042 --> 00:15:17,953
I'll arrest him.

171
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:19,414
None of us will benefit from it.

172
00:15:19,417 --> 00:15:20,998
Tang, please listen to me...

173
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,457
Don't you try to play tricks.

174
00:15:23,458 --> 00:15:25,870
I take him to
the police station now.

175
00:15:26,375 --> 00:15:28,036
I wonder what you
can say to big brother shing.

176
00:15:28,042 --> 00:15:28,827
No...

177
00:15:28,833 --> 00:15:33,281
I call the cards now.

178
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:39,123
Tang, don't drive me too
far please! I, really...

179
00:15:50,167 --> 00:15:51,282
You chicken shit.

180
00:16:03,375 --> 00:16:05,616
Tang, you are in a big trouble.

181
00:16:05,625 --> 00:16:06,489
Don't move!

182
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,707
How can I explain to
big brother shing now?

183
00:16:08,708 --> 00:16:09,823
Explain?

184
00:17:46,625 --> 00:17:47,330
Dad!

185
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:48,698
Lap, get into the car!

186
00:17:48,708 --> 00:17:50,539
I'll phone wong!
Wait for me in the car!

187
00:17:50,542 --> 00:17:51,327
Where's Rick?

188
00:17:51,333 --> 00:17:53,039
He's waiting at the pier!

189
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:00,911
Hello, wong!

190
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:02,956
Have you got any ship?

191
00:18:06,625 --> 00:18:08,035
Something is wrong!
We have to hide!

192
00:18:08,708 --> 00:18:11,074
Three! As soon as possible!

193
00:18:34,708 --> 00:18:35,868
Dad!

194
00:18:44,208 --> 00:18:45,493
Lap, where are you going?

195
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:47,910
I call the police!

196
00:18:47,917 --> 00:18:52,081
You can't report this case
to the police!

197
00:18:52,083 --> 00:18:53,493
Then what can I do?

198
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,707
Find someone to save your dad!

199
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:56,956
Whom could I ask for help?

200
00:18:59,542 --> 00:19:00,577
Find godfather shen!

201
00:19:02,083 --> 00:19:02,822
Godfather shen?

202
00:19:02,833 --> 00:19:05,449
Yes, he was your dad's partner once

203
00:19:05,458 --> 00:19:07,369
I think he may help you.

204
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:57,865
Is godfather shen here?

205
00:19:58,750 --> 00:19:59,785
What are you looking him for?

206
00:19:59,792 --> 00:20:02,033
Something urgent. Is he here?

207
00:20:32,292 --> 00:20:33,407
Godfather shen!

208
00:20:37,792 --> 00:20:41,159
All wet! Stowing away?

209
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:46,414
Sit down!

210
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:51,287
I'm cheung's daughter.
He's in trouble.

211
00:20:51,292 --> 00:20:53,078
Would you help me save him?

212
00:20:54,625 --> 00:20:55,990
You're cheung's daughter.

213
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,161
I'd seen you before

214
00:20:58,167 --> 00:20:59,828
you were bathing naked.

215
00:20:59,833 --> 00:21:01,539
I caressed you

216
00:21:01,792 --> 00:21:03,657
and you cried!

217
00:21:04,125 --> 00:21:05,786
It was lucky that
your dad wasn't there.

218
00:21:05,792 --> 00:21:07,282
Talking about uncle cheung...

219
00:21:07,292 --> 00:21:09,328
My dad was taken by big brother shing.

220
00:21:11,125 --> 00:21:12,456
Have some tea first!

221
00:21:14,083 --> 00:21:17,701
Why so hurry!
Speak slowly and calmly!

222
00:21:27,542 --> 00:21:29,533
Would you help me save my dad?

223
00:21:32,292 --> 00:21:35,079
I've heard about cheung's case...

224
00:21:35,083 --> 00:21:38,041
I don't care who's right or wrong.

225
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:41,947
But everyone knows that
big brother shing is a tough one!

226
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:44,365
We have rules to obey.

227
00:21:44,375 --> 00:21:46,536
We have to help our own men!

228
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,867
But I find no reason to help you!

229
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:05,956
But there's exception
for beautiful girls.

230
00:22:05,958 --> 00:22:08,165
There are two kinds of women
that I'll help!

231
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:11,697
One is my mother
and the others are my whores.

232
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:14,706
You are not my mother.

233
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:18,280
So you have to be my whore
if you want me to help you.

234
00:22:19,792 --> 00:22:20,907
Go to hell!

235
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:23,785
Godfather shen!

236
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,661
Aren't you coming for me?

237
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:31,536
Why leaving so soon?

238
00:22:32,542 --> 00:22:34,032
She is cheung's daughter.

239
00:22:34,042 --> 00:22:37,910
I know! And you treat her
as a whore.

240
00:22:37,917 --> 00:22:39,748
How tasteless.

241
00:22:41,292 --> 00:22:44,489
I am offering you this
chance to be my woman.

242
00:22:44,875 --> 00:22:46,240
What do you think?

243
00:22:55,042 --> 00:22:58,205
Think carefully! I won't force you!

244
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,289
Big brother shing is bad news.

245
00:23:04,625 --> 00:23:06,490
Cheung is in a great trouble
this time.

246
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:08,036
Once in his hands,

247
00:23:08,042 --> 00:23:09,748
no chance of survival.

248
00:23:10,833 --> 00:23:14,155
Cheung's too old.
He can't survive this.

249
00:23:14,167 --> 00:23:15,998
Chances are he'll die.

250
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,117
He'll suffer a lot
even if he is alive!

251
00:23:19,125 --> 00:23:22,117
He may lose one of
his legs or arms!

252
00:23:23,375 --> 00:23:26,412
Bloody old fool.

253
00:23:27,708 --> 00:23:28,708
Godfather shen!

254
00:23:44,833 --> 00:23:45,833
Rick!

255
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,787
Why are you so late? Is it alright?

256
00:23:53,167 --> 00:23:54,247
Where's your dad?

257
00:23:58,500 --> 00:23:59,740
He can't come!

258
00:24:00,875 --> 00:24:03,742
But don't worry!
He's under protection!

259
00:24:05,833 --> 00:24:09,121
He wants you to leave!
He's alright!

260
00:24:09,958 --> 00:24:10,663
Then what about you?

261
00:24:10,667 --> 00:24:12,407
I'll stay here with dad!

262
00:24:12,417 --> 00:24:14,624
I'll come to you after
I've finished the work here!

263
00:24:14,625 --> 00:24:16,115
Don't forget to write me letters!

264
00:24:16,792 --> 00:24:18,077
Then I won't leave either!

265
00:24:18,083 --> 00:24:22,702
No way! The police learned
of your license plate number.

266
00:24:22,708 --> 00:24:23,868
You must leave!

267
00:24:23,875 --> 00:24:26,116
We'll be alright! Don't worry!

268
00:24:36,167 --> 00:24:38,499
Have some food first!
The ship will come soon!

269
00:24:38,708 --> 00:24:39,743
So soon?

270
00:24:40,417 --> 00:24:43,659
Yes, uncle wong
had arranged everything!

271
00:24:44,125 --> 00:24:46,707
Rick, here're clothes
and other things

272
00:24:46,708 --> 00:24:48,619
that I prepared for you!

273
00:24:59,417 --> 00:25:02,955
Take it easy! There's still time!

274
00:25:18,917 --> 00:25:20,248
Are you alright?

275
00:25:21,875 --> 00:25:23,456
Nothing!

276
00:25:23,458 --> 00:25:26,450
I'm worrying that you're alone.

277
00:25:27,625 --> 00:25:30,412
Don't worry! I can handle it!

278
00:25:30,417 --> 00:25:33,614
I'm smart enough to survive at anywhere!

279
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:45,615
Take care of yourself!

280
00:25:47,875 --> 00:25:48,955
You too.

281
00:26:20,875 --> 00:26:22,285
Put on this overcoat later!

282
00:26:22,292 --> 00:26:23,998
The wind is strong in the ocean.

283
00:26:35,708 --> 00:26:36,708
Rick...

284
00:26:53,583 --> 00:26:55,289
Say goodbye for me to your dad!

285
00:27:05,125 --> 00:27:06,125
Rick!

286
00:27:12,083 --> 00:27:13,698
Come over! I wait for you!

287
00:27:14,458 --> 00:27:16,073
I don't want to marry
a pilipino woman!

288
00:28:01,667 --> 00:28:03,032
Big brother cheung!

289
00:28:03,042 --> 00:28:04,748
Don't make fun of me.

290
00:28:13,708 --> 00:28:15,039
Miss lap, Mr. cheung!

291
00:28:19,333 --> 00:28:20,448
Miss lap!

292
00:28:33,208 --> 00:28:34,823
Dad, are you drinking again?

293
00:28:34,833 --> 00:28:36,573
I've told you not to drink!

294
00:28:36,625 --> 00:28:39,662
What else can I do if I don't drink?

295
00:28:47,167 --> 00:28:49,408
Don't give him liquor.
Give him ginseng tea!

296
00:28:50,708 --> 00:28:53,996
Let me drink another cup!

297
00:28:55,167 --> 00:28:56,532
No way!

298
00:28:59,125 --> 00:29:00,490
Am I driving him too far?

299
00:29:00,833 --> 00:29:01,913
You're doing that for his good!

300
00:29:01,917 --> 00:29:03,282
He had his stomach washed
just a few days ago.

301
00:29:03,292 --> 00:29:04,873
The doctor had told him not to drink.

302
00:29:06,875 --> 00:29:08,160
Look after him for me please!

303
00:29:26,292 --> 00:29:27,702
Lap, come here...

304
00:29:27,708 --> 00:29:29,508
Let me introduce you
to some Japanese tycoons.

305
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,366
This is Mr. Tanaka.

306
00:29:33,625 --> 00:29:35,707
How do you do?

307
00:29:40,667 --> 00:29:41,952
This is Mr. Yamamoto.

308
00:29:42,458 --> 00:29:43,493
How do you do?

309
00:29:47,875 --> 00:29:48,875
Cheers!

310
00:29:56,208 --> 00:29:57,539
This is Mr. saito.

311
00:29:57,958 --> 00:29:58,958
How do you do?

312
00:30:29,625 --> 00:30:31,115
Give me some liquor, cheung!

313
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,410
Do you want a drink, uncle cheung?

314
00:30:38,083 --> 00:30:40,165
This one is for you.

315
00:30:40,167 --> 00:30:41,953
Miss lap said that
he could not drink.

316
00:30:42,667 --> 00:30:45,624
Really! Haven't you heard of that?

317
00:30:45,625 --> 00:30:47,991
Your daughter loves you very much!

318
00:30:48,208 --> 00:30:50,574
She didn't mean what she said.

319
00:30:50,583 --> 00:30:51,447
Do you really want to
drink so much?

320
00:30:51,458 --> 00:30:52,458
Brother liu!

321
00:30:59,417 --> 00:31:01,954
Why don't you kneel down

322
00:31:01,958 --> 00:31:03,994
and hide under me?
I pour the drink to you!

323
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,241
Then your daughter won't see it!

324
00:31:06,792 --> 00:31:08,498
Good idea!

325
00:31:12,292 --> 00:31:13,327
Brother liu!

326
00:31:19,417 --> 00:31:21,123
You can drink!

327
00:31:34,458 --> 00:31:35,618
Open your mouth!

328
00:31:43,417 --> 00:31:44,657
Taste good, huh?

329
00:31:51,417 --> 00:31:53,749
She is a beauty and a drinker.

330
00:32:06,833 --> 00:32:09,040
I sang poorly.

331
00:34:13,583 --> 00:34:16,370
Uncle cheung, let's go!

332
00:34:18,417 --> 00:34:19,532
Lap!

333
00:34:19,792 --> 00:34:21,748
Let me drink with you at home?

334
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:26,331
Good...

335
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:27,500
Come on...

336
00:35:24,625 --> 00:35:27,457
Godfather shen, long time no see!

337
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:28,493
Cheers!

338
00:35:30,958 --> 00:35:32,368
Please sit down and talk awhile.

339
00:35:32,375 --> 00:35:33,375
Good!

340
00:35:37,208 --> 00:35:39,164
How's thing going with
your partner, fat lau?

341
00:35:39,167 --> 00:35:40,577
Would it give you any trouble?

342
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:44,412
I don't think it would!
He won't do any harm to me.

343
00:35:45,083 --> 00:35:46,163
No, he isn't.

344
00:35:46,167 --> 00:35:47,953
I've heard that

345
00:35:47,958 --> 00:35:50,870
he's turned police's witness now.

346
00:35:50,875 --> 00:35:53,207
He's going to tell all
the things about you!

347
00:35:53,208 --> 00:35:55,164
And he's going to finish you.

348
00:35:58,500 --> 00:35:59,706
You'd better watch out!

349
00:36:01,333 --> 00:36:03,039
Godfather shen, I'll finish you.

350
00:36:06,958 --> 00:36:09,415
It's alright... he tumbled.

351
00:36:09,417 --> 00:36:10,417
It's alright...

352
00:36:13,792 --> 00:36:15,328
The car is over there.

353
00:36:16,333 --> 00:36:17,573
I don't want to
take godfather shen's car.

354
00:36:17,583 --> 00:36:19,369
Ok! We'll take a taxi!

355
00:36:20,208 --> 00:36:22,665
You go to look after lap.

356
00:36:22,667 --> 00:36:24,123
I take you home first!

357
00:36:24,917 --> 00:36:30,537
I'm alright. Go look after her!

358
00:36:32,083 --> 00:36:34,540
Uncle cheung,
are you really alright?

359
00:37:17,208 --> 00:37:19,119
Find me a reliable man at once,

360
00:37:20,417 --> 00:37:22,703
and go to kill fat lau
before he goes to the court.

361
00:37:24,250 --> 00:37:25,456
No failure!

362
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:27,500
Good!

363
00:38:14,667 --> 00:38:16,282
Give me a glass of vodka tonic.

364
00:38:30,917 --> 00:38:32,623
20 dollars, please!

365
00:38:36,167 --> 00:38:37,167
Thanks!

366
00:38:45,125 --> 00:38:47,411
Dear Rick.

367
00:38:48,625 --> 00:38:52,493
Hong Kong is cold!
How's the weather in philippine?

368
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:58,539
You've told me that
you'd settled down already,

369
00:38:59,458 --> 00:39:01,870
and began to adapt
to the lifestyle there.

370
00:39:02,458 --> 00:39:03,823
I was happy about that.

371
00:39:05,875 --> 00:39:08,082
Dad was alright.

372
00:39:08,083 --> 00:39:09,789
But the bar was sold.

373
00:39:10,417 --> 00:39:13,159
We seemed to have to
start all over again.

374
00:39:14,958 --> 00:39:18,325
You asked me when
I would come to you.

375
00:39:20,042 --> 00:39:22,249
My answer may upset you.

376
00:39:23,417 --> 00:39:26,375
I've decided not coming
to philippine.

377
00:39:28,417 --> 00:39:29,702
After your leaving,

378
00:39:30,792 --> 00:39:32,874
I've thought calmly and thoroughly.

379
00:39:34,125 --> 00:39:36,366
There's a great difference
between our personality.

380
00:39:37,792 --> 00:39:41,034
We'd better break up,
seizing this moment.

381
00:39:41,625 --> 00:39:43,305
It's worthless to carry
on such a relation.

382
00:39:44,917 --> 00:39:47,454
Wish you have a stable
living and development.

383
00:39:48,125 --> 00:39:52,573
Just forget me and
take care of yourself.

384
00:39:52,958 --> 00:39:53,958
Yours sincerely, lap.

385
00:40:46,625 --> 00:40:48,411
Sorry, I've forgot my lighter!

386
00:41:12,875 --> 00:41:14,661
Do you like this place?

387
00:41:16,958 --> 00:41:17,697
Not bad!

388
00:41:17,708 --> 00:41:19,073
This place was better in the past.

389
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:21,286
My dad ran this place before.

390
00:41:21,958 --> 00:41:25,030
I was very happy at that time.

391
00:41:25,667 --> 00:41:27,532
You're living fine now also.

392
00:41:29,958 --> 00:41:32,244
Did you enjoy your childhood?

393
00:41:32,625 --> 00:41:36,823
Of course, my grandma loved me
very much!

394
00:41:36,833 --> 00:41:38,323
I liked watching movie
very much at that time.

395
00:41:38,333 --> 00:41:41,655
She knew I had no money so
she pretended to watch movie

396
00:41:41,667 --> 00:41:43,328
and asked me to come with her.

397
00:41:43,667 --> 00:41:45,987
But she felt asleep at the minute
she went into the cinema.

398
00:41:46,042 --> 00:41:47,532
Is you grandma still living?

399
00:41:47,542 --> 00:41:50,124
She is still living, but very old.

400
00:41:53,833 --> 00:41:56,540
Cheung, after all these years,

401
00:41:56,667 --> 00:41:58,077
have you really loved any one?

402
00:42:05,708 --> 00:42:07,073
You won't believe that...

403
00:42:22,375 --> 00:42:24,206
Are you thinking of your past boyfriend?

404
00:42:25,042 --> 00:42:28,739
Everything must have changed after
so many years of departure.

405
00:42:33,625 --> 00:42:35,035
You won't understand!

406
00:42:36,250 --> 00:42:38,081
If you really love someone,

407
00:42:39,417 --> 00:42:41,282
you'll think of him forever.

408
00:42:43,167 --> 00:42:44,828
Then you would go to find him!

409
00:42:46,125 --> 00:42:47,331
Where could I find him?

410
00:42:52,417 --> 00:42:55,830
Just forget him!

411
00:42:57,375 --> 00:42:59,081
He's really quite a guy.

412
00:43:00,833 --> 00:43:04,155
This is the bracelet he gave me!

413
00:43:04,167 --> 00:43:05,828
I'm wearing it until now!

414
00:43:06,625 --> 00:43:09,697
You mustn't tell
godfather shen about it!

415
00:43:09,708 --> 00:43:12,666
I really want to know how he looks.

416
00:43:12,667 --> 00:43:14,532
You've said so many
good words about him.

417
00:43:14,542 --> 00:43:15,952
I am really jealous.

418
00:43:15,958 --> 00:43:18,870
No, I didn't say anything.

419
00:43:20,792 --> 00:43:23,955
If I could meet him again,

420
00:43:23,958 --> 00:43:25,664
I would leave with him!

421
00:43:26,250 --> 00:43:27,911
Would you help me leave?

422
00:43:29,708 --> 00:43:31,289
I don't know. Let's wait and see.

423
00:43:32,042 --> 00:43:33,498
Would you help me?

424
00:43:37,167 --> 00:43:38,247
I don't know!

425
00:43:39,042 --> 00:43:40,623
You will.

426
00:43:43,458 --> 00:43:45,414
After all these years,

427
00:43:45,417 --> 00:43:47,533
he might have married already.

428
00:44:01,750 --> 00:44:04,287
The court hold at 4! Why so early?

429
00:44:04,292 --> 00:44:06,658
I wouldn't be the witness
if I knew it's annoying.

430
00:44:07,250 --> 00:44:11,869
Please give us a hand, Mr. lau!

431
00:44:12,208 --> 00:44:14,244
If not because of inspector tso,

432
00:44:14,250 --> 00:44:16,206
I won't go even if you kneel down.

433
00:44:57,583 --> 00:44:58,583
Start!

434
00:45:07,583 --> 00:45:08,948
When were you back?

435
00:45:09,375 --> 00:45:10,375
Last night!

436
00:45:11,125 --> 00:45:13,286
Why were you in such
a hurry just now?

437
00:45:13,875 --> 00:45:15,160
I'm leaving today.

438
00:45:16,708 --> 00:45:18,198
Where will you go? Philippine?

439
00:45:20,125 --> 00:45:22,036
Where are you going?
I'll give you a ride!

440
00:45:23,625 --> 00:45:25,331
Could I get off at there?

441
00:45:26,708 --> 00:45:27,708
Rick!

442
00:45:27,958 --> 00:45:30,870
Let's have a drink, should we?

443
00:45:38,583 --> 00:45:40,323
I have something to talk to you.

444
00:45:41,250 --> 00:45:42,250
Just say it!

445
00:45:48,167 --> 00:45:49,327
Nothing to say?

446
00:45:50,667 --> 00:45:53,739
Actually what you want to
say is all written in this letter.

447
00:45:53,875 --> 00:45:55,160
Take it back!

448
00:46:49,708 --> 00:46:51,118
- Hello!
- Is it Rick ma?

449
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:52,739
Yes.

450
00:46:52,750 --> 00:46:54,911
It's liu. Is there any change
in tonight's schedule?

451
00:46:55,125 --> 00:46:56,114
No.

452
00:46:56,125 --> 00:46:57,956
Then we'll meet on time at the pier.

453
00:46:59,083 --> 00:47:00,083
Ok.

454
00:47:16,292 --> 00:47:17,907
- Can I come in?
- I have no time.

455
00:47:17,917 --> 00:47:20,158
Don't worry, I won't take
you too much time.

456
00:47:27,917 --> 00:47:30,704
Rick, I know you suffered a lot
all these years.

457
00:47:30,875 --> 00:47:32,706
It's none of your business!

458
00:47:33,958 --> 00:47:35,869
I'm sorry, Rick!

459
00:47:35,917 --> 00:47:36,997
There's no need to say sorry.

460
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,456
You have done nothing to be sorry!

461
00:47:38,458 --> 00:47:40,744
You're angry because
I didn't come to you, I know.

462
00:47:40,750 --> 00:47:42,115
What was done was done!

463
00:47:44,083 --> 00:47:45,083
Really?

464
00:47:47,042 --> 00:47:49,658
It's time for you to go back!
And me too.

465
00:47:53,208 --> 00:47:55,039
I've been waiting for so long

466
00:47:55,042 --> 00:47:57,283
but you didn't give me a chance.

467
00:47:58,125 --> 00:47:59,240
Were you waiting for me?

468
00:47:59,250 --> 00:48:01,332
What had you promised me
when I was leaving?

469
00:48:01,333 --> 00:48:03,619
What had I got then
by waiting there for so long?

470
00:48:03,625 --> 00:48:04,865
Listen to me!

471
00:48:05,458 --> 00:48:08,825
It's meaningless to discuss
who's right or wrong.

472
00:48:09,958 --> 00:48:11,698
You must listen to me
even if you don't want to.

473
00:48:11,708 --> 00:48:14,780
That night at the accident,
my dad was caught by law.

474
00:48:14,792 --> 00:48:17,829
I went to godfather shen to
ask for help.

475
00:48:17,833 --> 00:48:19,448
I didn't tell you.

476
00:48:19,458 --> 00:48:22,370
I didn't want you to
stay and get involved.

477
00:48:22,375 --> 00:48:25,663
Godfather shen promised to help
if I agreed to follow him.

478
00:48:25,667 --> 00:48:28,624
For the sake of dad,
I had to agree!

479
00:48:28,625 --> 00:48:30,456
Godfather shen is a man of power.

480
00:48:30,458 --> 00:48:32,995
I knew we'd never stay together

481
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,742
so I wrote to you
to change your mind.

482
00:48:35,750 --> 00:48:38,241
I didn't want you to wait for me!

483
00:48:38,333 --> 00:48:40,289
Although I lived with godfather shen,

484
00:48:40,292 --> 00:48:43,249
I thought of you all the time.

485
00:48:43,250 --> 00:48:45,491
In these years, my life is chaotic.

486
00:48:45,500 --> 00:48:49,664
My dad died recently and
my life starts to change.

487
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,615
I want to find you.

488
00:48:51,625 --> 00:48:54,788
I was very happy when I met you again.

489
00:48:55,417 --> 00:48:57,373
I thought we could stay together again.

490
00:48:57,375 --> 00:49:03,166
Maybe time passed could
never come back.

491
00:49:04,125 --> 00:49:07,663
Rick, take care of yourself!

492
00:50:08,792 --> 00:50:09,792
Are you leaving?

493
00:50:11,625 --> 00:50:12,705
Do you have business to do?

494
00:50:19,875 --> 00:50:20,910
What is it?

495
00:50:21,417 --> 00:50:23,578
Are you in a hurry?

496
00:50:25,042 --> 00:50:28,034
I was free just now so
I come to see you.

497
00:50:28,042 --> 00:50:30,749
Sorry, I have no time to
stay with you!

498
00:50:32,708 --> 00:50:35,575
Don't you have time for
just a few words?

499
00:50:36,875 --> 00:50:38,206
What do you want?

500
00:50:38,208 --> 00:50:40,745
What will godfather shen do
if he knows this?

501
00:50:41,792 --> 00:50:43,578
Then I must ask him for that.

502
00:50:44,417 --> 00:50:45,827
I must phone him.

503
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:53,367
Don't take it so serious?
I was only joking.

504
00:50:55,292 --> 00:50:56,873
I was joking too.

505
00:50:58,458 --> 00:51:01,871
We all want happiness, don't we?

506
00:51:02,250 --> 00:51:04,957
We'll spoil everything
if we take it too serious.

507
00:51:06,333 --> 00:51:09,700
Just say what you want!

508
00:51:10,792 --> 00:51:13,909
Straightforward!
I like this character of you.

509
00:51:19,875 --> 00:51:21,456
Ok, let's be frank!

510
00:51:24,208 --> 00:51:26,620
Are you going to the pier
for your lover?

511
00:51:30,792 --> 00:51:32,157
An old boyfriend?

512
00:51:32,583 --> 00:51:36,997
Who said that?
Stop bullshitting!

513
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,786
I am only going for travel.

514
00:51:38,792 --> 00:51:39,827
Really?

515
00:51:41,333 --> 00:51:44,621
I forgot your tea for
such a long time!

516
00:51:44,625 --> 00:51:46,661
Let's have some time first!

517
00:51:47,042 --> 00:51:50,205
That's right!
Don't always kick me out!

518
00:52:10,042 --> 00:52:11,077
Don't go.

519
00:52:13,083 --> 00:52:16,871
I'll let you go
if you give me benefit

520
00:52:16,875 --> 00:52:18,661
and I won't tell godfather shen.

521
00:52:18,833 --> 00:52:21,040
But, what can I have?

522
00:52:21,042 --> 00:52:22,282
What are you talking about?

523
00:52:23,042 --> 00:52:25,158
It's no need to say all out!

524
00:52:25,917 --> 00:52:29,034
You know that I treat you kind.

525
00:52:29,542 --> 00:52:31,498
If I inform godfather
shen about that,

526
00:52:32,042 --> 00:52:36,285
you and that guy will be
both in trouble.

527
00:52:43,792 --> 00:52:47,660
Let's enjoy a while together, ok?

528
00:53:10,583 --> 00:53:11,698
Liu!

529
00:53:22,958 --> 00:53:23,663
Liu!

530
00:53:23,667 --> 00:53:26,079
It's good that you've come.
She wanted to escape.

531
00:53:26,083 --> 00:53:28,244
I just came in time to stop her.

532
00:53:34,875 --> 00:53:37,082
Watch her!
I go to call godfather shen.

533
00:53:38,208 --> 00:53:39,914
Keep your eyes on her.

534
00:53:46,167 --> 00:53:47,532
What happened really?

535
00:53:50,875 --> 00:53:53,332
Rick was back,
I want to leave with him.

536
00:53:57,875 --> 00:53:59,740
Hello, godfather shen.
It's lai liu speaking.

537
00:53:59,875 --> 00:54:02,036
Cheung, you must help me.

538
00:54:06,750 --> 00:54:08,411
Trouble will come!

539
00:54:10,542 --> 00:54:12,908
Godfather shen will be right here.

540
00:55:15,083 --> 00:55:16,083
Please sit down!

541
00:55:16,417 --> 00:55:17,623
What is going on?

542
00:55:19,917 --> 00:55:20,952
She wanted...

543
00:55:26,083 --> 00:55:28,369
Liu wanted to rape me.

544
00:55:29,125 --> 00:55:30,456
It's not true.

545
00:55:30,708 --> 00:55:32,573
I didn't have that guts to do this.

546
00:55:32,583 --> 00:55:35,370
She wanted to see her boyfriend
but I stopped her.

547
00:55:35,375 --> 00:55:37,286
She had her luggage all packed up.

548
00:55:37,875 --> 00:55:39,365
He's lying.

549
00:55:39,375 --> 00:55:41,741
That guy... it's really coincident.

550
00:55:41,750 --> 00:55:43,615
He's the guy employed from philippine.

551
00:55:43,625 --> 00:55:45,240
Today when I kept an eye on lau,

552
00:55:45,542 --> 00:55:48,375
I discovered unintentiously about this.

553
00:55:51,667 --> 00:55:52,667
Lap!

554
00:55:53,458 --> 00:55:54,823
Is it the truth?

555
00:56:04,125 --> 00:56:05,125
Yes!

556
00:56:20,250 --> 00:56:22,866
I had followed you
for so many years.

557
00:56:23,500 --> 00:56:26,037
I had paid you back probably.

558
00:56:26,042 --> 00:56:27,578
Would you let me go?

559
00:56:30,042 --> 00:56:32,283
I've decided firmly to leave.

560
00:56:32,292 --> 00:56:33,577
You have so many women.

561
00:56:33,583 --> 00:56:35,790
It won't affect you without me!

562
00:56:55,833 --> 00:56:56,948
What about that guy?

563
00:56:57,667 --> 00:56:58,873
Don't worry!

564
00:56:58,875 --> 00:57:01,582
You've told me to kill him
after the work has finished.

565
00:57:02,125 --> 00:57:03,445
I've already arranged everything!

566
00:57:13,833 --> 00:57:15,289
Do you really want to leave?

567
00:57:15,292 --> 00:57:16,292
Yes.

568
00:57:19,083 --> 00:57:20,823
Since you didn't have
your heart on me,

569
00:57:21,458 --> 00:57:23,164
it's no use to make you stay.

570
00:57:24,708 --> 00:57:28,121
But I'd rather benefit my own people.

571
00:57:29,292 --> 00:57:30,292
Liu!

572
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,332
I know you've been
loving her for times.

573
00:57:36,083 --> 00:57:43,239
I'll give you a favor!

574
00:57:51,667 --> 00:57:53,282
You are not human being.

575
00:57:53,625 --> 00:57:55,707
Yes, I'm god.

576
00:57:56,083 --> 00:57:59,405
Everybody is under my control!

577
00:58:01,750 --> 00:58:03,786
Liu, go ahead!

578
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:17,490
Learn a lesson, young man!

579
00:58:46,125 --> 00:58:47,331
No, boss!

580
00:58:48,250 --> 00:58:49,456
Boss, please release her!

581
00:58:49,750 --> 00:58:52,162
Are you crazy? Put down the gun!

582
00:58:54,417 --> 00:58:56,078
I told you to put it down!

583
00:58:57,208 --> 00:58:58,664
Go away, be quick!

584
00:58:58,917 --> 00:58:59,622
Cheung!

585
00:58:59,708 --> 00:59:00,993
I don't mean to do this.

586
00:59:01,875 --> 00:59:03,581
But you are driving her too far.

587
00:59:03,917 --> 00:59:05,453
Don't hurt anybody!

588
00:59:06,333 --> 00:59:08,574
She treated you so good for years.

589
00:59:08,583 --> 00:59:09,823
Please let her go!

590
00:59:09,833 --> 00:59:11,193
Why do you have to hurt her still?

591
00:59:11,875 --> 00:59:12,990
Put down the gun!

592
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:17,243
I'm trembling and
I can't control the gun.

593
00:59:17,917 --> 00:59:19,748
I may hurt you accidentally.

594
00:59:20,250 --> 00:59:21,250
Lap!

595
00:59:34,042 --> 00:59:37,284
Sorry, I have to save her!

596
00:59:38,042 --> 00:59:41,114
I can't stand watching her dying!

597
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,286
Lap!

598
00:59:51,708 --> 00:59:52,993
Get the lift quickly!

599
00:59:55,583 --> 00:59:56,698
Sorry, boss!

600
00:59:57,542 --> 01:00:00,375
After I send her away,
I'll be back for your forgiving.

601
01:00:00,958 --> 01:00:03,574
Don't you dare to betray me?

602
01:00:03,583 --> 01:00:04,583
No!

603
01:00:05,042 --> 01:00:07,328
I just wanted to save her,
not to betray you.

604
01:00:07,667 --> 01:00:09,203
Cheung, the lift is coming.

605
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,207
Don't be angry about me!

606
01:00:41,208 --> 01:00:42,698
He's waiting inside for you.

607
01:00:44,708 --> 01:00:47,575
Sorry to cause you such a trouble.

608
01:00:47,583 --> 01:00:49,198
Don't mention it!

609
01:00:50,208 --> 01:00:51,914
I'm glad to make you happy.

610
01:00:51,917 --> 01:00:53,453
I worry your safety most.

611
01:00:54,250 --> 01:00:57,367
You're so kind to me.
I didn't know what to say.

612
01:01:05,167 --> 01:01:06,498
Take care of yourself!

613
01:01:06,500 --> 01:01:08,081
You too!

614
01:01:28,458 --> 01:01:30,039
You should go now!

615
01:01:58,917 --> 01:01:59,917
Rick!

616
01:02:01,083 --> 01:02:02,289
What happened to your mouth?

617
01:02:02,292 --> 01:02:05,580
It's alright!
I got hurled carelessly.

618
01:02:23,917 --> 01:02:24,917
Get on the ship!

619
01:02:59,667 --> 01:03:01,077
Rick, are you alright?

620
01:03:02,542 --> 01:03:03,782
Lap, are you alright?

621
01:03:05,917 --> 01:03:09,409
Don't shoot! We're friends!

622
01:03:09,875 --> 01:03:11,035
He's my friend.

623
01:03:20,542 --> 01:03:21,622
Lap!

624
01:03:21,625 --> 01:03:23,365
Why haven't you left?

625
01:03:23,375 --> 01:03:24,785
I'm worrying about your safety.

626
01:03:25,125 --> 01:03:26,740
Rick, are you alright?

627
01:03:27,500 --> 01:03:29,240
Give me a hand, cheung!

628
01:03:31,458 --> 01:03:33,369
You must be Rick! I'm cheung!

629
01:03:33,375 --> 01:03:34,865
I've heard about you before.

630
01:03:35,792 --> 01:03:38,033
You're hurt so badly!
You must see a doctor!

631
01:03:38,042 --> 01:03:39,077
No, it's alright.

632
01:03:39,083 --> 01:03:40,573
I know a doctor came from China.

633
01:03:40,583 --> 01:03:42,414
He's on our side.

634
01:03:43,917 --> 01:03:45,373
How is he, doctor?

635
01:03:46,625 --> 01:03:50,538
Just call me pang! He's alright!

636
01:03:51,833 --> 01:03:53,414
I'm old and useless now.

637
01:03:53,417 --> 01:03:55,123
I forgot my tools in the car!

638
01:03:55,125 --> 01:03:57,411
Take care of him!
I go to get my tools!

639
01:04:03,083 --> 01:04:07,326
Give him the key
and tell him to get me something.

640
01:04:16,792 --> 01:04:17,792
Cheung!

641
01:04:18,250 --> 01:04:19,956
He wanted you to get
something for him

642
01:04:21,208 --> 01:04:23,290
at cabinet no. 76 at club siwa.

643
01:04:25,208 --> 01:04:27,244
Let me do these.

644
01:04:28,042 --> 01:04:29,327
Thank you so much for tonight.

645
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:31,786
Don't mention it!

646
01:05:39,583 --> 01:05:43,496
I forgot my tools again!

647
01:05:43,958 --> 01:05:47,621
You go to clean his
wound with some cotton.

648
01:06:04,625 --> 01:06:06,115
Why are you still wearing it?

649
01:06:06,708 --> 01:06:08,869
You refused it when I gave you,

650
01:06:08,875 --> 01:06:10,411
but picked it back later.

651
01:06:24,667 --> 01:06:27,204
Hello, I'm pang!

652
01:06:27,708 --> 01:06:30,825
Why didn't your men come still?

653
01:06:32,042 --> 01:06:34,033
Yes... right...

654
01:06:35,333 --> 01:06:37,540
Ok, I try to make them stay.

655
01:07:43,750 --> 01:07:44,750
Rick!

656
01:09:14,208 --> 01:09:15,414
Is it here?

657
01:09:18,458 --> 01:09:19,789
I go and see.

658
01:09:31,250 --> 01:09:33,286
I had killed a policeman here before.

659
01:09:35,208 --> 01:09:38,371
Rick, it's already passed away.

660
01:09:42,417 --> 01:09:43,953
I came back again now!

661
01:09:54,583 --> 01:09:56,915
If that murder didn't happen,

662
01:09:58,375 --> 01:09:59,831
I wonder what will become now

663
01:10:06,208 --> 01:10:07,948
Do you regret to come back?

664
01:10:10,750 --> 01:10:12,991
I've never regretted on something.

665
01:10:25,917 --> 01:10:27,202
There's no one inside.

666
01:10:27,208 --> 01:10:29,494
I think it's empty and be quite safe.

667
01:10:29,750 --> 01:10:30,865
Let's get in!

668
01:10:42,750 --> 01:10:44,615
Don't forget the things!

669
01:10:49,792 --> 01:10:51,623
When I was young and
saw grandma was ill,

670
01:10:52,042 --> 01:10:53,327
I wanted to be a doctor.

671
01:10:55,333 --> 01:10:56,948
I don't even imagine that...

672
01:10:57,333 --> 01:10:59,324
Who knows what will happen?

673
01:11:01,500 --> 01:11:05,288
Rick, are there many killers
in philippine?

674
01:11:08,083 --> 01:11:10,165
You have to be cold blooded
in this trade.

675
01:11:13,125 --> 01:11:14,581
You've watched too many movies...

676
01:11:15,333 --> 01:11:19,326
No, actually you are not badly treated.

677
01:11:21,750 --> 01:11:23,536
How is godfather shen like?

678
01:11:27,167 --> 01:11:28,782
He's difficult to work with.

679
01:11:29,792 --> 01:11:31,532
You never know what he thinks.

680
01:11:32,167 --> 01:11:35,489
I think lap is great to have
tolerated him for so long.

681
01:11:35,833 --> 01:11:38,290
If I have to face someone
I don't like,

682
01:11:38,292 --> 01:11:39,953
I would rather die.

683
01:11:48,292 --> 01:11:49,702
Your wound seems to be inflamed.

684
01:11:53,250 --> 01:11:56,082
Cut the wound and take the
bullet out.

685
01:11:56,083 --> 01:11:57,493
That's painful.

686
01:12:00,708 --> 01:12:02,664
Bite it.

687
01:12:03,792 --> 01:12:05,828
No, I can stand it.

688
01:12:13,958 --> 01:12:15,073
Like this?

689
01:12:19,167 --> 01:12:20,167
What happened?

690
01:12:20,417 --> 01:12:21,452
Close your eyes.

691
01:12:22,458 --> 01:12:24,244
No, come on!

692
01:12:31,667 --> 01:12:33,248
Doing your job must be strong.

693
01:12:41,792 --> 01:12:43,908
Lap, you go out first.

694
01:12:46,417 --> 01:12:47,748
I want to help.

695
01:12:47,750 --> 01:12:50,162
No, I can manage myself.

696
01:13:08,333 --> 01:13:11,450
Cheung, have you thought
about your future?

697
01:13:11,792 --> 01:13:13,498
No, not worth thinking.

698
01:13:16,875 --> 01:13:18,490
What if you have a woman
to take care of?

699
01:13:20,125 --> 01:13:22,332
Woman? My grandmother?

700
01:13:24,250 --> 01:13:29,495
Lap, if I have any accident.
Please look after her.

701
01:13:33,417 --> 01:13:34,657
Do you promise?

702
01:13:36,875 --> 01:13:37,875
Yes!

703
01:13:47,875 --> 01:13:49,160
The bullet is taken out.

704
01:14:47,708 --> 01:14:51,121
The ship will arrive in the afternoon!

705
01:15:03,750 --> 01:15:05,832
725, 12.

706
01:15:06,917 --> 01:15:10,080
Your grandmother told you to call her
with godfather shen's phone.

707
01:15:31,750 --> 01:15:33,991
Hello, godfather shen!

708
01:15:34,500 --> 01:15:38,994
Cheung, you seem to be
enjoying yourself out there!

709
01:15:41,333 --> 01:15:43,289
Somebody is missing you.

710
01:15:49,625 --> 01:15:55,200
Cheung, why are you
leaving so much money?

711
01:15:55,417 --> 01:15:57,078
How are you, grandmother?

712
01:15:57,542 --> 01:16:01,785
I'm alright.
I'm just worrying about you.

713
01:16:01,792 --> 01:16:04,829
Your boss said you haven't
been to work for some days.

714
01:16:04,833 --> 01:16:06,869
What happened?

715
01:16:09,792 --> 01:16:12,374
Cheung, where's lap?

716
01:16:12,625 --> 01:16:13,785
I don't know!

717
01:16:13,792 --> 01:16:16,204
No? Forget it!

718
01:16:16,625 --> 01:16:18,911
There's nothing to
do with my grandmother...

719
01:16:30,833 --> 01:16:32,164
Are you looking for me? Lap?

720
01:16:33,333 --> 01:16:34,413
Sorry, cheung!

721
01:16:35,125 --> 01:16:36,615
Don't say such things.

722
01:16:47,167 --> 01:16:48,767
Godfather shen has captured grandmother?

723
01:16:49,125 --> 01:16:51,241
Never mind. I'll go back.

724
01:16:51,500 --> 01:16:54,037
Don't be silly.

725
01:16:55,458 --> 01:16:57,073
You've helped me so much.

726
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:01,242
I help you not because
I want you to feel grateful.

727
01:17:04,333 --> 01:17:05,618
Run away with Rick!

728
01:17:08,292 --> 01:17:09,407
Save grandmother.

729
01:17:09,458 --> 01:17:11,449
Godfather shen wants you,
not my grandmother.

730
01:17:11,958 --> 01:17:14,119
It's a valuable chance to
have escaped.

731
01:17:14,125 --> 01:17:15,615
Don't go back.

732
01:17:17,375 --> 01:17:20,117
Cheung, I've known you for so long.

733
01:17:22,333 --> 01:17:25,825
This time is different.
Godfather shen will kill you.

734
01:17:25,833 --> 01:17:28,119
You only know that
I am nice to others?

735
01:17:31,458 --> 01:17:35,622
Cheung, I know what you feel.

736
01:17:39,083 --> 01:17:40,368
What do you think about me?

737
01:17:43,583 --> 01:17:45,244
You only treat me as your brother?

738
01:17:46,500 --> 01:17:49,242
Yes, so your grandmother
is my grandmother.

739
01:17:52,042 --> 01:17:53,873
Things are not as simple as
you think.

740
01:18:09,792 --> 01:18:12,499
It's painful if
you can't be with your loved one.

741
01:18:15,458 --> 01:18:16,458
I know.

742
01:18:18,542 --> 01:18:21,329
So you should go with Rick.

743
01:18:21,333 --> 01:18:23,665
Rick won't let you stay either.

744
01:18:23,667 --> 01:18:25,703
I'll speak to him if you wish.

745
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:27,705
Cheung...

746
01:18:27,708 --> 01:18:30,074
Lap, I never plan to
run away with you.

747
01:18:31,250 --> 01:18:34,447
I'll make godfather shen
forget this matter after you leave.

748
01:18:36,292 --> 01:18:37,532
He takes care of me.

749
01:18:38,625 --> 01:18:41,037
I'll be alright!

750
01:19:16,833 --> 01:19:19,870
Rick, you go with lap.
I don't wanna go with you.

751
01:19:21,042 --> 01:19:22,373
Are you kidding?

752
01:19:23,375 --> 01:19:24,535
No, I mean it.

753
01:19:25,875 --> 01:19:28,241
Lap, what's wrong with him?

754
01:19:28,250 --> 01:19:31,742
Philippines isn't my ideal place.

755
01:19:32,375 --> 01:19:34,161
And it's none of my business.

756
01:19:34,167 --> 01:19:37,079
I love Hong Kong so
I don't have to go.

757
01:19:40,792 --> 01:19:44,080
Cheung, just say what you wanna say.

758
01:19:49,375 --> 01:19:52,208
If you treat me as friend, just say it.
We solve the problem together.

759
01:19:57,417 --> 01:19:59,032
Some problems can't be solved.

760
01:20:04,500 --> 01:20:05,990
Rick - lap

761
01:20:07,083 --> 01:20:08,493
what's the matter?

762
01:20:09,042 --> 01:20:11,158
You'd better ignore it.

763
01:20:11,167 --> 01:20:12,782
It's no use to talk out.

764
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:17,082
If you don't go, all of us will stay.

765
01:20:17,083 --> 01:20:18,083
Rick

766
01:20:21,125 --> 01:20:22,205
say it!

767
01:20:26,958 --> 01:20:28,164
Chueng...

768
01:21:17,333 --> 01:21:18,493
Cheung

769
01:21:19,083 --> 01:21:20,289
let my grandma go.

770
01:21:21,292 --> 01:21:23,123
How come you are so bold?

771
01:21:23,125 --> 01:21:24,581
How dare you talk to me
in this way?

772
01:21:26,208 --> 01:21:28,324
I have to do other stuff.
You go back first.

773
01:21:32,167 --> 01:21:33,657
Accompany her.

774
01:21:37,208 --> 01:21:40,530
Cheung, you boss is such a good guy.

775
01:21:40,542 --> 01:21:44,239
He even treated me watermelon.
You should work hard.

776
01:21:55,083 --> 01:21:56,198
Alone?

777
01:21:57,917 --> 01:21:59,327
You come back alone?

778
01:21:59,333 --> 01:22:01,333
Why do you have to make trouble
because of a woman?

779
01:22:03,083 --> 01:22:07,031
That's awesome.
You become the leader now.

780
01:22:07,667 --> 01:22:09,077
Give me a lesson?

781
01:22:10,042 --> 01:22:11,882
Godfather shen,
lap has left Hong Kong already.

782
01:22:13,958 --> 01:22:14,993
Where did she go?

783
01:22:39,792 --> 01:22:40,792
Say it!

784
01:22:40,833 --> 01:22:43,870
I don't know. I really don't know.

785
01:22:51,625 --> 01:22:53,456
I know he won't let cheung go.

786
01:22:53,458 --> 01:22:54,914
We shouldn't leave him behind.

787
01:22:54,917 --> 01:22:56,703
But I do want to go with you.

788
01:22:56,708 --> 01:22:59,165
For the coming of this day,
I have been waiting for years.

789
01:23:00,667 --> 01:23:02,453
How come it result in this way?

790
01:23:02,458 --> 01:23:04,198
It's none of his business

791
01:23:06,083 --> 01:23:07,994
just like that time
you went to Philippines.

792
01:23:08,583 --> 01:23:10,494
How come it happen again?

793
01:23:12,333 --> 01:23:16,281
It's my fault. I get him involved.

794
01:23:46,417 --> 01:23:47,497
We go back.

795
01:23:55,250 --> 01:23:57,707
Godfather shen,
phone call from miss lap.

796
01:26:14,583 --> 01:26:15,823
Cheung, come here quickly.
