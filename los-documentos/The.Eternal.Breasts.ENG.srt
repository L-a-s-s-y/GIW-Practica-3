Uncle! Hurry!

20
00:03:17,429 --> 00:03:19,378
We're back!

21
00:03:31,794 --> 00:03:33,971
Come on, Noboru.

22
00:03:41,337 --> 00:03:43,227
Your mother's here.

23
00:03:43,669 --> 00:03:45,411
Really? Grandma's here.

24
00:03:45,711 --> 00:03:47,821
Grandma!

25
00:03:54,169 --> 00:03:56,525
Grandma! Anything for us?

26
00:03:56,825 --> 00:04:01,850
Sure. Here's a surprise.
Sweet rice cake.

27
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:04,437
Sweet rice cake!

28
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:06,105
Hi, Mom!

29
00:04:06,405 --> 00:04:08,274
You're late.

30
00:04:08,722 --> 00:04:11,126
Wash your hands first.

31
00:04:11,426 --> 00:04:13,055
Your feet are dirty.

32
00:04:13,355 --> 00:04:15,790
Come to the well.

33
00:04:28,573 --> 00:04:29,874
Drug.

34
00:04:31,216 --> 00:04:33,569
It's bad for your health.

35
00:04:33,903 --> 00:04:35,433
Never mind.

36
00:04:50,144 --> 00:04:52,407
<i>To Mrs. Fumiko Shimojo.</i>

37
00:04:53,857 --> 00:04:55,573
Wash them.

38
00:04:57,626 --> 00:05:00,393
What are you doing?

39
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:06,318
More quickly, or your
husband will be angry.

40
00:05:08,218 --> 00:05:11,310
He's always angry, anyway.

41
00:05:12,634 --> 00:05:16,741
Because business is slow.
He handles too many things.

42
00:05:20,599 --> 00:05:21,835
Fumiko!

43
00:05:22,417 --> 00:05:25,536
He wants you. I'll go home.

44
00:05:27,208 --> 00:05:30,104
Get my parasol for me.

45
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:43,800
Your brother will get
married. I'm glad.

46
00:05:44,599 --> 00:05:48,694
If you could be happy too,
your late father would be...

47
00:05:49,292 --> 00:05:50,769
Fumiko!

48
00:05:52,162 --> 00:05:54,101
Go to him.

49
00:05:59,325 --> 00:06:01,606
I brought some rice.

50
00:06:05,348 --> 00:06:07,315
I'll see Grandma off.

51
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:08,773
Me, too.

52
00:06:09,073 --> 00:06:11,657
Thank you. Let's go.

53
00:06:42,267 --> 00:06:44,609
Please stop!

54
00:06:45,468 --> 00:06:46,778
No more!

55
00:06:48,462 --> 00:06:50,933
You're like your mother.

56
00:06:52,498 --> 00:06:55,016
She preached to me now, too.

57
00:06:55,669 --> 00:07:00,523
She's worried about you.
Our kids are still little.

58
00:07:01,716 --> 00:07:04,044
She wants you back.

59
00:07:04,633 --> 00:07:06,867
She's rich.

60
00:07:08,391 --> 00:07:10,884
You're young and beautiful.

61
00:07:11,184 --> 00:07:14,182
We're back.
We saw Grandma off.

62
00:07:14,616 --> 00:07:16,207
Mom, I'm hungry.

63
00:07:16,507 --> 00:07:18,370
Me, too.

64
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:19,755
Rice cake!

65
00:07:20,055 --> 00:07:21,722
Wait.

66
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:26,422
Have some.

67
00:07:40,271 --> 00:07:42,480
Good morning.

68
00:07:47,108 --> 00:07:51,318
Tell Mr. Hori I'll attend
the meeting of poets.

69
00:07:51,693 --> 00:07:53,024
Give this to him.

70
00:07:53,324 --> 00:07:54,377
Give me a lift.

71
00:07:54,677 --> 00:07:56,153
Sure. Come on.

72
00:08:11,872 --> 00:08:13,359
I'm leaving.

73
00:08:23,262 --> 00:08:25,633
Aiko, play outside.

74
00:08:26,048 --> 00:08:27,645
Let me carry it.

75
00:08:37,015 --> 00:08:38,892
Where are you going?

76
00:08:39,805 --> 00:08:42,586
Must I tell you each time?

77
00:08:43,568 --> 00:08:45,601
You go out, too.

78
00:08:47,081 --> 00:08:48,929
I don't have to go.

79
00:08:49,229 --> 00:08:50,903
Why not?

80
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:53,976
You want to be a poetess.

81
00:08:54,276 --> 00:08:55,728
Me a poetess?

82
00:08:56,028 --> 00:08:57,614
No!

83
00:08:58,807 --> 00:09:02,165
You'll be a good one.

84
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:05,640
Too good for me.

85
00:09:05,968 --> 00:09:08,931
Do I look so proud?

86
00:09:10,998 --> 00:09:13,200
Answer me.

87
00:09:13,671 --> 00:09:15,233
Do you hate me?

88
00:09:15,533 --> 00:09:17,400
Get my socks.

89
00:09:24,087 --> 00:09:27,930
What a cheap couple,
arguing like this!

90
00:09:30,645 --> 00:09:32,393
We're finished.

91
00:09:38,135 --> 00:09:41,408
I'm a petty broker
who earn little.

92
00:09:42,101 --> 00:09:47,118
You can't get
easy money nowadays.

93
00:09:48,456 --> 00:09:51,223
Now even my wife preaches.

94
00:09:55,122 --> 00:09:56,720
My overcoat.

95
00:10:24,454 --> 00:10:26,683
Where are you going?

96
00:10:35,878 --> 00:10:40,126
<i>The back of my husband
Blown by the wind</i>

97
00:10:40,426 --> 00:10:42,670
<i>Exits from my sight</i>

98
00:10:45,443 --> 00:10:49,000
<i>Ruined by the drug
Asleep all day</i>

99
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:52,428
<i>My husband has gone
Beyond my reach</i>

100
00:10:53,973 --> 00:10:55,221
Well?

101
00:10:56,977 --> 00:10:58,869
I think they're good.

102
00:10:59,239 --> 00:11:02,141
A bit exaggerated.

103
00:11:04,688 --> 00:11:05,884
Very good.

104
00:11:06,184 --> 00:11:09,118
Mrs. Shimojo's poems
are strange.

105
00:11:09,418 --> 00:11:12,289
Someday you'll understand.

106
00:11:12,589 --> 00:11:14,144
They tell the truth.

107
00:11:14,444 --> 00:11:16,554
Women's truth.

108
00:11:18,029 --> 00:11:20,058
You hate your husband?

109
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:24,777
No. My poems exaggerate.

110
00:11:25,852 --> 00:11:30,570
The Tokyo Daily News is
interested in our group.

111
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:33,670
Write good poems.

112
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:35,374
Good.

113
00:11:37,051 --> 00:11:39,967
Let's choose some for them.

114
00:11:41,272 --> 00:11:43,613
My children are waiting.

115
00:11:44,012 --> 00:11:45,081
I must go now.

116
00:11:45,381 --> 00:11:48,162
Sure. Go back to them.

117
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:53,581
Leaving?

118
00:11:53,881 --> 00:11:55,473
My kids are waiting.

119
00:11:57,388 --> 00:11:58,846
Your husband?

120
00:11:59,146 --> 00:12:01,564
Hasn't he come yet?

121
00:12:06,113 --> 00:12:08,850
He went to the doctor first.

122
00:12:09,291 --> 00:12:12,322
Fumiko! Leaving so soon?

123
00:12:12,622 --> 00:12:13,883
Hello, Hori.

124
00:12:14,183 --> 00:12:16,873
They're waiting.
To the doctor?

125
00:12:17,173 --> 00:12:18,961
I'm fine.

126
00:12:19,306 --> 00:12:22,416
Did they like your poems?

127
00:12:22,912 --> 00:12:25,486
I have little time for poems.

128
00:12:26,631 --> 00:12:30,922
They said my poems
exaggerate.

129
00:12:31,222 --> 00:12:36,686
Your poems describe your
hardship well.

130
00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:41,014
They make me sad.

131
00:12:41,409 --> 00:12:42,994
I don't mind.

132
00:12:43,425 --> 00:12:45,913
Let them criticize me.

133
00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:49,368
I tell the truth in my poems.

134
00:12:49,916 --> 00:12:55,279
You're too sensitive to
ignore their comments.

135
00:12:56,423 --> 00:12:59,050
But you were happy
as a student.

136
00:12:59,643 --> 00:13:01,855
We played with a ball.

137
00:13:02,382 --> 00:13:04,758
Did I change so much?

138
00:13:08,146 --> 00:13:10,798
My wife often talks
about you.

139
00:13:11,227 --> 00:13:13,847
You used to be a tomboy.

140
00:13:14,592 --> 00:13:16,621
You must tell her...

141
00:13:16,952 --> 00:13:20,520
I'll be a good wife.

142
00:13:22,025 --> 00:13:24,106
Don't pity me.

143
00:13:24,466 --> 00:13:28,935
I'll write good poems
that make you happy.

144
00:13:29,257 --> 00:13:31,369
I'm sure you'll like them.

145
00:13:36,918 --> 00:13:38,400
Keep well.

146
00:14:11,287 --> 00:14:13,050
- Welcome back.
- My kids?

147
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:14,809
In the room.

148
00:14:16,251 --> 00:14:20,705
I went to your house today.
There was a guest.

149
00:14:20,905 --> 00:14:22,738
A guest? Who?

150
00:14:22,938 --> 00:14:25,014
I didn't look in.

151
00:14:29,728 --> 00:14:32,445
Hello, Seiko.

152
00:14:35,097 --> 00:14:36,800
Hello.

153
00:14:37,672 --> 00:14:39,827
You're lovely.

154
00:14:39,927 --> 00:14:42,095
You're as pretty as ever.

155
00:14:42,195 --> 00:14:44,006
No, not anymore.

156
00:14:44,338 --> 00:14:48,924
Your husband has a guest.
You'd better go home.

157
00:14:49,152 --> 00:14:51,359
He'll be angry again.

158
00:14:51,459 --> 00:14:54,596
He doesn't miss me.
He hates a poetess.

159
00:14:55,213 --> 00:14:57,304
Children, let's go home.

160
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:01,025
They can stay with us.

161
00:15:01,125 --> 00:15:02,969
Thanks, Mom.

162
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:05,057
Be good, children.

163
00:15:05,169 --> 00:15:06,276
Goodbye.

164
00:15:06,376 --> 00:15:07,974
Leaving?

165
00:15:09,492 --> 00:15:13,770
Eating again?
You eat all day.

166
00:15:14,003 --> 00:15:15,899
What gluttons!

167
00:15:15,999 --> 00:15:19,209
So were you when
you were little?

168
00:15:26,402 --> 00:15:27,703
I'm back.

169
00:15:30,186 --> 00:15:31,954
It's me.

170
00:15:33,539 --> 00:15:35,010
Dear!

171
00:15:46,992 --> 00:15:48,928
Sorry, I'm late.

172
00:15:50,551 --> 00:15:51,936
Not at all.

173
00:15:52,036 --> 00:15:54,107
You had a guest?

174
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:56,574
Who was it?

175
00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:47,425
You lied to me!

176
00:16:48,062 --> 00:16:49,711
That woman!

177
00:16:50,567 --> 00:16:52,341
You still have her.

178
00:16:52,441 --> 00:16:53,950
Shut up!

179
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:58,726
A good wife, huh?

180
00:16:59,641 --> 00:17:01,609
No love affair, huh?

181
00:17:03,010 --> 00:17:04,570
Enough!

182
00:18:16,262 --> 00:18:19,075
<i>Notice of divorce</i>

183
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:35,542
Noboru, come here.

184
00:19:29,041 --> 00:19:30,797
Take care of him.

185
00:19:31,097 --> 00:19:32,759
Certainly.

186
00:19:33,059 --> 00:19:35,309
I feel rather relieved.

187
00:19:42,553 --> 00:19:43,777
He's ready.

188
00:19:44,077 --> 00:19:45,212
Your lunchbox?

189
00:19:45,512 --> 00:19:46,772
He has it.

190
00:19:47,072 --> 00:19:49,309
Don't be late for school.

191
00:19:49,609 --> 00:19:51,868
Aren't you coming with me?

192
00:19:52,168 --> 00:19:53,254
I'll go later.

193
00:19:53,554 --> 00:19:55,783
I want to go with him.

194
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:10,816
Noboru, let's go see
your father.

195
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:16,162
We'll be going.

196
00:20:16,462 --> 00:20:18,269
Thank you.

197
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:31,696
Aiko, play with me.

198
00:20:32,378 --> 00:20:34,486
What'll we do?

199
00:21:38,916 --> 00:21:41,005
Mrs. Shimojo won't come.

200
00:21:42,033 --> 00:21:43,911
You sent your wife?

201
00:21:45,668 --> 00:21:50,512
The Short Poems magazine
wants fifty poems.

202
00:21:51,158 --> 00:21:53,785
Mr. Otsuki of the
Daily News said...

203
00:21:54,554 --> 00:21:57,938
...we could send some
to the magazine.

204
00:21:58,587 --> 00:22:00,392
It's our chance.

205
00:22:00,918 --> 00:22:03,489
A debut in the central
circle of poets.

206
00:22:03,789 --> 00:22:05,709
Let's try hard.

207
00:22:06,891 --> 00:22:09,620
It makes me nervous.

208
00:22:12,478 --> 00:22:16,482
Hori, I think your last poem
is very good.

209
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,817
I don't know.

210
00:22:20,117 --> 00:22:22,777
Your wife's poem, too.

211
00:22:23,952 --> 00:22:24,964
Sorry I'm late.

212
00:22:25,264 --> 00:22:27,002
Welcome.

213
00:22:28,869 --> 00:22:31,249
Fumiko can't come today.

214
00:22:31,696 --> 00:22:35,193
Her daughter was
missing. She was pale.

215
00:22:37,266 --> 00:22:41,971
But the girl turned up
at her ex-husband's home.

216
00:22:43,269 --> 00:22:45,904
She sent her brother
to get her.

217
00:22:47,484 --> 00:22:49,424
Life is hard for her.

218
00:22:50,184 --> 00:22:52,478
She must have been worried.

219
00:22:55,325 --> 00:22:58,224
Has she changed much
since the divorce?

220
00:22:58,524 --> 00:23:00,696
She looked all right.

221
00:23:01,122 --> 00:23:03,392
She must be lonely.

222
00:23:04,719 --> 00:23:08,146
But bitter experiences
help her write good poems.

223
00:23:08,702 --> 00:23:13,154
She used to exaggerate
in her poems.

224
00:23:15,442 --> 00:23:18,576
Experience brings reality.

225
00:23:19,490 --> 00:23:22,953
Mr. Yamagami,
this poem by Fumiko...

226
00:23:24,867 --> 00:23:26,595
Please read it.

227
00:23:30,536 --> 00:23:34,898
<i>A blue workdress going
away in the wind</i>

228
00:23:35,956 --> 00:23:39,307
<i>It carries the sorrow
of a mother</i>

229
00:23:42,673 --> 00:23:44,317
Welcome home.

230
00:23:50,259 --> 00:23:52,288
I was surprised.

231
00:23:52,964 --> 00:23:55,316
It might happen again.

232
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:00,239
Your ex has a new wife.

233
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:04,707
Noboru must be lonely.

234
00:24:08,594 --> 00:24:09,715
Hello.

235
00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:11,651
Aiko?

236
00:24:11,951 --> 00:24:13,214
Taking a bath.

237
00:24:13,514 --> 00:24:14,889
Give this to her.

238
00:24:15,196 --> 00:24:16,857
Thank you.

239
00:24:17,399 --> 00:24:19,048
Please go in.

240
00:24:19,475 --> 00:24:22,167
Yoshio, take her.

241
00:24:28,870 --> 00:24:30,421
Mom.

242
00:24:31,073 --> 00:24:32,808
You'll catch cold.

243
00:24:33,148 --> 00:24:34,282
From Seiko.

244
00:24:34,582 --> 00:24:36,063
Thanks.

245
00:24:37,114 --> 00:24:38,422
Take a bath.

246
00:24:38,722 --> 00:24:39,634
No.

247
00:24:39,934 --> 00:24:42,383
Strange.
You like baths.

248
00:24:43,132 --> 00:24:45,001
Is something wrong?

249
00:24:45,303 --> 00:24:47,254
Go to the doctor.

250
00:24:47,686 --> 00:24:49,586
I'm all right.

251
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:53,887
You're stubborn.
So your ex didn't like you.

252
00:24:54,348 --> 00:24:58,111
I never wanted
to marry Shimojo.

253
00:24:59,026 --> 00:25:03,156
After our first meeting, you
insisted I marry him.

254
00:25:04,988 --> 00:25:07,346
Will you eat this?

255
00:25:09,735 --> 00:25:11,127
You saw Noboru?

256
00:25:11,634 --> 00:25:12,612
Dad, too?

257
00:25:12,912 --> 00:25:15,368
No. There was a lady.

258
00:25:24,207 --> 00:25:26,723
I'll wear a tuxedo.

259
00:25:26,823 --> 00:25:30,846
A Japanese kimono is better
for your wedding.

260
00:25:31,146 --> 00:25:32,940
No, I'll wear a tuxedo.

261
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:38,030
A bride is most beautiful in
Japanese wedding attire.

262
00:25:39,264 --> 00:25:42,081
Sis, I want to wear a
tuxedo at my wedding.

263
00:25:42,381 --> 00:25:43,961
Isn't it nice?

264
00:25:44,036 --> 00:25:46,262
What does your bride say?

265
00:25:46,362 --> 00:25:48,111
You like it, too?

266
00:25:48,249 --> 00:25:50,294
Aiko, let's go upstairs.

267
00:25:50,676 --> 00:25:53,009
Go upstairs.
I'll bring your cake.

268
00:25:57,090 --> 00:25:59,680
This is nice. I'll wear it.

269
00:26:07,364 --> 00:26:09,929
Please accept my humble gift.

270
00:26:10,229 --> 00:26:12,701
Thank you very much.

271
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:22,171
Be a good girl.

272
00:26:22,503 --> 00:26:25,346
Ask your mom to change
your kimono.

273
00:26:30,576 --> 00:26:31,562
No, Aiko.

274
00:26:31,862 --> 00:26:34,703
Don't do it,
or I'll punish you.

275
00:26:36,748 --> 00:26:40,765
Why not change your kimono?

276
00:26:41,535 --> 00:26:44,361
It's your brother wedding.

277
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:46,534
I hate to be watched.

278
00:26:47,138 --> 00:26:48,745
Suit yourself.

279
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:54,223
Why not obey me?
I'll take you out.

280
00:26:55,810 --> 00:26:58,746
Why doesn't she
attend the party?

281
00:26:59,073 --> 00:27:00,767
Because she's a divorcee.

282
00:27:01,067 --> 00:27:02,712
She had a hard time.

283
00:27:03,012 --> 00:27:05,395
She's afraid of rumors.

284
00:27:07,272 --> 00:27:08,518
The bride!

285
00:27:11,030 --> 00:27:12,554
She's coming!

286
00:27:12,863 --> 00:27:14,354
She's coming!

287
00:27:31,254 --> 00:27:32,998
Here's the bride!

288
00:27:37,578 --> 00:27:39,454
How beautiful!

289
00:27:44,810 --> 00:27:46,517
Let's go out.

290
00:27:47,866 --> 00:27:50,884
Let me see the bride!

291
00:28:03,041 --> 00:28:04,290
No.

292
00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:06,957
I'll be a good girl.

293
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:22,110
Is it warm enough?

294
00:29:22,410 --> 00:29:23,742
Yes.

295
00:29:30,962 --> 00:29:32,120
Shall I wash you?

296
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:34,990
No. You must go now.

297
00:29:46,028 --> 00:29:48,393
Hello, Fumiko! Welcome!

298
00:29:48,693 --> 00:29:49,727
Can I come in?

299
00:29:50,027 --> 00:29:52,036
Sure. Why not?

300
00:29:52,394 --> 00:29:54,818
You're always
welcome to our house.

301
00:29:59,649 --> 00:30:01,887
Fumiko's here, dear.

302
00:30:05,036 --> 00:30:07,364
It's your brother's
wedding day.

303
00:30:07,856 --> 00:30:11,171
I can't stay in that house,
so here I am.

304
00:30:15,450 --> 00:30:17,182
You're heavy.

305
00:30:18,769 --> 00:30:20,033
Have some.

306
00:30:20,415 --> 00:30:21,285
Thank her.

307
00:30:21,585 --> 00:30:22,780
Thank you.

308
00:30:23,205 --> 00:30:24,693
Good girl.

309
00:30:27,524 --> 00:30:30,723
I'm going to a
teachers' meeting.

310
00:30:31,023 --> 00:30:32,260
Leaving now?

311
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:34,495
I'll be back soon.

312
00:30:35,234 --> 00:30:37,046
Let's eat supper.

313
00:30:37,744 --> 00:30:39,482
Wait for me.

314
00:30:39,782 --> 00:30:41,270
Good girl.

315
00:30:47,958 --> 00:30:49,655
Fumiko.

316
00:30:49,971 --> 00:30:54,253
Mrs. Shirakawa found you a
potential groom.

317
00:30:55,664 --> 00:30:59,198
My husband said
you could marry him.

318
00:31:00,178 --> 00:31:02,829
But even if he has no children...

319
00:31:03,807 --> 00:31:06,003
...consider well this time.

320
00:31:06,681 --> 00:31:09,214
Let's not discuss it.

321
00:31:17,804 --> 00:31:21,068
Aiko, I'll bring you a surprise.

322
00:31:21,504 --> 00:31:22,676
Don't be long.

323
00:31:22,976 --> 00:31:24,264
I won't.

324
00:31:24,836 --> 00:31:27,831
Dear, take your medicine.

325
00:31:28,505 --> 00:31:30,352
How is he?

326
00:31:30,674 --> 00:31:34,729
Not very well.
Maybe he worked too hard.

327
00:31:35,509 --> 00:31:37,126
See you later.

328
00:31:38,925 --> 00:31:40,394
Goodbye.

329
00:31:46,106 --> 00:31:47,169
Hello.

330
00:31:47,469 --> 00:31:49,133
Good afternoon.

331
00:31:49,962 --> 00:31:52,050
Hi, Aiko! Welcome!

332
00:31:52,408 --> 00:31:53,232
Say hello.

333
00:31:53,532 --> 00:31:54,900
Hello.

334
00:32:18,041 --> 00:32:19,528
I remember this.

335
00:32:23,001 --> 00:32:25,001
What a tomboy!

336
00:32:28,972 --> 00:32:31,568
And you were a daredevil.

337
00:32:37,239 --> 00:32:39,346
We three liked skiing.

338
00:32:40,981 --> 00:32:42,973
I was happy then.

339
00:32:44,326 --> 00:32:48,105
How nice! Your honeymoon!

340
00:32:52,909 --> 00:32:54,926
Kinuko looks happy.

341
00:32:55,226 --> 00:32:56,983
Lake Doya.

342
00:32:59,128 --> 00:33:01,586
It was during the war.

343
00:33:02,119 --> 00:33:03,967
Not entirely happy.

344
00:33:20,074 --> 00:33:23,348
The lake was beautiful.
You should see it.

345
00:33:24,112 --> 00:33:29,983
I'll send my poem about it
to the magazine.

346
00:33:31,093 --> 00:33:33,210
I want to see it.

347
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:36,559
Hori.

348
00:33:38,110 --> 00:33:41,651
Do you really think
I should get married?

349
00:33:42,166 --> 00:33:45,970
It's not easy to live alone
with your child.

350
00:33:46,671 --> 00:33:50,218
I'm sick of a married life.

351
00:33:52,855 --> 00:33:57,032
But you failed only once.
Don't give up.

352
00:33:57,332 --> 00:34:00,887
Let everyone in the
world say so...

353
00:34:01,892 --> 00:34:03,856
...but not you.

354
00:34:14,887 --> 00:34:17,599
She's gone to sleep.

355
00:34:18,704 --> 00:34:20,175
Don't catch cold.

356
00:34:21,666 --> 00:34:22,952
Fumiko.

357
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:37,422
It began to rain.

358
00:34:38,825 --> 00:34:40,647
Kinuko has no umbrella.

359
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:54,317
I won't visit you again.

360
00:34:54,799 --> 00:34:56,174
Why not?

361
00:34:56,474 --> 00:34:58,783
You'd be embarrassed.

362
00:34:59,518 --> 00:35:01,363
I complain to you.

363
00:35:03,663 --> 00:35:06,454
I'm afraid Aiko
will catch a cold.

364
00:35:09,061 --> 00:35:10,539
Thanks.

365
00:35:12,553 --> 00:35:13,843
Hori.

366
00:35:14,197 --> 00:35:17,361
You dislike selfish women like me.

367
00:35:18,139 --> 00:35:20,131
You're strange today.

368
00:35:21,216 --> 00:35:26,211
I shouldn't be envious of
my brother's marriage.

369
00:35:27,978 --> 00:35:30,619
I hate myself
for all my misery.

370
00:35:31,256 --> 00:35:34,062
You're gentle, but fiery inside.

371
00:35:34,470 --> 00:35:37,147
Your poems tell the truth.

372
00:35:39,121 --> 00:35:40,439
Listen.

373
00:35:41,391 --> 00:35:43,910
What if I make a confession?

374
00:35:45,395 --> 00:35:49,210
I attend the poets' meetings
only to see you.

375
00:35:52,851 --> 00:35:54,788
I'm sorry.

376
00:35:55,581 --> 00:35:57,279
I'm selfish.

377
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,248
So my ex hated me.

378
00:36:03,339 --> 00:36:09,207
I'll marry again, not for love
but for a living.

379
00:36:09,865 --> 00:36:11,061
Ridiculous.

380
00:36:11,361 --> 00:36:13,482
It was so from the start.

381
00:36:14,441 --> 00:36:19,096
I married the man I was
first introduced to.

382
00:36:21,189 --> 00:36:23,059
I didn't know love.

383
00:36:26,899 --> 00:36:28,190
I'm sorry.

384
00:36:29,559 --> 00:36:34,643
I shouldn't complain to
somebody else's husband.

385
00:36:35,694 --> 00:36:38,041
Anyway, keep well.

386
00:36:38,341 --> 00:36:40,241
Don't waste your talent.

387
00:36:40,614 --> 00:36:41,439
I have none.

388
00:36:41,739 --> 00:36:43,308
You do.

389
00:36:43,734 --> 00:36:47,377
I'll send your poems
to the magazine.

390
00:36:47,707 --> 00:36:49,280
My poems?

391
00:36:50,083 --> 00:36:52,557
Don't make a fool of me.

392
00:36:53,830 --> 00:36:58,296
I'm worried about your health.

393
00:37:01,779 --> 00:37:06,672
I hope you will be
truly happy with Kinuko.

394
00:37:07,774 --> 00:37:10,152
Your happiness is mine.

395
00:37:19,295 --> 00:37:20,570
Here we are.

396
00:37:25,998 --> 00:37:27,527
Thank you.

397
00:37:27,827 --> 00:37:29,628
Wake up, Aiko.

398
00:37:30,259 --> 00:37:33,512
You must be warm
with his muffler.

399
00:37:34,167 --> 00:37:36,487
- Say goodbye to him.
- Goodbye.

400
00:37:38,849 --> 00:37:42,773
Don't let hardship beat you.
Write good poems.

401
00:37:43,991 --> 00:37:45,626
Take my advice.

402
00:37:50,150 --> 00:37:51,116
Fumiko.

403
00:37:51,416 --> 00:37:52,721
Here.

404
00:38:35,003 --> 00:38:36,482
Yes.

405
00:38:39,810 --> 00:38:40,904
I see.

406
00:38:44,370 --> 00:38:45,571
Sis!

407
00:38:46,823 --> 00:38:49,773
It's bad! Mr. Hori's dying!

408
00:38:50,073 --> 00:38:53,270
A report from the hospital.

409
00:38:53,813 --> 00:38:56,024
Will you go? I'll get a taxi.

410
00:40:22,193 --> 00:40:23,431
Hello.

411
00:40:24,974 --> 00:40:28,166
It's you! Hello!

412
00:40:47,250 --> 00:40:48,491
Ma'am!

413
00:41:19,327 --> 00:41:21,028
You won.

414
00:41:26,354 --> 00:41:29,420
Let's play catch.

415
00:41:47,871 --> 00:41:50,419
Here's some cake for you.

416
00:41:52,371 --> 00:41:53,480
Mom?

417
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:56,308
You're supposed to be a man.

418
00:42:11,812 --> 00:42:13,566
Sis!

419
00:42:16,688 --> 00:42:21,400
Your poems Mr. Hori sent to
the magazine were chosen.

420
00:42:22,278 --> 00:42:23,178
Who said so?

421
00:42:23,478 --> 00:42:26,895
Mr. Yamagami heard it from
the Daily News man.

422
00:42:27,195 --> 00:42:28,423
He wants to see you.

423
00:42:28,723 --> 00:42:30,598
Fine.

424
00:42:49,562 --> 00:42:53,606
Hori, thanks.
Good news!

425
00:42:55,850 --> 00:42:57,811
You've grown big.

426
00:42:59,609 --> 00:43:01,146
Good night.

427
00:43:01,446 --> 00:43:05,124
Good night.
You're a good boy.

428
00:43:05,646 --> 00:43:08,581
Aiko, go to sleep.

429
00:43:08,998 --> 00:43:10,471
Sleep beside me.

430
00:43:10,771 --> 00:43:12,330
All right.

431
00:43:14,885 --> 00:43:18,257
How nice sleeping together!

432
00:43:24,186 --> 00:43:28,752
Can I keep staying here?
From today on?

433
00:43:29,052 --> 00:43:32,139
Sure, don't worry.

434
00:43:54,163 --> 00:43:56,380
What's wrong?

435
00:43:58,624 --> 00:44:00,196
Nothing.

436
00:44:00,496 --> 00:44:02,685
The go-between is here.

437
00:44:04,309 --> 00:44:06,618
Your mother wants you.

438
00:44:10,235 --> 00:44:12,243
Where are you going?

439
00:44:12,550 --> 00:44:14,683
I won't go anywhere.

440
00:44:14,983 --> 00:44:17,048
Take care of him.

441
00:44:20,108 --> 00:44:23,731
Noboru, I'll read
a book for you.

442
00:44:51,460 --> 00:44:54,649
I can't convince her.

443
00:44:58,498 --> 00:45:02,756
I believe she knows,
what she's doing.

444
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:09,952
As the go-between, I must
take the boy to his father.

445
00:45:11,195 --> 00:45:14,928
He must live with his
father, after all.

446
00:45:15,228 --> 00:45:20,140
If he stays here too long,
it won't do him good.

447
00:45:41,558 --> 00:45:44,560
What's the matter? Fumiko!

448
00:45:45,632 --> 00:45:48,192
Sis! What's wrong with you?

449
00:45:48,492 --> 00:45:50,020
Get the doctor!

450
00:45:56,238 --> 00:45:58,680
<i>Operating Theatre</i>

451
00:47:21,967 --> 00:47:24,626
Thank you for coming.

452
00:47:26,171 --> 00:47:27,797
How's Fumiko?

453
00:47:29,615 --> 00:47:31,593
Much better now.

454
00:47:47,248 --> 00:47:52,066
Three persons died after
my daughter came here.

455
00:47:56,533 --> 00:47:59,193
If she dies, I...

456
00:48:01,177 --> 00:48:05,654
She won't die. I pray
for her every day.

457
00:48:08,457 --> 00:48:09,900
Mrs. Hori's here.

458
00:48:15,261 --> 00:48:16,460
Hello.

459
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:18,695
Oh, you look fine.

460
00:48:18,995 --> 00:48:21,394
I feel bored every day.

461
00:48:22,010 --> 00:48:23,303
She is very spoilt.

462
00:48:23,603 --> 00:48:25,171
Be patient.

463
00:48:29,825 --> 00:48:32,169
My husband's keepsake.

464
00:48:33,345 --> 00:48:35,879
A gift from him.

465
00:48:38,084 --> 00:48:39,655
I'm so glad.

466
00:48:51,531 --> 00:48:55,665
Such a precious thing!
Thank you very much.

467
00:49:02,963 --> 00:49:05,376
How's my boy?

468
00:49:06,630 --> 00:49:09,347
He's an urchin.
Does he bother you?

469
00:49:09,647 --> 00:49:12,935
No. He's very well behaved.

470
00:49:14,546 --> 00:49:18,302
Does he mention me?

471
00:49:18,926 --> 00:49:21,242
He often asks me about you.

472
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:24,198
Shall I bring him?

473
00:49:24,989 --> 00:49:28,461
If you get a little better.

474
00:49:29,247 --> 00:49:31,111
No, Kinuko.

475
00:49:32,116 --> 00:49:34,869
I wouldn't be able to sleep.

476
00:49:39,858 --> 00:49:42,110
Your poems are popular.

477
00:49:43,128 --> 00:49:46,928
"Lost Breasts". What a title!

478
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:55,668
It's clear that I can't
think of marriage anymore.

479
00:50:44,184 --> 00:50:45,480
Who are you?

480
00:50:45,780 --> 00:50:47,490
Where's my mom?

481
00:50:48,639 --> 00:50:52,686
Oh, it's you. She's not in now.
She's gone to her treatment.

482
00:50:52,986 --> 00:50:55,373
Come in and wait.

483
00:50:59,166 --> 00:51:00,285
Where are you going?

484
00:51:00,585 --> 00:51:01,897
To school.

485
00:51:15,980 --> 00:51:22,356
<i>Mom, get well soon.
I am praying to God for you.</i>

486
00:51:38,793 --> 00:51:40,044
It's good?

487
00:51:40,344 --> 00:51:41,392
Very.

488
00:51:41,692 --> 00:51:43,648
Eat this.

489
00:51:52,526 --> 00:51:53,955
For you.

490
00:51:58,830 --> 00:52:00,715
From our son in Tokyo.

491
00:52:04,268 --> 00:52:06,026
What is it?

492
00:52:06,392 --> 00:52:08,375
Wait.

493
00:52:15,941 --> 00:52:17,461
A kimono.

494
00:52:17,761 --> 00:52:20,861
Our son's wife sewed it.

495
00:52:23,693 --> 00:52:28,492
He'll bring his child
here next month.

496
00:52:30,386 --> 00:52:33,399
Finish your meal first.

497
00:52:33,699 --> 00:52:35,578
I'm not hungry.

498
00:52:49,049 --> 00:52:50,791
How do you feel? Fine?

499
00:52:51,091 --> 00:52:52,449
Yes, very.

500
00:52:59,101 --> 00:53:05,430
<i>Her first book of poetry on a deathbed.</i>

501
00:53:07,358 --> 00:53:08,305
Excuse me sir...

502
00:53:08,605 --> 00:53:11,731
May I look at the paper?

503
00:53:46,187 --> 00:53:49,188
<i>"Lost breasts" is a book of poems
by Shimojo Fumiko.</i>

504
00:53:49,189 --> 00:53:52,588
<i>She has breast cancer spreading
throughout her body...</i>

505
00:53:52,589 --> 00:53:55,632
<i>...and was admitted to the
Sapporo Hospital, in a critical state.</i>

506
00:54:03,206 --> 00:54:04,830
How are you?

507
00:54:08,024 --> 00:54:11,907
Mr. Otsuki is coming
from Tokyo to see you.

508
00:54:12,740 --> 00:54:13,762
Mr. Otsuki?

509
00:54:14,062 --> 00:54:17,833
The critic who praised
your poems.

510
00:54:18,605 --> 00:54:20,473
Of the Daily News?

511
00:54:21,904 --> 00:54:24,634
No. I won't see him.

512
00:54:24,934 --> 00:54:29,043
He's worried about you.
He called me many times.

513
00:54:29,617 --> 00:54:32,154
He's on the train now.

514
00:54:32,756 --> 00:54:34,593
Wire to the train.

515
00:54:35,949 --> 00:54:39,308
I don't want to see him.

516
00:54:41,195 --> 00:54:46,478
<i>The 15:06 express for
Asahikawa is leaving.</i>

517
00:54:48,009 --> 00:54:52,004
<i>Next stop Sapporo.</i>

518
00:55:04,079 --> 00:55:06,722
My daughter is missing.

519
00:55:36,473 --> 00:55:38,938
It's been a long time.

520
00:55:39,883 --> 00:55:41,609
A long trip.

521
00:55:41,909 --> 00:55:43,084
Thanks.

522
00:55:43,384 --> 00:55:44,985
Thank you.

523
00:55:46,546 --> 00:55:47,908
How is she?

524
00:55:48,225 --> 00:55:51,586
Alive. I told her
you're coming.

525
00:55:54,235 --> 00:55:55,446
To the office?

526
00:55:55,746 --> 00:55:57,819
No. I'll see her first.

527
00:55:58,631 --> 00:56:00,424
Sapporo Hospital.

528
00:56:58,978 --> 00:57:03,429
<i>Like a weed
floating in water</i>

529
00:57:03,808 --> 00:57:07,975
<i>I'm swaying
in the ocean of life</i>

530
00:57:25,591 --> 00:57:28,127
<i>My children playing in the sun</i>

531
00:57:28,227 --> 00:57:30,806
<i>And the flower bulbs</i>

532
00:57:30,906 --> 00:57:33,449
<i>Invite the same sadness</i>

533
00:57:44,594 --> 00:57:47,459
She's really impossible.

534
00:57:47,965 --> 00:57:49,691
She worries me so much.

535
00:57:49,991 --> 00:57:53,327
I'd rather welcome
her activeness.

536
00:57:54,197 --> 00:57:57,636
Even if she wanted
to see her son...

537
00:57:57,936 --> 00:58:03,298
If you sneak out again,
I'll give you an injection.

538
00:58:26,558 --> 00:58:28,918
Her condition is critical.

539
00:58:29,747 --> 00:58:32,187
Her lungs are infected.

540
00:58:33,436 --> 00:58:36,274
Pneumonia can finish her.

541
00:58:36,693 --> 00:58:39,319
It's a miracle
she's still alive.

542
00:58:40,684 --> 00:58:44,012
She has tremendous
willpower.

543
00:58:45,450 --> 00:58:48,461
I'd hate to lose her now.

544
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:56,847
I shouldn't have
called you.

545
00:58:57,147 --> 00:59:02,049
My boss told me to see her
and write the truth.

546
00:59:02,648 --> 00:59:06,157
As I wrote she might die
any moment.

547
00:59:06,686 --> 00:59:09,995
I prayed for her survival.

548
00:59:10,355 --> 00:59:12,544
I even forgot my job.

549
00:59:13,606 --> 00:59:15,048
This way.

550
00:59:23,766 --> 00:59:25,515
It's gloomy.

551
00:59:26,904 --> 00:59:29,035
She described it in a poem.

552
00:59:29,351 --> 00:59:32,033
<i>As if in a convent,
quiet prevails</i>

553
00:59:32,034 --> 00:59:35,544
<i>Is it to torture me
in my despair?</i>

554
00:59:35,644 --> 00:59:36,954
It's that.

555
01:00:00,802 --> 01:00:02,758
This is her mother.

556
01:00:03,086 --> 01:00:04,833
Mr. Otsuki from Tokyo.

557
01:00:05,404 --> 01:00:08,262
Thank you for coming so far.

558
01:00:09,739 --> 01:00:11,524
Wait a minute.

559
01:00:17,611 --> 01:00:20,829
Fumiko, Mr. Otsuki's here.

560
01:00:24,302 --> 01:00:26,441
I won't see him.

561
01:00:27,560 --> 01:00:29,747
He came from Tokyo.

562
01:00:30,649 --> 01:00:33,801
Reporters are inquisitive,
that's all.

563
01:00:35,271 --> 01:00:39,695
He wants to see me dying.
Send him away.

564
01:00:44,954 --> 01:00:46,667
X-RAY

565
01:00:55,882 --> 01:01:01,945
I'm very sorry, but she
doesn't feel well today.

566
01:01:02,492 --> 01:01:05,436
I see. We'll be back
tomorrow.

567
01:01:05,736 --> 01:01:07,292
Thank you.

568
01:01:07,755 --> 01:01:10,864
This is the trophy she won
for her poems.

569
01:01:11,378 --> 01:01:14,152
Thank you.

570
01:01:14,528 --> 01:01:16,071
See you later.

571
01:01:34,839 --> 01:01:37,983
It's wonderful.
You won it, Fumiko.

572
01:01:44,321 --> 01:01:45,605
Desk?

573
01:01:45,905 --> 01:01:47,937
She's seriously ill.

574
01:01:48,237 --> 01:01:52,655
I want to see her and get
some of her new poems.

575
01:01:54,319 --> 01:01:56,040
I'll be staying.

576
01:02:06,879 --> 01:02:09,609
Time for therapy.

577
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:39,658
Hello. Just a moment.

578
01:02:45,054 --> 01:02:46,965
It's the reporter.

579
01:02:51,386 --> 01:02:53,991
I'll see him.

580
01:02:55,101 --> 01:02:56,831
Make him wait.

581
01:03:00,070 --> 01:03:01,859
Wait a while.

582
01:03:47,416 --> 01:03:49,057
Please come in.

583
01:03:54,463 --> 01:03:55,933
Come in.

584
01:04:11,333 --> 01:04:13,196
I'm Otsuki.

585
01:04:30,731 --> 01:04:33,857
Thank him for his
consideration.

586
01:04:34,503 --> 01:04:38,725
Be seated. Excuse me.
I'll get tea for you.

587
01:04:39,025 --> 01:04:40,276
I'm leaving immediately.

588
01:04:43,580 --> 01:04:49,922
Thank you for coming all
way from Tokyo to see me.

589
01:04:51,555 --> 01:04:56,579
Are you here in Hokkaido
on business or something?

590
01:04:57,785 --> 01:05:00,342
Business? I came to see you.

591
01:05:01,791 --> 01:05:03,188
To see me die?

592
01:05:06,224 --> 01:05:09,814
In Tokyo, I didn't know
how things were here.

593
01:05:12,540 --> 01:05:19,188
I read your article
in the Tokyo Daily News.

594
01:05:21,954 --> 01:05:23,539
I'm ready to die.

595
01:05:25,186 --> 01:05:27,007
You needn't.

596
01:05:29,157 --> 01:05:32,583
You don't like to
hear it from me, but...

597
01:05:33,457 --> 01:05:35,122
It's not only me.

598
01:05:36,411 --> 01:05:40,948
All the poets in Tokyo
are interested in you.

599
01:05:42,232 --> 01:05:46,102
And all the critics said
you're promising.

600
01:05:46,402 --> 01:05:49,691
They're interested
because I'm dying.

601
01:05:52,834 --> 01:05:57,386
You wrote I was seriously
ill and would die soon.

602
01:05:58,922 --> 01:06:02,392
You want to make sure of it.

603
01:06:02,721 --> 01:06:05,091
You think that's a reporter?

604
01:06:06,612 --> 01:06:08,831
I respect your talent.

605
01:06:09,544 --> 01:06:12,914
Your first book isn't
for your poems.

606
01:06:13,986 --> 01:06:18,566
If you're satisfied,
I must say you're stupid.

607
01:06:19,931 --> 01:06:23,138
You're right. I'm stupid.

608
01:06:25,278 --> 01:06:27,618
That's why I write poems.

609
01:06:29,280 --> 01:06:34,525
But I'm going to die soon.
Poems can't help.

610
01:06:35,714 --> 01:06:38,065
But you are alive.

611
01:06:40,182 --> 01:06:43,487
Don't give up
so long as you live.

612
01:06:46,307 --> 01:06:47,941
Any new poems?

613
01:06:48,954 --> 01:06:50,783
No.

614
01:06:52,975 --> 01:06:54,854
I can't write any.

615
01:06:55,198 --> 01:06:56,610
Why not?

616
01:06:57,419 --> 01:07:01,386
I lost my breasts.
What can I write?

617
01:07:02,582 --> 01:07:03,905
What can I say?

618
01:07:06,059 --> 01:07:10,783
I don't want to be
known as a poetess.

619
01:07:12,059 --> 01:07:13,732
I'm just a woman.

620
01:07:15,323 --> 01:07:16,771
As a woman...

621
01:07:19,898 --> 01:07:22,322
...losing my breasts saddens me.

622
01:07:23,368 --> 01:07:25,522
Everybody has sadness.

623
01:07:26,373 --> 01:07:29,181
Without it, you can't
write good poems.

624
01:07:30,320 --> 01:07:32,768
You must write more poems.

625
01:07:33,068 --> 01:07:35,721
You want my new poems? Why?

626
01:07:36,554 --> 01:07:40,542
You want my last poem
for your newspaper?

627
01:07:43,235 --> 01:07:47,278
I'll never die!

628
01:07:48,581 --> 01:07:50,530
No new poems!

629
01:07:55,921 --> 01:07:59,299
As long as you live,
I'll be glad.

630
01:08:00,623 --> 01:08:02,729
My visit won't be wasted.

631
01:08:39,509 --> 01:08:45,101
This is our first meeting.
I'll come again tomorrow.

632
01:08:46,299 --> 01:08:49,554
I won't die so soon,
not tomorrow.

633
01:08:49,993 --> 01:08:51,516
Get well.

634
01:08:52,851 --> 01:08:57,256
Sapporo has good beer.
Let's drink it later.

635
01:08:59,524 --> 01:09:02,138
We'll have a party
for your book.

636
01:09:03,634 --> 01:09:05,366
I'll drink for you.

637
01:09:06,106 --> 01:09:09,428
<i>SHIMOJO FUMIKO'S POETRY BOOK
CELEBRATION OF ITS PUBLICATION</i>

638
01:09:09,728 --> 01:09:12,281
As Fumiko is ill...

639
01:09:12,581 --> 01:09:16,131
...we postponed this party.

640
01:09:16,642 --> 01:09:19,531
But having Mr. Otsuki
here in Hokkaido...

641
01:09:19,831 --> 01:09:22,101
...let's hold it tonight.

642
01:09:23,724 --> 01:09:28,647
To Fumiko's new book
and her recovery!

643
01:09:31,122 --> 01:09:32,447
Thank you.

644
01:09:48,744 --> 01:09:52,648
It's a pity
she can't be here.

645
01:09:52,948 --> 01:09:56,344
You women should be careful
about breast cancer.

646
01:09:56,644 --> 01:09:58,189
Men get it, too.

647
01:09:58,489 --> 01:10:01,688
Men, too! Really?

648
01:10:03,463 --> 01:10:06,810
This book has been published
by Mr. Hori.

649
01:10:08,415 --> 01:10:09,630
If he was alive...

650
01:10:09,930 --> 01:10:11,733
...he would be very glad.

651
01:10:12,033 --> 01:10:14,978
It's true.
I wish he could see it.

652
01:10:15,346 --> 01:10:17,819
Mr. Otsuki, thank you for coming
from so far away.

653
01:10:17,820 --> 01:10:18,719
You are welcome.

654
01:10:18,720 --> 01:10:21,363
I thought she'd be worse,
but she didn't seem to be.

655
01:10:21,364 --> 01:10:27,185
- I didn't think it was breast cancer.
- It's too late now. It's a pity.

656
01:10:27,687 --> 01:10:33,608
She must be happy
being congratulated like this.

657
01:10:41,971 --> 01:10:46,473
This is my last wish.
I can die without regrets.

658
01:10:48,961 --> 01:10:50,145
Is it warm?

659
01:10:50,445 --> 01:10:54,048
Yes. I feel fine.

660
01:10:55,042 --> 01:10:58,769
You suddenly wanted
to take a bath.

661
01:10:59,478 --> 01:11:02,440
But I know how you feel.

662
01:11:02,746 --> 01:11:06,080
You're very nice.
I'm grateful to you.

663
01:11:07,403 --> 01:11:09,493
I'll never forget.

664
01:11:09,932 --> 01:11:11,942
I'll be scolded.

665
01:11:12,242 --> 01:11:14,699
It's okay if you get well.

666
01:11:19,707 --> 01:11:21,465
I'm sorry.

667
01:11:28,572 --> 01:11:30,024
Kinuko.

668
01:11:35,562 --> 01:11:37,995
Look, my breasts were here.

669
01:11:38,983 --> 01:11:42,309
This is how I look now.

670
01:11:47,981 --> 01:11:51,899
If you're through, come out.

671
01:11:53,176 --> 01:11:59,087
I wanted to take a bath
where your husband did.

672
01:12:02,376 --> 01:12:05,709
I got cancer as my punishment.

673
01:12:06,990 --> 01:12:09,764
I loved him.

674
01:13:05,266 --> 01:13:06,117
Hello.

675
01:13:06,417 --> 01:13:08,373
Who... It's you.

676
01:13:16,291 --> 01:13:18,589
Come in.

677
01:13:33,580 --> 01:13:35,644
Wait here.

678
01:13:37,414 --> 01:13:38,967
Worried?

679
01:13:43,643 --> 01:13:45,554
Relax.

680
01:13:56,604 --> 01:13:58,279
She troubles you.

681
01:14:01,745 --> 01:14:03,152
No.

682
01:14:03,993 --> 01:14:06,207
Let her alone for a while.

683
01:14:07,881 --> 01:14:10,303
She sounds happy.

684
01:14:13,573 --> 01:14:16,588
She changed
after the operation.

685
01:14:17,680 --> 01:14:19,700
She's like a child.

686
01:14:21,772 --> 01:14:25,595
Sometimes I think she's
trying to destroy herself.

687
01:14:43,286 --> 01:14:45,828
Fumiko, are you through?

688
01:14:49,302 --> 01:14:51,546
Can I open it?

689
01:15:02,806 --> 01:15:05,704
What's wrong?
It's a long bath.

690
01:15:10,157 --> 01:15:12,634
Mr. Otsuki and Yoshio are here.

691
01:15:15,112 --> 01:15:16,394
Sick?

692
01:15:36,255 --> 01:15:37,698
Dizzy?

693
01:15:42,262 --> 01:15:43,813
Feeling pain?

694
01:16:02,792 --> 01:16:03,654
Wait.

695
01:16:03,954 --> 01:16:08,182
- Stay still.
- Okay, okay.

696
01:16:16,471 --> 01:16:21,666
Why come to see a sick
woman like me? What for?

697
01:16:24,076 --> 01:16:28,821
You reported I was dying
in the newspaper.

698
01:16:31,137 --> 01:16:33,175
You want to make sure?

699
01:16:37,011 --> 01:16:40,556
As long as you come to see me...

700
01:16:42,138 --> 01:16:43,946
...I won't write.

701
01:16:48,098 --> 01:16:49,659
Rest quietly.

702
01:16:50,646 --> 01:16:51,954
Sis.

703
01:16:53,217 --> 01:16:58,489
Mr. Otsuki, when will
you leave for Tokyo?

704
01:16:58,789 --> 01:17:00,643
Tonight.

705
01:17:04,096 --> 01:17:05,359
Fumiko.

706
01:17:06,260 --> 01:17:11,484
If my report was wrong,
I'm extremely happy.

707
01:17:13,776 --> 01:17:15,593
Try to live.

708
01:17:29,969 --> 01:17:39,407
<i>The 21:52 train for
Hakodate is leaving.</i>

709
01:17:40,920 --> 01:17:44,868
<i>Passengers have to go
to platform 2 or 3.</i>

710
01:17:45,299 --> 01:17:48,359
If anything happens,
I'll call you.

711
01:17:48,659 --> 01:17:49,934
Thanks.

712
01:17:55,028 --> 01:17:56,741
Otsuki!

713
01:17:58,638 --> 01:18:03,024
I'm glad I came in time.
This is from Fumiko.

714
01:18:03,324 --> 01:18:05,180
- Is it for me?
- Yes.

715
01:18:09,832 --> 01:18:13,218
<i>After dying
I fly everywhere lightly</i>

716
01:18:13,318 --> 01:18:15,766
<i>On your shoulders,
for instance</i>

717
01:18:31,198 --> 01:18:35,728
<i>Unable to return.
Better follows. -Otsuki</i>

718
01:19:04,181 --> 01:19:05,701
What's funny?

719
01:19:06,909 --> 01:19:10,451
So you've come for my poems.

720
01:19:11,470 --> 01:19:13,288
If you like.

721
01:19:13,854 --> 01:19:16,516
Sit down, please.

722
01:19:23,514 --> 01:19:24,727
Your mother?

723
01:19:25,027 --> 01:19:27,752
Out for a bath.

724
01:19:34,118 --> 01:19:36,118
Open it.

725
01:19:38,590 --> 01:19:43,388
All my new poems are there.

726
01:19:43,688 --> 01:19:45,520
Why keep it a secret?

727
01:19:46,482 --> 01:19:50,752
I don't want anybody to see them.

728
01:19:51,052 --> 01:19:52,993
You're mean.

729
01:19:54,373 --> 01:19:58,268
When you really go away...

730
01:19:59,023 --> 01:20:02,750
...please do me a favor.

731
01:20:03,371 --> 01:20:04,894
What is it about?

732
01:20:05,354 --> 01:20:09,903
Throw the poems in Lake Doya.

733
01:20:11,317 --> 01:20:15,688
Do it for me... Please.

734
01:20:16,532 --> 01:20:18,845
- Lake Doya?
- Yes.

735
01:20:20,676 --> 01:20:23,164
I always wanted to go there.

736
01:20:24,984 --> 01:20:29,410
I still do. I can die
for a sight of that lake.

737
01:20:29,714 --> 01:20:31,385
Don't mention dying.

738
01:20:34,963 --> 01:20:38,211
I want you to be more
eager to live.

739
01:20:40,064 --> 01:20:44,481
You're spoiling yourself
by being ill.

740
01:20:47,306 --> 01:20:48,821
To live is never easy.

741
01:20:50,129 --> 01:20:52,194
We all struggle for it.

742
01:20:52,769 --> 01:20:56,331
I refuse to be pitied.

743
01:20:58,760 --> 01:21:01,607
A sick poetess isn't rare.

744
01:21:02,998 --> 01:21:06,555
I try to look fine
for visitors.

745
01:21:07,935 --> 01:21:11,540
I send them away
without worries.

746
01:21:13,733 --> 01:21:19,277
Or I'd feel more miserable
about myself.

747
01:21:42,548 --> 01:21:44,198
I'll be back tomorrow.

748
01:21:45,548 --> 01:21:47,623
Anything you want?

749
01:21:49,287 --> 01:21:52,018
Just you. I want you.

750
01:21:59,800 --> 01:22:01,102
Good night.

751
01:22:12,219 --> 01:22:19,029
<i>Now that Fumiko Shimojo's
days are numbered...</i>

752
01:22:19,329 --> 01:22:23,261
<i>...she should write as many
poems as possible.</i>

753
01:22:23,561 --> 01:22:28,010
<i>The sentence "I hope you get better"
has lost all sense.</i>

754
01:22:29,047 --> 01:22:30,826
<i>All I can do is...</i>

755
01:22:31,126 --> 01:22:34,229
<i>...stimulate her desire
to write poems.</i>

756
01:22:36,011 --> 01:22:40,564
<i>Maybe it's not my duty
as a reporter, but...</i>

757
01:22:40,971 --> 01:22:43,722
<i>...please understand
and let me stay here.</i>

758
01:22:45,117 --> 01:22:47,433
<i>To: Chief Editor.</i>

759
01:23:05,961 --> 01:23:07,981
Hello.

760
01:23:08,876 --> 01:23:11,167
Thank you for last night.

761
01:23:11,973 --> 01:23:14,739
I'm sorry I was out
for a bath.

762
01:23:15,829 --> 01:23:17,693
Come this way.

763
01:23:22,285 --> 01:23:24,346
You look tired.

764
01:23:24,873 --> 01:23:28,421
Fumiko had trouble
breathing last night.

765
01:23:29,584 --> 01:23:31,161
I couldn't sleep.

766
01:23:32,081 --> 01:23:34,176
If there's anything I can do.

767
01:23:34,476 --> 01:23:36,251
Thank you.

768
01:23:37,507 --> 01:23:40,482
I want to go home today.

769
01:23:41,071 --> 01:23:43,635
The nurse will care for her.

770
01:23:44,285 --> 01:23:46,683
But she'll be lonely by herself.

771
01:23:46,983 --> 01:23:48,404
Don't worry.

772
01:23:49,228 --> 01:23:52,709
The old lady in your ward
will move today.

773
01:23:53,427 --> 01:23:55,149
Is that so?

774
01:24:01,533 --> 01:24:03,399
Here's Mr. Otsuki.

775
01:24:04,671 --> 01:24:05,656
Hello.

776
01:24:05,956 --> 01:24:06,918
Welcome.

777
01:24:07,218 --> 01:24:08,727
How are you?

778
01:24:14,951 --> 01:24:16,349
Do you feel like it?

779
01:24:17,567 --> 01:24:19,567
Eat it later, dear.

780
01:24:20,651 --> 01:24:21,966
For you.

781
01:24:24,206 --> 01:24:25,972
Mother.

782
01:24:26,798 --> 01:24:29,132
Come on, let's move.

783
01:24:57,207 --> 01:24:58,938
Goodbye.

784
01:25:00,086 --> 01:25:01,677
And thank you.

785
01:25:10,414 --> 01:25:12,678
You're very kind.

786
01:25:12,978 --> 01:25:15,382
Please take care of her.

787
01:28:03,226 --> 01:28:04,426
<i>Morgue</i>

788
01:28:21,730 --> 01:28:23,458
Fumiko! Fumiko!

789
01:28:42,318 --> 01:28:47,948
When I die, I'll die
just as I am.

790
01:28:49,929 --> 01:28:55,775
I won't ask God to help me
die a good woman.

791
01:28:57,652 --> 01:29:02,529
Because I know there's
no God to rely on.

792
01:29:03,532 --> 01:29:05,484
Be quiet. Go to sleep.

793
01:29:12,090 --> 01:29:14,208
I can't.

794
01:29:16,645 --> 01:29:18,620
Get me some pills.

795
01:29:20,588 --> 01:29:21,873
Please.

796
01:29:23,380 --> 01:29:27,115
No. The doctor said
they'd harm you.

797
01:29:28,557 --> 01:29:32,314
Please! Sleeping pills!

798
01:29:42,882 --> 01:29:44,019
No!

799
01:29:49,889 --> 01:29:51,422
Please!

800
01:29:52,806 --> 01:29:53,861
Please!

801
01:30:29,572 --> 01:30:31,915
Hold on to me.

802
01:31:17,423 --> 01:31:19,049
Have you slept well?

803
01:31:22,342 --> 01:31:23,583
Strange.

804
01:31:24,877 --> 01:31:29,912
I lost my breasts and
my chest got burned.

805
01:31:31,008 --> 01:31:32,934
But I could sleep well.

806
01:31:44,230 --> 01:31:46,926
Mr. Otsuki, a call for you.

807
01:31:49,479 --> 01:31:53,995
From your Tokyo office.
They want you back immediately.

808
01:31:55,699 --> 01:31:58,138
I see.
I'll be there.

809
01:32:15,236 --> 01:32:17,790
Are you leaving tomorrow?

810
01:32:18,393 --> 01:32:20,659
I wish you wouldn't.

811
01:32:22,068 --> 01:32:24,188
People visit me...

812
01:32:25,411 --> 01:32:27,906
...then go away.

813
01:32:28,471 --> 01:32:33,537
It's nice having
a place to return to.

814
01:32:35,151 --> 01:32:38,743
Unfortunately I have none.

815
01:32:42,591 --> 01:32:44,331
I'll end up here.

816
01:32:47,410 --> 01:32:49,856
If I can't stop you...

817
01:32:50,359 --> 01:32:54,088
And if you must leave...

818
01:32:55,144 --> 01:32:57,026
I won't be able...

819
01:32:59,365 --> 01:33:01,883
...to run after you.

820
01:33:02,838 --> 01:33:04,978
I'll be back. Wait for me.

821
01:33:05,875 --> 01:33:07,656
Try to live.

822
01:33:09,789 --> 01:33:11,754
This is goodbye.

823
01:35:06,094 --> 01:35:07,340
What is it?

824
01:35:08,326 --> 01:35:09,866
Say nothing.

825
01:35:11,914 --> 01:35:14,040
Stay still.

826
01:35:17,401 --> 01:35:21,202
This is the happiest
day of my life.

827
01:35:23,819 --> 01:35:24,949
Yet...

828
01:35:26,918 --> 01:35:30,125
As a woman, I'm miserable.
Why is it so?

829
01:35:34,115 --> 01:35:36,521
Because I'm bad?

830
01:35:49,453 --> 01:35:51,184
Sleep with me.

831
01:35:55,733 --> 01:35:58,788
I can die in your arms.

832
01:36:34,371 --> 01:36:36,959
Say hello...

833
01:36:38,109 --> 01:36:41,253
...to your people for me.

834
01:36:50,453 --> 01:36:53,822
These days were...

835
01:36:54,369 --> 01:36:57,083
...the happiest in my life.

836
01:37:00,707 --> 01:37:04,533
Thanks to you
I could live longer.

837
01:37:07,218 --> 01:37:10,553
I was happy every day.

838
01:37:14,982 --> 01:37:18,783
I'll live to write more poems.

839
01:37:22,090 --> 01:37:24,999
I'll send you good poems.

840
01:37:26,766 --> 01:37:30,461
I'll write in the paper
you'll live long.

841
01:37:42,041 --> 01:37:43,241
Go...

842
01:37:44,201 --> 01:37:47,208
...while my eyes are closed.

843
01:38:09,613 --> 01:38:11,283
Try hard.

844
01:38:12,298 --> 01:38:14,254
I'll be back.

845
01:39:45,386 --> 01:39:47,783
<i>No visitors</i>

846
01:40:13,638 --> 01:40:15,596
Mother...

847
01:40:17,304 --> 01:40:20,016
...wash my hair, will you?

848
01:40:20,437 --> 01:40:21,717
Hair?

849
01:40:23,790 --> 01:40:25,206
Doctor?

850
01:40:49,291 --> 01:40:50,778
Yoshio.

851
01:40:54,523 --> 01:40:56,862
Yoshio, get it.

852
01:41:17,916 --> 01:41:21,906
Give it to my children.

853
01:41:30,048 --> 01:41:33,854
They'll read it when
they grow up.

854
01:41:34,154 --> 01:41:36,672
<i>To Noburu and Aiko.
Children, accept my death.</i>

<i>The only thing

856
01:41:48,838 --> 01:41:51,134
Sis, Mrs. Hori is here.

857
01:42:07,363 --> 01:42:08,689
Hello.

858
01:43:28,364 --> 01:43:29,799
Noboru.

859
01:43:30,641 --> 01:43:31,961
Aiko.

860
01:43:32,779 --> 01:43:34,232
I'm sorry.

861
01:43:35,581 --> 01:43:40,843
I wanted to live long
to watch over you...

862
01:43:42,600 --> 01:43:47,568
...to see the days when
you're happily married.

863
01:43:48,565 --> 01:43:50,981
But I can't.

864
01:43:58,346 --> 01:44:00,599
Thank you, ma'am.

865
01:44:09,301 --> 01:44:10,802
Let's go.

866
01:44:11,437 --> 01:44:13,184
Your mom's gift.

867
01:45:35,629 --> 01:45:37,013
Mother!

868
01:45:53,187 --> 01:45:57,375
Stay calm... stay calm.

869
01:46:05,464 --> 01:46:10,023
<i>Mom, get well.</i>

870
01:47:32,185 --> 01:47:36,868
<i>I'm coming. Try hard to live.

871
01:48:16,898 --> 01:48:17,772
Mom?

872
01:48:18,072 --> 01:48:20,471
Gone. That way.

873
01:49:21,768 --> 01:49:23,874
Mom!

874
01:49:55,336 --> 01:50:01,652
