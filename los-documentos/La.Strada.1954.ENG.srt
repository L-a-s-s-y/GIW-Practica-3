1
00:02:08,618 --> 00:02:11,110
<i>Gelsomina!</i>

2
00:02:17,594 --> 00:02:23,056
Mother says
to come home right away.

3
00:02:23,533 --> 00:02:27,493
There's a man here.
He came on a big motorcycle.

4
00:02:27,871 --> 00:02:30,534
He says Rosa is dead.

5
00:02:41,384 --> 00:02:45,913
<i>Gelsomina, you remember Zampanò
who took Rosa away with him?</i>

6
00:02:46,089 --> 00:02:48,183
<i>My poor daughter.</i>

7
00:02:48,458 --> 00:02:51,053
<i>I'll never even see
where they buried her.</i>

8
00:02:51,228 --> 00:02:54,790
She's dead, poor thing.

9
00:02:55,065 --> 00:02:57,660
She was so beautiful, so good.

10
00:02:57,934 --> 00:03:01,132
She could do everything.

11
00:03:01,304 --> 00:03:02,636
Zampanò,

12
00:03:02,906 --> 00:03:06,274
see how much my daughter
Gelsomina looks like her?

13
00:03:07,877 --> 00:03:10,608
We're so poor.

14
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:14,842
I told you, she's not like Rosa.

15
00:03:15,118 --> 00:03:16,882
But she's a good girl, poor thing.

16
00:03:17,053 --> 00:03:19,716
She'll do what she's told.

17
00:03:19,889 --> 00:03:22,256
She just came out a little strange.

18
00:03:22,626 --> 00:03:25,994
But if she eats every day,
maybe she'll get better.

19
00:03:26,363 --> 00:03:29,060
You want to go with Zampanò

20
00:03:29,232 --> 00:03:30,996
and take Rosa's place?

21
00:03:31,301 --> 00:03:34,738
He'll teach you a trade.
You'll earn some money.

22
00:03:34,904 --> 00:03:38,136
And one less mouth to feed
around here wouldn't be bad.

23
00:03:40,644 --> 00:03:43,739
Zampanò's a good man.
He'll treat you well.

24
00:03:44,014 --> 00:03:47,746
You'll travel the world.
You'll sing and dance.

25
00:03:48,018 --> 00:03:50,920
And look what he gave me:

26
00:03:51,321 --> 00:03:52,880
10,000 lire.

27
00:03:53,156 --> 00:03:56,649
I have it here.

28
00:03:56,826 --> 00:04:01,161
We can fix the roof,
and these poor things can eat.

29
00:04:01,331 --> 00:04:05,735
Why did your father
ever leave us?

30
00:04:06,269 --> 00:04:10,104
You're all grown up,
but you've never worked.

31
00:04:10,573 --> 00:04:13,566
It's not your fault

32
00:04:13,843 --> 00:04:15,505
you're not like the other girls.

33
00:04:16,713 --> 00:04:18,944
Won't you help your mother?

34
00:04:19,215 --> 00:04:22,652
He'll teach you.
Isn't that right, Zampanò?

35
00:04:22,819 --> 00:04:26,051
Of course.
I can even teach dogs.

36
00:04:28,692 --> 00:04:30,251
Hey, kids...

37
00:04:32,195 --> 00:04:35,791
go get two pounds of salami,
a pound of cheese,

38
00:04:36,566 --> 00:04:38,694
and two bottles of wine.

39
00:04:39,269 --> 00:04:40,965
That's just the way I am.

40
00:04:41,137 --> 00:04:43,936
Thank you. Go on, kids.

41
00:04:45,241 --> 00:04:46,675
Where are you going?

42
00:04:46,943 --> 00:04:48,172
Come back here.

43
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:52,479
Why do you act like that?

44
00:05:06,029 --> 00:05:09,295
I'm gonna work and learn a trade
and send money home.

45
00:05:09,566 --> 00:05:11,501
I'm gonna be an artist too.

46
00:05:11,768 --> 00:05:14,033
I'll dance and sing like Rosa.

47
00:05:14,304 --> 00:05:16,034
When will you come back?

48
00:05:16,306 --> 00:05:17,968
When will I come back?

49
00:05:18,708 --> 00:05:22,406
Don't go, my daughter!

50
00:05:30,353 --> 00:05:32,845
I said we'd be back soon.

51
00:05:37,861 --> 00:05:39,056
Time to go!

52
00:05:39,229 --> 00:05:40,356
Your shawl!

53
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:43,295
Your shawl!

54
00:05:44,868 --> 00:05:46,427
Jump in.

55
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,399
My daughter!

56
00:05:53,209 --> 00:05:55,769
My poor daughter!

57
00:06:24,508 --> 00:06:28,036
This chain is a quarter-inch thick,

58
00:06:28,178 --> 00:06:31,148
made of solid iron
and stronger than steel.

59
00:06:31,314 --> 00:06:34,284
By simply expanding my pectorals,
or chest muscles,

60
00:06:34,451 --> 00:06:37,478
I'll bust the hook in two.

61
00:06:37,654 --> 00:06:40,385
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

62
00:06:41,725 --> 00:06:45,719
To do this, I must fill my lungs
with air like a tire.

63
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:50,164
A vein might burst
and make me spit blood.

64
00:06:50,333 --> 00:06:52,393
Once, in Milan,

65
00:06:52,669 --> 00:06:58,301
a 260-pound man
lost his eyesight doing this.

66
00:06:58,475 --> 00:07:02,105
The optic nerve
has to do all the work,

67
00:07:02,279 --> 00:07:05,147
and when you've lost your eyesight,
it's all over.

68
00:07:05,882 --> 00:07:09,751
Any sensitive members of the audience
may want to look away.

69
00:07:10,987 --> 00:07:12,922
There may be blood.

70
00:07:34,978 --> 00:07:36,139
Thank you.

71
00:08:15,685 --> 00:08:18,052
You've never made soup before,
have you?

72
00:08:19,456 --> 00:08:21,084
It's pig's swill.

73
00:08:25,028 --> 00:08:27,520
There's enough clothes here
for 10 people.

74
00:08:27,697 --> 00:08:29,962
Shoes, dresses and everything.

75
00:08:30,133 --> 00:08:32,534
Come here. There should be
something here to fit you.

76
00:08:33,937 --> 00:08:35,735
I want you to look elegant.

77
00:08:35,906 --> 00:08:38,432
I don't want to see you in rags.

78
00:08:38,608 --> 00:08:40,975
My women have always
looked smart.

79
00:08:42,779 --> 00:08:44,247
Here.

80
00:08:49,586 --> 00:08:52,351
Try saying, "Here he is: Zampanò."

81
00:08:52,522 --> 00:08:54,582
Here he is: Zampanò.

82
00:09:09,739 --> 00:09:11,105
Here he is: Zampanò.

83
00:09:22,319 --> 00:09:23,981
Come here.

84
00:09:35,031 --> 00:09:37,626
This is a trumpet.

85
00:09:58,922 --> 00:10:00,584
Do only what I tell you to.

86
00:10:07,530 --> 00:10:10,728
This is a drum.

87
00:10:20,777 --> 00:10:22,939
Here he is: Zampanò!

88
00:10:37,861 --> 00:10:40,126
Here he is: Zampanò!

89
00:10:44,667 --> 00:10:46,260
Zampanò is here.

90
00:11:11,361 --> 00:11:12,385
Try again.

91
00:11:18,001 --> 00:11:18,991
Come here.

92
00:11:20,937 --> 00:11:21,870
Stand right there.

93
00:11:27,243 --> 00:11:28,643
Go on.

94
00:11:32,849 --> 00:11:34,078
Zampanò is here.

95
00:11:36,486 --> 00:11:38,114
Say it like this:

96
00:11:38,288 --> 00:11:40,553
Here he is: Zampanò!

97
00:11:42,892 --> 00:11:43,882
Go on.

98
00:11:58,508 --> 00:12:00,170
Quiet flame, bright flame,

99
00:12:00,343 --> 00:12:03,245
quiet flame, night cries.

100
00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:08,077
What are you doing?

101
00:12:12,055 --> 00:12:13,990
It's gonna rain day after tomorrow.

102
00:12:15,192 --> 00:12:16,524
How do you know?

103
00:12:16,693 --> 00:12:17,956
It's gonna rain.

104
00:12:19,896 --> 00:12:20,795
Come here.

105
00:12:36,913 --> 00:12:38,381
Get in.

106
00:12:50,994 --> 00:12:52,929
I'll sleep out here.

107
00:12:53,096 --> 00:12:54,689
Oh, yeah?

108
00:12:58,235 --> 00:12:59,601
Listen...

109
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:05,440
what's your name?

110
00:13:05,609 --> 00:13:07,373
Di Costanzo, Gelsomina.

111
00:13:08,612 --> 00:13:10,672
Come on, Gelsomina.
Get in.

112
00:13:22,425 --> 00:13:23,358
Tomorrow...

113
00:13:23,526 --> 00:13:25,188
Get in!

114
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:18,348
Thank you.

115
00:14:19,482 --> 00:14:23,180
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
for the first time in this city,

116
00:14:23,353 --> 00:14:27,313
we present a farce
bound to make you laugh!

117
00:14:32,262 --> 00:14:35,824
Anybody with a weak heart
better not watch.

118
00:14:35,999 --> 00:14:37,968
You might die laughing.

119
00:14:38,134 --> 00:14:41,298
And since we work
to fill our stomachs,

120
00:14:41,471 --> 00:14:43,906
my wife will pass
the hat around afterwards.

121
00:14:45,275 --> 00:14:46,834
Come on. Quick.

122
00:15:08,865 --> 00:15:11,494
Good morning, Miss Gelsomina.

123
00:15:14,170 --> 00:15:15,968
Excuse me for asking,

124
00:15:16,239 --> 00:15:18,902
but are you afraid of my "trifle"?

125
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:23,007
I said, excuse me for asking,

126
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:25,215
but are you afraid of my "trifle"?

127
00:15:26,216 --> 00:15:28,947
No need to be scared.

128
00:15:29,119 --> 00:15:31,054
Let's go "shunting" with my"trifle."

129
00:15:34,524 --> 00:15:36,550
It's not "trifle."

130
00:15:36,826 --> 00:15:40,160
It's rifle, dummy!

131
00:15:45,969 --> 00:15:49,599
Where would these ducks be?

132
00:15:52,309 --> 00:15:55,302
Well, if there aren't any ducks,

133
00:15:55,478 --> 00:15:58,744
you be the duck
and I'll be the "shunter."

134
00:16:02,819 --> 00:16:05,550
That's a jackass, not a duck!

135
00:16:21,638 --> 00:16:22,833
Thank you.

136
00:16:24,174 --> 00:16:27,201
And now my wife will pass the hat.

137
00:16:27,377 --> 00:16:29,744
Thank you to those
who can give something,

138
00:16:29,913 --> 00:16:31,814
and to those who can't,
thanks anyway.

139
00:16:34,017 --> 00:16:35,178
Evening, everyone.

140
00:16:35,352 --> 00:16:36,786
Hey, close the door.

141
00:16:37,621 --> 00:16:39,055
Hi, Zampanò.

142
00:16:40,657 --> 00:16:42,626
Hey, Gypsy, how's it going?

143
00:16:42,826 --> 00:16:44,795
Zampanò, how are you?

144
00:16:45,061 --> 00:16:46,552
This is my wife.

145
00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:49,165
You mean another one
of your girlfriends.

146
00:16:49,332 --> 00:16:50,766
Pleasure to meet you.

147
00:16:50,934 --> 00:16:52,232
Have a seat.

148
00:16:52,402 --> 00:16:54,098
No, we'll sit over here.

149
00:16:59,309 --> 00:17:00,402
Waiter.

150
00:17:01,678 --> 00:17:03,943
- I'll get him.
- No, you sit still.

151
00:17:04,714 --> 00:17:06,307
Waiter!

152
00:17:06,483 --> 00:17:08,611
<i>Coming. I heard you.</i>

153
00:17:08,785 --> 00:17:10,253
We want to eat.

154
00:17:11,254 --> 00:17:13,223
We've got lamb and veal.

155
00:17:14,324 --> 00:17:15,917
What do you want?

156
00:17:18,094 --> 00:17:20,654
- That one.
- Which? Lamb or veal?

157
00:17:22,065 --> 00:17:23,431
Both.

158
00:17:24,434 --> 00:17:28,337
Fine. Both.
I'll have the lamb with spaghetti.

159
00:17:30,006 --> 00:17:32,305
And a liter of red wine.
- Okay.

160
00:18:18,188 --> 00:18:19,816
Where are you from?

161
00:18:20,957 --> 00:18:22,585
My hometown.

162
00:18:25,362 --> 00:18:28,696
You don't talk like us.

163
00:18:28,865 --> 00:18:30,561
Where were you born?

164
00:18:32,769 --> 00:18:34,431
My father's house.

165
00:18:34,971 --> 00:18:38,135
Waiter!
Get us more wine.

166
00:18:42,479 --> 00:18:45,972
Wool? This ain't no wool!
I could stick my toes through it.

167
00:18:46,783 --> 00:18:48,513
Hey, Red!

168
00:18:48,685 --> 00:18:50,085
Come here.

169
00:18:55,625 --> 00:18:57,617
- You talking to me?
- Yeah. Come here.

170
00:19:00,130 --> 00:19:01,462
Good evening.

171
00:19:01,631 --> 00:19:03,896
- What are you up to?
- Nothing.

172
00:19:04,067 --> 00:19:06,036
Then sit down.

173
00:19:10,874 --> 00:19:12,775
- Want something to drink?
- Yes, thank you.

174
00:19:13,643 --> 00:19:17,011
- Where's that wine?
- I don't like this place at all.

175
00:19:19,382 --> 00:19:21,180
Have a cigarette.

176
00:19:32,095 --> 00:19:34,189
I think I've seen you before.

177
00:19:34,364 --> 00:19:36,697
It's possible. I get around.

178
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,765
- Here's the wine.
- Have you already eaten?

179
00:19:39,936 --> 00:19:41,165
Yes.

180
00:19:51,247 --> 00:19:53,148
Where have I seen you?

181
00:19:54,217 --> 00:19:57,710
What line of work are you in?
- I'm a traveling artist.

182
00:19:57,887 --> 00:20:00,755
This is my sidekick.
I taught her everything.

183
00:20:00,924 --> 00:20:03,325
When I took her on,
she couldn't even quack.

184
00:20:09,265 --> 00:20:11,063
Feel that.

185
00:20:13,903 --> 00:20:15,895
What a macho man!

186
00:20:16,706 --> 00:20:18,140
Look here.

187
00:20:18,641 --> 00:20:22,009
I earned all this
in one hour, with these.

188
00:20:22,178 --> 00:20:23,077
May I?

189
00:20:27,650 --> 00:20:28,845
She's a sly one.

190
00:20:29,018 --> 00:20:32,284
Let's get out of here.
It smells.

191
00:20:32,455 --> 00:20:34,151
Let's go see the fireworks.

192
00:20:34,324 --> 00:20:37,726
Waiter, two more bottles of wine.

193
00:20:38,461 --> 00:20:40,657
How much do I owe?
- 120, I think.

194
00:20:59,048 --> 00:21:00,516
- Hey there.
- Good evening.

195
00:21:01,551 --> 00:21:03,816
- How's business?
- So-so.

196
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:09,752
Put the wine inside.

197
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:12,661
Hey, Red, where are you going?

198
00:21:13,863 --> 00:21:16,697
Get in.
- Is this piece of junk your car?

199
00:21:16,866 --> 00:21:19,859
- Don't you like it?
- Are you crazy?

200
00:21:20,036 --> 00:21:22,005
It's American.

201
00:21:22,272 --> 00:21:24,935
Hasn't broken down once
in seven years.

202
00:21:25,108 --> 00:21:27,407
My God! What are you doing?

203
00:21:27,677 --> 00:21:29,236
Feel that motor?

204
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:32,815
- Shall I get in back?
- You wait here.

205
00:21:33,616 --> 00:21:35,346
Where are you going?

206
00:22:33,977 --> 00:22:36,378
You're still here?

207
00:22:36,546 --> 00:22:38,344
Why didn't you eat your soup?

208
00:22:38,515 --> 00:22:42,452
Why didn't she eat the soup?
- I don't know. She just wouldn't eat.

209
00:22:42,619 --> 00:22:45,179
Shut up about your old soup.
I'll kick your old soup!

210
00:22:45,355 --> 00:22:47,915
See how she is?
You try to help and...

211
00:22:48,091 --> 00:22:52,119
Tell me: Does your husband
have the motorcycle with the wagon?

212
00:22:52,295 --> 00:22:54,287
The one that was
in the piazza yesterday?

213
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:56,023
I'll bet you that's him.

214
00:22:56,199 --> 00:22:59,601
Over by the gardens there's a man
with a motorcycle and wagon.

215
00:22:59,769 --> 00:23:02,534
- Where?
- That way, beyond the houses.

216
00:25:28,017 --> 00:25:30,179
A dog died in there.

217
00:26:13,864 --> 00:26:15,492
You woke up?

218
00:26:16,933 --> 00:26:18,868
I planted some tomatoes.

219
00:26:20,837 --> 00:26:22,271
Tomatoes?

220
00:26:27,377 --> 00:26:30,575
I found some seeds, the big kind,

221
00:26:30,747 --> 00:26:32,375
so I planted them.

222
00:26:33,583 --> 00:26:35,484
Come on. Move it.

223
00:26:40,924 --> 00:26:42,950
We're leaving?

224
00:26:43,126 --> 00:26:46,790
Why? Want to wait around
for your tomatoes to grow?

225
00:26:46,963 --> 00:26:48,454
Push.

226
00:27:06,116 --> 00:27:08,585
Were you like this with Rosa, too?

227
00:27:09,486 --> 00:27:10,886
What?

228
00:27:12,355 --> 00:27:13,914
With Rosa.

229
00:27:15,025 --> 00:27:16,857
What the hell are you saying?

230
00:27:17,661 --> 00:27:19,892
Why did you go with that woman?

231
00:27:20,063 --> 00:27:22,259
Were you like this with Rosa, too?

232
00:27:22,432 --> 00:27:23,991
Knock it off!

233
00:27:31,608 --> 00:27:33,008
What do you want?

234
00:27:33,176 --> 00:27:36,044
You're one of those men
who runs around with women.

235
00:27:36,212 --> 00:27:38,113
What?

236
00:27:38,281 --> 00:27:40,477
Who runs around with women.

237
00:27:40,650 --> 00:27:43,677
If you want to stay with me,
you've got to learn one thing-

238
00:27:44,754 --> 00:27:46,985
to keep your mouth shut!

239
00:27:49,492 --> 00:27:51,051
Tomatoes.

240
00:27:53,096 --> 00:27:55,622
What have you got
in your head, anyway?

241
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,200
Here.

242
00:28:16,353 --> 00:28:20,620
Wine! Sweet honeydew,
pleasure of Don Matthew!

243
00:28:28,765 --> 00:28:32,258
Long life to the bride,
fresh as a rose!

244
00:28:42,512 --> 00:28:45,346
It was all because of a dance!

245
00:29:06,703 --> 00:29:07,830
A kiss!

246
00:29:08,004 --> 00:29:11,270
We want to see a kiss!

247
00:29:16,613 --> 00:29:17,876
She's calling us.

248
00:29:18,048 --> 00:29:21,416
- Why don't you come and eat?
- We'll be right there.

249
00:29:21,585 --> 00:29:23,645
Come and sit.

250
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:26,517
- Teresa, come sit down.
- I don't have time.

251
00:29:36,633 --> 00:29:37,965
Come.

252
00:29:39,436 --> 00:29:41,064
Follow me.

253
00:29:42,639 --> 00:29:45,632
- I have to eat.
- You can eat afterwards.

254
00:29:49,579 --> 00:29:51,207
Where are you taking me?

255
00:29:51,381 --> 00:29:53,111
To see Oswald.

256
00:30:00,924 --> 00:30:02,483
This way.

257
00:30:07,697 --> 00:30:10,166
Don't pull on me.
I'll slap you.

258
00:30:17,574 --> 00:30:19,372
Oswald, look who's here.

259
00:30:24,881 --> 00:30:26,509
Poor thing. Who is he?

260
00:30:26,683 --> 00:30:30,017
My cousin Oswald. He's sick.
He stays in here.

261
00:30:30,186 --> 00:30:32,621
They never let anyone see him.
Make him laugh.

262
00:30:33,456 --> 00:30:36,756
- How?
- Do what you were doing before.

263
00:30:39,663 --> 00:30:42,292
Little birdie.

264
00:30:59,649 --> 00:31:02,710
Scoundrels! That's what you are!
You'll get a thrashing tonight!

265
00:31:02,886 --> 00:31:04,752
Out of here right now!

266
00:31:06,122 --> 00:31:08,284
Who let you in?
Get out of here!

267
00:31:25,909 --> 00:31:27,935
You always eat standing up
like a horse?

268
00:31:28,912 --> 00:31:30,608
I always eat on my feet.

269
00:31:34,784 --> 00:31:37,185
Who's going to keep
the house going if not me?

270
00:31:37,353 --> 00:31:39,322
I had two husbands, but both died.

271
00:31:42,726 --> 00:31:45,321
For three nights I've been up
at 1:00 a.m. to cook.

272
00:31:45,495 --> 00:31:49,899
Think I'm tired? If I felt like it,
I could dance all night long.

273
00:31:50,066 --> 00:31:52,297
Us older women
are better than young girls.

274
00:31:53,636 --> 00:31:56,970
- Why don't you remarry?
- What? Another husband?

275
00:31:58,441 --> 00:32:00,603
I'm the only one
who gives orders around here.

276
00:32:01,111 --> 00:32:03,546
Is that all a husband is good for?

277
00:32:04,214 --> 00:32:06,012
Giving orders?

278
00:32:06,850 --> 00:32:08,944
Think I'm not made
of flesh and blood?

279
00:32:09,119 --> 00:32:11,281
Everybody likes sweets
after a good meal.

280
00:32:15,658 --> 00:32:17,820
What are you looking at?
Get out of here!

281
00:32:19,696 --> 00:32:22,860
My first husband
was big and tall like you.

282
00:32:23,433 --> 00:32:25,129
I've still got all his clothes.

283
00:32:25,301 --> 00:32:27,065
They don't fit anyone.

284
00:32:31,941 --> 00:32:33,273
Upstairs-

285
00:32:35,578 --> 00:32:37,171
I'll get you something too.

286
00:32:39,048 --> 00:32:41,882
There's a little boy
with a head like this.

287
00:32:43,386 --> 00:32:45,048
Here. Eat.

288
00:32:45,221 --> 00:32:48,316
The wine's all gone.
Help me bring out some more.

289
00:32:48,491 --> 00:32:52,587
Listen, you really don't have
any use for those clothes?

290
00:32:52,762 --> 00:32:56,722
Who else is gonna wear them?
There aren't many men built like you.

291
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:59,995
Is there a hat too?

292
00:33:00,170 --> 00:33:01,536
I could really use a hat.

293
00:33:01,704 --> 00:33:04,572
Sure. Come on in.
See for yourself.

294
00:34:15,712 --> 00:34:18,272
Do you remember
how beautiful it was, Zampanò?

295
00:34:22,986 --> 00:34:25,455
Watching the rain
from the window that day?

296
00:34:39,669 --> 00:34:42,503
Why don't you teach me
to play the trumpet?

297
00:34:42,672 --> 00:34:44,300
I'll learn quickly.

298
00:34:44,474 --> 00:34:48,411
Did you teach Rosa?
Did she do my job?

299
00:34:51,114 --> 00:34:52,810
How do I look?

300
00:34:55,685 --> 00:34:57,153
Women.

301
00:34:59,923 --> 00:35:01,482
Can't even smoke in here.

302
00:35:10,233 --> 00:35:11,895
What the hell is the matter?

303
00:35:12,068 --> 00:35:13,263
Nothing.

304
00:35:13,436 --> 00:35:15,132
Then why are you crying?

305
00:35:15,305 --> 00:35:17,001
Because-

306
00:35:21,511 --> 00:35:23,070
Climb up out of there.

307
00:35:24,648 --> 00:35:26,241
Come on, get out of there.

308
00:35:28,485 --> 00:35:31,478
Gonna stay there all night?
- Yes, all night!

309
00:35:55,645 --> 00:35:57,238
I'm leaving.

310
00:35:58,214 --> 00:36:01,048
I'm going back home.
I'm sick and tired.

311
00:36:09,292 --> 00:36:10,920
It's not on account of the work,

312
00:36:11,328 --> 00:36:13,297
'cause I like the work.

313
00:36:14,631 --> 00:36:16,725
I like being an artist.

314
00:36:18,401 --> 00:36:20,302
It's you I don't like.

315
00:36:21,738 --> 00:36:23,297
What's the matter?

316
00:36:25,041 --> 00:36:26,304
I'm leaving.

317
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:31,375
I'm going home!

318
00:36:31,548 --> 00:36:33,380
Knock it off, you idiot.

319
00:36:39,255 --> 00:36:42,919
I'm leaving the shoes and the coat!

320
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:44,589
Everything!

321
00:37:02,512 --> 00:37:05,607
I do everything for him,

322
00:37:05,782 --> 00:37:08,115
and what does he do for me?
Nothing!

323
00:37:21,064 --> 00:37:22,896
I'm leaving!

324
00:41:02,118 --> 00:41:05,384
And now the Fool will perform
his most dangerous stunt yet.

325
00:41:05,856 --> 00:41:10,123
He will eat a plate of spaghetti while
suspended 125 feet above the ground.

326
00:41:11,127 --> 00:41:14,894
We ask you to keep very quiet
during this feat,

327
00:41:15,165 --> 00:41:18,624
for the slightest distraction
could prove fatal.

328
00:41:19,002 --> 00:41:21,938
Ladies and gentlemen,
I present the Fool,

329
00:41:22,105 --> 00:41:25,166
the only man in the world
to perform this feat.

330
00:41:32,415 --> 00:41:34,714
Is it nice up there?

331
00:41:36,186 --> 00:41:39,452
Yes, but a bit cold.

332
00:41:39,823 --> 00:41:43,021
To tell the truth,
it's given me quite an appetite.

333
00:41:44,394 --> 00:41:45,987
Darned wind!

334
00:41:46,763 --> 00:41:48,356
It blew my napkin away.

335
00:41:48,531 --> 00:41:54,198
What? You're not even going
to ask us to join you?

336
00:41:54,838 --> 00:41:56,500
There's plenty of room.

337
00:41:56,673 --> 00:41:59,575
If anyone wants to come up,
they're welcome.

338
00:42:40,050 --> 00:42:41,484
Thank you.

339
00:42:52,929 --> 00:42:54,557
Let me through.

340
00:43:01,571 --> 00:43:03,540
Anna, I'll see you at the restaurant.

341
00:43:03,707 --> 00:43:04,800
All right.

342
00:43:13,149 --> 00:43:15,015
Out of the way.

343
00:43:18,054 --> 00:43:20,080
Will you let me through?

344
00:43:23,193 --> 00:43:24,752
Get out of the way.

345
00:43:29,232 --> 00:43:31,497
Attention!

346
00:43:31,668 --> 00:43:34,228
One, two...
- She's crazy!

347
00:43:38,542 --> 00:43:40,238
Leave her alone.

348
00:43:50,153 --> 00:43:53,282
- I'm going now.
- Bye, Mario.

349
00:43:57,160 --> 00:43:58,753
You want a drink?

350
00:43:58,929 --> 00:44:00,989
No more drink for me.

351
00:44:46,276 --> 00:44:47,369
Get in.

352
00:44:52,749 --> 00:44:54,650
I don't want to go with you again!

353
00:44:55,085 --> 00:44:56,314
I don't want to!

354
00:44:58,054 --> 00:44:59,613
Never again!

355
00:45:00,991 --> 00:45:02,584
I said get in!

356
00:45:03,860 --> 00:45:04,828
Take this!

357
00:45:06,229 --> 00:45:07,322
Come here.

358
00:45:14,204 --> 00:45:15,763
Now walk!

359
00:45:20,877 --> 00:45:22,004
Get in there!

360
00:45:23,747 --> 00:45:25,306
And shut up!

361
00:45:28,018 --> 00:45:29,884
You got something to say?

362
00:45:31,321 --> 00:45:32,949
I thought so.

363
00:46:29,913 --> 00:46:31,313
Good morning.

364
00:46:41,791 --> 00:46:43,157
Good morning.

365
00:47:14,724 --> 00:47:16,283
Hey, come here.

366
00:47:16,726 --> 00:47:17,819
Come on. Move it.

367
00:47:22,032 --> 00:47:24,058
Come on up.
Make yourself comfortable.

368
00:47:25,902 --> 00:47:27,894
Say hi to the boss lady.

369
00:47:28,071 --> 00:47:29,437
Mr. Giraffa.

370
00:47:30,173 --> 00:47:32,733
I've taught her everything.

371
00:47:34,044 --> 00:47:35,307
Cup of coffee?

372
00:47:38,315 --> 00:47:40,284
Go on. Take it.

373
00:47:40,450 --> 00:47:42,783
When I got her,
she didn't even have shoes.

374
00:47:43,620 --> 00:47:46,715
She's not like us.
We've seen the world.

375
00:47:47,524 --> 00:47:48,924
Nasty wind!

376
00:47:49,159 --> 00:47:52,357
Nazareno, careful
the tent doesn't blow away.

377
00:47:53,129 --> 00:47:55,598
I'm warning you,
I don't pay nobody nothing.

378
00:47:55,765 --> 00:47:58,735
You work for tips like the others.

379
00:47:58,902 --> 00:48:01,872
They pass the hat,
and they're happy with that, right?

380
00:48:02,038 --> 00:48:04,872
That's fine.
Have we ever disagreed before?

381
00:48:05,308 --> 00:48:07,937
Then you can start tonight.

382
00:48:08,111 --> 00:48:11,047
You have the girl to pass
the hat around, so it's settled.

383
00:48:15,051 --> 00:48:18,579
- Where are we?
- In Rome. That's St. Paul's.

384
00:48:20,924 --> 00:48:23,393
So we're joining the circus?

385
00:48:25,528 --> 00:48:28,464
- Seems like a good tent.
- Come on in.

386
00:48:29,532 --> 00:48:32,991
How many people does it hold?

387
00:48:33,169 --> 00:48:35,798
There are seats for 400,
and standing room too.

388
00:48:37,807 --> 00:48:38,968
You know him?

389
00:48:43,780 --> 00:48:46,272
Look who's here! It's Trifle.

390
00:48:48,651 --> 00:48:50,586
You did a good thing taking him on.

391
00:48:50,754 --> 00:48:52,586
A circus needs animals.

392
00:48:53,623 --> 00:48:55,558
Just kidding.
You know I'm always kidding.

393
00:48:55,759 --> 00:48:57,387
Want a cig?
Oh, you've got one.

394
00:48:57,861 --> 00:49:00,330
I have to admit,
he's a great artist.

395
00:49:00,497 --> 00:49:02,625
And what a repertoire!

396
00:49:02,799 --> 00:49:06,634
You should do the number with the chain.
You haven't done that one in ages.

397
00:49:06,803 --> 00:49:08,533
Let me give you some advice.

398
00:49:08,705 --> 00:49:10,367
Don't speak to me.

399
00:49:10,540 --> 00:49:12,532
Otherwise you'll be sorry.

400
00:49:13,676 --> 00:49:15,474
I was just joking.

401
00:49:17,180 --> 00:49:18,580
You heard me.

402
00:49:38,869 --> 00:49:40,428
He's really good.

403
00:49:58,588 --> 00:50:00,113
Go, Trifle!

404
00:50:07,364 --> 00:50:08,696
Big man.

405
00:50:17,974 --> 00:50:20,170
Don't worry.
It's sure to be a disaster.

406
00:50:21,244 --> 00:50:22,837
Now, ladies and gentlemen,

407
00:50:23,947 --> 00:50:27,247
the Giraffa Circus
presents a new attraction.

408
00:50:28,885 --> 00:50:32,583
Zampanò, the man
with lungs of steel.

409
00:50:44,267 --> 00:50:48,261
Ladies and gentlemen,
this here chain

410
00:50:48,438 --> 00:50:49,701
is a quarter-inch thick,

411
00:50:49,973 --> 00:50:52,841
made of solid iron
and stronger than steel.

412
00:50:54,110 --> 00:50:56,909
I will wrap the chain around my chest

413
00:50:57,080 --> 00:50:59,709
and fasten it securely with this hook.

414
00:51:00,784 --> 00:51:03,754
By simply expanding
my pectoral muscles-

415
00:51:04,521 --> 00:51:06,080
that is, my chest-

416
00:51:06,489 --> 00:51:08,219
I'll bust the hook.

417
00:51:08,491 --> 00:51:11,427
If anyone thinks the hook
is already sawed in half,

418
00:51:12,028 --> 00:51:14,588
you may look for yourself.

419
00:51:14,831 --> 00:51:16,561
Gelsomina, please.

420
00:51:17,801 --> 00:51:20,168
This piece of cloth
is not for my protection...

421
00:51:25,942 --> 00:51:28,377
but to spare you the sight of blood

422
00:51:28,545 --> 00:51:31,777
in case the hook tears my flesh.

423
00:51:34,651 --> 00:51:37,678
I'm not saying it takes
a team of oxen.

424
00:51:38,421 --> 00:51:40,185
You're not all geniuses, I'm sure,

425
00:51:40,557 --> 00:51:43,527
but any reasonable person can see

426
00:51:44,227 --> 00:51:46,219
that it takes three things:

427
00:51:47,597 --> 00:51:48,997
good lungs,

428
00:51:49,265 --> 00:51:50,494
ribs of steel,

429
00:51:51,201 --> 00:51:53,193
and superhuman strength.

430
00:51:53,370 --> 00:51:54,804
Get out of there.

431
00:51:56,239 --> 00:51:59,175
Any sensitive members of the audience
are advised to look away.

432
00:52:00,910 --> 00:52:03,778
The drum will sound three times.

433
00:52:07,717 --> 00:52:09,276
Gelsomina, please begin.

434
00:52:15,925 --> 00:52:17,188
Zampanò, excuse me.

435
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:19,226
Telephone call for you.

436
00:52:29,539 --> 00:52:30,871
Bastard!

437
00:52:31,041 --> 00:52:32,566
Quick, it's your turn!

438
00:52:34,744 --> 00:52:37,111
Calm down.
I'll talk to that rascal.

439
00:52:37,547 --> 00:52:39,140
Where is he? I'll kill him.

440
00:52:40,050 --> 00:52:41,040
I'll kill him!

441
00:52:46,556 --> 00:52:48,184
Where are you?

442
00:52:55,432 --> 00:52:58,334
- Is he hiding in there?
- I haven't seem him.

443
00:53:00,770 --> 00:53:03,865
Where are you, you coward?

444
00:53:08,144 --> 00:53:10,579
When I'm done with you,
you won't feel like laughing.

445
00:53:15,552 --> 00:53:17,077
Coward.

446
00:53:30,133 --> 00:53:32,625
What has he got against you?

447
00:53:32,802 --> 00:53:34,327
How should I know?

448
00:53:35,805 --> 00:53:37,637
Did you do something to him?

449
00:53:37,807 --> 00:53:39,605
I never did a thing to him.

450
00:53:41,945 --> 00:53:43,937
He's the one who makes fun of me.

451
00:53:44,547 --> 00:53:46,448
One of these days he'll pay for it.

452
00:53:48,118 --> 00:53:49,814
But who is he?

453
00:53:50,353 --> 00:53:52,845
The bastard son of a gypsy,
that's who he is.

454
00:53:55,325 --> 00:53:58,193
- Have you known him long?
- Too long.

455
00:54:01,898 --> 00:54:04,527
Did Rosa know him too?

456
00:54:05,702 --> 00:54:08,570
Listen, he doesn't know a thing
about either Rosa or me.

457
00:54:11,841 --> 00:54:13,867
I don't walk
to talk about it anymore.

458
00:54:14,444 --> 00:54:16,003
Let's go to bed.

459
00:55:18,675 --> 00:55:21,110
There she is.
Look how she walks!

460
00:55:25,549 --> 00:55:27,950
What did I tell you?
The very face we need.

461
00:55:28,718 --> 00:55:29,811
Take this.

462
00:55:30,253 --> 00:55:31,687
Come on.

463
00:55:31,855 --> 00:55:33,983
Put that thing down,
for Pete's sake.

464
00:55:34,858 --> 00:55:38,556
I always did this number when
I had a girl, and it always went over.

465
00:55:40,130 --> 00:55:41,689
Gelsomina, work with us.

466
00:55:41,865 --> 00:55:43,026
Scram!

467
00:55:43,767 --> 00:55:46,032
Here we go.
Give it a good blow.

468
00:55:48,338 --> 00:55:51,365
Magnificent! Did you know
you're very talented?

469
00:55:51,875 --> 00:55:55,039
Now pay attention.
I'll play the violin,

470
00:55:55,212 --> 00:55:57,408
and when you hear me go like this...

471
00:55:59,149 --> 00:56:02,381
you come creeping up
behind me ever so quietly

472
00:56:02,953 --> 00:56:05,422
and blow the trumpet
exactly like you just did.

473
00:56:05,589 --> 00:56:08,320
Got it? Let's give it a try.
- I can't.

474
00:56:09,226 --> 00:56:11,957
- Why not?
- Zampanò says no.

475
00:56:12,729 --> 00:56:15,164
Hear that?
And you say it's my fault!

476
00:56:15,332 --> 00:56:16,891
Where is Zampanò?

477
00:56:17,434 --> 00:56:19,994
Go get him and I'll talk to him.

478
00:56:20,170 --> 00:56:22,969
- He went into the city.
- Fine. I'll talk to him later.

479
00:56:23,139 --> 00:56:25,005
Don't be afraid.
He won't eat you.

480
00:56:25,308 --> 00:56:27,402
We're all one big family
and we all work together.

481
00:56:27,577 --> 00:56:29,409
The more the merrier.

482
00:56:29,579 --> 00:56:31,946
Remember,
when I get to this point...

483
00:56:35,252 --> 00:56:36,117
Understand?

484
00:56:36,286 --> 00:56:38,346
You sure?

485
00:56:38,521 --> 00:56:39,784
Okay, here goes.

486
00:56:42,325 --> 00:56:44,157
Ladies and gentlemen,

487
00:56:44,327 --> 00:56:48,856
I will now play for you
a very sad song.

488
00:56:59,142 --> 00:57:00,940
Go on, blow.

489
00:57:02,279 --> 00:57:04,475
Too late, silly girl!

490
00:57:04,648 --> 00:57:07,516
Very nice.

491
00:57:07,684 --> 00:57:10,882
I see Zampanò's company
has made you a genius.

492
00:57:11,054 --> 00:57:13,751
Don't wait for me to finish.
You have to interrupt me!

493
00:57:14,057 --> 00:57:16,891
And I told you to blow it
over here, silly girl!

494
00:57:17,527 --> 00:57:19,621
Let's try it again.

495
00:57:33,243 --> 00:57:34,643
See? That was great!

496
00:57:34,811 --> 00:57:37,144
Now, we do that three times.

497
00:57:37,614 --> 00:57:43,019
Then I walk around the ring, and you
follow playing behind me. Got it?

498
00:57:43,186 --> 00:57:44,586
Let me show you something.

499
00:57:44,754 --> 00:57:47,724
Put one finger here
and the other over here.

500
00:57:47,891 --> 00:57:49,382
Then you just blow.

501
00:57:49,559 --> 00:57:50,788
Try it.

502
00:57:55,332 --> 00:57:57,233
Now follow me. One, two...

503
00:58:10,113 --> 00:58:11,706
What's the matter, Zampanò?

504
00:58:11,881 --> 00:58:13,440
She's working. I asked her to.

505
00:58:14,084 --> 00:58:15,916
She only works with me.

506
00:58:17,721 --> 00:58:19,485
Sorry, but I don't understand.

507
00:58:19,656 --> 00:58:23,093
I'd have asked you earlier,
but you were in the city.

508
00:58:23,259 --> 00:58:25,660
What's wrong?
We all work together here.

509
00:58:25,829 --> 00:58:27,730
She doesn't work with him!

510
00:58:28,031 --> 00:58:29,693
You'd better knock it off!

511
00:58:30,233 --> 00:58:31,826
I'm not speaking to you.

512
00:58:32,001 --> 00:58:33,936
You told me not to, remember?

513
00:58:34,971 --> 00:58:37,531
Gelsomina, go see my wife.
Let me talk to him.

514
00:58:37,707 --> 00:58:40,506
Stay! I tell her what to do!

515
00:58:41,611 --> 00:58:44,240
If I tell you not to work
with that bum,

516
00:58:44,414 --> 00:58:45,712
then you don't work with him.

517
00:58:45,882 --> 00:58:48,875
Because that's how I want it!

518
00:58:49,953 --> 00:58:51,888
If I catch you again-

519
00:58:57,627 --> 00:58:59,721
Zampanò, leave the Fool alone!

520
00:59:00,230 --> 00:59:03,667
Stop them!
They'll kill each other!

521
00:59:04,234 --> 00:59:06,829
Hurry up! He's a beast!

522
00:59:09,239 --> 00:59:11,367
Damn these gypsy vagabonds!

523
00:59:13,009 --> 00:59:14,568
He's got a knife!

524
00:59:16,112 --> 00:59:17,910
Don't worry.

525
00:59:18,081 --> 00:59:20,073
They'll keep them apart.

526
00:59:31,428 --> 00:59:33,897
Be careful!
He's got a knife!

527
00:59:39,369 --> 00:59:41,497
I'll kill the first person
who comes near me.

528
00:59:44,641 --> 00:59:47,076
Open this door!
Come out here!

529
00:59:52,282 --> 00:59:54,615
Get back!

530
00:59:55,785 --> 00:59:58,118
What's going on here?
- Nothing.

531
00:59:58,288 --> 00:59:59,256
Hey, you!

532
00:59:59,656 --> 01:00:01,215
Drop that knife!

533
01:00:03,193 --> 01:00:06,561
My circus has never been involved
in a scandal like this before!

534
01:00:06,863 --> 01:00:10,197
The police never carried
anyone off in handcuffs before!

535
01:00:10,767 --> 01:00:11,894
It's his fault.

536
01:00:12,068 --> 01:00:14,833
I've never had
problems with the law!

537
01:00:16,706 --> 01:00:18,265
Where will you go now?

538
01:00:18,441 --> 01:00:21,434
Don't worry. When he gets out,
he'll come looking for you.

539
01:00:21,611 --> 01:00:23,876
You should forget about him.

540
01:00:24,047 --> 01:00:26,573
You're better off without
the likes of him.

541
01:00:26,749 --> 01:00:30,652
What will you do on your own?
Where will your next meal come from?

542
01:00:31,120 --> 01:00:32,247
The motorcycle...

543
01:00:32,922 --> 01:00:35,323
We'll leave it with the police.

544
01:00:35,492 --> 01:00:37,256
Come with us, Gelsomina.

545
01:00:37,527 --> 01:00:39,860
- But where would I sleep?
- With me. Come see.

546
01:00:40,029 --> 01:00:41,622
There's enough room
for two in my wagon.

547
01:00:41,798 --> 01:00:42,925
Stop yakking!

548
01:00:43,099 --> 01:00:44,795
We still have to take
everything down.

549
01:00:44,968 --> 01:00:46,527
The truck's coming at 4:00.

550
01:00:46,703 --> 01:00:49,172
You do as you like.
You want to come, come!

551
01:00:49,339 --> 01:00:51,240
You want to wait for him,
then wait!

552
01:00:51,407 --> 01:00:53,103
But he'll never work with us again!

553
01:00:53,276 --> 01:00:55,177
Neither one of them!

554
01:00:56,412 --> 01:00:57,937
Let the tent down!

555
01:01:21,054 --> 01:01:22,181
Were you sleeping?

556
01:01:25,025 --> 01:01:26,891
It smells like a pigsty in here.

557
01:01:27,060 --> 01:01:28,926
How can you stand it?

558
01:01:30,997 --> 01:01:32,556
Zampanò is still in jail.

559
01:01:33,133 --> 01:01:34,897
Maybe they'll let him out tomorrow.

560
01:01:36,369 --> 01:01:38,065
Tomorrow?

561
01:01:38,238 --> 01:01:39,638
Yeah, maybe.

562
01:01:39,940 --> 01:01:41,841
It was your fault.

563
01:01:42,242 --> 01:01:44,302
Zampanò never did anything to you.

564
01:01:44,978 --> 01:01:47,106
So why did they let you out?

565
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:51,945
Maybe from one point of view
it was my fault,

566
01:01:52,786 --> 01:01:54,345
but he had the knife.

567
01:01:56,756 --> 01:01:58,782
Come on out for a bit.

568
01:01:59,893 --> 01:02:01,293
Come down.

569
01:02:01,962 --> 01:02:04,193
It'll do him good
to spend some time in jail.

570
01:02:05,265 --> 01:02:07,234
He's got so many years ahead of him.

571
01:02:07,968 --> 01:02:09,834
I'm the one who's gonna die young.

572
01:02:11,438 --> 01:02:12,997
What a nice breeze tonight.

573
01:02:13,506 --> 01:02:15,065
Let's sit here for a while.

574
01:02:16,243 --> 01:02:17,905
What a lovely robe.

575
01:02:18,678 --> 01:02:19,907
Sit down.

576
01:02:27,554 --> 01:02:29,989
What a funny face you have.

577
01:02:31,324 --> 01:02:34,294
Are you sure you're a woman?
You look more like an artichoke.

578
01:02:39,866 --> 01:02:42,301
I don't know
if I'll stay with Zampanò.

579
01:02:42,469 --> 01:02:44,131
They've asked me to go with them.

580
01:02:44,904 --> 01:02:47,464
Then it's a good opportunity
to get rid of him.

581
01:02:53,046 --> 01:02:55,072
Imagine his face tomorrow

582
01:02:55,348 --> 01:02:57,340
when he gets out
and finds everyone gone!

583
01:02:59,719 --> 01:03:01,244
You should do it!

584
01:03:02,722 --> 01:03:04,384
What an animal.

585
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:09,020
I've got nothing against him,

586
01:03:09,296 --> 01:03:12,130
but I can't help teasing him
whenever I see him.

587
01:03:13,667 --> 01:03:15,329
I don't know why.

588
01:03:16,803 --> 01:03:19,637
I swear I don't know.
An urge just comes over me.

589
01:03:21,641 --> 01:03:26,204
But how did you end up with him?

590
01:03:27,047 --> 01:03:28,675
He gave my mother 10,000 lire.

591
01:03:28,848 --> 01:03:30,646
That much?

592
01:03:31,551 --> 01:03:33,383
I have four younger sisters.

593
01:03:35,955 --> 01:03:37,617
Do you like him?

594
01:03:39,225 --> 01:03:40,989
- Me?
- Yes, you.

595
01:03:41,561 --> 01:03:43,496
You could have gotten away.

596
01:03:45,699 --> 01:03:47,861
I tried.

597
01:03:48,435 --> 01:03:49,994
Nothing.

598
01:03:50,570 --> 01:03:53,734
You can be really exasperating!
What do you mean, nothing?

599
01:03:54,541 --> 01:03:57,670
If you don't want to stay with him,
then go with the others.

600
01:04:00,513 --> 01:04:03,244
Makes no difference
whether I go with them

601
01:04:03,416 --> 01:04:06,284
or stay with Zampanò.

602
01:04:06,820 --> 01:04:09,654
How would going with them
change anything?

603
01:04:09,823 --> 01:04:12,884
I'm of no use to anybody,

604
01:04:13,960 --> 01:04:17,658
and I'm sick of living.

605
01:04:22,869 --> 01:04:24,497
Can you cook?

606
01:04:25,972 --> 01:04:28,567
I said, can you cook?

607
01:04:31,277 --> 01:04:34,111
Then what can you do?
Dance? Sing?

608
01:04:34,814 --> 01:04:36,180
A little.

609
01:04:37,417 --> 01:04:38,851
Maybe...

610
01:04:40,887 --> 01:04:43,015
you like to make love.

611
01:04:47,394 --> 01:04:49,522
Then what do you like?

612
01:04:52,432 --> 01:04:54,333
You really are an ugly one.

613
01:04:56,136 --> 01:04:59,334
Why was I born?

614
01:05:03,877 --> 01:05:06,904
What if I asked you
to come with me?

615
01:05:07,714 --> 01:05:09,410
I'll teach you to walk the tightrope,

616
01:05:09,682 --> 01:05:12,481
way up in the air,
with all the lights on you.

617
01:05:13,186 --> 01:05:15,917
I have a car.
We'd be traveling all the time.

618
01:05:16,189 --> 01:05:18,090
We'd have a world of fun.

619
01:05:18,892 --> 01:05:20,986
Would you like that?

620
01:05:24,230 --> 01:05:25,391
But no. "Nothing."

621
01:05:25,665 --> 01:05:30,467
You have to stay with Zampanò
and perform his ridiculous stunts,

622
01:05:30,737 --> 01:05:34,367
and let him beat you like a donkey.

623
01:05:39,913 --> 01:05:41,381
Such is life.

624
01:05:42,816 --> 01:05:44,341
But you know,

625
01:05:44,617 --> 01:05:48,019
Zampanò wouldn't keep you
if you weren't worth something to him.

626
01:05:50,390 --> 01:05:52,825
What did he do
that time you escaped?

627
01:05:52,992 --> 01:05:55,223
He really slapped me around.

628
01:05:58,364 --> 01:06:01,163
Why didn't he let you go?

629
01:06:03,803 --> 01:06:05,169
I don't understand.

630
01:06:05,438 --> 01:06:09,500
I wouldn't keep you a single day.

631
01:06:10,810 --> 01:06:12,711
Maybe...

632
01:06:15,715 --> 01:06:17,775
Maybe he likes you.

633
01:06:18,585 --> 01:06:20,986
Zampanò... likes me?

634
01:06:21,254 --> 01:06:22,449
Why not?

635
01:06:22,722 --> 01:06:24,122
He's like a dog.

636
01:06:24,290 --> 01:06:27,283
Ever seen those dogs
who look like they want to speak

637
01:06:27,460 --> 01:06:29,224
but all they do is bark?

638
01:06:29,429 --> 01:06:31,125
Poor guy.

639
01:06:35,835 --> 01:06:38,236
Yeah. Poor guy.

640
01:06:41,040 --> 01:06:42,440
But...

641
01:06:43,743 --> 01:06:45,644
if you don't stay with him,

642
01:06:45,812 --> 01:06:47,371
who will?

643
01:06:47,680 --> 01:06:50,741
I'm an ignorant man,
but I've read a book or two.

644
01:06:51,751 --> 01:06:53,344
You may not believe it,

645
01:06:53,520 --> 01:06:56,388
but everything
in this world has a purpose.

646
01:06:56,923 --> 01:07:00,189
Even this pebble.

647
01:07:00,360 --> 01:07:01,828
Which one?

648
01:07:02,095 --> 01:07:03,757
This one. Any one.

649
01:07:04,030 --> 01:07:07,194
But even this one has a purpose.

650
01:07:08,368 --> 01:07:10,337
- What's its purpose?
- Its purpose is-

651
01:07:11,204 --> 01:07:14,003
How should I know?
If I knew, I'd be-

652
01:07:14,207 --> 01:07:17,041
- Who?
- The Almighty, who knows everything.

653
01:07:17,877 --> 01:07:20,176
When you're born.
When you die.

654
01:07:20,446 --> 01:07:22,142
Who knows?

655
01:07:23,650 --> 01:07:27,746
No, I don't know
what this pebble's purpose is.

656
01:07:27,921 --> 01:07:29,913
but it must have one,

657
01:07:30,189 --> 01:07:33,489
because if this pebble has no purpose,
then everything is pointless.

658
01:07:34,494 --> 01:07:36,520
Even the stars.

659
01:07:37,363 --> 01:07:39,093
At least, I think so.

660
01:07:40,400 --> 01:07:41,993
And you too.

661
01:07:42,769 --> 01:07:45,204
You have a purpose too,

662
01:07:45,872 --> 01:07:48,535
with that artichoke head of yours.

663
01:08:08,227 --> 01:08:11,891
One of these days, I'll take a match
and set fire to everything.

664
01:08:12,065 --> 01:08:14,125
Mattresses, blankets-everything.

665
01:08:14,934 --> 01:08:16,562
That'll show him.

666
01:08:16,736 --> 01:08:19,570
I never refused to go with him.

667
01:08:19,806 --> 01:08:23,743
He paid 10,000 lire.
I do my work and he hits me.

668
01:08:26,112 --> 01:08:28,104
That's not right.

669
01:08:28,548 --> 01:08:30,073
He doesn't think.

670
01:08:30,316 --> 01:08:32,217
I tell him, and what does he do?

671
01:08:32,485 --> 01:08:34,147
What good does it do?

672
01:08:34,420 --> 01:08:37,857
I'll put poison in his soup too.

673
01:08:38,124 --> 01:08:40,320
I'll set fire to it all!

674
01:08:41,227 --> 01:08:43,526
If I don't stay with him, who will?

675
01:08:48,568 --> 01:08:50,764
So they want you to join them?

676
01:08:55,908 --> 01:08:57,308
Wake up.

677
01:08:57,477 --> 01:08:59,969
I asked you if they want you
to join them.

678
01:09:01,648 --> 01:09:04,709
Did they say anything about me?

679
01:09:06,085 --> 01:09:10,022
They said they don't want
either you or Zampanò.

680
01:09:13,092 --> 01:09:15,527
Big deal.
Who wants to stay anyway?

681
01:09:15,695 --> 01:09:17,664
Where I'm going,
I'll make gobs of money.

682
01:09:17,830 --> 01:09:19,958
They need me.
I don't need anybody.

683
01:09:20,233 --> 01:09:22,099
I'm here today,
who knows where tomorrow.

684
01:09:22,268 --> 01:09:24,203
The less time in one place,
the better,

685
01:09:24,370 --> 01:09:26,362
because people get
on my nerves very quickly.

686
01:09:26,906 --> 01:09:29,205
I take off on my own.

687
01:09:29,475 --> 01:09:31,410
That's just the way I am.

688
01:09:31,678 --> 01:09:33,340
No house, no roof.

689
01:09:33,613 --> 01:09:36,310
Why did you say you'd die soon?

690
01:09:37,250 --> 01:09:40,709
It just stands to reason.

691
01:09:40,987 --> 01:09:42,888
Goes with the job.

692
01:09:46,859 --> 01:09:49,260
I'll break my neck,
and no one will remember me.

693
01:09:50,463 --> 01:09:52,261
What about your mama?

694
01:09:52,432 --> 01:09:55,368
So what are you going to do?

695
01:09:55,535 --> 01:09:57,731
Wait for him or join them?

696
01:09:59,706 --> 01:10:01,231
Go on, get in.

697
01:10:01,407 --> 01:10:04,309
We'll take the motorcycle
to the police station

698
01:10:05,211 --> 01:10:07,806
so he'll find you there
when they let him out.

699
01:10:09,949 --> 01:10:12,851
Does this old dinosaur actually work?

700
01:10:34,191 --> 01:10:35,989
What a piece of junk!

701
01:10:36,226 --> 01:10:38,127
Come on, get out.

702
01:10:41,198 --> 01:10:43,167
There's the jail.

703
01:10:51,508 --> 01:10:52,908
I'll be leaving now.

704
01:10:53,076 --> 01:10:54,339
You're going?

705
01:10:55,011 --> 01:10:56,001
Yes.

706
01:10:56,179 --> 01:10:57,613
But seriously,

707
01:10:58,081 --> 01:11:00,744
you'd really like to come with me?

708
01:11:03,720 --> 01:11:06,588
Silly, I told you I've no intention
of taking along a girl.

709
01:11:06,756 --> 01:11:08,281
I really don't need one.

710
01:11:21,071 --> 01:11:22,198
That's just...

711
01:11:25,642 --> 01:11:27,076
a souvenir.

712
01:11:58,174 --> 01:12:00,166
Good-bye, Gelsomina!

713
01:12:22,799 --> 01:12:24,199
Here I am.

714
01:12:30,907 --> 01:12:33,467
They asked me to go with them,

715
01:12:33,643 --> 01:12:34,941
but I -

716
01:12:35,211 --> 01:12:37,180
You could have gone.

717
01:13:44,514 --> 01:13:46,346
Which way is my home?

718
01:13:47,150 --> 01:13:48,618
That way.

719
01:14:00,597 --> 01:14:03,726
Once all I thought about
was going home,

720
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:07,300
but I don't care so much anymore.

721
01:14:10,273 --> 01:14:13,607
Now I feel like my home is with you.

722
01:14:15,145 --> 01:14:17,546
Oh, yeah?
What a discovery.

723
01:14:17,814 --> 01:14:22,343
And with all that poverty
at your house to tempt you.

724
01:14:23,787 --> 01:14:25,449
You're an animal!

725
01:14:25,722 --> 01:14:27,691
You don't think!

726
01:14:31,227 --> 01:14:32,820
There wasn't much to eat, huh?

727
01:14:34,030 --> 01:14:35,464
There was plenty!

728
01:14:37,267 --> 01:14:39,327
There's going to be a storm.

729
01:14:39,936 --> 01:14:42,167
What's the nearest town?

730
01:14:42,439 --> 01:14:44,499
Magliano, 13 miles from here.

731
01:14:44,674 --> 01:14:47,234
But you have to cross the mountains.

732
01:14:47,811 --> 01:14:49,746
We'd never make it.

733
01:14:50,280 --> 01:14:51,839
Not enough gas.

734
01:14:54,851 --> 01:14:56,752
Our convent is over there.

735
01:15:08,532 --> 01:15:10,000
Wait a moment.

736
01:15:10,267 --> 01:15:12,327
Mother, I found oil.

737
01:15:12,602 --> 01:15:16,835
This man wants to know
if he could stay the night.

738
01:15:18,975 --> 01:15:21,376
Pardon us, Mother,
but we don't have much gas.

739
01:15:22,112 --> 01:15:25,571
It's getting dark,
the town is still a ways off,

740
01:15:25,949 --> 01:15:27,781
and my wife doesn't feel well.

741
01:15:29,686 --> 01:15:33,384
- They could sleep in the barn.
- All right. Just for tonight.

742
01:15:33,657 --> 01:15:35,751
She said you can stay.

743
01:15:35,926 --> 01:15:37,895
You can sleep in the barn.

744
01:15:38,662 --> 01:15:41,461
Thank you very much, Mother.

745
01:15:47,904 --> 01:15:49,964
I found a little more.

746
01:15:52,375 --> 01:15:53,809
It's good.

747
01:15:58,248 --> 01:16:00,717
Wouldn't you like a little more?

748
01:16:00,884 --> 01:16:02,614
Go on. Have some more.

749
01:16:07,857 --> 01:16:10,122
Does she work with you too?

750
01:16:11,861 --> 01:16:13,557
She helps me out a bit.

751
01:16:13,830 --> 01:16:16,994
She plays the drum and the trumpet.

752
01:16:17,834 --> 01:16:20,167
Show the sister
how you play the trumpet.

753
01:17:04,914 --> 01:17:05,813
Beautiful.

754
01:17:07,450 --> 01:17:09,180
You play so well.

755
01:17:09,452 --> 01:17:11,250
That's enough.
Now wash these dishes.

756
01:17:11,421 --> 01:17:13,583
- Let me have those.
- It's not your job.

757
01:17:13,857 --> 01:17:15,450
We'll do it together.

758
01:17:15,625 --> 01:17:18,823
She's so good,
and she plays so well.

759
01:17:20,463 --> 01:17:23,433
What's the name of that song?
- I don't know.

760
01:17:24,534 --> 01:17:26,526
What are you doing there?

761
01:17:27,737 --> 01:17:30,798
Let me do that.
That's no work for you, Sister.

762
01:17:31,875 --> 01:17:34,310
I always do it.

763
01:17:41,284 --> 01:17:43,378
Do you always sleep in there?

764
01:17:43,987 --> 01:17:45,683
There's lots of room.

765
01:17:45,855 --> 01:17:48,723
I've got pots and pans,
just like in a house.

766
01:17:48,958 --> 01:17:50,153
Very nice.

767
01:17:50,427 --> 01:17:53,727
Do you like traveling from one place
to the next all the time?

768
01:17:54,164 --> 01:17:55,962
That's how his work is.

769
01:17:56,733 --> 01:18:00,693
We travel around too.
We change convents every two years.

770
01:18:00,937 --> 01:18:03,236
This is my second.
- Why?

771
01:18:03,506 --> 01:18:06,533
So we don't get too attached
to the things of this world.

772
01:18:06,843 --> 01:18:09,677
You grow fond of where you live,

773
01:18:09,946 --> 01:18:12,006
even of a plant.

774
01:18:12,282 --> 01:18:15,616
You risk forgetting your most
important attachment, which is to God.

775
01:18:18,154 --> 01:18:19,884
So you see, we both travel.

776
01:18:20,056 --> 01:18:22,616
You follow your husband,
and I follow mine.

777
01:18:24,060 --> 01:18:25,585
Each her own.

778
01:18:25,862 --> 01:18:28,195
Would you like to see the convent?

779
01:18:28,465 --> 01:18:30,297
I'll show it to you.

780
01:18:30,567 --> 01:18:34,265
It's ancient.
Over a thousand years old.

781
01:18:48,952 --> 01:18:50,750
Why do you keep me?

782
01:18:51,154 --> 01:18:54,090
I'm not pretty. I can't cook.
I can't do anything.

783
01:18:55,325 --> 01:18:57,226
What the heck do you want?

784
01:18:59,262 --> 01:19:00,753
Go to bed.

785
01:19:02,365 --> 01:19:04,596
What a potato head you are.

786
01:19:17,914 --> 01:19:19,439
It's raining.

787
01:19:20,116 --> 01:19:22,017
It's nice here.

788
01:19:28,525 --> 01:19:31,085
Would you be sorry if I died?

789
01:19:34,664 --> 01:19:36,633
Why? Planning on dying?

790
01:19:37,901 --> 01:19:40,530
Once I really wanted to die

791
01:19:40,737 --> 01:19:43,605
"rather than stay with him,"
I told myself.

792
01:19:49,613 --> 01:19:53,243
Now, I'd even be willing
to marry you,

793
01:19:54,985 --> 01:19:57,978
since we're going to stay together.

794
01:19:58,221 --> 01:20:00,656
If even a pebble has a purpose.

795
01:20:00,824 --> 01:20:04,317
You have to think about these things,

796
01:20:04,494 --> 01:20:06,156
but you never think at all.

797
01:20:06,329 --> 01:20:09,197
- There's nothing to think about.
- But there is!

798
01:20:10,300 --> 01:20:13,327
What should I think about?
Tell me.

799
01:20:14,337 --> 01:20:16,966
Enough of this nonsense!

800
01:20:17,707 --> 01:20:19,437
Go to sleep. I'm tired.

801
01:20:36,092 --> 01:20:38,459
Do you like me a little?

802
01:20:55,779 --> 01:20:57,407
Knock it off.

803
01:21:34,417 --> 01:21:39,014
There are silver hearts on the wall,
but my hands are too big.

804
01:21:39,189 --> 01:21:40,851
Come see if you can reach.

805
01:21:43,426 --> 01:21:45,452
What do you mean, no?

806
01:21:45,628 --> 01:21:47,358
How dare you say no to me!

807
01:21:52,235 --> 01:21:54,204
- You shouldn't.
- Shut up!

808
01:22:12,122 --> 01:22:14,284
Have a good trip.
Wait a minute.

809
01:22:15,425 --> 01:22:16,984
What's the matter?

810
01:22:19,062 --> 01:22:20,928
Would you like to stay here?

811
01:22:22,499 --> 01:22:24,434
I'll tell Mother Superior.

812
01:22:28,037 --> 01:22:29,596
Sisters-

813
01:22:29,773 --> 01:22:31,401
Here. Put this away.

814
01:22:31,574 --> 01:22:36,706
Many thanks for your goodwill
and hospitality.

815
01:22:37,380 --> 01:22:40,373
Sincere thanks
from a humble artist.

816
01:22:41,117 --> 01:22:42,517
Push.

817
01:23:51,821 --> 01:23:54,882
Trifle, come to give me a hand?

818
01:24:07,103 --> 01:24:09,299
I'll help you someday too.

819
01:24:26,790 --> 01:24:28,759
Drop it!

820
01:24:33,029 --> 01:24:34,395
Zampanò, stop it!

821
01:24:34,564 --> 01:24:36,192
Make fun of me now!

822
01:24:42,672 --> 01:24:45,403
You trying to kill me?

823
01:24:50,580 --> 01:24:52,879
That was a little present from "Trifle."

824
01:24:55,018 --> 01:24:56,987
Next time it'll be worse.

825
01:24:57,254 --> 01:24:59,450
Worse than this?

826
01:25:03,927 --> 01:25:06,055
You broke my watch!

827
01:25:28,818 --> 01:25:31,049
Zampanò, run!

828
01:25:31,688 --> 01:25:33,122
He's hurt!

829
01:25:48,571 --> 01:25:50,403
He's dying.

830
01:25:53,877 --> 01:25:55,903
Come on, get up.

831
01:25:56,079 --> 01:25:57,775
Stop clowning around.

832
01:26:00,583 --> 01:26:02,108
He's dying.

833
01:26:08,224 --> 01:26:09,783
Knock it off!

834
01:26:11,027 --> 01:26:12,518
Hey, you!

835
01:26:26,476 --> 01:26:28,240
Shut up.

836
01:26:31,114 --> 01:26:34,278
Shut up!

837
01:26:40,790 --> 01:26:42,918
Now I'm done for.

838
01:28:26,263 --> 01:28:29,665
I advise sensitive members
of the audience to look away.

839
01:28:29,933 --> 01:28:33,131
The hook may pierce my flesh,
causing blood to spurt out.

840
01:28:33,904 --> 01:28:35,634
The drum will sound three times.

841
01:28:35,906 --> 01:28:37,772
Gelsomina, please.

842
01:28:43,013 --> 01:28:44,037
The drum!

843
01:28:49,553 --> 01:28:51,954
The Fool is hurt.

844
01:28:56,359 --> 01:28:58,351
The Fool is hurt.

845
01:29:26,323 --> 01:29:28,053
What's wrong with you?

846
01:29:28,525 --> 01:29:30,084
What's the matter?

847
01:29:32,896 --> 01:29:35,991
No one saw us,
and no one is after us.

848
01:29:37,567 --> 01:29:39,763
They'll never even suspect us.

849
01:29:44,574 --> 01:29:46,133
I'm hungry.

850
01:29:48,712 --> 01:29:51,477
You stay here.
I'll take care of it.

851
01:30:20,577 --> 01:30:22,136
Where are you going?

852
01:30:26,049 --> 01:30:28,018
Where are you going?

853
01:30:30,954 --> 01:30:33,389
Where do you think you're going?

854
01:30:42,799 --> 01:30:45,394
Want to go back home?

855
01:31:08,958 --> 01:31:10,221
Eat something.

856
01:31:14,364 --> 01:31:17,027
Enough crying! Stop it!

857
01:31:18,702 --> 01:31:20,603
I can't take it anymore!

858
01:31:24,107 --> 01:31:26,702
It's cold.
I'm coming in to bed.

859
01:31:28,778 --> 01:31:31,213
Don't come in.

860
01:31:31,381 --> 01:31:33,407
Shut up. I'll sleep out here.

861
01:32:09,818 --> 01:32:11,377
It's nice here.

862
01:32:12,288 --> 01:32:13,881
It's cold.

863
01:32:17,593 --> 01:32:19,061
Sit down.

864
01:32:19,562 --> 01:32:20,894
Get some sun.

865
01:32:58,968 --> 01:33:00,834
Let's have some soup.

866
01:33:13,816 --> 01:33:15,375
It's missing something.

867
01:33:16,085 --> 01:33:18,554
Leave it. I'll do it.

868
01:33:22,758 --> 01:33:24,522
It's about time.

869
01:33:24,827 --> 01:33:26,728
You didn't move for ten days.

870
01:33:35,304 --> 01:33:37,739
I didn't mean to kill him.

871
01:33:38,273 --> 01:33:40,469
I just punched him a couple of times.

872
01:33:41,010 --> 01:33:42,876
He wasn't hurt.

873
01:33:43,779 --> 01:33:46,010
I bloodied his nose a bit.

874
01:33:46,615 --> 01:33:48,777
I turn around, he drops dead.

875
01:33:49,952 --> 01:33:53,013
The rest of my life in prison
for a couple of punches?

876
01:33:53,188 --> 01:33:56,556
Just let me work in peace.
Don't I have a right to live?

877
01:34:12,374 --> 01:34:15,606
Thank goodness,
now we can get going.

878
01:34:16,545 --> 01:34:19,071
There's a big fair in this town.

879
01:34:19,748 --> 01:34:23,617
Just a few miles from here.
We'll make some money.

880
01:34:24,987 --> 01:34:26,250
What's wrong?

881
01:34:27,389 --> 01:34:29,085
What's the matter?

882
01:34:30,426 --> 01:34:32,258
The Fool is hurt.

883
01:34:45,741 --> 01:34:48,210
I'll take you home.

884
01:34:49,311 --> 01:34:51,542
Want me to take you home
to your mother?

885
01:34:53,982 --> 01:34:56,417
Don't you want to go home
to your mother?

886
01:34:56,652 --> 01:35:00,248
If I don't stay with you, who will?

887
01:35:00,422 --> 01:35:02,891
I can't go on like this!

888
01:35:03,592 --> 01:35:05,493
I have to make a living!

889
01:35:06,795 --> 01:35:09,230
You're sick up here!

890
01:35:19,775 --> 01:35:21,869
Go inside.
What are you doing?

891
01:35:22,244 --> 01:35:24,304
It's cold. Come on.

892
01:35:25,314 --> 01:35:26,714
Come on.

893
01:35:34,623 --> 01:35:38,025
You killed him.

894
01:35:38,193 --> 01:35:39,991
It's nice here in the sun.

895
01:35:41,196 --> 01:35:42,926
I wanted to run away,

896
01:35:43,198 --> 01:35:46,066
but he told me to stay with you.

897
01:35:50,472 --> 01:35:52,634
We need more wood.

898
01:35:53,609 --> 01:35:55,407
The fire's dying out.

899
01:38:36,472 --> 01:38:40,705
Get out of here, kids.
The show's not till tonight.

900
01:38:45,014 --> 01:38:46,710
Hey, where are you going?

901
01:38:46,982 --> 01:38:48,541
For a walk.

902
01:38:49,919 --> 01:38:51,911
Want me to come with you?

903
01:38:52,922 --> 01:38:55,187
No. I'll be right back.

904
01:39:06,835 --> 01:39:08,963
A small vanilla.

905
01:39:14,410 --> 01:39:16,504
And a little lemon.

906
01:40:11,133 --> 01:40:12,692
Hey, you!

907
01:40:12,868 --> 01:40:15,565
Where did you learn that song?

908
01:40:16,639 --> 01:40:19,973
- What song?
- The one you were just singing.

909
01:40:20,709 --> 01:40:21,904
This one?

910
01:40:25,681 --> 01:40:29,015
A girl who was here
a long time ago used to sing it.

911
01:40:29,284 --> 01:40:30,843
How long ago?

912
01:40:31,120 --> 01:40:34,056
A long time.
Four or five years.

913
01:40:34,423 --> 01:40:38,485
She always played it on the trumpet,
and it stuck in my head.

914
01:40:40,396 --> 01:40:42,524
Where is she now?

915
01:40:42,865 --> 01:40:44,891
She's dead, poor thing.

916
01:40:45,200 --> 01:40:47,692
You're from the circus, right?

917
01:40:47,903 --> 01:40:51,032
She was one of you too.
A vagabond.

918
01:40:51,206 --> 01:40:53,675
No one around here
knew her or anything about her.

919
01:40:53,942 --> 01:40:55,467
She never spoke.

920
01:40:56,211 --> 01:40:58,009
She seemed crazy.

921
01:40:58,447 --> 01:41:01,906
My father found her
one night on the beach.

922
01:41:02,584 --> 01:41:05,144
Poor thing was sick with a fever.

923
01:41:05,320 --> 01:41:07,118
We took her into our home.

924
01:41:07,289 --> 01:41:09,349
But she wouldn't say anything.
All she did was cry.

925
01:41:09,525 --> 01:41:11,084
She wouldn't eat.

926
01:41:11,260 --> 01:41:14,128
When she got a little better,
she sat out in the sun.

927
01:41:14,296 --> 01:41:16,765
She would thank us
and play the trumpet.

928
01:41:18,033 --> 01:41:20,400
Then, one morning,
she just didn't wake up.

929
01:41:20,669 --> 01:41:24,697
The mayor got involved,
wrote letters to find out who she was.

930
01:41:26,241 --> 01:41:29,075
Would you like to go see him?

931
01:42:07,683 --> 01:42:11,984
Now we present Zampanò,
the man with lungs of steel.

932
01:42:12,321 --> 01:42:15,223
After that,
you'll see a humorous skit

933
01:42:15,390 --> 01:42:17,052
that will have you in stitches.

934
01:42:31,840 --> 01:42:33,706
Ladies and gentlemen,

935
01:42:34,543 --> 01:42:37,809
this here is a chain and hook
a quarter-inch thick.

936
01:42:38,647 --> 01:42:41,640
Solid iron, stronger than steel.

937
01:42:42,084 --> 01:42:46,283
By simply expanding
my pectoral muscles-

938
01:42:46,455 --> 01:42:48,151
that is, my chest-

939
01:42:48,323 --> 01:42:49,985
I'll bust the hook.

940
01:42:51,160 --> 01:42:55,029
This piece of cloth
is not for my protection,

941
01:42:55,297 --> 01:42:57,732
but to spare the public
the sight of blood

942
01:42:58,000 --> 01:42:59,866
in case the hook pierces my flesh.

943
01:43:02,004 --> 01:43:03,996
Sensitive members of the audience

944
01:43:05,507 --> 01:43:07,305
should look away.

945
01:43:13,649 --> 01:43:16,778
That's enough now.
It's late. Go home to bed.

946
01:43:17,953 --> 01:43:19,785
Leave me alone!

947
01:43:19,955 --> 01:43:21,218
Stop drinking now.

948
01:43:21,490 --> 01:43:25,325
I'll take you to Amilcare's.
His wine is better.

949
01:43:26,695 --> 01:43:28,664
Put that down.
Stop drinking now.

950
01:43:30,599 --> 01:43:33,194
I know how to walk!

951
01:43:33,802 --> 01:43:34,963
Get your hands off me!

952
01:43:35,137 --> 01:43:36,935
The check.

953
01:43:37,239 --> 01:43:39,868
Throw him in the sea.
He can't even hold his drink.

954
01:43:40,109 --> 01:43:42,476
Leave them alone.
Are you crazy?

955
01:43:45,481 --> 01:43:47,177
I'll show you.

956
01:43:55,157 --> 01:43:56,853
You a big strong man?

957
01:43:57,026 --> 01:44:00,087
Let me go!

958
01:44:07,603 --> 01:44:09,504
Tough guy!

959
01:44:14,810 --> 01:44:16,608
I'll take each one of you on!

960
01:44:17,613 --> 01:44:21,414
Damn drunk!
You're pathetic!

961
01:44:27,523 --> 01:44:30,891
What are you doing?
Kicking a drunk?

962
01:44:37,466 --> 01:44:39,230
Leave me alone!

963
01:44:39,868 --> 01:44:42,030
You want to hit me too?
Don't you recognize me?

964
01:44:42,271 --> 01:44:45,935
I'll leave you to your fate, then.

965
01:44:46,308 --> 01:44:48,709
I don't want no friends.

966
01:44:51,080 --> 01:44:52,946
Go ahead.
Break whatever you want.

967
01:44:55,584 --> 01:44:59,351
Why don't you all come out now?

968
01:45:00,823 --> 01:45:02,382
Come on!

969
01:45:03,692 --> 01:45:05,354
I'll crush you like bugs!

970
01:45:14,370 --> 01:45:18,466
I don't need anybody!

971
01:45:18,707 --> 01:45:22,007
I want to be alone!

972
01:45:22,978 --> 01:45:25,004
Alone...
