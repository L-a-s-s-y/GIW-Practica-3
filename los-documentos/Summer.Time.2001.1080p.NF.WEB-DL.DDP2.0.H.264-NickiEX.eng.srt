1
00:02:23,477 --> 00:02:28,107
I looked up all the documents from
before you were adopted.

2
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:32,512
Before you were adopted,

3
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:36,050
you were reported as an orphan.

4
00:02:37,391 --> 00:02:40,019
I went to the neighborhood and asked around.

5
00:02:40,961 --> 00:02:45,625
Luckily, there was a woman who remembered you.

6
00:02:50,137 --> 00:02:54,471
Thank you very much.
I'll never forget your help.

7
00:02:56,343 --> 00:03:00,143
Hey, you bitch!
Where the hell do you think you're going?

8
00:03:00,347 --> 00:03:04,181
Pay up...
Let go, you bitch!

9
00:03:04,718 --> 00:03:08,916
Why you, bitch!
You're stealing a zipper that's only a dollar?

10
00:03:09,156 --> 00:03:12,182
Is this the way you sew on a zipper?

11
00:03:12,626 --> 00:03:15,754
Of course, this is the way!
How else, bitch?

12
00:03:27,174 --> 00:03:29,665
She's the one I told you about!

13
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:57,195
Ugh... dumb, fat bitch... huh.

14
00:03:57,404 --> 00:04:03,036
Scratching a person's face like this.

15
00:04:10,584 --> 00:04:12,074
Hello.

16
00:04:17,124 --> 00:04:19,649
This is the man I told you about.

17
00:04:23,864 --> 00:04:29,063
Then... this is... Jin-woo?
Yes.

18
00:04:43,417 --> 00:04:45,385
I wanted to see you because

19
00:04:45,552 --> 00:04:49,352
there's something you should know.

20
00:04:54,528 --> 00:04:56,496
Sit, sit here.

21
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:07,099
I was hoping to have this time with you some day.

22
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:13,145
It's a long story...

23
00:05:23,523 --> 00:05:27,482
Today, commentator Bang speaks
about the Kwangjoo incident.

24
00:05:27,794 --> 00:05:29,557
Hello. This is Young-jin Bang

25
00:05:30,864 --> 00:05:32,297
Today, I'd like to talk about

26
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:34,459
the military that has entered Kwangjoo.

27
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:38,300
The difficulties the military had

28
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:41,136
in stabilizing the crisis is well known.

29
00:05:42,976 --> 00:05:45,240
The military under martial law worked hard

30
00:05:45,278 --> 00:05:48,304
to bring it under control.

31
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:53,042
It is well understood that it was

32
00:05:53,754 --> 00:05:56,018
hard for the military to protect

33
00:05:56,056 --> 00:05:59,958
the innocent majority of Kwangjoo
who are citizens of this country.

34
00:06:01,762 --> 00:06:06,324
Thus the army acted cautiously.

35
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:10,796
We will not forget their endeavors.

36
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:13,130
The Martial Law headquarters released

37
00:06:13,173 --> 00:06:15,471
its report on the Kwangjoo riot today.

38
00:06:15,509 --> 00:06:17,773
According to the report,

39
00:06:18,578 --> 00:06:20,842
there were 33 main instigators,

40
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:23,845
30 who attacked the prisons,
33 looters who also set fires,

41
00:06:24,084 --> 00:06:28,453
174 who left the main party,
10 who spread rumors,

42
00:06:28,789 --> 00:06:32,020
and 74 who participated in demonstrations or riot

43
00:06:52,746 --> 00:07:00,949
"The river is flowing... Underneath
the Third Han Bridge..."

44
00:08:52,299 --> 00:08:53,095
Hey

45
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:55,865
Did you see the guy who moved
into the second floor?

46
00:08:57,170 --> 00:08:58,535
He looks real elegant

47
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:04,673
His fingers are white and really long

48
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:08,844
What good are pretty hands, you fool

49
00:09:09,182 --> 00:09:12,982
Look at Kyung-chul. He easily makes
10 bucks a day.

50
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:16,120
Ugh... whatever. Who cares if he's a good worker

51
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:21,187
You crazy bitch!
Then what's great about pretty hands?

52
00:09:21,461 --> 00:09:23,326
What's he gonna use them for

53
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:27,192
You haven't got a clue... A fool,
that's what you are.

54
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:32,129
Ki-ok, all you do is curse

55
00:09:32,172 --> 00:09:33,070
Stop it.

56
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:35,033
It's irritating.

57
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:38,240
Huh! Am I wrong?

58
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:41,009
It's not like his thing is pretty.

59
00:09:41,214 --> 00:09:43,739
Who cares about his hands, right?

60
00:09:45,552 --> 00:09:48,646
Ki-ok! You do know something, don't you?

61
00:09:49,456 --> 00:09:52,254
You go, girl!

62
00:09:53,326 --> 00:09:55,351
Ugh... I'm sick of this neighborhood

63
00:09:55,628 --> 00:09:56,492
I've gotta get out of here.

64
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:58,826
So let's get out together, okay?

65
00:11:41,167 --> 00:11:43,567
They say the discomfort index is high today.

66
00:11:46,406 --> 00:11:49,068
But I can't tell.

67
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:53,103
Just like I don't know about pleasure,

68
00:11:54,581 --> 00:11:56,344
I don't know about discomfort either.

69
00:11:58,518 --> 00:12:03,012
I'm just used to this space.

70
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:47,459
I couldn't take such humid weather before.

71
00:12:48,868 --> 00:12:51,564
But once you get used to it,
it feels comfortable.

72
00:12:54,741 --> 00:12:57,437
That's life for me.

73
00:12:59,212 --> 00:13:02,943
The fact that there's nothing for me
to do is also comfortable.

74
00:13:04,751 --> 00:13:06,616
I just have to live.

75
00:13:08,988 --> 00:13:14,756
It's okay to just feel alive every now and then

76
00:15:29,862 --> 00:15:33,821
So many fucking bills.
And no one who cares. Damnit...

77
00:19:53,793 --> 00:19:56,318
You should've told me before if it fell out

78
00:19:56,562 --> 00:19:57,893
You gotta take care of these things right away

79
00:19:58,364 --> 00:20:01,094
I fixed it good now.

80
00:20:02,068 --> 00:20:05,469
When are you going to paint this?
Soon.

81
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:17,709
Damnit! Get over here!
Oh... at it again, those crazyfools.

82
00:20:19,952 --> 00:20:23,251
Hurry, it's your move

83
00:20:23,556 --> 00:20:25,387
Why are you so slow

84
00:20:38,971 --> 00:20:41,735
What kind of move is that

85
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:45,339
Who says you're a great player, huh?
Move your 'cha, cha, '...

86
00:20:45,378 --> 00:20:48,142
What do you mean 'cha?' I win if I do this

87
00:20:52,985 --> 00:20:57,115
Give it, give it

88
00:20:57,156 --> 00:20:58,953
The girls at the teahouse in front

89
00:20:59,191 --> 00:21:00,954
they smoke really cool.

90
00:21:03,629 --> 00:21:04,960
How

91
00:21:05,197 --> 00:21:06,494
Look at you..

92
00:21:07,166 --> 00:21:11,569
But where do you hide your ciggies?
My cigarettes?

93
00:21:12,838 --> 00:21:13,964
Wo

94
00:21:14,907 --> 00:21:17,535
Plan on working at a match factory

95
00:21:17,777 --> 00:21:19,802
Let me see.
What the hell...

96
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:24,111
Damnit! I stepped on shit! Fuck

97
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:32,357
What's the ring for

98
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:36,887
You know. It's Detective Im's son's first birthday

99
00:21:37,396 --> 00:21:38,863
He has all the luck

100
00:21:39,231 --> 00:21:40,789
Gets promoted..

101
00:21:49,275 --> 00:21:50,902
You know what

102
00:21:52,011 --> 00:21:54,241
I think I'm gonna get my job back soon

103
00:21:55,781 --> 00:21:58,079
They know I took the fall for them

104
00:21:58,117 --> 00:22:00,347
that I didn't do it.

105
00:22:09,061 --> 00:22:12,326
Just wait a little.
They said they'd call me back

106
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:15,027
Our troubles are over

107
00:22:16,302 --> 00:22:19,237
We'll live like we used to

108
00:22:19,538 --> 00:22:20,937
I'm confident

109
00:22:21,574 --> 00:22:23,041
Just be patient

110
00:22:23,442 --> 00:22:26,104
We'll get out of this shitty neighborhood...

111
00:22:34,587 --> 00:22:44,155
"Who said love was beautiful..."

112
00:22:47,032 --> 00:23:00,503
"Rather, rather... Put me to sleep with
your empty hands."

113
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:18,162
I went to a friend's house yesterday

114
00:23:19,999 --> 00:23:22,593
His sister was sleeping

115
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:33,041
I put my hands under her skirt

116
00:23:36,849 --> 00:23:39,511
Crazy bastard

117
00:23:49,862 --> 00:23:52,160
Who the hell

118
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:54,588
I'll kill you

119
00:24:00,706 --> 00:24:08,044
You! It was you, right? Stupid bastard

120
00:24:12,418 --> 00:24:16,013
Look! Look! Crazy bastard... Damnit..

121
00:24:17,389 --> 00:24:18,447
Shit

122
00:25:50,716 --> 00:25:52,149
Who put this..

123
00:26:01,093 --> 00:26:03,527
Wait till I get my hands on you..

124
00:26:06,065 --> 00:26:08,898
Fresh cabbages

125
00:26:09,368 --> 00:26:12,360
Fresh cabbages from Kangwon

126
00:26:16,008 --> 00:26:18,772
If I catch the bastard,
I'll stick his head in the can.

127
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:22,543
What kind of sick pig peeks at that?
Exactly.

128
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:24,907
Hey, are you talking to us

129
00:26:25,284 --> 00:26:29,653
Mr. Park, I beg you,
change the bathroom door.

130
00:26:29,955 --> 00:26:31,445
Why me

131
00:26:32,391 --> 00:26:38,296
Plus, today's a holiday.
Why'd you come here?

132
00:26:38,831 --> 00:26:41,527
Why don't you go use your own bathroom...

133
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:44,225
I won't mention names but there's a pric

134
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:46,870
who's ruining the neighborhood

135
00:26:46,905 --> 00:26:50,602
You can't even take a dump
in our own neighborhood.

136
00:26:50,843 --> 00:26:53,368
When I catch him, I'll fuck his life up good

137
00:26:53,645 --> 00:26:56,876
What? Fuck his life up?
Don't talk like that, Ki-ok

138
00:26:56,915 --> 00:27:01,614
Fuck up his life cause he saw her take a dump

139
00:27:01,754 --> 00:27:03,984
Is that a thing to say

140
00:27:04,656 --> 00:27:08,422
I'm not being mean.
That's how the world is today.

141
00:27:08,694 --> 00:27:12,858
Say the wrong thing and they'll tear you apart

142
00:27:12,998 --> 00:27:16,263
Peeking into the bathroom,
that's a crime! A big one!

143
00:27:19,538 --> 00:27:20,596
I'm... I'm... Young-mi

144
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:24,498
What was that in the papers a few days back

145
00:27:25,277 --> 00:27:27,575
Immoral behavior?

146
00:27:27,946 --> 00:27:30,073
The thing that they're trying to set an example with?

147
00:27:30,382 --> 00:27:33,681
That's it! Immoral behavior!
Set an example.

148
00:27:33,819 --> 00:27:35,684
What? What? What'd you say

149
00:27:35,988 --> 00:27:37,353
Well, you know... l don't wanna be

150
00:27:37,389 --> 00:27:39,983
to mean living in the same neighborhood.

151
00:27:40,759 --> 00:27:44,126
But there's a bastard who doesn't seem to get it

152
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:47,528
And if that's the case,
you're part of the problem, too.

153
00:27:47,766 --> 00:27:49,791
Boy, you're so smart, aren't you

154
00:27:50,069 --> 00:27:52,162
I don't get a word you said.

155
00:27:52,204 --> 00:27:53,728
What? Set what

156
00:27:53,772 --> 00:27:57,606
Set an example!
You don't need to get it all.

157
00:27:57,843 --> 00:27:59,401
If you don't want to be dragged of

158
00:27:59,445 --> 00:28:01,208
and tortured then watch out.

159
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:03,571
It's a scary world right now

160
00:28:03,615 --> 00:28:06,311
Let's go. Peeking into the bathroom...

161
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:14,482
What? What? Torture?
Man... She's so full of herself...

162
00:29:59,598 --> 00:30:01,589
These mosquitoes are driving me crazy

163
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:09,999
Why aren't you sleeping? Come here

164
00:30:10,042 --> 00:30:11,600
I'm gonna steam some yams

165
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:13,835
Don't pee there. Go overthere

166
00:37:25,644 --> 00:37:29,410
"My love who has left me"

167
00:37:31,483 --> 00:37:36,921
"if I could only meet him today..."

168
00:37:39,624 --> 00:37:46,723
"With my tired lips, I can tell you all about it."

169
00:37:50,502 --> 00:37:52,697
Where is everybody

170
00:37:55,240 --> 00:38:02,169
"I've lived, unaware of the world."

171
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:23,931
How far are you going to follow me

172
00:38:24,269 --> 00:38:27,568
Wanna go see the circus?
I happen to have two tickets.

173
00:38:28,206 --> 00:38:29,798
No thanks

174
00:38:30,008 --> 00:38:31,942
Can I see your place?
No!

175
00:38:36,247 --> 00:38:40,343
Oh... how about tomorrow night at 8

176
00:38:40,785 --> 00:38:42,116
Okay

177
00:38:53,398 --> 00:38:56,492
"The river is flowing..."

178
00:39:13,885 --> 00:39:15,352
Cut it out

179
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:20,354
"I'm so... fucking embarrassed."

180
00:39:20,391 --> 00:39:22,291
Hey! What is that

181
00:39:22,761 --> 00:39:25,195
Do we always gotta listen to country

182
00:39:25,230 --> 00:39:27,698
Let's get some culture.

183
00:39:28,399 --> 00:39:31,095
Crazy bastard. Do you even know the title

184
00:39:33,772 --> 00:39:35,865
You making fun of me

185
00:39:36,708 --> 00:39:41,111
It was as popular as Paul Anka, Diana

186
00:39:41,513 --> 00:39:43,105
Do you even know that

187
00:39:43,915 --> 00:39:48,147
"I'm so... fucking embarrassed."

188
00:39:48,286 --> 00:39:50,311
Sure, no matter what you spit out

189
00:39:50,355 --> 00:39:52,789
no bitch here can understand you.

190
00:39:53,124 --> 00:39:56,457
We have nothing to do with English
except for 'thank you.'

191
00:39:59,130 --> 00:40:00,290
What

192
00:40:01,933 --> 00:40:03,059
What

193
00:40:03,368 --> 00:40:08,601
I'm telling you it's something like Diana

194
00:40:09,841 --> 00:40:12,708
Are you crazy? Hey

195
00:40:12,877 --> 00:40:14,469
Polka Inca, Diamond, whatever

196
00:40:14,512 --> 00:40:17,037
what the hell are you throwing at me

197
00:40:17,448 --> 00:40:21,350
Damnit... Hey! Pick that up! Pick it up

198
00:40:23,021 --> 00:40:28,254
Well... you were laughing at me... That's why..

199
00:40:38,870 --> 00:40:40,337
I'm out of here

200
00:40:40,572 --> 00:40:43,132
Hey! Where are you going

201
00:40:43,641 --> 00:40:46,769
What are the torture camps doing?
Not taking that one...

202
00:40:46,911 --> 00:40:49,778
What did you say? Bitch...

203
00:40:49,814 --> 00:40:51,247
You brat, you out of your mind

204
00:40:51,749 --> 00:40:54,616
We've a big load to send out in two days

205
00:40:55,887 --> 00:41:01,348
Did you even do your job

206
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:08,030
Kyung-chul.
Yes.

207
00:41:08,066 --> 00:41:09,863
Is this a dance hall

208
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:14,597
What are you doing

209
00:41:15,306 --> 00:41:16,534
Stop being full of yourself and

210
00:41:16,574 --> 00:41:18,542
undo these stitches, will ya?

211
00:47:50,935 --> 00:47:52,698
I'm sorry. It's just that..

212
00:47:53,004 --> 00:47:56,963
You're so beautiful.

213
00:47:57,141 --> 00:47:59,939
It was you the last time too, wasn't it?

214
00:50:13,577 --> 00:50:15,772
You always look so lonely

215
00:50:20,551 --> 00:50:25,488
Why doesn't your husband look at you

216
00:50:28,659 --> 00:50:30,650
How do you know that

217
00:50:35,466 --> 00:50:37,866
Overthere

218
00:51:03,093 --> 00:51:05,493
I'm sorry I couldn't make it last time

219
00:51:05,996 --> 00:51:08,328
I had to work overtime.

220
00:51:09,667 --> 00:51:11,760
Do you work in the factory out front

221
00:51:11,936 --> 00:51:13,164
I'm just a low-level worker right now

222
00:51:13,604 --> 00:51:15,629
but one day, I'll have my own store

223
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:19,401
I have a savings account, too. In a few years,
I'll have enough.

224
00:51:20,211 --> 00:51:23,044
I'm different from the people around here

225
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:26,311
Some thread here...
What are you doing?

226
00:51:29,620 --> 00:51:32,817
It must've gotten there at work. I had to do a lot today

227
00:51:34,425 --> 00:51:35,915
Do I have any on my back

228
00:51:36,894 --> 00:51:39,556
Yes...
Could you take them off?

229
00:51:41,832 --> 00:51:43,026
Sure

230
01:00:16,471 --> 01:00:22,467
Get that bastard! Get him

231
01:00:22,777 --> 01:00:24,176
You bastard

232
01:00:24,645 --> 01:00:28,741
Hey! Hey, you

233
01:00:29,283 --> 01:00:34,050
Grab that guy for me! You bastard

234
01:00:36,057 --> 01:00:37,046
What's wrong with you

235
01:00:40,995 --> 01:00:43,293
Get him

236
01:00:46,534 --> 01:00:50,095
Crazy bastard! Come out! Come out

237
01:00:52,907 --> 01:00:54,431
Move, you fucking bastard

238
01:00:55,643 --> 01:00:58,407
Should I kill you or cripple you, you son of a bitch

239
01:00:59,180 --> 01:01:02,741
Fucking asshole, you think you're still a cop?
Huh?

240
01:01:02,984 --> 01:01:04,611
Stinking security guard

241
01:01:12,193 --> 01:01:14,184
Don't shoot

242
01:01:15,463 --> 01:01:17,590
Don't shoot

243
01:01:18,866 --> 01:01:23,064
Calm down. Calm down.
What's wrong with everybody?

244
01:01:23,337 --> 01:01:26,329
We're neighbors. Why do this

245
01:01:26,774 --> 01:01:28,799
Calm down..

246
01:01:47,829 --> 01:01:49,228
Ki-ok, what's going on?

247
01:01:50,398 --> 01:01:52,423
Don't cry. Tell me

248
01:01:55,937 --> 01:01:59,100
Why I... I was taking a dump and

249
01:01:59,140 --> 01:02:04,601
I saw this bastard's eyes through the door.

250
01:02:05,413 --> 01:02:07,745
Fucking bastard! This is all your fault

251
01:02:07,782 --> 01:02:09,647
I told you to change the bathroom door

252
01:02:09,684 --> 01:02:11,049
And you didn't!

253
01:02:11,085 --> 01:02:12,609
What? Why is that my fault

254
01:02:13,588 --> 01:02:18,423
I lost a lot of hair, right?
I can't tell.

255
01:02:19,227 --> 01:02:24,324
You think that's all?
That dickhead tried to rape me.

256
01:02:24,365 --> 01:02:27,732
Shit! When did I

257
01:02:27,835 --> 01:02:29,860
You think I have no bitch to have that I'd do you? Fuck

258
01:02:30,638 --> 01:02:34,438
What'd you say, dick!
Why are you guys doing this?

259
01:02:34,609 --> 01:02:39,205
Fucking pisses me off when I think of lying by that shithole!

260
01:02:39,347 --> 01:02:43,306
Scum, you gotta push me down there, huh?

261
01:02:43,351 --> 01:02:44,716
Dirty pig! Fuckin' ass!

262
01:02:44,919 --> 01:02:47,683
Alright, I hear you. Let's go.

263
01:02:47,922 --> 01:02:50,117
We'll need your statement, too.

264
01:02:50,658 --> 01:02:51,818
Come on!

265
01:02:52,126 --> 01:02:53,491
Do I go too?

266
01:02:54,929 --> 01:02:56,829
Rape's a crime by complaint. Let's go.

267
01:02:56,864 --> 01:03:00,027
Wait. There's no need...

268
01:03:00,801 --> 01:03:04,259
Damnit, rape's a serious complaint.
We gotta to report it.

269
01:03:05,606 --> 01:03:10,100
Um, thanks for catching him
but you don't seem to understand.

270
01:03:10,144 --> 01:03:11,372
Pisses me off just living in the

271
01:03:11,913 --> 01:03:17,408
same neighborhood with this crazy bastard.

272
01:03:17,518 --> 01:03:18,542
But compliment? Young-mi,

273
01:03:18,586 --> 01:03:20,554
did I ever compliment this asshole?

274
01:03:20,755 --> 01:03:22,086
She never did.

275
01:03:22,323 --> 01:03:25,224
This crime is no compliment, it's not.

276
01:03:25,459 --> 01:03:27,518
Who said it was a compliment?

277
01:03:27,795 --> 01:03:29,956
I meant, you have to file a complaint.

278
01:03:29,997 --> 01:03:33,728
You get it now?
Man...

279
01:03:33,901 --> 01:03:36,870
You crazy bastard, you think this is funny?

280
01:03:37,205 --> 01:03:40,106
Enough. You see... it's hot

281
01:03:40,708 --> 01:03:42,198
and he's young, his blood boils...

282
01:03:42,243 --> 01:03:43,540
It doesn't matter.

283
01:03:43,744 --> 01:03:44,938
You, follow me. To the station.

284
01:03:44,979 --> 01:03:46,810
Ki-ok, come a little later.

285
01:04:57,952 --> 01:04:59,317
Who is it?

286
01:08:29,964 --> 01:08:32,831
Your husband seems very insecure

287
01:08:36,670 --> 01:08:41,471
But how did you two meet

288
01:08:47,615 --> 01:08:49,446
I want to know

289
01:08:52,786 --> 01:08:56,722
My father was suspected of having ties
to the student movement.

290
01:08:59,293 --> 01:09:01,352
It must've been because he let

291
01:09:02,730 --> 01:09:06,564
his students hide out in his attic.

292
01:09:12,940 --> 01:09:14,532
He had to leave the school

293
01:09:18,479 --> 01:09:21,277
And he went into hiding

294
01:11:21,402 --> 01:11:23,632
I asked my husband a few time

295
01:11:24,838 --> 01:11:26,738
but he says he doesn't know either...

296
01:11:28,208 --> 01:11:30,301
He's probably passed away

297
01:11:33,647 --> 01:11:37,208
Do you ever... want a different life

298
01:11:38,886 --> 01:11:40,786
Different

299
01:11:43,924 --> 01:11:49,191
You can leave here and go somewhere else

300
01:11:51,765 --> 01:11:54,893
It's the same everywhere

301
01:12:02,710 --> 01:12:04,905
Hide under the bed, hurry

302
01:12:04,945 --> 01:12:06,242
One second

303
01:12:09,950 --> 01:12:11,440
I'm coming

304
01:12:30,404 --> 01:12:33,237
I bought a cake. Let's eat it together

305
01:12:48,722 --> 01:12:51,555
Why is the bed so messy

306
01:12:51,592 --> 01:12:54,686
I must've moved around in my sleep

307
01:13:06,340 --> 01:13:08,308
Let's eat it tomorrow

308
01:13:16,583 --> 01:13:17,982
Sure...

309
01:13:19,186 --> 01:13:21,586
Your birthday's tomorrow anyway

310
01:13:41,542 --> 01:13:43,874
Aren't you... going to work today

311
01:13:46,313 --> 01:13:48,440
I can go in a little late

312
01:13:52,586 --> 01:13:54,451
I feel sluggish

313
01:13:57,224 --> 01:13:59,317
Just a quickie and I'll go

314
01:14:29,590 --> 01:14:31,285
What's with you today

315
01:14:32,993 --> 01:14:34,483
I'm really tired, too

316
01:17:32,973 --> 01:17:34,668
Did something happen?

317
01:17:40,213 --> 01:17:43,410
Why am I the only who got fired?

318
01:17:45,852 --> 01:17:49,151
The bastard who took more than
I did got a promotion...

319
01:17:53,894 --> 01:17:59,025
I don't think I'm getting my job back

320
01:18:01,601 --> 01:18:04,627
It sounded like I would just a while ago

321
01:18:08,542 --> 01:18:13,980
How... how did I end up this way

322
01:18:15,849 --> 01:18:17,749
Where did you hear this?

323
02:10:40,655 --> 02:10:42,748
Today at the station..

324
01:18:36,036 --> 01:18:37,936
You can't leave me..

325
01:18:38,138 --> 01:18:41,835
You do know... you're all that I have

326
01:18:44,177 --> 01:18:45,906
Do whatever you want

327
01:18:49,015 --> 01:18:50,846
Just don't leave me

328
01:18:51,551 --> 01:18:53,143
That's all

329
01:18:53,987 --> 01:18:56,956
You can do that, right

330
01:19:19,980 --> 01:19:21,572
Happy birthday

331
01:19:22,816 --> 01:19:24,443
Thank you

332
01:19:26,219 --> 01:19:27,709
Blow them out

333
01:19:39,266 --> 01:19:42,064
When did you stop ballet

334
01:19:46,573 --> 01:19:50,532
I saw your toe shoes under the bed

335
01:19:53,446 --> 01:19:55,175
In high school

336
01:19:57,918 --> 01:20:01,581
I've never seen the ballet

337
01:20:02,289 --> 01:20:07,124
I'd like to see you dancing once wearing a tut

338
01:20:21,041 --> 01:20:22,872
Open wide

339
01:20:27,214 --> 01:20:32,516
Not like that. Open wide. Like this

340
01:20:57,477 --> 01:21:02,346
Actually, I'm wanted

341
01:21:05,885 --> 01:21:07,512
It doesn't matter

342
01:21:12,158 --> 01:21:15,855
I was going to leave once things settled down

343
01:21:16,796 --> 01:21:18,195
But I've lost all contact

344
01:21:18,732 --> 01:21:20,723
My friends must've been all arrested

345
01:21:22,302 --> 01:21:25,567
I don't think I can stay here

346
01:21:30,543 --> 01:21:36,106
I have to leave here soon

347
01:21:41,921 --> 01:21:43,354
Come with me

348
01:22:10,417 --> 01:22:12,078
Is she seeing someone these days

349
01:22:12,385 --> 01:22:15,252
Hey, looking good today!
Where are you going?

350
01:22:15,622 --> 01:22:16,714
Whatever

351
01:22:18,358 --> 01:22:20,690
What a snot! Fine..

352
01:22:27,200 --> 01:22:31,967
Oh, you're home. I knew you'd be

353
01:22:32,806 --> 01:22:37,266
Wow, it's nice out today.
Let's go downtown together.

354
01:22:38,011 --> 01:22:41,105
I know a great place.
Their pork cutlet's really good.

355
01:22:41,147 --> 01:22:43,911
Let's go. My treat. Come on.

356
01:22:44,084 --> 01:22:47,349
I have to get my laundry
and I have a lot to do...

357
01:22:57,263 --> 01:22:59,823
Sorry. Let's go next time.

358
01:23:01,768 --> 01:23:03,497
Are you really gonna be like this?

359
01:23:20,854 --> 01:23:26,087
Young-mi, this is for your own good.

360
01:23:26,693 --> 01:23:32,598
He's going to hurt you.

361
01:23:32,799 --> 01:23:34,824
Ki-ok, leave me alone.

362
01:23:36,102 --> 01:23:39,936
Hey. I'm looking out for you.

363
01:23:40,940 --> 01:23:44,376
Do you know what kind of guy he is? Do you?

364
01:23:45,278 --> 01:23:47,838
Oh, Young-mi...

365
01:23:48,615 --> 01:23:52,073
I'm begging you, don't worry about me.
You bug me.

366
01:23:52,685 --> 01:23:53,652
Hey

367
01:23:55,121 --> 01:23:56,679
You know what?

368
01:23:57,757 --> 01:24:02,785
Taking someone else's girl is the best.

369
01:24:03,563 --> 01:24:07,465
When you having so much fun, it makes you blind,

370
01:24:07,600 --> 01:24:08,794
get it?

371
01:24:09,269 --> 01:24:10,634
What are you saying?

372
01:24:10,937 --> 01:24:15,169
What I mean is...
Hello.

373
01:24:16,276 --> 01:24:18,369
You've waited long for today.

374
01:24:18,411 --> 01:24:19,469
Yes. Today, let's get plastered.

375
01:24:19,813 --> 01:24:22,304
I'm treating big tonight, okay?

376
01:24:24,584 --> 01:24:27,985
Bastard, when are you not plastered?

377
01:24:28,154 --> 01:24:29,849
I'm trying to have a serious talk

378
01:24:30,223 --> 01:24:33,090
Let's get plastered again, my ass..

379
01:24:33,426 --> 01:24:37,487
Come on, Ki-ok... I'm treating

380
01:24:37,764 --> 01:24:40,358
You gonna be that way, huh?

381
01:24:40,800 --> 01:24:44,600
Hey, aren't you spending too much?

382
01:24:45,538 --> 01:24:49,269
What do you mean too much?
It's just a few bottles.

383
01:24:49,742 --> 01:24:51,141
I just gotta work 20 days to make

384
01:24:51,444 --> 01:24:53,469
what a guy usually makes in a month

385
01:24:53,847 --> 01:24:58,147
10 bucks a day? If I wanted to,
I can make 15, 15.

386
01:24:58,384 --> 01:25:00,477
Alright, big shot

387
01:25:01,087 --> 01:25:09,324
Young-mi, oh...
"I'm so your... and you so... It's, I..."

388
01:25:10,129 --> 01:25:14,930
Hey, is that the only song you know

389
01:25:15,068 --> 01:25:17,002
Why are you hitting me

390
01:25:17,170 --> 01:25:19,695
Man, sing another one

391
01:25:19,939 --> 01:25:22,237
I've heard that so many times

392
01:25:22,275 --> 01:25:23,799
I can sing it better. Sing something else

393
01:25:24,077 --> 01:25:26,910
Then you do one. Do one. Go ahead

394
01:25:26,946 --> 01:25:28,379
Me

395
01:25:28,515 --> 01:25:31,678
Go ahead, go ahead.
Sure. I'll do one.

396
01:25:36,689 --> 01:25:47,998
"Oh... I'm so your..."

397
01:25:55,508 --> 01:25:58,773
Hey, you gotta watch me at least!

398
01:25:58,811 --> 01:26:00,506
Oh, okay, okay. Nice, nice.

399
01:26:00,547 --> 01:26:08,977
"I'm so... can't stop me... Night of Shilla..."

400
01:26:09,188 --> 01:26:14,251
Look, look, you're shaking your squid leg too much

401
01:26:38,017 --> 01:26:43,080
I... leave tomorrow.

402
01:26:47,727 --> 01:26:52,790
It's not like I was a core member of the movement.

403
01:26:54,367 --> 01:26:58,770
I participated after watching my friends get hurt

404
01:27:01,140 --> 01:27:03,131
and then went on the run.

405
01:27:11,484 --> 01:27:17,445
I've been really happy.

406
01:27:21,394 --> 01:27:25,194
I haven't been any help to you, Sang-ho...

407
01:27:28,001 --> 01:27:32,529
It was short but I was happy

408
01:27:33,573 --> 01:27:35,803
to share a moment of freedom.

409
01:27:49,522 --> 01:27:51,922
I'll never forget you

410
01:27:56,095 --> 01:27:56,857
Mr. Im!
Yes?

411
01:27:57,063 --> 01:27:59,031
Come on over. Good work in this heat. Here,
take a swig.

412
01:27:59,399 --> 01:28:00,229
Thanks

413
01:28:01,567 --> 01:28:05,469
Really cool, don't you think? For you..

414
01:28:06,739 --> 01:28:10,698
Okay, Young-mi.
I'll tell you a fun puzzle, puzzle.

415
01:28:34,634 --> 01:28:38,126
"My love cries while holding me...

416
01:28:38,404 --> 01:28:42,932
Don't stop me from leaving..."

417
01:28:43,142 --> 01:28:47,772
Stop the sun from setting!
Oh, oh... what to do?

418
01:28:50,917 --> 01:28:57,288
Trouble ahead, an enemy, an enemy..

419
01:28:57,990 --> 01:29:00,857
An enemy, an enemy..

420
01:29:02,228 --> 01:29:12,035
A parting... He who makes a part in

421
01:29:14,407 --> 01:29:19,037
We are enemies..

422
01:29:22,381 --> 01:29:32,188
Others ask me to go. My love holds me fast

423
01:29:33,392 --> 01:29:36,156
When I see you, I don't like it

424
01:29:37,029 --> 01:29:40,430
When I don't see you, I hate it.

425
01:29:41,300 --> 01:29:44,531
I shouldn't have had..

426
01:29:44,771 --> 01:29:51,643
I didn't know you..

427
01:29:51,978 --> 01:29:58,406
Now that I think about it, I want to know..

428
01:29:58,951 --> 01:30:04,082
A sign at the end of my thoughts

429
01:30:04,824 --> 01:30:11,252
Night and day, my troubles are endless

430
01:30:11,631 --> 01:30:18,594
I'd rather..

431
01:30:18,938 --> 01:30:25,537
You die first and I'll take you..

432
01:30:25,578 --> 01:30:36,682
When I see you, I don't like it.

433
01:31:29,942 --> 01:31:31,375
No, no

434
01:31:31,410 --> 01:31:37,280
When I don't see you, I hate it.

435
01:31:37,617 --> 01:31:41,451
I shouldn't have had..

436
01:31:41,754 --> 01:31:46,555
I...

437
01:32:49,455 --> 01:32:51,184
Why

438
01:32:55,461 --> 01:32:58,055
I never stopped lovin

439
01:33:01,067 --> 01:33:02,694
you even for a moment.

440
01:33:05,304 --> 01:33:07,272
So why did you

441
01:33:10,343 --> 01:33:11,503
Love

442
01:33:12,578 --> 01:33:16,708
You... took me when I was in high school.

443
01:33:16,749 --> 01:33:18,649
A girl lost herfather

444
01:33:20,453 --> 01:33:23,217
And you forced her legs apart.

445
01:33:23,756 --> 01:33:25,951
Is that what you call love

446
01:33:31,097 --> 01:33:33,622
Then you never loved me

447
01:33:35,434 --> 01:33:37,493
Not even for a moment

448
01:35:40,392 --> 01:35:44,226
In the end, it all ended like

449
01:35:44,263 --> 01:35:46,163
that because of my jealousy.

450
01:35:49,735 --> 01:35:52,704
I didn't know something so big would happen

451
01:35:54,373 --> 01:35:56,534
I really didn't know

452
01:35:59,545 --> 01:36:03,538
Then what about Jin-woo's mother?

453
01:39:05,097 --> 01:39:09,534
Jin-woo, stand there. Jin-woo... Look here...

454
01:39:09,568 --> 01:39:15,598
To comfort Young-mi, I even took you in

455
01:39:16,041 --> 01:39:18,737
like she wanted but it was no use.

456
01:39:20,279 --> 01:39:22,110
Without Young-mi,

457
01:39:25,851 --> 01:39:33,257
I didn't have the guts to raise you all alone.

458
01:39:42,201 --> 01:39:44,761
But now... to see you are grown-up

459
01:39:46,004 --> 01:39:48,666
It makes me feel better.

460
01:39:55,748 --> 01:40:00,185
Um, I have something for you

461
01:40:11,930 --> 01:40:16,890
This is all that your mom left you

462
01:40:44,963 --> 01:40:50,526
Will you forgive me, Jin-woo

463
01:40:51,170 --> 01:40:58,201
You will, won't you? Jin-woo..

464
01:40:59,077 --> 01:41:01,807
Jin-woo..
