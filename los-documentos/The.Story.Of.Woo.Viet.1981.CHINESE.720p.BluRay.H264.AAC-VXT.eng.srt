1
00:01:25,544 --> 00:01:27,910
Lap quan, I am wu viet!

2
00:01:29,464 --> 00:01:31,000
I will be leaving Saigon tomorrow.

3
00:01:31,216 --> 00:01:32,752
I am going as a refugee to Hong Kong.

4
00:01:34,052 --> 00:01:36,384
I do not know if you will get this letter.

5
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:39,425
I have not written to you for a few years,

6
00:01:40,601 --> 00:01:43,121
and I do not know if you have
changed your address in Hong Kong.

7
00:01:43,854 --> 00:01:46,436
I was in the army
for the last several years, fighting.

8
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:49,063
I was home several times on vacations

9
00:01:49,443 --> 00:01:51,024
and I had read the letters you sent.

10
00:01:53,155 --> 00:01:55,487
I am not so sure
you will recognize me though...

11
00:01:57,909 --> 00:01:58,909
What is she doing?

12
00:02:00,871 --> 00:02:01,871
She is tired.

13
00:02:02,164 --> 00:02:03,700
I'm going to sleep too.

14
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:06,125
Sleep.

15
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:26,370
What is wrong? Are you not feeling well?

16
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:27,563
Nothing,

17
00:02:28,649 --> 00:02:29,649
we are in Hong Kong!

18
00:03:04,976 --> 00:03:07,513
Everybody go over there,

19
00:03:09,564 --> 00:03:10,564
slowly and in order.

20
00:03:22,285 --> 00:03:23,024
Over there.

21
00:03:23,078 --> 00:03:24,409
Sit down and wash your hair.

22
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:27,487
One after one.

23
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:32,868
Wu viet... wu viet!

24
00:03:33,755 --> 00:03:35,120
Wu viet...

25
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:39,087
Wu viet... wu viet...

26
00:03:40,137 --> 00:03:41,673
Wu viet...

27
00:03:42,597 --> 00:03:43,837
Wu viet...

28
00:03:45,684 --> 00:03:47,970
- Lap quan, Lee lap quan!
- Wu viet

29
00:03:48,562 --> 00:03:50,268
Lee lap quan - wu viet...

30
00:03:50,522 --> 00:03:54,686
- Lee lap quan!
- Wu viet... wu viet!

31
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:56,975
I never would have believed that

32
00:03:56,987 --> 00:03:58,693
I am going to meet you here.

33
00:03:59,114 --> 00:04:00,650
I nearly could not recognize you.

34
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:02,280
I got your letter

35
00:04:02,284 --> 00:04:03,990
and I had been waiting here every day.

36
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:07,657
- My telephone number is 382567
- Go and wash your hair

37
00:04:07,748 --> 00:04:08,783
I will wait.

38
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:10,155
- What?
- Wash your hair!

39
00:04:10,167 --> 00:04:11,748
382567

40
00:04:11,877 --> 00:04:14,163
I know, 382567

41
00:04:14,296 --> 00:04:15,752
call me

42
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:18,504
remember to look me up

43
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:31,556
Ritz theatre shows what kind of films?

44
00:04:32,898 --> 00:04:33,898
Hollywood movies.

45
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:35,855
Where is tai Kong theatre?

46
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:37,933
Governor fong street

47
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:52,875
Are you wu viet?

48
00:04:52,918 --> 00:04:53,918
Yes.

49
00:05:00,217 --> 00:05:01,047
How do you do

50
00:05:01,051 --> 00:05:02,051
how do you do...

51
00:05:03,929 --> 00:05:05,209
Come, help me with these things.

52
00:05:08,183 --> 00:05:09,844
Vietnam sausages...

53
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:15,353
And oranges.

54
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:26,700
Thank you!

55
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:28,449
You are really wu viet?

56
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:29,453
Yes!

57
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:31,865
Did you come alone?

58
00:05:32,207 --> 00:05:33,476
There were quite a few people in the boat.

59
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,491
No, I mean in your family.

60
00:05:35,502 --> 00:05:37,538
Yes, I am alone.

61
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:44,754
I have to go now, I will
see you again, bye!

62
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:26,837
Why do we have to go to the states?

63
00:06:27,596 --> 00:06:28,596
You are going to school.

64
00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:30,754
I will follow you?

65
00:06:31,182 --> 00:06:35,425
Alright, what is in the bag?

66
00:06:36,563 --> 00:06:39,600
My picture with my mother.

67
00:06:39,858 --> 00:06:43,521
My aunt made me these clothes,

68
00:06:43,904 --> 00:06:47,647
and 3 note books.

69
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:53,208
I wonder what is going to happen
to those people on the deserted island.

70
00:06:59,461 --> 00:07:00,701
In our boat,

71
00:07:00,712 --> 00:07:03,328
I saw 2 people driven
into the sea by the spy.

72
00:07:03,882 --> 00:07:04,917
We are lucky.

73
00:07:05,467 --> 00:07:07,708
It'll be terrible if we had land
and then get killed.

74
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:09,762
They are alright.

75
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:11,295
I'm not alright,

76
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:15,219
I saw they dump those people in the sea.

77
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:17,593
You can be a witness.

78
00:07:18,772 --> 00:07:20,933
But I didn't see their face.

79
00:07:24,361 --> 00:07:25,361
Let's be careful.

80
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:42,579
It is all over so fast.

81
00:07:43,213 --> 00:07:45,044
We can do without money,

82
00:07:45,757 --> 00:07:47,839
but we're finished without a country.

83
00:07:50,512 --> 00:07:51,912
How long have you lived in vietham?

84
00:07:52,973 --> 00:07:54,304
3 generations!

85
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:57,842
You must have made quite a bit
at the army supply store.

86
00:07:58,645 --> 00:08:02,479
It's all over now,
I don't have anything anymore.

87
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:05,682
Everything will be alright,

88
00:08:06,695 --> 00:08:07,695
stop worrying.

89
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:10,422
I am worried about those special agents.

90
00:08:11,616 --> 00:08:13,948
Because I saw them
dumping a woman into the sea.

91
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:18,620
Have some rest now,
and let me know if there is anything!

92
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:22,078
Alright, you sleep first.

93
00:08:39,102 --> 00:08:40,137
What would you like to drink?

94
00:08:40,145 --> 00:08:40,975
Sugar cane juice.

95
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:42,289
- What about you?
- Sugar cane juice.

96
00:08:42,313 --> 00:08:44,099
2 sugar cane juice please.

97
00:08:44,107 --> 00:08:45,107
Coming.

98
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:50,225
This place is just like Vietnam.

99
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:52,987
I come here often
to talk to those ex-convicts.

100
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:56,149
I am a social worker.

101
00:08:58,872 --> 00:08:59,872
Drink up!

102
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:17,973
Your son?

103
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:20,886
His father was killed by the pirates.

104
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:30,816
These are the letters I tried to send you,

105
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:40,193
No one would lay down their gun

106
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:43,868
and write letters in the front line.

107
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:47,700
People tried their best

108
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:52,140
to stay away from flying
bullets at the time.

109
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:55,257
I had tried to write several times.

110
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:56,880
But I'd torn them all up.

111
00:09:57,639 --> 00:09:58,639
Why?

112
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:03,083
I was afraid that by the time
you received them, I'd be dead.

113
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:09,305
Listening to a dead man bring bad luck.

114
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:14,273
When I visited you at the camp last time,
did I look crazy?

115
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:17,021
I am not that innocent

116
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:19,781
what are you like?

117
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:23,658
When a person has been working too long,
she gets a little slow in the head.

118
00:10:25,542 --> 00:10:26,657
You are not different.

119
00:10:29,254 --> 00:10:31,336
You look different from your photograph.

120
00:10:33,216 --> 00:10:35,656
People will look different
after they'd killed so many people.

121
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:38,255
Actually, you don't look too good.

122
00:10:39,931 --> 00:10:42,409
My friend sleeping next to me
was strangled to death last night.

123
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:43,468
Who did it?

124
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:44,476
Special agents.

125
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:46,055
Why do they have to kill him?

126
00:10:46,229 --> 00:10:47,594
Special agents are spy.

127
00:10:47,856 --> 00:10:49,266
If you knows their secret,

128
00:10:49,524 --> 00:10:50,889
they will kill you.

129
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:51,900
Did you see it?

130
00:10:53,236 --> 00:10:54,442
Go and tell the police, quick.

131
00:10:56,865 --> 00:10:58,105
This is very confusing.

132
00:10:58,575 --> 00:11:00,695
All vietnamese are the same
in the eyes of the police.

133
00:11:01,411 --> 00:11:02,651
What are you going to do?

134
00:11:03,204 --> 00:11:04,740
The nightmare will end if I kill him.

135
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:06,559
Aren't you afraid
they might not let you go to the states?

136
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:08,223
I won't be able to go anyway if I'm dead.

137
00:11:11,963 --> 00:11:13,323
I have to go back to the camp now.

138
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:16,251
Can you remember my phone number?

139
00:11:16,259 --> 00:11:17,259
I remember.

140
00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:19,004
Do you know your way?

141
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:20,012
Yes!

142
00:11:21,973 --> 00:11:22,973
Don't do anything silly.

143
00:13:33,396 --> 00:13:36,980
What's happening? Why so noisy?
Let's go and see.

144
00:13:37,025 --> 00:13:42,395
I need a 'p', but it's so dark!

145
00:13:46,617 --> 00:13:49,859
Be a good boy, I've something to do,
you go by yourself!

146
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:30,150
Hello... I'm coming over right now!

147
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:05,444
How come there is nothing?

148
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:09,694
All political matters are covered up,
it is not so unusual.

149
00:15:21,379 --> 00:15:23,139
I don't know if you would
like to eat those.

150
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:39,062
Who?

151
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:41,766
Fast food delivery, open up!

152
00:15:41,983 --> 00:15:42,813
We didn't order any fast food.

153
00:15:42,817 --> 00:15:44,682
I am sorry, wrong room.

154
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:52,772
You don't have to be so nervous.

155
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:54,866
If I was not careful,

156
00:15:54,871 --> 00:15:56,751
I'd have been killed by
the Vietcong last time!

157
00:15:58,624 --> 00:15:59,744
I cannot stay here too long.

158
00:16:00,918 --> 00:16:03,375
I can find you a phoney passport.

159
00:16:12,555 --> 00:16:13,555
Wong!

160
00:16:17,477 --> 00:16:18,557
I didn't do anything wrong.

161
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:21,306
No, you didn't, but can you help me?

162
00:16:21,314 --> 00:16:22,314
Talk!

163
00:16:22,732 --> 00:16:24,438
I want you to get me a phoney passport.

164
00:16:25,109 --> 00:16:27,069
You told me to associate myself
with those people.

165
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,185
I want you to contact them now.

166
00:16:31,073 --> 00:16:32,073
It'll be very expensive.

167
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:34,488
The important thing is
to have the right connections.

168
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:37,230
I will only introduce you to them.

169
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:41,865
You want to smuggle into the United States?
What for?

170
00:16:44,504 --> 00:16:46,369
You got me involved.

171
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:48,166
And I want to know the truth!

172
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:51,384
I killed someone!

173
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:52,712
1st degree or manslaughter?

174
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:55,639
I killed a special agent!

175
00:16:57,350 --> 00:17:00,558
They deserve it.
Alright, I'll help you. 100,000 dollars.

176
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:03,643
I don't have so much money.

177
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:05,646
It's not easy to go to the United States.

178
00:17:06,317 --> 00:17:08,524
Put it this way, I'll sat it one more time.

179
00:17:09,237 --> 00:17:11,273
Take it or leave it.

180
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:14,776
Expenses are necessary.

181
00:17:14,784 --> 00:17:16,695
And there's no way you can do without.

182
00:17:17,245 --> 00:17:18,781
Pay the 30,000 first.

183
00:17:19,247 --> 00:17:21,863
The 70,000 you can pay
after you got to U.S.A.

184
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:24,290
And found work in Chinatown.

185
00:17:27,255 --> 00:17:28,745
I'll think about it.

186
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:30,254
You have no choice.

187
00:17:30,758 --> 00:17:32,918
Talk to your girl-friend and
try to whip up the 30,000.

188
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:37,132
Someone will tell you to come
to learn Japanese in a few days.

189
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:40,214
Try to say "my home is
in kyushu" in Japanese.

190
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:44,056
My home is in kyushu.

191
00:17:44,814 --> 00:17:46,054
Not bad.

192
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:47,475
If you can't ever speak Japanese.

193
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:49,690
How can you pretend to be
a Japanese in going to U.S.A.

194
00:17:49,694 --> 00:17:52,254
If worse comes to worst,
use a combination of chuchow & Japanese.

195
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:55,156
It's your turn.

196
00:18:00,997 --> 00:18:05,582
My home...

197
00:18:11,007 --> 00:18:13,794
You'll make it worst
if you don't concentrate, try again.

198
00:18:16,137 --> 00:18:17,137
Damn bastard.

199
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:20,880
What did you say?

200
00:18:21,267 --> 00:18:22,267
I don't understand.

201
00:18:24,562 --> 00:18:26,644
My home is in kyushu.

202
00:18:26,814 --> 00:18:31,808
Stop fussing, listen to me,
my home is in kyushu.

203
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:37,651
My... home... in... kyushu.

204
00:18:39,035 --> 00:18:40,400
My home is in kyushu.

205
00:18:40,703 --> 00:18:41,863
Are you from Vietnam?

206
00:18:42,288 --> 00:18:43,288
Yes!

207
00:18:43,331 --> 00:18:47,324
I'll teach you one more sentence,
"my home is in saikwok".

208
00:19:04,894 --> 00:19:05,894
No thanks!

209
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:07,885
I thought you liked it!

210
00:19:10,733 --> 00:19:11,597
How long have you been here?

211
00:19:11,609 --> 00:19:12,609
Very long.

212
00:19:13,861 --> 00:19:16,022
We've been waiting so long,
let's use the stair-case!

213
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:21,826
I go with you!

214
00:19:23,371 --> 00:19:25,032
Didn't you want to leave with me?

215
00:19:31,545 --> 00:19:32,785
Is your home near? Yes!

216
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:36,505
Are you free now? I want
to show you a place.

217
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:38,340
I don't like crowded places.

218
00:19:38,928 --> 00:19:40,259
The place is not crowded.

219
00:19:40,262 --> 00:19:42,253
A little bit dark maybe,
many flowers for sale.

220
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:44,008
Don't you afraid of darkness?

221
00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:45,892
I am used to it!

222
00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:04,744
Go over there!

223
00:20:33,774 --> 00:20:34,774
Is it interesting?

224
00:20:35,568 --> 00:20:36,568
It is interesting.

225
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:42,096
Why do you want to go to the states?

226
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,080
Because I want to make a living.
What about you?

227
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:53,074
One of my former customers
had emigrated to the U.S.A.

228
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:54,746
And he wanted me to go no matter
how much money he has to spend.

229
00:20:54,754 --> 00:20:55,539
That's why you go!

230
00:20:55,546 --> 00:20:58,879
Yes. And I have no relative in Hong Kong,
life is so boring.

231
00:21:03,471 --> 00:21:04,991
Buy some, these flowers are so pretty.

232
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:11,100
Take your time and choose!

233
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,200
Stop running...

234
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:33,208
Stop!

235
00:21:44,762 --> 00:21:46,502
Please... let us go... let us go...

236
00:21:57,233 --> 00:21:58,233
Sit!

237
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:02,355
How did it go? Was the movie popular?

238
00:22:02,363 --> 00:22:06,777
Not bad, are there any actors?

239
00:22:06,784 --> 00:22:07,784
Yes!

240
00:22:24,844 --> 00:22:26,175
Don't buy me anything.

241
00:22:27,638 --> 00:22:31,096
I didn't buy them for you. I bought
them so that you'll look lik Japanese.

242
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:47,061
Where is the location to gather?

243
00:22:50,327 --> 00:22:51,327
I can't tell you.

244
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:05,338
I know these things have to keep in secret.

245
00:23:05,342 --> 00:23:06,548
Don't worry about it.

246
00:23:08,554 --> 00:23:10,434
I'll pay you back the money
as soon as possible.

247
00:23:11,599 --> 00:23:12,599
Have I ever said that?

248
00:23:19,315 --> 00:23:21,852
No, I feel bad about it.

249
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:23,394
Feel bad?

250
00:23:25,154 --> 00:23:26,954
I seldom know what the
right thing to say is.

251
00:23:28,866 --> 00:23:31,073
When you arrive,
will you really live in Chinatown?

252
00:23:33,329 --> 00:23:34,969
I'll think of something when I get there.

253
00:23:36,916 --> 00:23:39,749
If you're in trouble, will you look me up?

254
00:23:41,921 --> 00:23:43,081
I'm afraid I won't have time.

255
00:23:56,936 --> 00:23:59,018
Li lap quan, shum ching.

256
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:01,940
Sorry!

257
00:24:07,738 --> 00:24:09,399
She is also using a phoney passport.

258
00:24:11,075 --> 00:24:13,282
She comes here to meet...

259
00:24:21,043 --> 00:24:22,328
Is everything packed?

260
00:24:22,795 --> 00:24:23,795
Everything is packed!

261
00:24:26,382 --> 00:24:27,838
What about the letters I gave you?

262
00:24:27,841 --> 00:24:28,841
They're here.

263
00:24:30,219 --> 00:24:32,419
It's more convenient
if you let me to keep them for you.

264
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:33,585
It's alright!

265
00:24:33,597 --> 00:24:34,597
It's not alright.

266
00:24:42,231 --> 00:24:43,892
I'd carried them to war before.

267
00:24:47,736 --> 00:24:48,816
And I never get killed.

268
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:05,460
I won't go to see you off.

269
00:25:07,464 --> 00:25:08,464
I'll write to you.

270
00:25:10,384 --> 00:25:11,384
Alright!

271
00:25:24,857 --> 00:25:26,188
You might need money over there.

272
00:25:57,681 --> 00:25:58,761
Your girlfriend?

273
00:25:59,725 --> 00:26:00,725
Pen-friend!

274
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:04,521
Are you afraid that
we might not be able to leave?

275
00:26:04,605 --> 00:26:06,095
I am not afraid, are you?

276
00:26:08,192 --> 00:26:09,728
Neither am I.

277
00:27:12,673 --> 00:27:13,673
You two follow me!

278
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:25,091
You follow me! You sit down here!

279
00:27:31,358 --> 00:27:34,816
When I get to the states,
I won't go and look up that jerk.

280
00:27:35,696 --> 00:27:37,186
He gave you the money to go.

281
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:41,027
I'll spend a day with him
and I'll look you up in Chinatown.

282
00:27:43,203 --> 00:27:44,283
I'll go with you.

283
00:27:46,623 --> 00:27:47,623
Alright!

284
00:27:55,841 --> 00:27:58,503
Excuse me, may I borrow a light? Thank you!

285
00:28:02,181 --> 00:28:03,181
Thank you!

286
00:28:49,686 --> 00:28:53,429
Shum ching! Shum ching!

287
00:28:58,403 --> 00:28:59,403
Shum ching!

288
00:29:04,117 --> 00:29:05,117
Shum ching!

289
00:29:12,167 --> 00:29:13,282
The male lavatory is there.

290
00:29:22,469 --> 00:29:24,881
My pants are all wet, how can I see people?

291
00:29:26,098 --> 00:29:27,213
Where is the girl?

292
00:29:29,017 --> 00:29:30,052
Chinatown!

293
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:31,060
Why?

294
00:29:31,728 --> 00:29:33,935
Bu... business...

295
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,400
Bring him inside.

296
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:35,833
Take me to Chinatown.

297
00:30:52,768 --> 00:30:53,768
My friend!

298
00:31:31,098 --> 00:31:33,931
No reason not to go to the states
because of one woman.

299
00:31:54,413 --> 00:31:55,413
Thank you.

300
00:32:07,467 --> 00:32:09,267
Don't believe that I'll
kill you in one shot.

301
00:32:09,511 --> 00:32:10,796
I'll kill very slowly.

302
00:32:10,804 --> 00:32:12,544
Like the viet-congs like to do.

303
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:33,944
Why don't you dance?

304
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:34,952
I want to see youe boss!

305
00:32:39,666 --> 00:32:40,701
Call mr.Chung.

306
00:32:45,547 --> 00:32:46,787
Mr.chung is not here.

307
00:32:48,842 --> 00:32:49,842
Call migual...

308
00:32:51,178 --> 00:32:52,258
Call migual...

309
00:32:53,054 --> 00:32:54,134
Call migual...

310
00:32:58,310 --> 00:33:00,426
Migual...

311
00:33:02,772 --> 00:33:06,264
Migual...

312
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:17,242
Migual...

313
00:36:34,693 --> 00:36:36,649
Why don't you have the lights on?

314
00:36:36,861 --> 00:36:37,941
Are you the boss?

315
00:36:40,907 --> 00:36:41,907
My name is chung!

316
00:36:42,826 --> 00:36:43,826
Where is the shum ching?

317
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:47,280
Put down your gun and we'll talk!

318
00:36:47,288 --> 00:36:48,288
Talk!

319
00:36:50,166 --> 00:36:52,908
What you wanted is a
woman, not her dead body.

320
00:36:53,962 --> 00:36:57,295
Given if you have your gun pointed
at my head and ask me to let her go.

321
00:36:58,133 --> 00:37:00,419
You won't be able to leave Chinatown.

322
00:37:01,261 --> 00:37:02,171
Migual!

323
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:03,881
Mr. chung is back.

324
00:37:06,683 --> 00:37:09,390
You put away your gun and follow me.

325
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:34,460
Please sit down!

326
00:37:45,597 --> 00:37:47,428
I heard you're hold out for 2 hours,

327
00:37:48,808 --> 00:37:49,808
have a drink first.

328
00:37:51,603 --> 00:37:52,603
Where is the shum ching?

329
00:37:54,981 --> 00:37:57,017
Have a drink first, put away your gun.

330
00:37:57,442 --> 00:38:00,525
I won't be able to talk to you like this.

331
00:38:08,411 --> 00:38:09,617
What is your name?

332
00:38:10,914 --> 00:38:11,914
Wu viet!

333
00:38:12,874 --> 00:38:15,456
Wu & viet, aren't you Chinese?

334
00:38:15,794 --> 00:38:17,000
Vietnamese Chinese.

335
00:38:17,879 --> 00:38:19,559
What is your relationship with shum ching?

336
00:38:21,925 --> 00:38:22,925
Friend!

337
00:38:23,593 --> 00:38:24,593
Friend!

338
00:38:27,388 --> 00:38:28,628
I'd promised to look after her.

339
00:38:30,642 --> 00:38:33,884
Have you always fulfilled
all your promises?

340
00:38:37,398 --> 00:38:38,808
Now I understand.

341
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:40,359
Understand what?

342
00:38:41,778 --> 00:38:44,394
If you can't do it, you can't do it.

343
00:38:48,701 --> 00:38:52,569
I suspect that you must have injured
or killed a philippine policeman.

344
00:38:53,206 --> 00:38:55,663
Because you're smuggled on a plane.

345
00:38:56,417 --> 00:38:57,953
You couldn't have a gun.

346
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:02,833
And you've come here from the airport.

347
00:39:03,758 --> 00:39:06,591
The gun must be taken from the police.

348
00:39:07,303 --> 00:39:09,168
I'll only need to make one phone call

349
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:11,341
to prove my theory.

350
00:39:13,059 --> 00:39:15,766
I know you're using a phoney passport,

351
00:39:16,646 --> 00:39:18,477
that's not a problem.

352
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:21,518
But injuring a policeman,

353
00:39:21,985 --> 00:39:25,944
the penalty for injuring
or killing a police is severe here.

354
00:39:26,948 --> 00:39:30,691
You're lucky to be sitting here.

355
00:39:31,077 --> 00:39:33,739
Because you're Chinese,

356
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:38,369
I am Chinese and he is Chinese.

357
00:39:39,836 --> 00:39:41,042
You've got guts.

358
00:39:41,838 --> 00:39:43,829
You've got yourself a stable job here.

359
00:39:44,883 --> 00:39:47,215
I'll use your salary
to get you a phoney passport.

360
00:39:47,927 --> 00:39:49,713
And then you'll be free
to go after a while!

361
00:39:51,014 --> 00:39:53,551
What about shum ching? I won't go alone.

362
00:39:54,517 --> 00:39:56,382
This you'll have to make clear,

363
00:39:56,853 --> 00:39:59,185
we bought shum ching with our money.

364
00:39:59,647 --> 00:40:02,389
And she does what we tell her to do.

365
00:40:03,484 --> 00:40:04,940
But I can promise you.

366
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:06,643
No one will touch her.

367
00:40:07,822 --> 00:40:08,902
I'll have to take her away.

368
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:12,698
Then you'll need to
have enough money to redeem her.

369
00:40:15,038 --> 00:40:16,078
What do you want me to do?

370
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:19,747
I'll let you know.

371
00:40:20,084 --> 00:40:23,576
What I'd promise, consider it done.

372
00:40:24,923 --> 00:40:27,039
Tell chum ching that I'm here.

373
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:30,462
You'll talk to her yourself
when you meet her!

374
00:40:31,012 --> 00:40:33,503
Ah sarin, take Mr. wu to his room.

375
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:38,181
Give me the gun.

376
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:46,687
Remember, don't leave Chinatown.

377
00:40:48,196 --> 00:40:52,189
Don't go looking for shum ching,
you won't find her.

378
00:44:09,397 --> 00:44:10,637
He is a man.

379
00:44:14,402 --> 00:44:15,767
His boyfriend dumped him.

380
00:44:17,238 --> 00:44:19,524
That's why he's looking everywhere
for his boyfriend.

381
00:44:20,658 --> 00:44:24,526
Nobody minds him,
he'll sing for a while and then leave.

382
00:44:34,297 --> 00:44:37,460
Mr. chung knew you're a bit tight with
money and wants you to have these.

383
00:44:43,598 --> 00:44:49,468
This money will be enough
for a few cans of beer but not woman.

384
00:44:54,483 --> 00:44:55,768
I don't want beer now.

385
00:45:03,075 --> 00:45:08,411
I only drink rice wine
but they've hard to find.

386
00:45:27,141 --> 00:45:28,176
Adios.

387
00:46:08,683 --> 00:46:09,683
Ah viet!

388
00:46:13,187 --> 00:46:16,896
Add some water and sugar
but not too much coconut juice.

389
00:46:16,899 --> 00:46:18,560
The boss does not want to waste anything.

390
00:46:19,485 --> 00:46:21,396
Go up and see what the
customers want to drink.

391
00:47:57,541 --> 00:47:58,656
Ah viet!

392
00:48:38,624 --> 00:48:39,363
Shy?

393
00:48:39,375 --> 00:48:40,410
What are you looking at?

394
00:48:45,297 --> 00:48:46,777
Don't you have to go to school today?

395
00:48:50,219 --> 00:48:51,219
Good morning.

396
00:48:53,305 --> 00:48:54,305
Do you want an ice-cream?

397
00:48:56,308 --> 00:48:57,308
Eat slowly!

398
00:48:59,061 --> 00:49:00,392
Try it, - thank you.

399
00:49:14,410 --> 00:49:16,571
Did you have good time?

400
00:49:18,956 --> 00:49:19,956
Customers!

401
00:49:25,921 --> 00:49:26,956
Ricardo!

402
00:49:55,451 --> 00:49:57,407
Don't fight, he is my friend.

403
00:50:03,083 --> 00:50:06,450
Don't fight, if you kill him,
your girl-friend will suffer.

404
00:50:12,343 --> 00:50:13,503
Let's go!

405
00:50:19,058 --> 00:50:20,058
Go!

406
00:50:22,770 --> 00:50:23,770
Have an ice-cream.

407
00:50:25,814 --> 00:50:27,520
Have an ice-cream, eat up!

408
00:50:34,406 --> 00:50:37,193
Hold this, hurry up and
eat, you eat up too.

409
00:50:43,958 --> 00:50:47,075
Eat, philippine mango
ice-cream is best known.

410
00:50:50,506 --> 00:50:52,121
When can we go?

411
00:50:53,551 --> 00:50:55,212
I work on a commission,

412
00:50:56,387 --> 00:51:00,221
if you find a good family, it is your luck.

413
00:51:01,141 --> 00:51:04,099
Girls who got married to nice families
come back to see me sometimes.

414
00:51:15,781 --> 00:51:18,238
Why are you crying again? Don't cry...

415
00:51:19,243 --> 00:51:20,323
Don't cry...

416
00:51:20,953 --> 00:51:22,489
Don't cry, stop crying!

417
00:51:24,790 --> 00:51:26,906
Got and give her some water, hurry up!

418
00:51:35,092 --> 00:51:40,758
I don't know whether your boss works
for money or for power.

419
00:51:41,974 --> 00:51:43,089
For power.

420
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:44,100
Really?

421
00:51:44,435 --> 00:51:45,345
Really!

422
00:51:45,352 --> 00:51:46,352
And you?

423
00:51:47,563 --> 00:51:48,563
For both.

424
00:51:48,856 --> 00:51:50,642
Good, I'm old

425
00:51:50,649 --> 00:51:54,517
I just want to earn some money
and be able to have friends

426
00:52:17,635 --> 00:52:19,842
Mr. chung wanted you
to go to the night club tonight.

427
00:52:27,353 --> 00:52:31,642
The staff here can only drink ice-water,
but I'm exceptional.

428
00:52:32,316 --> 00:52:36,525
The one good thing about
working here is that you can

429
00:52:36,528 --> 00:52:37,968
throw out those face you don't like.

430
00:52:42,868 --> 00:52:44,233
Bring shum ching here!

431
00:52:44,870 --> 00:52:45,870
Yes!

432
00:52:51,627 --> 00:52:52,742
Who is migual?

433
00:52:55,005 --> 00:52:57,712
I heard he's the bastard son of Mr. chung.

434
00:52:59,134 --> 00:53:02,217
And a philippine woman.

435
00:53:03,263 --> 00:53:07,757
And I heard that
woman had eloped with some other man.

436
00:53:07,768 --> 00:53:09,383
Then Mr. chung found them,

437
00:53:09,395 --> 00:53:11,932
he used the philippine's favorite knife
the "butterfly knife"

438
00:53:11,939 --> 00:53:14,646
and killed them.

439
00:53:15,984 --> 00:53:19,147
But Chinatown is always full of rumors.

440
00:53:46,515 --> 00:53:47,515
Shum ching!

441
00:54:02,740 --> 00:54:06,232
Mr. chung, there is trouble,
please come and see!

442
00:54:38,108 --> 00:54:39,548
You are going to back on your words.

443
00:54:41,403 --> 00:54:42,984
Who brought her here to do the show?

444
00:54:44,448 --> 00:54:45,528
Take shum ching back.

445
00:54:46,325 --> 00:54:47,405
Let shum ching follow me!

446
00:54:48,744 --> 00:54:51,611
I have an idea, we'll
go someplace and talk.

447
00:54:51,872 --> 00:54:52,872
I won't go!

448
00:54:52,956 --> 00:54:55,413
Don't be afraid,
I'll come and pick you up in a while.

449
00:54:55,918 --> 00:54:56,918
You go back first!

450
00:55:01,465 --> 00:55:03,376
Sir, what about me?

451
00:55:07,554 --> 00:55:09,920
You don't touch her or I will kill you!

452
00:55:37,626 --> 00:55:38,741
How do you like this room?

453
00:55:38,752 --> 00:55:39,752
It's not bad!

454
00:55:40,754 --> 00:55:41,960
If you're not comfortable over there,

455
00:55:41,964 --> 00:55:43,704
why don't you move in here?

456
00:55:44,174 --> 00:55:45,710
My friends have moved abroad

457
00:55:46,134 --> 00:55:47,874
and I'm looking after his house.

458
00:55:49,304 --> 00:55:50,384
Come and see the room!

459
00:55:58,230 --> 00:55:59,345
What do you want me to do?

460
00:56:00,691 --> 00:56:02,932
Let's talk!

461
00:56:05,362 --> 00:56:06,772
Sit down and talk slowly!

462
00:56:14,872 --> 00:56:18,160
The snake-head is still alive
and he is in hospital.

463
00:56:21,378 --> 00:56:23,334
I heard you were in the army.

464
00:56:24,673 --> 00:56:25,673
That's right!

465
00:56:26,008 --> 00:56:27,293
You killed a lot of communists.

466
00:56:28,010 --> 00:56:29,045
I had lost count.

467
00:56:31,555 --> 00:56:33,546
And you had killed a man in Hong Kong?

468
00:56:35,809 --> 00:56:37,424
Can you do me a favor?

469
00:56:38,145 --> 00:56:39,225
What will I get out of it?

470
00:56:39,938 --> 00:56:40,938
Like I said,

471
00:56:41,189 --> 00:56:43,180
money, passport

472
00:56:44,151 --> 00:56:46,392
and if you've enough money
to buy shum ching out.

473
00:56:47,154 --> 00:56:48,314
She goes with you.

474
00:56:50,365 --> 00:56:51,365
When do I do it?

475
00:56:52,701 --> 00:56:53,701
In 2 days.

476
00:56:55,746 --> 00:56:57,282
I want shum ching now.

477
00:57:22,731 --> 00:57:23,891
Come over here!

478
00:57:27,444 --> 00:57:30,436
Please try your best
to make yourself feel at home.

479
00:58:16,994 --> 00:58:18,655
If you're caught by the philippine police,

480
00:58:18,662 --> 00:58:20,072
you must run away.

481
00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:21,330
Why?

482
00:58:22,916 --> 00:58:26,033
If they kill you, it'll save them
the trouble of going to court.

483
00:58:28,005 --> 00:58:29,165
Who is to be killed?

484
00:58:29,881 --> 00:58:30,881
Don't know.

485
00:58:34,428 --> 00:58:35,713
You don't need to be worry.

486
00:58:39,016 --> 00:58:40,552
Mr. chung is used to it,

487
00:58:40,559 --> 00:58:44,393
you won't know who works for him
until the last minute.

488
01:00:23,245 --> 01:00:24,245
Is that you?

489
01:01:12,919 --> 01:01:13,999
Get up the car...

490
01:01:37,777 --> 01:01:38,777
At the back!

491
01:02:21,655 --> 01:02:24,647
Lap quan, I'm in Chinatown already.

492
01:02:25,367 --> 01:02:27,653
But this is not the u.S.A,
but the Philippines.

493
01:02:28,745 --> 01:02:30,326
Even at which Chinatown,

494
01:02:30,330 --> 01:02:31,850
I think my situation will be the same.

495
01:02:32,791 --> 01:02:34,327
Because I have no identity.

496
01:02:34,334 --> 01:02:36,245
I can solve people's
problem with no problem.

497
01:02:37,128 --> 01:02:40,871
Like today, I & my partner had
just killed a philippine.

498
01:02:42,259 --> 01:02:43,590
You need not worry about me.

499
01:02:44,636 --> 01:02:47,503
I had experienced
the most dangerous situation in Vietnam.

500
01:02:48,098 --> 01:02:51,511
It's much simpler to kill people here
compared to Vietnam.

501
01:02:51,935 --> 01:02:56,304
And the target is simpler,
I just wanted to make a fast buck

502
01:02:56,815 --> 01:02:58,726
and buy myself a phoney passport.

503
01:03:00,568 --> 01:03:05,232
My partner too has come from Hong Kong,
10 years ago.

504
01:03:06,324 --> 01:03:08,406
I didn't ask him
if he has come by phoney passport.

505
01:03:09,369 --> 01:03:12,861
But I can tell, he's all along been
killing people for the boss.

506
01:03:14,833 --> 01:03:17,745
I don't understand, he's made his money.

507
01:03:18,545 --> 01:03:20,206
Why not take off now.

508
01:03:51,619 --> 01:03:55,032
The girl you saw in my room is also here.

509
01:03:56,499 --> 01:03:57,955
Did I ever tell you,

510
01:03:58,752 --> 01:04:01,243
I was once at the kowloon flower market.

511
01:04:01,588 --> 01:04:05,922
I ran into 2 illegal immigrants from China,
one man and one woman.

512
01:04:06,009 --> 01:04:07,374
They were being arrested.

513
01:04:10,013 --> 01:04:11,423
Even since then,

514
01:04:11,431 --> 01:04:14,173
I knew very clearly that she's like me.

515
01:04:14,184 --> 01:04:18,678
She'll spend all her life running

516
01:04:22,192 --> 01:04:24,854
I miss the boy at the refugee camp.

517
01:04:26,321 --> 01:04:27,777
I wonder how he is doing.

518
01:04:28,865 --> 01:04:32,073
If you have time, please go and see him.

519
01:04:55,016 --> 01:04:58,679
He really won't do it?
You need to be angry.

520
01:04:58,686 --> 01:05:01,894
Those old Chinese are
all miser, let them be.

521
01:05:03,108 --> 01:05:04,188
Let them be.

522
01:05:50,864 --> 01:05:51,864
Please sit down.

523
01:05:59,747 --> 01:06:02,409
Do you know what wu vuet is doing for me?

524
01:06:04,502 --> 01:06:05,867
You must have guessed it.

525
01:06:07,213 --> 01:06:08,213
Yes!

526
01:06:09,382 --> 01:06:12,374
Wu viet is not working for me here.

527
01:06:12,385 --> 01:06:13,921
He is working for you.

528
01:06:14,971 --> 01:06:18,463
He wants to make enough money
so that he can take you out of Philippines.

529
01:06:21,394 --> 01:06:27,185
He kills people because of you.

530
01:06:27,567 --> 01:06:29,558
And killing once is not enough.

531
01:06:33,490 --> 01:06:36,573
And what are you willing to do for wu viet?

532
01:06:37,785 --> 01:06:38,900
I will do anything.

533
01:06:54,844 --> 01:06:56,709
Next time I'll cook you
your favorite dishes.

534
01:06:57,347 --> 01:06:58,347
Where?

535
01:06:59,057 --> 01:07:01,639
No, not here, I'll have
to find another house.

536
01:07:02,060 --> 01:07:03,641
With a smell kitchen inside.

537
01:07:03,853 --> 01:07:06,014
Then I'll be able to
cook you some nice food.

538
01:07:06,898 --> 01:07:08,338
You can cook? How come I never knew?

539
01:07:08,983 --> 01:07:10,783
There are lots of thing
that you didn't know.

540
01:07:15,573 --> 01:07:16,573
Don't tell me now,

541
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:19,816
wait till I'm 70 or 80, then let me know.

542
01:07:30,797 --> 01:07:32,207
Are you going out again?

543
01:07:32,215 --> 01:07:35,127
Yes, Mr. chung wants to see me.

544
01:07:36,344 --> 01:07:37,834
Go to sleep, don't wait up for me.

545
01:07:50,608 --> 01:07:51,608
What's the matter?

546
01:08:26,561 --> 01:08:27,561
This is your money.

547
01:08:29,439 --> 01:08:30,439
Use it to get a passport.

548
01:08:31,065 --> 01:08:33,898
No... one thing at a time.

549
01:08:34,777 --> 01:08:36,017
How many more things are there?

550
01:08:36,112 --> 01:08:39,445
It's like this, we're waiting for someone
to pay us some ransom money.

551
01:08:39,449 --> 01:08:42,816
You go and kidnap him as well,
this is what I want you to do.

552
01:08:43,202 --> 01:08:45,284
I don't trust anyone from outside.

553
01:08:49,917 --> 01:08:51,123
I'm not forcing you.

554
01:08:51,711 --> 01:08:55,579
Firstly, your time to
leave is not ripe yet.

555
01:08:56,382 --> 01:08:59,874
Secondly, I want you to save up more money.

556
01:09:01,304 --> 01:09:03,260
Mr. chung, I want to talk to you.

557
01:09:03,890 --> 01:09:04,890
I am leaving.

558
01:09:06,601 --> 01:09:10,185
You don't have to go, I'm not afraid
to losing face in front of you.

559
01:09:11,230 --> 01:09:14,848
Mr. chung, I've never
done a kidnap job before.

560
01:09:14,942 --> 01:09:17,024
We are short of men right now.

561
01:09:17,236 --> 01:09:19,852
Are you worried that
I might not do a clean job?

562
01:09:20,406 --> 01:09:22,362
Stop kidding, we've
co-operated for so long.

563
01:09:22,367 --> 01:09:24,153
I've never given you any trouble.

564
01:09:24,661 --> 01:09:26,492
You've done everything alone.

565
01:09:26,663 --> 01:09:28,891
Didn't you say you wanted to go back
to Hong Kong to live?

566
01:09:28,915 --> 01:09:30,746
This man is very rich.

567
01:09:31,334 --> 01:09:33,074
Have I ever lied to you?

568
01:10:27,598 --> 01:10:28,598
Help!

569
01:10:42,363 --> 01:10:43,443
Help!

570
01:10:49,871 --> 01:10:50,871
Help!

571
01:10:56,669 --> 01:10:58,751
Help! Help!

572
01:11:26,949 --> 01:11:32,069
I can take it...
I'm just worried that I might be careless.

573
01:11:35,625 --> 01:11:40,289
I'm useless, I'm too old
to be useful anymore.

574
01:11:40,797 --> 01:11:44,585
Especially you, even if you're dead,
there's no way of finding out.

575
01:11:47,553 --> 01:11:48,633
Do we have any solution?

576
01:11:50,056 --> 01:11:52,263
It's best that you don't stay here anymore.

577
01:11:53,100 --> 01:11:55,512
I can help you if you want to leave.

578
01:11:58,064 --> 01:11:59,064
What about shum ching?

579
01:12:01,150 --> 01:12:02,390
That could be difficult.

580
01:12:18,751 --> 01:12:19,831
They won't pay.

581
01:12:21,128 --> 01:12:22,413
There's no money in the trunk?

582
01:12:23,464 --> 01:12:24,920
No, what's in the trunk is for the kid.

583
01:12:24,924 --> 01:12:26,444
His family won't pay his ransom money.

584
01:13:23,774 --> 01:13:26,982
This is not difficult, first,
let us buy a fishing junk.

585
01:13:27,570 --> 01:13:31,313
Then tell the fisherman

586
01:13:32,116 --> 01:13:33,916
to let you know so soon
as they are refugees.

587
01:13:34,076 --> 01:13:35,566
Then we'll immediately go out to sea.

588
01:13:35,578 --> 01:13:37,990
We'll pretend we're refugees.

589
01:13:38,915 --> 01:13:40,280
The other thing is easy.

590
01:13:42,126 --> 01:13:43,206
Will there be any danger?

591
01:13:44,086 --> 01:13:45,086
No

592
01:13:45,379 --> 01:13:47,370
Betan island is very far from Manila.

593
01:13:49,300 --> 01:13:50,540
Why won't you go?

594
01:13:50,551 --> 01:13:51,551
Go where?

595
01:13:52,261 --> 01:13:54,547
From this part of Chinatown to another?

596
01:13:56,515 --> 01:13:59,882
Do you know how many times
I've thought of women in a year?

597
01:14:04,231 --> 01:14:05,231
Nil?

598
01:14:06,525 --> 01:14:07,525
Nil!

599
01:14:07,902 --> 01:14:09,767
Not even once? I don't believe it!

600
01:14:11,697 --> 01:14:14,154
Except my mother, but she is died already.

601
01:14:16,744 --> 01:14:20,111
You should go, if you stay here like me,

602
01:14:20,122 --> 01:14:23,205
you'll be like me
and not even think about women.

603
01:15:24,520 --> 01:15:25,680
The two jobs we had done,

604
01:15:25,688 --> 01:15:26,677
the president had
ordered thorough investigation.

605
01:15:26,689 --> 01:15:29,180
The police were
hard pressed to produce the criminal,

606
01:15:29,984 --> 01:15:31,190
and if they can't,

607
01:15:32,028 --> 01:15:34,110
our Chinatown will never
have one day of peace.

608
01:15:34,572 --> 01:15:36,012
Well, will you hand over the people?

609
01:15:36,323 --> 01:15:39,531
I said no, they said they
didn't want to arrest anyone.

610
01:15:40,536 --> 01:15:42,639
They said they only wanted to give
the president some sort of answer.

611
01:15:42,663 --> 01:15:43,663
What do you plan to do?

612
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:47,456
Are you prepared to help me out?

613
01:15:54,467 --> 01:15:57,129
I had thought of a plan,
and everyone will be happy.

614
01:15:57,762 --> 01:16:00,219
You can all leave here
and I get my job done.

615
01:16:01,182 --> 01:16:03,594
I'll pretend that
I'll give you up to the police,

616
01:16:03,601 --> 01:16:05,933
and you'll go to a restaurant
to talk to the police.

617
01:16:06,395 --> 01:16:10,104
Men will be outside preparing to shoot you.

618
01:16:10,900 --> 01:16:12,310
When you go into the restaurant,

619
01:16:12,318 --> 01:16:13,478
they will search you

620
01:16:13,486 --> 01:16:15,067
just in case you carry any firearm.

621
01:16:15,571 --> 01:16:18,529
But once you're inside, you'll pretend
that you'll go to the toilet.

622
01:16:18,532 --> 01:16:20,989
A gun will be there behind the toilet.

623
01:16:21,702 --> 01:16:24,409
You'll hold the policeman
hostage and leave.

624
01:16:24,622 --> 01:16:27,910
That crop will be one of my men,
he's a good actor.

625
01:16:31,087 --> 01:16:33,294
Our car will be waiting for you
at the road junction.

626
01:16:33,297 --> 01:16:35,413
Ask shum ching to wait for you in the car.

627
01:16:35,883 --> 01:16:38,340
You'll take the police officer
and drive directly to the pier.

628
01:16:38,344 --> 01:16:41,586
Then you'll take a boat to Malaysia.

629
01:16:41,597 --> 01:16:43,053
When the minister ask me about it,

630
01:16:43,057 --> 01:16:45,469
I'll say I'd handed you over.

631
01:16:45,476 --> 01:16:47,341
Not being able to kill you is not my fault.

632
01:16:48,395 --> 01:16:50,602
We'll push him out of our car on route.

633
01:16:50,606 --> 01:16:52,312
Then we go to our pier.

634
01:18:41,508 --> 01:18:42,828
There's no ammunition in the gun.

635
01:18:53,771 --> 01:18:54,977
There's no back door here!

636
01:18:54,980 --> 01:18:56,265
Hold on to this piece of glass.

637
01:19:10,371 --> 01:19:11,406
Shum ching!

638
01:19:20,047 --> 01:19:21,047
Lie down!

639
01:19:24,760 --> 01:19:26,170
Wu viet, ah sarm, get on the car!

640
01:20:09,096 --> 01:20:10,096
Shum ching!

641
01:20:12,975 --> 01:20:13,975
Shum ching!

642
01:20:54,475 --> 01:20:56,181
Heh, yes... l am...

643
01:21:01,857 --> 01:21:06,226
Alright, we'll nail everything on this one.

644
01:21:06,653 --> 01:21:09,019
We'll take the dead one back
to relieve ourselves of duties.

645
01:21:09,531 --> 01:21:13,740
We'll go back to Chinatown in a few days
to pay last respect to that constable.

646
01:21:14,536 --> 01:21:17,118
Good-bye!

647
01:21:49,947 --> 01:21:51,357
My tooth is blooding again!

648
01:22:06,171 --> 01:22:08,583
Lap quan, I am wu viet.

649
01:22:09,466 --> 01:22:12,003
Me and my partner, and that girl also

650
01:22:12,553 --> 01:22:14,089
are leaving the Philippines tomorrow,

651
01:22:14,763 --> 01:22:17,129
and go to batan island as refugees.

652
01:22:18,434 --> 01:22:20,675
My partner didn't want to leave originally.

653
01:22:21,478 --> 01:22:24,158
He said he'll drink himself to death
in the Chinatown of philippine.

654
01:22:24,815 --> 01:22:27,602
But he has no alternative but to leave.

655
01:22:28,610 --> 01:22:32,148
He wanted to drink himself
to death in Chinatown of the U.S.A.

656
01:22:33,282 --> 01:22:35,739
The girl is a lot more optimistic than us.

657
01:22:36,743 --> 01:22:39,780
She believes that
we'll go to the u.S.A someday.

658
01:22:40,456 --> 01:22:42,993
We'll settle down once and for all.

659
01:22:44,084 --> 01:22:46,166
She had planned
on buying a house for ourselves.

660
01:22:46,628 --> 01:22:47,834
With our own private kitchen.

661
01:22:49,047 --> 01:22:50,583
She'll cook vietnamese food for us.

662
01:22:51,633 --> 01:22:53,965
We've also decided that in the u.S.A,

663
01:22:54,636 --> 01:22:56,996
we'll bring over the kid
from the refugee camp in Hong Kong,

664
01:22:58,056 --> 01:22:59,466
we'll adopt him.

665
01:23:01,643 --> 01:23:03,053
I will reply on these hope,

666
01:23:04,062 --> 01:23:05,552
to complete my journey.
