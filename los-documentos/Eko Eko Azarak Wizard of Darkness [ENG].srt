1
00:00:44,663 --> 00:01:06,538


2
00:01:09,335 --> 00:01:10,825
Alpha Omega.

3
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:13,732
Ely Elohe Eloheim.

4
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:16,274
Sabaoth Elion Sady.

5
00:01:34,194 --> 00:01:35,593
Help me!

6
00:01:40,433 --> 00:01:41,464
Help!

7
00:01:44,137 --> 00:01:45,331
Alpha Omega.

8
00:01:45,972 --> 00:01:47,234
Ely Elohe Eloheim.

9
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:49,431
Help me!

10
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:12,889
Ely Elohe Eloheim.

11
00:02:13,032 --> 00:02:14,693
Elohe Elo Obosos.

12
00:02:15,268 --> 00:02:17,998
Orion Elkhie Adnaia.

13
00:02:18,738 --> 00:02:21,070
Detragramaton Saday.

14
00:02:21,841 --> 00:02:23,741
Ely Elohe Eloheim.

15
00:02:23,943 --> 00:02:25,604
Elohe Elo Obosos.

16
00:02:25,712 --> 00:02:28,203
Orion Elkhie Adnaia.

17
00:02:29,782 --> 00:02:32,410
Detragramaton Saday.

18
00:03:30,443 --> 00:03:32,707
The pentagram is complete.

19
00:03:34,113 --> 00:03:38,482
On the night of the full moon,
we offerthirteen sacrifices.

20
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:42,411
Use their blood to
cleanse our sanctuary.

21
00:03:43,423 --> 00:03:45,118
For Lucifer!

22
00:03:45,592 --> 00:03:48,993
To revive Satan, the lord Lucifer!

23
00:03:58,004 --> 00:03:59,631
Lucifer.

24
00:04:03,142 --> 00:04:04,769
Ashtaroth.

25
00:04:08,622 --> 00:04:11,275
ln the name of Asmodeus.

26
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:18,288
You will lead the ceremony.

27
00:04:28,067 --> 00:04:29,659
Rise!

28
00:04:37,243 --> 00:04:39,973
That woman may come.

29
00:04:41,147 --> 00:04:42,177
Which woman?

30
00:04:43,816 --> 00:04:46,717
The woman with great powers.

31
00:04:47,987 --> 00:04:50,251
The woman we don't want as an enemy.

32
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:32,390
Good morning.

33
00:05:32,484 --> 00:05:34,022
Let me check you.

34
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:39,470
Okay, you may go.

35
00:05:41,941 --> 00:05:44,375
Good morning Kazumi.

36
00:05:44,777 --> 00:05:47,075
How's your hair?

37
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,380
Your breasts?

38
00:05:52,085 --> 00:05:54,553
The length of your skirt...

39
00:05:55,455 --> 00:05:56,854
Okay.

40
00:05:57,790 --> 00:05:59,417
Everything's fine.

41
00:05:59,559 --> 00:06:00,753
You can go.

42
00:06:03,229 --> 00:06:04,992
l've never seen you before!

43
00:06:05,965 --> 00:06:07,023
What's your name?

44
00:06:10,169 --> 00:06:11,397
Misa Kuroi.

45
00:06:12,972 --> 00:06:19,707
Eko Eko Azarak

46
00:06:38,998 --> 00:06:40,042
Look.

47
00:06:40,533 --> 00:06:44,629
Last night's accident took place here.

48
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:50,637
And the ones before that were here...

49
00:06:51,056 --> 00:06:54,364
...and here, and here and here.

50
00:06:55,249 --> 00:06:56,942


51
00:06:58,885 --> 00:07:05,222
lf you connect all the sites of
those strange accidents with straight lines...

52
00:07:15,034 --> 00:07:17,559
...you get a pentagram.

53
00:07:18,971 --> 00:07:23,408
And in the middle is our school.

54
00:07:23,643 --> 00:07:24,473
No way!

55
00:07:24,577 --> 00:07:25,942
Why?

56
00:07:28,181 --> 00:07:29,079
Good morning.

57
00:07:29,182 --> 00:07:30,444
Good morning.

58
00:07:30,817 --> 00:07:32,478
What is that?

59
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:36,753
lt's a very important magic symbol.

60
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:46,552
lt can be used as an invocation or as
protection, depending on how it's drawn.

61
00:07:47,366 --> 00:07:52,599
But this pentagram was drawn with
human blood, so it's an invocation.

62
00:07:54,674 --> 00:07:58,735
lt's to call forth the devil.

63
00:08:00,744 --> 00:08:02,758
Magicians have their rank and order.

64
00:08:02,868 --> 00:08:06,429
The highertheir rank, the
greater evils they can call forth.

65
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:14,509
There are lots of powerful
devils like Belzebub and Asmodeus...

66
00:08:14,794 --> 00:08:19,197
...but it's every magician's dream
to call the Great Lord Satan...

67
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:22,563
...and to make his powers their own.

68
00:08:23,202 --> 00:08:26,296
Lucifer used to be an angel,
he looks beautiful, doesn't he?

69
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:31,977
But his powers are incredible.

70
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:38,048
lt is said that if you call
Lucifer, you can rule the world.

71
00:08:40,052 --> 00:08:42,145
Are you on something?

72
00:08:43,308 --> 00:08:45,914
This would be dangerous
if it was for real.

73
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:47,287
You should be careful.

74
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:52,561
Are you making fun of magic?

75
00:09:02,575 --> 00:09:03,633
Looking for a fight?

76
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:09,272
All rise.

77
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:15,377
Get back to your seats.

78
00:09:19,358 --> 00:09:20,423
Bow.

79
00:09:20,526 --> 00:09:22,721
Good morning.

80
00:09:22,828 --> 00:09:24,056
Be seated.

81
00:09:27,867 --> 00:09:30,529
l'd like to introduce
our new transfer student.

82
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:34,165
Miss Kuroi.

83
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:41,369
She's hot!

84
00:09:45,685 --> 00:09:48,848
Misa Kuroi will be part of
our class from today on.

85
00:10:00,733 --> 00:10:02,360
My name is Misa Kuroi.

86
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:12,541
Misa, let me know if you have any
questions, l'm the class representative.

87
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:13,877
Thank you.

88
00:10:14,013 --> 00:10:15,071
lt must be a lot of work.

89
00:10:15,214 --> 00:10:17,682
lt is, l got forced into it.

90
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:22,378
But if l do it now, l don't
have to do it when l'm a senior.

91
00:10:24,657 --> 00:10:26,056
What's this room?

92
00:10:27,426 --> 00:10:28,825
This room is sealed off.

93
00:10:29,862 --> 00:10:32,330
lt used to be the art room.

94
00:10:32,832 --> 00:10:35,801
Ever since one of the teachers
went crazy and committed suicide.

95
00:10:35,901 --> 00:10:38,267
They say that at night
you can hear her voice.

96
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:46,869
See?

97
00:10:48,214 --> 00:10:51,581
lt's true, the security
guards have heard it.

98
00:10:51,684 --> 00:10:52,708
Really?

99
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:54,376
Really!

100
00:10:56,222 --> 00:10:58,713
This is the biology lab.

101
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:00,516
This is the physics lab.

102
00:11:00,893 --> 00:11:05,626
This school has had a lot of additions,
so it might be confusing at first.

103
00:11:08,234 --> 00:11:09,861
l really like that.

104
00:11:11,137 --> 00:11:12,866
Should we go buy one today?

105
00:11:13,406 --> 00:11:15,340
Sure, l have lots of time.

106
00:11:22,267 --> 00:11:25,725
Did Mr. Numata feel you up this morning?

107
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:26,909
No.

108
00:11:27,171 --> 00:11:30,576
Really, he's a pervert so be careful.

109
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:33,321
And our homeroom teacher, Miss Shirai...

110
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:36,017
She likes girls.

111
00:11:37,163 --> 00:11:38,721
What do you mean?

112
00:11:41,587 --> 00:11:45,148
She and Kazumi Tanaka
are having a thing...

113
00:11:47,139 --> 00:11:48,629
What's wrong?

114
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:51,270
What's wrong, Mizuki?

115
00:12:03,155 --> 00:12:04,179
Adonai Hareitz.

116
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:07,856
Wait here.

117
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:15,488
Are you sure you're okay?

118
00:13:15,728 --> 00:13:16,626
Yeah.

119
00:13:16,762 --> 00:13:18,354
lt's so weird...

120
00:13:18,564 --> 00:13:20,122
lt just went away.

121
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,867
lt's so strange.

122
00:13:25,337 --> 00:13:28,898
lt took you so long to come
back, l thought you ditched me.

123
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:30,872
l'm sorry, l got lost.

124
00:13:31,277 --> 00:13:32,369
Of course.

125
00:13:32,511 --> 00:13:35,844
You seem like you're very
loyal to your friends.

126
00:13:37,716 --> 00:13:39,308
l do?

127
00:13:40,052 --> 00:13:41,781
Yes, you do.

128
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:45,415
You must have been really frazzled.

129
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:48,550
Your beautiful hair is all messed up.

130
00:13:49,728 --> 00:13:55,030
ls there anyone in this school
who knows about magic and spells?

131
00:13:56,101 --> 00:13:57,534
Mizuno, l guess.

132
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:58,760
Why?

133
00:14:00,406 --> 00:14:02,670
What were you saying
earlier in the locker room?

134
00:14:02,942 --> 00:14:05,877
Oh, what was l saying?

135
00:14:07,028 --> 00:14:11,312
Oh yeah, that Miss Shirai
and Kazumi are having a thing.

136
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:13,512
Kazumi?

137
00:14:15,888 --> 00:14:16,989
Let's go.

138
00:14:23,395 --> 00:14:25,090
l wonder if she heard us.

139
00:14:25,798 --> 00:14:26,958
Mizuki...

140
00:14:27,099 --> 00:14:28,161
What?

141
00:14:29,168 --> 00:14:30,829
What just happened before....

142
00:14:31,136 --> 00:14:32,501
...l think it was a curse.

143
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:34,263
A curse?

144
00:14:39,762 --> 00:14:42,372
l found this here.

145
00:14:48,988 --> 00:14:51,548
This was stuck in its chest.

146
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:53,817
Can you think of who
might have done this?

147
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:55,151
No.

148
00:14:56,195 --> 00:14:57,924
What about Kazumi?

149
00:14:59,298 --> 00:15:01,698
l don't think she likes me much.

150
00:15:02,201 --> 00:15:04,294
But l don't think she hates me.

151
00:15:05,037 --> 00:15:08,234
Misa, are you serious about this curse?

152
00:15:08,395 --> 00:15:10,375
Or is this some kind of joke?

153
00:15:10,643 --> 00:15:12,167
l wish it was.

154
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:18,581
lf you hear any strange
rumors, let me know right away.

155
00:15:19,685 --> 00:15:21,277
lt doesn't matter what it is.

156
00:15:21,654 --> 00:15:26,614
lt could be about ghosts, or
that someone is using magic.

157
00:15:27,359 --> 00:15:28,519
Okay.

158
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:35,029
You can keep this if you'd like.

159
00:15:36,168 --> 00:15:37,465
Thank you.

160
00:15:37,636 --> 00:15:38,762
But why?

161
00:15:39,004 --> 00:15:40,130
lt's a charm.

162
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:42,331
lt will protect you.

163
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:45,336
Thank you, l will take good care of it.

164
00:15:47,646 --> 00:15:51,912
Someone is after Mizuki
Kurahashi, and put a curse on her...

165
00:15:52,484 --> 00:15:54,782
Who here uses magic?

166
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:56,046
Miss Kuroi.

167
00:15:57,256 --> 00:16:00,657
We have a practice
match against West High...

168
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:02,124
...will you come?

169
00:16:02,928 --> 00:16:06,022
l have a feeling that if you
come to cheer us on, we'll win.

170
00:16:06,198 --> 00:16:07,631
Don't be fooled.

171
00:16:09,268 --> 00:16:14,570
Shindo has a feeling that they'll
win if any girls cheerthem on.

172
00:16:14,907 --> 00:16:16,374
Only cute girls.

173
00:16:16,942 --> 00:16:19,536
No way, Misa's all mine.

174
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:20,682
Let's go.

175
00:16:25,284 --> 00:16:28,276
Remember you told me to tell
you if l heard anything strange?

176
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:31,184
Some people are about to
perform a ritual to cast a spell.

177
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:32,348
A ritual?

178
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:38,719
Numata touched my chest again today!

179
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:40,397
Can you believe it?

180
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:43,900
l bet that's the real
reason he teaches here.

181
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:46,862
He deserves to die.

182
00:16:48,707 --> 00:16:50,265
l don't think we should do this.

183
00:16:50,409 --> 00:16:53,537
What are you saying
Kana, it was your idea.

184
00:16:53,946 --> 00:16:57,404
l went all the way to
Harajuku to buy this.

185
00:16:58,299 --> 00:16:59,409
But...

186
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:01,683
What are you doing?

187
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:05,714
Hey Mizuki, wanna join us?

188
00:17:05,991 --> 00:17:08,983
We're going to make Numata suffer.

189
00:17:13,332 --> 00:17:14,390
Where's his picture?

190
00:17:25,511 --> 00:17:27,342
Let's not do this.

191
00:17:27,646 --> 00:17:29,511
We shouldn't do this.

192
00:17:29,748 --> 00:17:31,079
Come on, Mizuno.

193
00:17:31,417 --> 00:17:33,681
You always do this.

194
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:36,884
You always wimp out.

195
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:40,521
l hate half-assed flakes.

196
00:17:41,026 --> 00:17:42,823
lf you don't like it,
why don't you leave.

197
00:17:42,928 --> 00:17:44,156
That's enough, Kazumi.

198
00:17:44,296 --> 00:17:46,958
But she's always like this.

199
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,563
l hate half-assed flakes.

200
00:17:50,836 --> 00:17:53,600
You're the ones who
are being half-assed.

201
00:17:56,308 --> 00:18:00,438
You need a doll like this to
put a curse on someone, Kazumi.

202
00:18:01,113 --> 00:18:02,341
Misa?

203
00:18:16,728 --> 00:18:19,196
Are you saying you know how to do it?

204
00:18:19,331 --> 00:18:23,062
You seem to know, let's
see you do it then.

205
00:18:26,071 --> 00:18:27,129
Fine.

206
00:18:27,339 --> 00:18:28,772
Give me the photo.

207
00:18:46,992 --> 00:18:53,522
This is not my breath, but the
breath of our enemy, Hideki Numata.

208
00:19:03,008 --> 00:19:05,841
Eko Eko Azarak, Eko Eko Zamelak.

209
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:09,970
Eko Eko Kernonos, Eko Eko Aradia.

210
00:19:13,185 --> 00:19:16,382
Put this in Mr. Numata's desk drawer.

211
00:19:18,937 --> 00:19:20,564
lt will take effect right away.

212
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,423
Are you sure this is going to work?

213
00:19:23,595 --> 00:19:25,358
l don't think so.

214
00:19:25,731 --> 00:19:29,258
Don't tell anyone about the doll,
it will decrease its powers.

215
00:19:40,913 --> 00:19:42,676
Why did you do it?

216
00:19:43,448 --> 00:19:46,042
l wanted to see if anyone
knew about the doll.

217
00:19:46,752 --> 00:19:51,189
Besides, you wanted to see
how a curse works, didn't you?

218
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:56,093
Did you figure out who it was?

219
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:57,226
No.

220
00:19:57,796 --> 00:20:01,061
But l will.

221
00:20:04,403 --> 00:20:07,031
Mr. Numata has fallen
ill and is not here.

222
00:20:07,139 --> 00:20:09,232
You will have study
hall instead of biology.

223
00:20:09,386 --> 00:20:10,614
Yes!

224
00:20:10,742 --> 00:20:12,642
Wow, Misa!

225
00:20:13,278 --> 00:20:14,870
Yeah!

226
00:20:25,324 --> 00:20:27,383
How did you do that?

227
00:20:28,493 --> 00:20:30,484
Can you show us?

228
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:40,404
Misa Kuroi uses black magic.

229
00:20:40,505 --> 00:20:41,510
Really?

230
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:42,839
No way.

231
00:20:42,941 --> 00:20:43,971
lt's true.

232
00:20:45,344 --> 00:20:50,179
Hey Mizuno, that means she
is the real thing, unlike you.

233
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:55,650
Shut up!

234
00:21:03,895 --> 00:21:05,328
Ooh, l'm so scared.

235
00:21:10,168 --> 00:21:11,226
Damn it!

236
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:33,856
The new transfer student, Misa Kuroi...

237
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:35,824
She's very pretty.

238
00:21:36,113 --> 00:21:39,879
l heard something strange
from a friend of mine...

239
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:42,999
...who teaches at her old school.

240
00:21:43,702 --> 00:21:47,138
He said that many
people around her died.

241
00:21:47,272 --> 00:21:48,000
No way.

242
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:51,735
She's not directly involved but...

243
00:21:51,877 --> 00:21:55,335
At her last school,
and the one before too...

244
00:21:55,614 --> 00:21:58,913
People die when she transfers in.

245
00:22:18,737 --> 00:22:21,604
Do you like the new student?

246
00:22:25,025 --> 00:22:26,135
What's wrong?

247
00:22:26,611 --> 00:22:28,238
What are you worried about?

248
00:22:31,978 --> 00:22:34,144
You seem strange today, Kazumi.

249
00:23:00,345 --> 00:23:02,279
She's so pretty.

250
00:23:04,015 --> 00:23:06,245
You have your eye on her, don't you?

251
00:23:07,753 --> 00:23:08,777
You're being silly.

252
00:23:08,887 --> 00:23:10,411
lt's not like that.

253
00:23:12,257 --> 00:23:15,090
You think Misa made Mr. Numata sick?

254
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:17,752
l heard that Misa...

255
00:24:46,234 --> 00:24:47,252
Who's there?

256
00:24:52,591 --> 00:24:53,785
Pig!

257
00:24:54,593 --> 00:24:55,787
Miss Shirai?

258
00:24:58,797 --> 00:24:59,889
lt's okay.

259
00:25:00,198 --> 00:25:02,826
You don't have anything to worry about.

260
00:25:03,385 --> 00:25:06,700
But Mr. Numata has a big mouth.

261
00:25:07,606 --> 00:25:09,801
What if everyone finds out about us?

262
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:14,707
No matter how big a mouth he
has, he won't be able to talk.

263
00:25:38,423 --> 00:25:41,666
She may be pretty, but who
knows what she's really thinking.

264
00:25:44,495 --> 00:25:45,533
Good morning.

265
00:25:54,752 --> 00:25:55,828
Good morning.

266
00:25:58,643 --> 00:26:00,338
Stop it you guys!

267
00:26:02,647 --> 00:26:07,846
Mr. Numata was in a
traffic accident last night.

268
00:26:08,586 --> 00:26:10,281
He's in critical condition.

269
00:26:10,388 --> 00:26:11,946
Mr. Numata?

270
00:26:12,290 --> 00:26:13,416
Why?

271
00:26:14,392 --> 00:26:15,791
lt's because you put a curse on him.

272
00:26:15,893 --> 00:26:16,951
No way.

273
00:26:17,061 --> 00:26:18,756
lt wasn't that kind of curse.

274
00:26:25,002 --> 00:26:30,030
This was in Numata's drawer.

275
00:26:35,546 --> 00:26:39,380
Besides, l know.

276
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:45,354
People died in your
old school too, right?

277
00:26:46,791 --> 00:26:49,692
l heard that people around you die.

278
00:26:51,896 --> 00:26:54,956
You're the one making the
blood pentagram, aren't you?

279
00:26:56,334 --> 00:26:57,995
What are you up to?

280
00:26:58,369 --> 00:26:59,666
Murderer!

281
00:27:08,513 --> 00:27:12,313
They went after Mr. Numata and not me.

282
00:27:13,384 --> 00:27:14,942
Why?

283
00:27:15,987 --> 00:27:19,753
Eight people knew about the doll.

284
00:27:21,425 --> 00:27:23,518
Don't let that get you down.

285
00:27:24,829 --> 00:27:28,356
Everyone is just a little freaked out.

286
00:27:29,233 --> 00:27:31,497
Mizuno's crazy to begin with anyway.

287
00:27:32,403 --> 00:27:36,430
Besides, there's no reason
for you to do that to Numata.

288
00:27:38,289 --> 00:27:41,122
All this talk of curses and black magic...

289
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:42,871
What's wrong with everyone?

290
00:27:43,881 --> 00:27:47,408
So you came to cheer me up.

291
00:27:48,919 --> 00:27:50,109
Sort of.

292
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:56,993
Will you go out with me?

293
00:27:58,429 --> 00:27:59,691
Do you have a boyfriend?

294
00:28:00,264 --> 00:28:01,390
No.

295
00:28:03,734 --> 00:28:07,135
What Mizuno said is true.

296
00:28:08,673 --> 00:28:10,937
People around me die.

297
00:28:11,642 --> 00:28:14,543
You should stay away from me.

298
00:28:15,989 --> 00:28:19,072
That's a really crappy
way to reject someone.

299
00:28:19,183 --> 00:28:20,582
But it's the truth.

300
00:28:20,685 --> 00:28:22,016
l don't care.

301
00:28:22,787 --> 00:28:24,084
Shindo!

302
00:28:24,222 --> 00:28:25,211
What are you doing?

303
00:28:25,323 --> 00:28:26,585
Hurry up!

304
00:28:26,724 --> 00:28:27,918
l'm coming.

305
00:28:28,919 --> 00:28:30,960
Think about it.

306
00:28:48,846 --> 00:28:50,973
And this is the answer.

307
00:28:51,737 --> 00:28:53,183
Any questions?

308
00:28:55,453 --> 00:28:57,546
Okay, that's it fortoday.

309
00:29:00,564 --> 00:29:04,330
After school, there will be a retake
of the test you took the other day.

310
00:29:06,831 --> 00:29:10,198
This is a list of those
who need to do the retake.

311
00:29:10,401 --> 00:29:12,062
Check to see if you're on it.

312
00:29:14,505 --> 00:29:15,836
And Misa...

313
00:29:16,051 --> 00:29:17,029
Yes.

314
00:29:17,148 --> 00:29:20,233
l'd like you to take it, too.

315
00:29:20,712 --> 00:29:21,785
Yes.

316
00:29:22,948 --> 00:29:25,743
l don't want to be there
if Misa's going to be there.

317
00:29:26,717 --> 00:29:28,275
That's enough, Mizuno.

318
00:29:33,924 --> 00:29:35,721
Good luck, everyone.

319
00:29:41,799 --> 00:29:43,027
There's my name.

320
00:29:43,668 --> 00:29:44,884
My name's on it, too!

321
00:29:57,481 --> 00:29:58,641
Miss Shirai.

322
00:30:06,691 --> 00:30:09,888
l want to see you after school today...

323
00:30:10,094 --> 00:30:11,108
Yes.

324
00:30:40,524 --> 00:30:42,116
You have 60 minutes.

325
00:30:42,226 --> 00:30:44,660
This goes without
saying, but no cheating!

326
00:30:45,629 --> 00:30:50,532
Even if you are finished, do
not leave until l come back.

327
00:30:50,653 --> 00:30:51,825
Understand?

328
00:31:02,189 --> 00:31:03,678
Begin.

329
00:32:17,154 --> 00:32:19,714
Wanna go out tonight?

330
00:32:22,526 --> 00:32:24,460
Where's Shirai?

331
00:32:24,929 --> 00:32:27,397
l bet she forgot about us.

332
00:32:28,899 --> 00:32:30,992
l want to go home.

333
00:33:39,370 --> 00:33:41,531
Misa, what's the matter?

334
00:33:42,172 --> 00:33:43,605
Did you hearthat?

335
00:33:44,029 --> 00:33:45,236
What?

336
00:33:48,078 --> 00:33:49,875
lt's so quiet all of a sudden.

337
00:33:54,051 --> 00:33:56,618
What is that?

338
00:34:00,190 --> 00:34:02,715
That wasn't there before.

339
00:34:03,726 --> 00:34:05,125
lt's the number of evil.

340
00:34:07,097 --> 00:34:08,826
Whatever.

341
00:34:10,034 --> 00:34:11,228
l'm leaving.

342
00:34:11,869 --> 00:34:13,928
Mizuki, you deal with this.

343
00:34:14,605 --> 00:34:15,679
Me, too.

344
00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:18,230
l'm leaving too.

345
00:34:18,609 --> 00:34:22,602
Didn't you hear her say we
had to stay until she came back?

346
00:34:22,746 --> 00:34:24,304
l didn't hearthat.

347
00:34:24,415 --> 00:34:25,746
Neither, did l.

348
00:34:28,052 --> 00:34:29,713
Misa, let's go.

349
00:34:29,853 --> 00:34:31,753
l'm going to wait for Miss Shirai.

350
00:34:32,356 --> 00:34:34,051
Come on, Shindo!

351
00:34:34,158 --> 00:34:35,206
See you.

352
00:34:35,559 --> 00:34:36,716
l'm leaving, too.

353
00:34:36,927 --> 00:34:38,258
You're going to get in trouble!

354
00:34:38,696 --> 00:34:40,163
Chie, are you leaving too?

355
00:34:40,264 --> 00:34:41,492
l gotta pee.

356
00:34:45,102 --> 00:34:47,502
lt won't open.

357
00:34:49,373 --> 00:34:50,635
That's strange.

358
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:52,373
Maybe it's broken.

359
00:34:59,750 --> 00:35:02,218
l think Beroma's going
to the second round.

360
00:35:02,319 --> 00:35:03,946
Berdie's not dead yet though.

361
00:35:04,088 --> 00:35:05,953
Oh no, the game's going to start!

362
00:35:44,881 --> 00:35:46,815
Didn't we just go outside?

363
00:35:46,930 --> 00:35:48,135
We did.

364
00:36:14,191 --> 00:36:15,222
Huh?

365
00:36:17,027 --> 00:36:18,858
Why won't it open?

366
00:36:32,409 --> 00:36:35,469
l can't get the door open!

367
00:36:36,513 --> 00:36:37,631
Hello?

368
00:36:38,449 --> 00:36:39,467
Hello?

369
00:36:44,888 --> 00:36:48,790
Please, is anyone there?

370
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:51,125
Hello?

371
00:36:57,134 --> 00:36:58,396
Help me!

372
00:36:58,836 --> 00:37:00,269
Please open the door!

373
00:37:00,738 --> 00:37:02,467
Please open the door!

374
00:37:03,006 --> 00:37:04,234
Someone!

375
00:37:04,831 --> 00:37:06,605
Please open the door!

376
00:37:10,681 --> 00:37:12,478
Someone help me!

377
00:37:13,117 --> 00:37:15,210
Help!

378
00:37:26,997 --> 00:37:30,831
Mizuki, l need to get going.

379
00:37:32,102 --> 00:37:33,330
Me, too.

380
00:37:33,871 --> 00:37:36,271
My dad's going to be hungry.

381
00:37:39,610 --> 00:37:41,373
Where's Chie?

382
00:37:41,812 --> 00:37:43,177
She's still in the bathroom?

383
00:37:45,682 --> 00:37:47,445
What's taking her so long?

384
00:37:48,919 --> 00:37:50,716
l'm going to go check on her.

385
00:38:01,698 --> 00:38:03,131
l thought you left.

386
00:38:03,233 --> 00:38:04,495
We can't get out.

387
00:38:04,601 --> 00:38:05,499
Are the doors locked?

388
00:38:05,602 --> 00:38:06,034
No!

389
00:38:06,136 --> 00:38:07,398
You go out, but you're in again.

390
00:38:07,504 --> 00:38:08,835
We went out but
ended up back inside.

391
00:38:08,939 --> 00:38:09,769
No, the inside is outside.

392
00:38:09,873 --> 00:38:11,067
What are you talking about?

393
00:38:11,175 --> 00:38:13,143
We're just about to leave.

394
00:38:13,230 --> 00:38:14,278
We're not lying!

395
00:38:14,344 --> 00:38:15,470
The windows won't open either!

396
00:38:15,913 --> 00:38:17,505
We can't get out!

397
00:38:18,649 --> 00:38:21,083
Chie, everyone's leaving.

398
00:38:31,762 --> 00:38:32,592
Chie?

399
00:38:38,302 --> 00:38:39,769
Are you in there, Chie?

400
00:38:46,877 --> 00:38:48,504
That's impossible.

401
00:38:48,645 --> 00:38:49,337
lt's true.

402
00:38:49,413 --> 00:38:50,505
lt's not a lie.

403
00:38:51,782 --> 00:38:52,908
lt's a curse.

404
00:38:56,408 --> 00:38:57,462
Maki!

405
00:38:58,188 --> 00:38:59,246
Misa wait!

406
00:39:19,276 --> 00:39:20,766
l'll go get Miss Shirai!

407
00:39:20,944 --> 00:39:21,837
l'll go, too.

408
00:39:21,979 --> 00:39:22,983
Me, too.

409
00:39:23,213 --> 00:39:24,237
Me, too.

410
00:39:28,418 --> 00:39:29,612
Why?

411
00:39:35,626 --> 00:39:36,820
Miss Shirai!

412
00:39:39,396 --> 00:39:40,470
Please help...

413
00:39:58,148 --> 00:39:59,559
We have to call an ambulance.

414
00:40:01,408 --> 00:40:02,414
Hello?

415
00:40:02,519 --> 00:40:04,214
The number you have called...

416
00:40:04,388 --> 00:40:05,047
What's wrong?

417
00:40:05,155 --> 00:40:06,053
Hurry up.

418
00:40:06,156 --> 00:40:06,986
Come on.

419
00:40:07,124 --> 00:40:07,988
What's wrong?

420
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:09,792
What about the police?

421
00:40:13,630 --> 00:40:14,654
There's no dial tone!

422
00:40:14,715 --> 00:40:15,729
Who are you calling?

423
00:40:15,832 --> 00:40:16,850
Home.

424
00:40:17,734 --> 00:40:19,929
The line's disconnected.

425
00:40:20,203 --> 00:40:21,500
Let me call my dad.

426
00:40:22,439 --> 00:40:23,530
Hello?

427
00:40:25,131 --> 00:40:26,134
Someone!

428
00:40:26,243 --> 00:40:26,800
Damn it!

429
00:40:26,910 --> 00:40:27,944
Hello?

430
00:40:33,517 --> 00:40:34,587
Mizuno!

431
00:40:40,290 --> 00:40:44,090
We're locked in.

432
00:40:45,896 --> 00:40:49,059
Misa Kuroi, you did this, didn't you?

433
00:40:49,933 --> 00:40:52,094
This is a magic boundary.

434
00:40:52,803 --> 00:40:55,931
You are the only one who can do this.

435
00:40:57,441 --> 00:40:59,068
Just like with Numata...

436
00:41:00,110 --> 00:41:02,305
You put a curse on us, didn't you?

437
00:41:07,250 --> 00:41:08,342
Everyone, get out!

438
00:41:17,194 --> 00:41:18,218
Open it!

439
00:41:19,796 --> 00:41:20,956
Hurry up and open it!

440
00:41:21,064 --> 00:41:21,928
lt won't open!

441
00:41:22,032 --> 00:41:23,124
Give me a hand!

442
00:41:26,937 --> 00:41:29,872
Furfur, commander of the infernal
world, reveal to me your secrets!

443
00:41:30,539 --> 00:41:31,870
Everyone, move away!

444
00:41:48,458 --> 00:41:49,823
Open it!

445
00:41:54,097 --> 00:41:55,758
No!

446
00:44:08,317 --> 00:44:11,548
What should we do with the bodies?

447
00:44:13,136 --> 00:44:15,195
We can't leave them like that.

448
00:44:18,108 --> 00:44:19,126
lkeno, Abe, Takada, Yuka, Reiko...

449
00:44:20,271 --> 00:44:21,287


450
00:44:22,563 --> 00:44:23,657


451
00:44:24,817 --> 00:44:25,832


452
00:44:27,329 --> 00:44:28,397


453
00:44:30,776 --> 00:44:33,802
Someone might still be alive.

454
00:44:35,492 --> 00:44:37,119
You saw them!

455
00:44:37,290 --> 00:44:39,180
You saw how torn up they are!

456
00:44:39,554 --> 00:44:41,021
There's no way they're alive!

457
00:44:41,131 --> 00:44:42,199
But!

458
00:44:45,936 --> 00:44:49,565
Then you go and bring back
the ones who are alive.

459
00:44:49,673 --> 00:44:51,766
l can't do that.

460
00:44:55,345 --> 00:44:59,179
l wonder who won the match...

461
00:45:01,509 --> 00:45:03,645
Why did this have to happen?

462
00:45:10,636 --> 00:45:11,787
lt's you.

463
00:45:13,496 --> 00:45:16,863
lt's you, Misa Kuroi.

464
00:45:18,814 --> 00:45:20,426
lt's her fault.

465
00:45:23,206 --> 00:45:25,731
She erected the magic boundary.

466
00:45:28,078 --> 00:45:29,602
She killed them!

467
00:45:29,713 --> 00:45:30,975
Cut it out, Mizuno!

468
00:45:33,449 --> 00:45:38,886
Mizuno's right, we are trapped
in a web of black magic.

469
00:45:39,055 --> 00:45:40,249
Misa!

470
00:45:40,624 --> 00:45:42,057
But it's not me.

471
00:45:43,026 --> 00:45:45,119
l couldn't break the spell.

472
00:45:48,732 --> 00:45:50,563
You failed on purpose.

473
00:45:51,935 --> 00:45:55,029
You pretended that you couldn't,
after all it's your own spell!

474
00:45:55,138 --> 00:45:56,162
Mizuno!

475
00:45:58,675 --> 00:46:00,108
What's wrong with you?

476
00:46:01,177 --> 00:46:03,145
There's no such thing as magic.

477
00:46:03,246 --> 00:46:05,510
Then what was that?

478
00:46:07,017 --> 00:46:08,348
People are dead!

479
00:46:08,585 --> 00:46:09,847
But there's no one around!

480
00:46:09,986 --> 00:46:12,887
We can't make any calls or get out!

481
00:46:15,292 --> 00:46:18,125
What should we do with the bodies?

482
00:46:19,229 --> 00:46:22,721
l want to go home.

483
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:25,133
Me, too.

484
00:46:36,576 --> 00:46:37,907
Hey...

485
00:46:40,016 --> 00:46:42,177
Did anyone touch the blackboard?

486
00:46:49,159 --> 00:46:52,424
lt used to say 13, didn't it?

487
00:46:53,970 --> 00:46:56,165
ls that number...

488
00:46:57,863 --> 00:46:59,425
ls it...

489
00:47:03,306 --> 00:47:04,568
lt's us!

490
00:47:04,674 --> 00:47:05,299
Cut it out!

491
00:47:05,408 --> 00:47:07,069
lt means there are 7 of us left.

492
00:47:07,944 --> 00:47:09,912
lt's the seven of us.

493
00:47:11,581 --> 00:47:12,809
We're going to die!

494
00:47:13,616 --> 00:47:14,810
We're going to die!

495
00:47:16,119 --> 00:47:17,780
We're all going to die!

496
00:47:17,987 --> 00:47:19,978
Damn it, give me a break.

497
00:47:20,357 --> 00:47:21,449
Don't!

498
00:47:21,591 --> 00:47:23,024
Don't erase it!

499
00:47:23,126 --> 00:47:26,721
lf you erase it, we'll die!

500
00:47:27,597 --> 00:47:29,360
Don't erase it!

501
00:47:36,306 --> 00:47:40,037
Crying won't help.

502
00:47:41,745 --> 00:47:46,148
We have to find a way
to get out of here.

503
00:47:49,085 --> 00:47:50,382
She's right.

504
00:47:51,788 --> 00:47:53,312
We need to get out!

505
00:47:53,757 --> 00:47:55,486
Get out?

506
00:47:56,326 --> 00:47:57,793
Don't you get it, we can't get out!

507
00:47:57,894 --> 00:47:59,225
We'll find a way!

508
00:48:00,563 --> 00:48:02,326
There has to be a way.

509
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:07,493
l won't go with Misa.

510
00:48:07,824 --> 00:48:09,768
lt's best not to split up.

511
00:48:10,691 --> 00:48:14,173
We can protect each other
if we stick together.

512
00:48:14,727 --> 00:48:16,108
Protect each other?

513
00:48:18,548 --> 00:48:20,516
You were useless earlier.

514
00:48:28,224 --> 00:48:29,748
Don't be fooled by her.

515
00:48:32,328 --> 00:48:37,027
She's a murderer.

516
00:48:44,407 --> 00:48:46,398
l'm going with Misa.

517
00:48:48,511 --> 00:48:49,773
Me, too.

518
00:48:53,817 --> 00:48:58,254
What about you guys?

519
00:48:59,956 --> 00:49:05,417
l'm going with you, Mizuno.

520
00:49:06,763 --> 00:49:10,290
l'm going with Mizuno, too.

521
00:49:16,906 --> 00:49:18,203
Me, too.

522
00:49:30,860 --> 00:49:34,253
You're going to die.

523
00:49:52,141 --> 00:49:53,802
lt's no use.

524
00:50:18,801 --> 00:50:20,996
lt's sealed.

525
00:50:21,329 --> 00:50:22,199
Come on!

526
00:50:22,253 --> 00:50:23,321
Wait!

527
00:50:23,840 --> 00:50:25,740
What are you going to do with that rope?

528
00:50:25,842 --> 00:50:28,834
We're going to the roof.

529
00:50:28,945 --> 00:50:29,843
But the roof?

530
00:50:29,946 --> 00:50:31,811
l know how to rappel.

531
00:50:31,954 --> 00:50:34,923
My dad was into outdoor
sports, and he taught me how.

532
00:50:35,084 --> 00:50:38,679
He was cheesy, but he's got balls.

533
00:50:38,922 --> 00:50:42,824
l felt embarrassed because you
were the one keeping your cool, Misa.

534
00:50:51,838 --> 00:50:53,161
No good?

535
00:51:00,009 --> 00:51:01,442
Nader Letroll satanarse.

536
00:51:01,911 --> 00:51:02,935
Yes!

537
00:51:18,361 --> 00:51:19,692
We can't...

538
00:51:22,372 --> 00:51:23,763
We can't get out!

539
00:51:24,534 --> 00:51:29,494
No, there's got to be a way out.

540
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:32,840
l bet my dad is so worried.

541
00:51:35,078 --> 00:51:39,014
He must be hungry, too.

542
00:51:39,215 --> 00:51:42,116
l'm sure your mom is taking care of him.

543
00:51:42,944 --> 00:51:47,096
No, they got divorced when l was three.

544
00:51:49,258 --> 00:51:51,590
l'm the only one he's got.

545
00:51:52,028 --> 00:51:54,826
Wait, l think this one might open.

546
00:51:58,768 --> 00:52:00,895
We can get down from here!

547
00:52:33,783 --> 00:52:35,045
Wait!

548
00:52:35,638 --> 00:52:37,367
Don't leave me behind!

549
00:53:37,100 --> 00:53:39,625
Please don't leave me alone.

550
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:45,068
No!

551
00:53:49,679 --> 00:53:50,718
Kana!

552
00:53:53,036 --> 00:53:54,064
Kana!

553
00:53:55,666 --> 00:53:56,708
Kana!

554
00:53:57,987 --> 00:53:59,318
Where are the others?

555
00:54:00,690 --> 00:54:02,590
Maki's...

556
00:54:03,726 --> 00:54:05,523
Where are Kimura and Mizuno?

557
00:54:06,529 --> 00:54:09,589
l don't know.

558
00:54:13,269 --> 00:54:14,930
Let's go back to the classroom.

559
00:55:14,263 --> 00:55:15,855
What are you doing, Mizuno?

560
00:55:16,632 --> 00:55:18,065
lt's a pentagram.

561
00:55:19,135 --> 00:55:23,538
So long as you're inside of it,
you're protected from any magic.

562
00:55:24,941 --> 00:55:28,741
What could this chalk
drawing possibly do?

563
00:55:35,518 --> 00:55:37,110
Don't step on it!

564
00:55:52,275 --> 00:55:55,065
lf you want to live, come in.

565
00:55:55,671 --> 00:55:56,899
But...

566
00:55:58,986 --> 00:56:00,872
...you can't come in, Misa.

567
00:56:08,117 --> 00:56:09,277
Mizuki?

568
00:56:09,452 --> 00:56:11,511
l don't want to die.

569
00:56:11,621 --> 00:56:14,488
l'm not moving, l'm staying here.

570
00:56:15,157 --> 00:56:17,352
You're going to trust Mizuno?

571
00:56:17,460 --> 00:56:19,087
Get out of here.

572
00:56:24,100 --> 00:56:25,362
Shindo...

573
00:56:26,636 --> 00:56:29,469
Misa's going to kill you.

574
00:56:32,475 --> 00:56:34,102
Misa, wait.

575
00:56:34,210 --> 00:56:35,643
Don't follow me.

576
00:56:37,380 --> 00:56:39,814
ls it because of what Mizuno said?

577
00:56:40,182 --> 00:56:42,446
What he's saying is true.

578
00:56:42,919 --> 00:56:44,113
What are you saying?

579
00:56:44,487 --> 00:56:47,183
l'm a witch, a useless witch.

580
00:56:47,290 --> 00:56:48,086
Stop it.

581
00:56:48,190 --> 00:56:51,785
lf l had realized earlier, none
of this would have happened.

582
00:56:52,194 --> 00:56:55,357
Something's wrong, l
can't use my powers.

583
00:56:55,464 --> 00:56:56,488
What are you saying?

584
00:56:56,599 --> 00:56:58,658
lt's my fault they all died.

585
00:56:58,801 --> 00:57:00,769
And this isn't the first time, either.

586
00:57:01,003 --> 00:57:03,494
This happens to everyone
who gets close to me.

587
00:57:03,639 --> 00:57:04,401
Everyone dies!

588
00:57:04,507 --> 00:57:05,667
Stop it!

589
00:57:20,656 --> 00:57:21,816
Sorry.

590
00:57:23,512 --> 00:57:27,278
But at least l want you
to pull yourself together.

591
00:57:27,964 --> 00:57:30,023
We're going to get out of here.

592
00:57:30,967 --> 00:57:32,992
We have to get out of here.

593
00:57:34,737 --> 00:57:37,205
What l said is true.

594
00:57:37,873 --> 00:57:39,670
But don't get me wrong.

595
00:57:40,710 --> 00:57:47,548
l came to this school to
try to help protect you all...

596
00:57:48,310 --> 00:57:52,144
...from those who are using
magic for evil purposes.

597
00:57:56,592 --> 00:57:59,083
Everyone who loves me...

598
00:58:00,796 --> 00:58:03,128
...dies trying to protect me.

599
00:58:03,265 --> 00:58:04,732
That's how it always is.

600
00:58:09,305 --> 00:58:14,208
lf you get too close to
me, bad things will happen.

601
00:58:21,250 --> 00:58:24,777
Not this time.

602
00:58:25,287 --> 00:58:26,777
Shindo...

603
00:58:30,497 --> 00:58:31,652
The vent!

604
00:58:31,994 --> 00:58:33,552
We can get out through it.

605
00:58:49,745 --> 00:58:51,337
Two people are going to die.

606
00:58:52,615 --> 00:58:54,310
lt won't be us.

607
00:58:55,051 --> 00:58:58,782
We're inside the pentagram.

608
00:59:00,956 --> 00:59:06,394
But then does that mean
Misa's going to die?

609
00:59:12,334 --> 00:59:16,566
Then that means that one
of us is the murderer.

610
00:59:39,795 --> 00:59:40,988
lt's open.

611
00:59:41,630 --> 00:59:42,720
Give it to me.

612
00:59:44,467 --> 00:59:45,468
lt's okay.

613
01:00:53,503 --> 01:00:54,627
No!

614
01:01:01,386 --> 01:01:02,401
No!

615
01:01:05,080 --> 01:01:06,843
No, no...

616
01:01:06,982 --> 01:01:08,313
No!

617
01:01:19,295 --> 01:01:20,523
Shindo.

618
01:01:20,663 --> 01:01:21,891
Don't give up.

619
01:01:23,432 --> 01:01:24,831
l'll go get some tools.

620
01:01:25,234 --> 01:01:26,360
Wait, l'll go with you.

621
01:01:27,803 --> 01:01:31,466
Misa, is your heart racing?

622
01:01:32,808 --> 01:01:36,744
l heard that our hearts don't
race because we're in love...

623
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:41,047
...but that we think we're in
love with the person we're with...

624
01:01:41,150 --> 01:01:43,071
...when our hearts are pounding.

625
01:01:45,187 --> 01:01:46,620
Wait here for me,
with your heart racing.

626
01:01:46,722 --> 01:01:47,927
Wait.

627
01:01:59,935 --> 01:02:01,960
lt will protect you.

628
01:02:03,038 --> 01:02:04,060
Thank you.

629
01:02:04,206 --> 01:02:05,440
l'll be right back.

630
01:02:38,934 --> 01:02:39,972
Misa...

631
01:02:48,984 --> 01:02:50,110
Shindo!

632
01:02:53,956 --> 01:02:55,389
Oh, thank god!

633
01:02:56,292 --> 01:02:57,452
Misa.

634
01:03:02,131 --> 01:03:05,362
What are you doing here,
l told you to wait for me.

635
01:03:07,211 --> 01:03:08,635
l'm so glad.

636
01:03:23,719 --> 01:03:25,050
Shindo?

637
01:03:36,332 --> 01:03:37,993
Serves him right.

638
01:03:39,468 --> 01:03:44,963
Shindo always made fun of me.

639
01:04:56,716 --> 01:04:57,773
Kazumi...

640
01:05:40,722 --> 01:05:42,883
You're the last sacrifice...

641
01:05:43,525 --> 01:05:44,890
Misa Kuroi, the witch.

642
01:05:49,565 --> 01:05:50,930
You pitiful thing!

643
01:05:51,834 --> 01:05:54,962
l was going to kill you
in the teacher's room, but...

644
01:05:55,504 --> 01:05:57,199
lt was clever of you to realize.

645
01:05:58,774 --> 01:06:00,139
l commend you.

646
01:06:14,056 --> 01:06:18,083
But it's all over now.

647
01:07:38,073 --> 01:07:40,234
Oh, Lucifer!

648
01:07:42,377 --> 01:07:46,871
l shall be with you now.

649
01:08:45,807 --> 01:08:48,776
Mizuki, it's over.

650
01:08:54,299 --> 01:08:56,281
Misa!

651
01:08:57,419 --> 01:08:59,410
l was so scared!

652
01:08:59,655 --> 01:09:01,054
lt's okay...

653
01:09:01,990 --> 01:09:03,389
lt's okay now.

654
01:09:21,410 --> 01:09:26,211
l really liked you.

655
01:09:32,921 --> 01:09:33,945
Mizuki...

656
01:09:34,256 --> 01:09:35,280
You...

657
01:09:48,070 --> 01:09:49,970
So, it wasn't Miss Shirai.

658
01:09:51,239 --> 01:09:54,265
She was just following my orders.

659
01:09:55,944 --> 01:10:00,313
What are you trying to do?

660
01:10:01,717 --> 01:10:05,585
You should know that, Misa Kuroi.

661
01:10:07,489 --> 01:10:09,787
A pentagram drawn in blood...

662
01:10:10,158 --> 01:10:13,924
...and 13 young sacrifices.

663
01:10:15,564 --> 01:10:17,361
Lucifer's resurrection!

664
01:10:26,241 --> 01:10:28,709
Lucifer and l shall be one!

665
01:10:31,646 --> 01:10:34,114
Lucifer's great powers will be mine!

666
01:10:39,688 --> 01:10:41,417
lt will be mine!

667
01:10:42,624 --> 01:10:46,082
You killed everyone forthat?

668
01:10:46,695 --> 01:10:52,190
And l thought you of all
people would understand.

669
01:10:57,372 --> 01:11:00,830
l will be the master of the world.

670
01:11:03,912 --> 01:11:06,210
Everyone will kneel before me!

671
01:11:09,384 --> 01:11:13,150
l don't understand you...

672
01:11:13,922 --> 01:11:15,446
l don't even want to!

673
01:11:16,091 --> 01:11:22,655
There's no way you
can resurrect Lucifer.

674
01:11:25,600 --> 01:11:27,727
l am much betterthan you.

675
01:11:28,804 --> 01:11:30,704
l can do it.

676
01:11:32,974 --> 01:11:35,067
For such a stupid reason...

677
01:11:35,744 --> 01:11:39,180
You killed everyone forthat?

678
01:11:39,948 --> 01:11:41,939
