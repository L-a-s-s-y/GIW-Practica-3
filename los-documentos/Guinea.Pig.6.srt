1
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,958
Good morning.

2
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:16,878
Hiroshi, look.
He still carries his scetchbook.

3
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:22,199
He <i>seems so normal
since</i> he <i>has lost his wife.</i>

4
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:26,239
It's a month ago
now that his wife left him.

5
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:30,359
I wonder where he's going with the torch.

6
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:36,278
Wait, Hiroshi!

7
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:12,598
This is my secret place.

8
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:16,032
All my lost treasures are here.

9
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:21,993
All the beautiful things I have ever lost,
they are here.

10
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:25,550
All the time I have lost
is here.

11
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:28,234
Everything is hidden in the darkness.

12
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:20,077
When I was a child, there used to be
a river here. I played there.

13
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:24,116
Fish, friends, dragonflies...

14
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:30,358
They disappeared.

15
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,038
Chibi, is that you?

16
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,958
You were away out of a sudden!

17
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:50,431
And now you are here
in this cold place.

18
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:58,038
You poor thing.

19
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:06,553
I am a painter.

20
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:09,598
I have to paint Chibi.

21
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,157
You?

22
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:50,516
I met you once.
Then, when there was a river here.

23
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:02,678
It was you then?

24
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,758
Yes, I am the mermaid.

25
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:09,510
When the river got dried
this is where I stranded.

26
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:14,192
I can hear you. Your voice
sounds in my heart.

27
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:17,875
You have been living here in the dark...

28
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:22,798
all this time.

29
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:54,473
Ever since the day I met you here
I enjoy coming here.

30
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,911
I came here for years in order to paint.

31
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:03,434
Now I understand the reason.

32
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,477
Why?

33
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:10,872
Just to see you again
and to paint.

34
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:18,679
Everything, I have ever lost,
I can find in you.

35
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:22,712
From now on I will point you all the time.

36
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:24,518
What is if?

37
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,312
You get something in such places.

38
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:11,757
We go home. To my place.

39
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:15,073
We have to look after the infection.

40
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:20,278
Let's go home.

41
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,837
Thanks.

42
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,870
Let me see.

43
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:21,918
This will certainly help you.

44
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,630
This medicine heals all kinds
of diseases.

45
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:37,839
You better point me.
That is your mission.

46
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:44,158
Yes, my mission.

47
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:47,558
That's true.
Das ist wahr.

48
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:52,278
I am a painter.

49
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:55,318
I will point you.

50
00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:00,630
From now on I will point you forever.

51
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:16,758
Hiroshi, what happened to the pointer
from upstairs?

52
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:21,559
He used to go out everyday
with his scetchbook.

53
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:25,554
How should I know about if?
-Haven't I told you

54
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:29,190
that they delivered a
bathtube last week?

55
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:32,113
Why are you so interested in this guy?

56
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,718
Stop it.

57
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:40,678
Then stop if.

58
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:43,918
You are so stupid!

59
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:05,918
What is if?

60
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:10,198
Are you ok?

61
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:45,914
Wait.

62
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:24,919
Wait.

63
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:04,598
Thank goodness.

64
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,959
If stopped.

65
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:13,998
Thank goodness.

66
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,117
Thanks.

67
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:26,832
This medicine doesn't seem to work.

68
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,919
<i>Damn it.</i>

69
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:35,998
You should eat something.

70
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:41,118
What do you want?

71
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,072
It's long ago that I had fish.

72
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,877
Fish.

73
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:53,837
I'll get you some fresh fish.

74
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:58,920
Wait here.

75
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,637
Hello.

76
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:06,029
Is it true?
-Yes, it's true. I was shocked.

77
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:10,873
I see half bitten raw fish
in the trash every day.

78
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:14,191
You can judge people according to
their trash.

79
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:18,510
If is very strange.
I'm sick of if.

80
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:23,558
Yes, if is strange.
A whole fish in one bite.

81
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:28,520
Maybe he bought a little pet monster.

82
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:31,114
Hiroshi, you frighten me!

83
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:17,234
Are you sure you want if?

84
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:22,994
Yes, there are little puppps of seven
different colours in these tumors.

85
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:27,030
My body is full of little puppps
of seven colours.

86
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:35,436
I suffer so much.
Please hurry.

87
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:12,912
My body hurts!

88
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:15,995
I suffer.

89
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:19,158
Hurry UP!

90
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,991
Do if.

91
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:04,473
I am tired.

92
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:07,518
I need a break.

93
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:10,998
I go out to get some fish.

94
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:55,517
What?

95
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:59,478
Are you ok?

96
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:23,713
Don't die.

97
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:26,758
Don't die!

98
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:42,920
She died.

99
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:47,878
My mermaid is dead.

100
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,994
She died.

101
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:58,998
My precious mermaid died.

102
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:05,318
She died.

103
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:10,718
She died.

104
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:49,917
Quick, you have to point me.

105
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:58,995
You have to point me in the
moment before I die. Hurry up!

106
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:01,717
The painting.

107
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:05,959
It's finished.

108
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:08,714
Now I have to look after you.

109
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:13,478
No, it's too late.

110
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:16,758
You have to kill me now.

111
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:44,469
It's a long time ago that
I've seen the pointer from upstairs.

112
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:49,953
I wonder what has happened.
-I smell rotten fish.

113
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:54,990
It's so strange.
It makes me sick.

114
00:48:55,960 --> 00:48:58,918
Do you think something is wrong?

115
00:48:59,080 --> 00:49:01,833
What?

116
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:18,238
What's that?

117
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:29,989
Hiroshi...

118
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:34,998
Mr Haydashi?

119
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:41,598
It's open.

120
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:11,118
She's dead.

121
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:15,318
My mermaid is dead.

122
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,958
She is dead.

123
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:24,238
My mermaid is dead.

124
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:31,878
She is dead.

125
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:28,957
<i>So...</i>

126
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,799
What can I say?

127
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:38,111
The dead body must belong
to his wife.

128
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:45,958
It's a terrible story.
She was awfully injured.

129
00:52:46,040 --> 00:52:48,998
You know, there was a baby in there.

130
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:52,878
When I think about <i>if...</i>

131
00:52:56,080 --> 00:52:58,833
Are you ok?

132
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:03,158
I'm scared!

133
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:09,278
He killed his wife.

134
00:53:10,080 --> 00:53:13,038
Let us pass.

135
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:34,991
His wife had been bedridden
for a long time.

136
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:38,360
He was an art teacher.

137
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:41,193
A very gentle, friendly man.

138
00:53:45,080 --> 00:53:48,038
What will happen to him?

139
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:51,478
I have no idea.

140
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:37,989
Beautiful...

141
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:53,840
Beautiful...

142
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:08,679
This is the result of the investigation.
According to the autopsy report

143
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:13,709
the painter dismembered his wife.
She was pregnant, in her eight month

144
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:18,033
and was in the last state
of stomach cancer.

145
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:23,350
The foetus died in the mother.

146
00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:28,556
The pointer insisted on having killed
a mermaid.

147
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:33,434
According to the psychological test
he is schizophrenic

148
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:38,469
and got hospitalized.
This is the result of the investigation.

149
00:55:39,320 --> 00:55:42,870
A scale was found in his
bathtube.

150
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:47,318
The Japanese Fishery Laboratory
couldn't find out

151
00:55:48,600 --> 00:55:51,991
what kind of fish
if is from.
