DIRECTED BY
YASUZO MASUMURA

22
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:50,235
<i>My name is Sakura Nishi.</i>

23
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:57,117
<i>I left Japan for China in May, 1939,
as an army nurse.</i>

24
00:01:57,909 --> 00:02:00,871
<i>I was assigned
to the Tientsin Army Hospital.</i>

25
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:08,378
Nurse Taniguchi and you four, surgery.

26
00:02:09,546 --> 00:02:13,383
Nurse Nishi and you three,
general medicine.

27
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:16,261
- Nishi.
- Yes.

28
00:02:17,304 --> 00:02:23,143
Half of your patients are critical.
The rest are not.

29
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:26,521
They're mainly T.B.
and mentally ill patients.

30
00:02:26,647 --> 00:02:29,775
- Some aren't sick at all, so be careful.
- Yes.

31
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:37,324
Many can fake a fever
by agitating the thermometer.

32
00:02:38,325 --> 00:02:42,954
Mental patients who have recovered
pretend they're sick.

33
00:02:43,914 --> 00:02:49,127
They prefer being here
to manning the front lines.

34
00:02:50,087 --> 00:02:54,132
Seeing through their lies
is not my job.

35
00:02:54,257 --> 00:02:57,969
As you'll be with them every day,
that responsibility lies with you.

36
00:02:58,095 --> 00:02:59,680
Understand?

37
00:03:01,556 --> 00:03:06,645
<i>Outwardly, it's just like
a military hospital in Japan.</i>

38
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:10,899
<i>But in fact it's a field hospital.</i>

39
00:03:13,485 --> 00:03:16,738
- You're new here, aren't you?
- Yes.

40
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:18,699
Where was your last post?

41
00:03:19,574 --> 00:03:25,539
After graduating, I spent three years
at the Tokyo Army Hospital.

42
00:03:25,664 --> 00:03:29,084
Were you born in Tokyo?
Me too.

43
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:31,169
From Kiba, East Tokyo.

44
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:35,382
Kiba? Smart.
So, your family's in the lumber trade?

45
00:03:35,507 --> 00:03:39,344
I think my grandfather was,
I don't remember.

46
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:40,971
How come?

47
00:03:41,722 --> 00:03:45,225
My father died
a month before I was born.

48
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:47,394
My mother died when I was two.

49
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:49,896
An aunt raised me in West Tokyo.

50
00:03:51,022 --> 00:03:53,734
- How old are you?
- I'm 24.

51
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:58,613
I'm Private Sakamoto.
Also from Tokyo, so be nice to me.

52
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:08,957
Tokyo, eh?
Damn it, I wish I was back there!

53
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:17,716
- Nishi, time to make your rounds.
- Yes.

54
00:05:00,801 --> 00:05:04,012
ALL THE WORLD, UNDER ONE ROOF!
ADVANCE!

55
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:07,349
What are you doing?

56
00:05:07,474 --> 00:05:10,018
- I'll scream!
- Who cares?

57
00:05:12,521 --> 00:05:15,232
Let me go! Let me go!

58
00:05:27,911 --> 00:05:29,913
There's no use fighting back.

59
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:34,334
Everyone's bored.
They'll enjoy the show.

60
00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:01,403
<i>I reported everything the next night.</i>

61
00:06:02,988 --> 00:06:07,325
I see...
Private Sakamoto again?

62
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:11,037
You're his third victim.

63
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:18,879
He isn't fully recovered,
but this can't go on.

64
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:30,140
Hello, Nurse.

65
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:37,564
I'm being sent back to the front line.

66
00:06:38,773 --> 00:06:41,067
A death sentence.

67
00:06:41,192 --> 00:06:43,737
Hey... congratulate me.

68
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:50,368
Thanks for everything.

69
00:06:52,329 --> 00:06:53,747
Good luck.

70
00:06:55,707 --> 00:06:59,711
I really enjoyed it.
Next time it's my turn.

71
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:04,799
Stuck here all day,
a man needs a woman.

72
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:20,106
<i>My next posting, two months later,
was even worse.</i>

73
00:07:20,982 --> 00:07:23,777
<i>Hell couldn't be much worse.</i>

74
00:07:23,902 --> 00:07:26,446
<i>It was a front line hospital.</i>

75
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:32,911
FIELD HOSPITAL

76
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:46,883
Move them over here!

77
00:08:10,657 --> 00:08:11,992
Move them!

78
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:22,752
- Bullet wound.
- Bullet wound! Surgery!

79
00:08:26,256 --> 00:08:27,882
- Dead.
- Dead!

80
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:33,471
- Surgery.
- Surgery!

81
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:36,599
Hey, bury this one!

82
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:39,811
- Amputation.
- Amputation!

83
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:43,064
For burial!

84
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:44,816
- Dead.
- Dead!

85
00:08:46,276 --> 00:08:48,862
Put my foot back on!

86
00:08:48,987 --> 00:08:51,239
- Forget it, son.
- Put it back!

87
00:08:53,283 --> 00:08:54,701
- Amputation.
- Amputation!

88
00:08:54,826 --> 00:08:56,286
Help me!

89
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:00,331
All right, son. We'll stop the pain.

90
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:03,710
- No saving him.
- Yes, sir.

91
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:10,050
<i>Surgeâ€œ!-</i>

92
00:09:12,135 --> 00:09:14,054
Help me! Please!

93
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:16,931
Hey, control yourself!

94
00:09:17,599 --> 00:09:19,642
- Separate the dead.
- Yes, sir!

95
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:28,693
Amputation at the thigh.

96
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:32,822
- Anesthetic?
- Just local.

97
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:46,169
He's a kicker.
Hold him down, Nishi.

98
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:18,993
Idiot! Get back here!

99
00:10:49,691 --> 00:10:51,109
Mother!

100
00:10:54,445 --> 00:10:57,657
Alright, he's ready.
I'll sew him up.

101
00:11:17,051 --> 00:11:19,053
Get me a bandage.

102
00:11:28,563 --> 00:11:32,483
<i>Two hundred operations
over three days and three nights.</i>

103
00:11:34,152 --> 00:11:37,280
<i>Lieutenant Okabe, the surgeon,</i>

104
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:43,578
<i>as well as the medics and nurses,
all went without sleep.</i>

105
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:50,668
Arm next. Hold him down.

106
00:12:07,602 --> 00:12:12,732
<i>More and more men
were brought in.</i>

107
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:18,154
<i>Many died waiting for surgery.</i>

108
00:12:20,531 --> 00:12:22,909
<i>Some died during surgery.</i>

109
00:12:25,495 --> 00:12:29,832
<i>Others died after the operation.</i>

110
00:12:31,793 --> 00:12:34,754
<i>They all went to the morgue.</i>

111
00:12:44,806 --> 00:12:48,559
Hey, get their tags
or we won't know who's who.

112
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:04,575
<i>There was a mountain of tags.</i>

113
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:07,620
<i>It was the end of the third day...</i>

114
00:13:20,508 --> 00:13:22,552
His pulse is strong.

115
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:27,015
He's lost too much blood.

116
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:30,476
We can't help him.

117
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:36,357
Nurse Nishi...

118
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:43,239
It's me... Sakamoto.

119
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:50,371
Nurse Nishi, save me, please.

120
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:55,251
I'm sorry about what happened.

121
00:13:57,712 --> 00:14:01,215
I don't want to die.
I want to live!

122
00:14:02,425 --> 00:14:05,803
I'm begging you. Please save me.

123
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:10,850
Don't leave me!

124
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:16,022
Nurse Nishi...
Please don't let me die!

125
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:19,400
Don't let me die!

126
00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:25,615
- Doctor.
- What is it?

127
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:27,617
He needs a transfusion.

128
00:14:32,163 --> 00:14:33,664
Anesthetic.

129
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:42,799
Only colonels and above
get blood transfusions.

130
00:14:42,924 --> 00:14:46,386
I know this man. Please, Doctor.

131
00:14:46,511 --> 00:14:48,304
How do you know him?

132
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:53,351
He was my patient in Tientsin
for a while.

133
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:57,021
He's not kin, or even a friend?

134
00:14:58,356 --> 00:14:59,399
No, sir.

135
00:14:59,524 --> 00:15:03,653
We're swamped.
These others have a better chance.

136
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:13,037
If you come to my quarters tonight, Nishi,
I'll do it for you.

137
00:15:16,499 --> 00:15:17,959
Thank you, sir.

138
00:15:19,293 --> 00:15:20,920
Just this once!

139
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:37,437
<i>I didn't want him to die.</i>

140
00:15:37,562 --> 00:15:42,608
<i>I didn't want him to think
that was my revenge...</i>

141
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:46,446
<i>that I'd deliberately kill him.</i>

142
00:15:47,822 --> 00:15:50,408
<i>However, the transfusion didn't work.</i>

143
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:56,456
<i>By the end of the shift,
he was dead.</i>

144
00:15:59,584 --> 00:16:03,546
- Sakamoto! Sakamoto!
- What's up?

145
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:09,010
No pulse. His pupils are dilated.

146
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:12,555
He's been gut shot,
it kills them every time.

147
00:16:13,556 --> 00:16:16,392
What a waste of precious blood.

148
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:20,563
We'll take him out.
Throw him on the pile.

149
00:16:21,898 --> 00:16:23,900
One more dead!

150
00:16:47,882 --> 00:16:50,134
- Who is it?
- Nurse Nishi.

151
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:52,470
- Come on.
- Excuse me.

152
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:01,103
So, you actually came?

153
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:06,317
- Were you joking?
- No, I meant it.

154
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:10,571
- Pour me some wine.
- Yes, sir.

155
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:14,867
The spoils of war.

156
00:17:16,494 --> 00:17:18,120
Dr. Okabe...

157
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:23,125
The man we gave
the transfusion to has died.

158
00:17:26,963 --> 00:17:30,967
That's no surprise.
It would've been a miracle.

159
00:17:32,343 --> 00:17:35,221
I'm sorry I caused you trouble.

160
00:17:37,348 --> 00:17:40,643
Nishi, don't play favorites
with the patients.

161
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:47,650
Soldiers aren't human beings.
They're objects... just weapons.

162
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:52,363
Then, why did you operate
if you knew he'd die?

163
00:17:54,949 --> 00:17:58,786
Before I was drafted,

164
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:01,122
I was a specialist surgeon
at a large hospital.

165
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:04,333
But here I'm no doctor.

166
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:09,255
I have to decide who will live,

167
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:11,924
whether I can save them or not.

168
00:18:12,967 --> 00:18:16,137
Sometimes I long to be a doctor again.

169
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:22,893
I knew he'd die,
but I did my best anyway.

170
00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:30,693
The last vestiges of professional pride
made me go through the motions.

171
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:37,199
Hey, have a drink.
You'll sleep better.

172
00:18:38,159 --> 00:18:40,661
Yes, sir, I will.

173
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:46,792
What can I do to save
those truckloads of soldiers?

174
00:18:49,337 --> 00:18:53,299
Ruptured blood vessels,
smashed bones...

175
00:18:54,175 --> 00:18:57,303
Blood loss or gangrene
gets most of them.

176
00:18:58,179 --> 00:19:01,182
We've no blood
and hardly any medicine.

177
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:06,937
So I cut off their arms
and their legs.

178
00:19:07,063 --> 00:19:09,273
Even those who don't need it.

179
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,153
They say that I'm an expert at it.

180
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:20,284
I've cut off hundreds of limbs.

181
00:19:21,327 --> 00:19:23,746
I've crippled hundreds of men.

182
00:19:25,081 --> 00:19:27,333
God knows how many.

183
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:32,672
But you had to try to save their lives.

184
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:36,801
You think those soldiers believe that?

185
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:42,223
They'd be better off dead.

186
00:19:43,641 --> 00:19:45,768
What I'm doing is wicked.

187
00:19:46,936 --> 00:19:52,024
I either let them die, or I cripple them.
That's all.

188
00:19:55,528 --> 00:19:57,905
Am I a doctor?

189
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:00,282
It's a wonder I don't go mad.

190
00:20:01,659 --> 00:20:05,913
The war's to blame. Not you.

191
00:20:07,456 --> 00:20:08,874
The war?

192
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:13,796
As we attack,
our lines get longer.

193
00:20:15,089 --> 00:20:19,051
The enemy turns around
and attacks our rear,

194
00:20:19,176 --> 00:20:21,637
where our defenses are weak.

195
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:26,183
China's too big.

196
00:20:27,977 --> 00:20:30,062
It's a stupid war.

197
00:20:31,355 --> 00:20:37,737
But that's the Army's problem...
not mine.

198
00:20:41,282 --> 00:20:43,242
Get undressed.

199
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:45,661
I can't get drunk in front of a nurse.

200
00:20:49,415 --> 00:20:51,250
That's an order!

201
00:20:52,418 --> 00:20:53,544
Yes, sir.

202
00:20:58,007 --> 00:21:01,218
There's no tomorrow
on the battlefield.

203
00:21:02,845 --> 00:21:05,222
We live from day to day.

204
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:11,103
What happens today, whatever we do,
it all fades away tomorrow.

205
00:21:12,605 --> 00:21:14,607
You need not worry.

206
00:21:17,902 --> 00:21:19,403
Now come here.

207
00:21:41,217 --> 00:21:44,553
What's your first name, Nishi?

208
00:21:44,678 --> 00:21:46,138
It's Sakura.

209
00:21:46,263 --> 00:21:49,433
Sakura? As in "cherry blossom"?

210
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:50,976
Yes.

211
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:56,607
Just think, if you live long enough,

212
00:21:56,732 --> 00:22:00,152
you'll become
a 60- or 70-year-old Sakura.

213
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:03,364
Cherry blossoms only last
a few brief days.

214
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:05,950
I love my name.

215
00:22:06,784 --> 00:22:09,787
I'd like to live up to my name.

216
00:22:09,912 --> 00:22:11,372
Who named you?

217
00:22:12,498 --> 00:22:15,501
My father, who died
before I was born.

218
00:22:17,503 --> 00:22:20,256
In photographs, he looks like you.

219
00:22:23,592 --> 00:22:27,012
Enough drinking.
I need a shot now.

220
00:22:28,055 --> 00:22:30,349
It's all in that drawer.

221
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:33,185
What kind of injection is it?

222
00:22:35,062 --> 00:22:37,606
Never mind. Just do as I say.

223
00:22:38,399 --> 00:22:39,817
Yes, sir.

224
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:03,549
It's morphine, sir.

225
00:23:03,674 --> 00:23:07,845
Hurry up. It's almost dawn,
there's no time.

226
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:20,566
I just want to sleep,
sleep and forget everything.

227
00:23:25,613 --> 00:23:30,200
Nishi, will you stay here
until I fall asleep?

228
00:23:30,326 --> 00:23:31,744
Yes, sir.

229
00:23:34,496 --> 00:23:36,540
Summer nights are cold here.

230
00:23:37,791 --> 00:23:41,170
If you're cold,
you can share my blanket.

231
00:23:51,138 --> 00:23:53,599
<i>I was exhausted.</i>

232
00:23:56,101 --> 00:23:58,228
<i>I just wanted to sleep.</i>

233
00:24:03,192 --> 00:24:04,818
Hey, next!

234
00:24:32,638 --> 00:24:34,348
Are you awake?

235
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:38,102
It's noon.

236
00:24:38,227 --> 00:24:42,231
You've slept for ten hours straight.
Get some more rest.

237
00:24:43,691 --> 00:24:45,359
I have to go.

238
00:24:46,777 --> 00:24:48,779
They'll manage without you.

239
00:24:50,197 --> 00:24:52,700
I've told them that you're exhausted.

240
00:25:06,672 --> 00:25:08,257
Doctor...

241
00:25:09,216 --> 00:25:10,634
What?

242
00:25:12,553 --> 00:25:15,431
Did anything happen?

243
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:22,688
You think I took advantage of you?

244
00:25:24,314 --> 00:25:26,025
You undressed me.

245
00:25:26,817 --> 00:25:30,070
I didn't touch you.
Not that it matters.

246
00:25:31,071 --> 00:25:32,906
What does that mean?

247
00:25:34,742 --> 00:25:36,326
You wouldn't understand.

248
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,707
I'll go back.

249
00:25:53,635 --> 00:25:59,433
<i>We nurses went back
to the hospital in Tientsin</i>

250
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:02,686
<i>in a truck with the sick and wounded.</i>

251
00:26:05,439 --> 00:26:13,072
<i>By that time, I couldn't get
Dr. Okabe out of my mind.</i>

252
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:18,118
<i>Perhaps I'd begun
to fall in love with him.</i>

253
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:22,164
TIENTSIN MILITARY HOSPITAL

254
00:26:23,499 --> 00:26:25,876
So, how was the front line?

255
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:30,589
Do I smell strange?

256
00:26:30,714 --> 00:26:32,424
What kind of smell?

257
00:26:32,549 --> 00:26:37,971
The smell of blood.
I almost scrubbed my skin off, but...

258
00:26:38,097 --> 00:26:43,519
You're imagining it.
That's how you become a real nurse.

259
00:26:46,355 --> 00:26:50,818
Matron, what's Dr. Okabe really like?

260
00:26:52,069 --> 00:26:54,905
He's a fine officer
and an excellent surgeon.

261
00:26:56,031 --> 00:27:00,494
Nishi, I'm putting you in charge
of surgery this time.

262
00:27:10,754 --> 00:27:14,466
Excuse me, Nurse,
can you help me urinate?

263
00:27:14,591 --> 00:27:16,009
Just wait.

264
00:27:29,231 --> 00:27:32,526
Why were both of your arms
amputated, Orihara?

265
00:27:34,194 --> 00:27:37,781
The left one was blown off.

266
00:27:39,575 --> 00:27:43,704
Gangrene set in on the right arm,
so the doctor cut it off.

267
00:27:45,164 --> 00:27:46,582
Thank you.

268
00:27:52,171 --> 00:27:54,339
Which doctor?

269
00:27:54,464 --> 00:28:00,888
Dr. Okabe. He caught the tetanus
in time and saved my life.

270
00:28:02,973 --> 00:28:05,267
How many months have you been here?

271
00:28:06,768 --> 00:28:11,356
Six months.
My wounds have healed, but...

272
00:28:12,608 --> 00:28:17,779
You can't return to fighting.
You'll be going home. Have you got a wife?

273
00:28:18,906 --> 00:28:22,576
I shipped out two months
after we married.

274
00:28:24,786 --> 00:28:27,039
You can't wait to go home, then?

275
00:28:28,582 --> 00:28:29,791
Yeah...

276
00:28:30,834 --> 00:28:34,171
But, for some reason, I can't.

277
00:28:35,505 --> 00:28:39,051
I only bother the others here.

278
00:28:41,929 --> 00:28:43,931
Home will be better.

279
00:28:46,433 --> 00:28:51,104
Matron, Private Orihara's
almost fully recovered.

280
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:53,941
He hardly feels any pain.

281
00:28:55,317 --> 00:28:57,986
Why hasn't he been sent home?

282
00:28:58,111 --> 00:29:03,325
I wonder.
But that's not our problem.

283
00:29:05,327 --> 00:29:07,996
We're short of beds as it is.

284
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:14,503
It'd be best for him, and for us,
if he's sent home.

285
00:29:14,628 --> 00:29:16,672
Nishi, that's quite enough!

286
00:29:17,923 --> 00:29:21,927
It's not a nurse's place
to make those kind of decisions.

287
00:29:23,262 --> 00:29:24,680
Yes, ma'am.

288
00:29:26,098 --> 00:29:29,059
It's just... I feel sorry for him.

289
00:29:29,977 --> 00:29:31,979
Nurses do not have feelings.

290
00:29:33,146 --> 00:29:37,150
It's your duty to keep quiet
and get on with your work.

291
00:29:41,238 --> 00:29:43,073
I've given up.

292
00:29:44,825 --> 00:29:49,955
- I don't think I'll ever go home.
- Ever?

293
00:29:54,668 --> 00:29:56,461
Thanks.

294
00:29:56,586 --> 00:30:02,009
Not that I think the war will last forever.

295
00:30:03,552 --> 00:30:05,679
Why can't you go home?

296
00:30:07,014 --> 00:30:11,727
A soldier who'd lost both legs
was finally sent back.

297
00:30:13,312 --> 00:30:16,315
They kept him hidden
in a hospital in Hakone.

298
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:18,900
He wasn't even allowed
to see his family.

299
00:30:21,153 --> 00:30:24,656
They'll probably keep him
institutionalized forever.

300
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:29,036
That's my fate, too.

301
00:30:29,161 --> 00:30:30,954
But why?

302
00:30:33,373 --> 00:30:36,126
If people at home saw me,

303
00:30:36,251 --> 00:30:41,465
they'd realize how terrible war was
and hate it.

304
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:47,554
Some people would think
we were losing the war.

305
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:52,142
The Army brass
wouldn't like that at all.

306
00:30:56,188 --> 00:30:59,316
Sometimes... I wish I was dead.

307
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:02,861
That's how I feel.

308
00:31:02,986 --> 00:31:04,780
You poor man.

309
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:08,784
It must be agony.

310
00:31:08,909 --> 00:31:12,329
I'm used to it now, though.

311
00:31:13,455 --> 00:31:16,458
The one unbearable thing...

312
00:31:16,583 --> 00:31:18,001
What is it?

313
00:31:19,336 --> 00:31:20,754
It's...

314
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:25,258
No, never mind. It's nothing.

315
00:31:28,637 --> 00:31:30,847
Let's wipe you down.

316
00:31:37,979 --> 00:31:41,942
Nurse Nishi, would you mind
doing it at night for me?

317
00:31:42,067 --> 00:31:45,529
Why? I can't show you
any special favors.

318
00:31:45,654 --> 00:31:48,824
I don't want the others to see me.

319
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:56,248
Tonight, after Taps.
Can you wipe me down then?

320
00:31:56,373 --> 00:31:57,791
Please?

321
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:26,778
Right, let's wipe you down.

322
00:32:29,114 --> 00:32:32,367
I'm sorry to bother you.

323
00:32:33,702 --> 00:32:35,120
Nurse Nishi...

324
00:32:36,288 --> 00:32:41,209
Can you come every night
from now on?

325
00:32:41,334 --> 00:32:43,420
If you want me to.

326
00:32:43,545 --> 00:32:46,089
Please. I'd like you to.

327
00:32:53,013 --> 00:33:00,604
All you nurses take care of our meals
and everything...

328
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:03,648
with never a frown.

329
00:33:03,773 --> 00:33:05,817
It's our duty.

330
00:33:05,942 --> 00:33:13,116
But there's one thing
that no one does for me.

331
00:33:14,451 --> 00:33:16,286
Do you follow me?

332
00:33:18,788 --> 00:33:22,751
Nurse Nishi, I'm a man, too...

333
00:33:24,503 --> 00:33:28,465
I'm crippled, but I'm still healthy.

334
00:33:30,342 --> 00:33:35,472
The others all manage somehow...

335
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:39,184
but I have no hands.

336
00:33:41,478 --> 00:33:43,188
I'm helpless.

337
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:49,444
It's starting to drive me mad.

338
00:33:52,405 --> 00:33:54,658
Do you understand me?

339
00:33:54,783 --> 00:34:00,997
Yes, I learned about that
at nursing school.

340
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:05,293
Nurse Nishi, I'm asking you...

341
00:34:06,586 --> 00:34:09,005
Please save me.

342
00:34:11,383 --> 00:34:15,762
Please... touch my body.

343
00:34:17,556 --> 00:34:18,974
I beg you.

344
00:34:20,016 --> 00:34:25,689
Have you... asked this
of the other nurses?

345
00:34:25,814 --> 00:34:30,485
No, ma'am,
I've never asked anyone before.

346
00:34:32,237 --> 00:34:34,406
Only you, Nurse Nishi.

347
00:34:36,324 --> 00:34:37,742
I see.

348
00:34:41,037 --> 00:34:45,917
Nurse Nishi, I'm just a filthy man.

349
00:34:47,127 --> 00:34:48,628
A hateful man.

350
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:55,844
But I'm going to die
without ever seeing my wife again.

351
00:34:58,138 --> 00:35:01,600
Nurse Nishi... please help me.

352
00:35:13,194 --> 00:35:16,281
<i>Blood banks, medicine,
everything was scarce.</i>

353
00:35:16,406 --> 00:35:21,286
<i>Poor Dr. Okabe could only
amputate patients' arms and legs.</i>

354
00:35:23,288 --> 00:35:27,626
<i>However trivial, I decided
that I would try to ease his burden...</i>

355
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,795
<i>in my own way.</i>

356
00:35:34,341 --> 00:35:37,594
Nurse Nishi, am I asking too much?

357
00:35:39,763 --> 00:35:41,181
Not at all.

358
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:57,197
Thank you.

359
00:36:00,742 --> 00:36:05,789
You're the only one
who cared to save me.

360
00:36:08,333 --> 00:36:11,002
You poor, unfortunate man.

361
00:36:15,298 --> 00:36:16,633
Nurse Nishi...

362
00:36:19,052 --> 00:36:23,890
Please let me kiss you.
Just once.

363
00:36:35,985 --> 00:36:37,445
Miss Sakura.

364
00:36:39,948 --> 00:36:44,494
I want to touch your body.

365
00:36:45,745 --> 00:36:49,582
I don't mind, but...

366
00:36:51,918 --> 00:36:54,212
Since I lost my hands,

367
00:36:54,337 --> 00:36:57,841
my toes have become very sensitive.

368
00:36:59,843 --> 00:37:04,389
I can feel with them
just like my hands.

369
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:06,725
So...

370
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:10,854
- So?
- Please.

371
00:37:12,647 --> 00:37:19,487
Please let me put my foot
between your legs.

372
00:37:22,365 --> 00:37:23,783
Please.

373
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:29,038
Alright.

374
00:37:54,439 --> 00:37:57,484
I'm glad.

375
00:37:58,902 --> 00:38:00,904
I feel happy.

376
00:38:09,537 --> 00:38:11,956
Let Private Orihara
go out for a walk?

377
00:38:12,081 --> 00:38:15,126
Yes, he can walk fine.

378
00:38:15,251 --> 00:38:18,505
I think it will be good for him.

379
00:38:21,257 --> 00:38:23,343
But all alone?

380
00:38:24,636 --> 00:38:28,681
I'll escort him. Today's my day off.

381
00:38:29,724 --> 00:38:32,727
I see. Alright, then.

382
00:38:32,852 --> 00:38:35,230
We can't do much else for him.

383
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:40,985
Have him wear a coat
so his arms won't be too obvious.

384
00:38:42,403 --> 00:38:44,948
Treat him to something nice to eat.

385
00:39:00,088 --> 00:39:01,756
What is it?

386
00:39:01,881 --> 00:39:04,551
Where are we going?

387
00:39:04,676 --> 00:39:08,054
- Let's find a hotel.
- A hotel?

388
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:11,599
Just leave everything to me.

389
00:39:11,724 --> 00:39:12,934
Come on.

390
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:49,596
Let's take a bath together.

391
00:39:50,972 --> 00:39:52,181
A bath?

392
00:39:52,307 --> 00:39:54,934
I'll wash you. Come on.

393
00:40:12,994 --> 00:40:18,082
You can look at me
all you want to, Orihara.

394
00:40:19,167 --> 00:40:21,294
You can do anything you like.

395
00:40:22,378 --> 00:40:25,715
Tell me anything
you want me to do for you.

396
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:31,054
Why are you doing this for me?

397
00:40:33,556 --> 00:40:35,308
No particular reason.

398
00:41:27,276 --> 00:41:33,408
I have no arms, but I can do things
to make up for it.

399
00:41:35,451 --> 00:41:38,496
But what we're doing
won't happen again.

400
00:41:39,455 --> 00:41:42,125
- This is the last time.
- Yes.

401
00:41:45,378 --> 00:41:46,796
Probably.

402
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:50,299
Remember it.

403
00:41:51,467 --> 00:41:55,596
I'll never forget
what happened today.

404
00:41:56,597 --> 00:41:59,976
I'm truly very happy-

405
00:42:17,827 --> 00:42:21,831
Nishi, Private Orihara
has committed suicide.

406
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:28,296
How? He has no arms...

407
00:42:28,421 --> 00:42:31,340
He jumped from the hospital roof.

408
00:42:31,466 --> 00:42:35,595
He died instantly from a fractured skull.
He's been taken to the morgue.

409
00:42:37,513 --> 00:42:39,307
I can't believe it.

410
00:42:39,432 --> 00:42:42,101
This was found under his pillow.

411
00:42:43,603 --> 00:42:46,731
He wrote it with a pencil
in his mouth, I guess.

412
00:42:48,274 --> 00:42:50,777
It's addressed to you.

413
00:42:50,902 --> 00:42:53,237
I haven't told anyone else.

414
00:42:54,739 --> 00:43:00,578
<i>"Miss Sakura, I'll never meet
anyone like you again.</i>

415
00:43:01,913 --> 00:43:04,749
<i>"So, there's no point in living.</i>

416
00:43:04,874 --> 00:43:06,292
<i>"Thank you.</i>

417
00:43:07,126 --> 00:43:10,671
<i>"Farewell, Orihara."</i>

418
00:43:13,841 --> 00:43:17,428
Will you inform his family?

419
00:43:18,846 --> 00:43:21,849
He'll be listed as killed in action,

420
00:43:21,974 --> 00:43:25,061
and receive a promotion
to Private First Class.

421
00:43:26,896 --> 00:43:29,232
I believe I killed him.

422
00:43:31,609 --> 00:43:36,239
I tried to help him,
but I tortured him instead.

423
00:43:36,364 --> 00:43:38,491
This does not concern you!

424
00:43:38,616 --> 00:43:43,454
In war, it's everyone for themselves,
or there's no surviving it.

425
00:43:45,331 --> 00:43:49,168
Forget about Private Orihara
as soon as you can.

426
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:53,214
There's too much to forget.

427
00:43:54,465 --> 00:43:56,467
I can never forget.

428
00:44:01,472 --> 00:44:06,018
<i>Private Sakamoto
and then Private Orihara...</i>

429
00:44:08,271 --> 00:44:11,065
<i>I killed them both.</i>

430
00:44:14,610 --> 00:44:16,779
<i>A month later,</i>

431
00:44:16,904 --> 00:44:23,327
<i>we five nurses were transferred
back to the front lines.</i>

432
00:44:57,069 --> 00:45:00,990
I'm back again.
Have you been keeping well, sir?

433
00:45:02,116 --> 00:45:06,954
We meet again?
It seems like you and I are fated.

434
00:45:07,997 --> 00:45:12,752
You've been promoted.
Congratulations, sir.

435
00:45:13,711 --> 00:45:18,716
The more people we kill,
the more stars they give us.

436
00:45:20,843 --> 00:45:22,595
It's a strange life.

437
00:45:25,681 --> 00:45:27,683
Is there a major battle?

438
00:45:29,644 --> 00:45:34,357
Yes, Chiang Kai-shek
and his allies made an attack.

439
00:45:35,691 --> 00:45:38,569
Our army is stretched very thin.

440
00:45:38,694 --> 00:45:40,988
They were cut to pieces.

441
00:45:41,781 --> 00:45:44,242
The wounded are arriving in droves.

442
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:50,998
You have experience,
so I'll have you removing bullets.

443
00:45:52,959 --> 00:45:55,503
Can we manage?

444
00:45:57,129 --> 00:45:58,673
We have to!

445
00:46:00,675 --> 00:46:05,596
A handful of Japanese soldiers
are pitted against all of China.

446
00:46:07,181 --> 00:46:09,016
It's no easy war.

447
00:46:10,893 --> 00:46:16,816
The number of wounded will increase
and we're badly undermanned here.

448
00:46:17,984 --> 00:46:22,113
You'll have to work twice as hard, Nishi.

449
00:46:22,238 --> 00:46:24,532
If not, good men will die.

450
00:46:24,657 --> 00:46:26,784
Yes, sir. I will, sir!

451
00:46:30,371 --> 00:46:33,624
The wounded are arriving, sir.

452
00:46:33,749 --> 00:46:35,418
I'll be right there.

453
00:47:13,539 --> 00:47:15,875
Water! Give me water!

454
00:47:16,417 --> 00:47:17,668
Water!

455
00:47:21,964 --> 00:47:24,675
Be careful!
Don't bring dead bodies in here!

456
00:47:43,694 --> 00:47:47,281
- The bullet's still in there. Remove it.
- Yes, sir.

457
00:48:01,003 --> 00:48:06,258
<i>We began operating,
and did so for two days and two nights.</i>

458
00:48:07,426 --> 00:48:13,182
<i>I, alone, removed 160 bullets.</i>

459
00:48:27,321 --> 00:48:30,616
Can't save him. He's cut to pieces.

460
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:33,702
He's lost too much blood.

461
00:48:34,995 --> 00:48:38,457
Nishi, do you know
why the enemy did this?

462
00:48:39,834 --> 00:48:41,252
No, sir.

463
00:48:42,044 --> 00:48:46,841
He swallowed this.
It's a secret code.

464
00:48:48,050 --> 00:48:50,594
A communications officer.

465
00:48:51,637 --> 00:48:54,765
No time to burn it,
so he swallowed it.

466
00:48:57,309 --> 00:49:01,897
They cut him open to get it.

467
00:49:03,274 --> 00:49:05,860
While he was still alive?

468
00:49:06,944 --> 00:49:08,195
Yes.

469
00:49:16,912 --> 00:49:20,624
A fine soldier.
You did your duty well.

470
00:49:23,169 --> 00:49:25,004
A hero's death.

471
00:49:26,005 --> 00:49:29,258
He's dead.
Sew him up and ship him out.

472
00:49:40,352 --> 00:49:43,063
Shrapnel in the lower back.

473
00:49:43,189 --> 00:49:45,316
I'll have to operate.

474
00:49:45,441 --> 00:49:46,859
Anesthetic.

475
00:50:18,432 --> 00:50:21,936
I've changed my mind.
Close him up.

476
00:50:22,061 --> 00:50:23,687
Next patient.

477
00:50:28,859 --> 00:50:33,030
Why did he stop?
That was a waste of anesthetic.

478
00:50:33,155 --> 00:50:36,200
There's something different
about him today.

479
00:50:39,078 --> 00:50:43,874
<i>By the third night, all of the soldiers
had been treated.</i>

480
00:50:47,461 --> 00:50:49,630
- Is that you, Nishi?
- Yes, sir.

481
00:50:49,755 --> 00:50:51,632
- Come in.
- Yes, sir.

482
00:50:55,261 --> 00:50:57,263
Sit and have a drink.

483
00:51:02,601 --> 00:51:05,938
May I ask you a question, sir?

484
00:51:07,481 --> 00:51:09,108
What is it?

485
00:51:09,233 --> 00:51:13,737
Why didn't you operate
after administering the anesthetic?

486
00:51:16,490 --> 00:51:19,785
Officers don't need to explain
to lower ranks.

487
00:51:21,787 --> 00:51:27,084
I'll explain, though you probably
won't understand.

488
00:51:28,043 --> 00:51:29,503
Why is that, sir?

489
00:51:29,628 --> 00:51:34,300
You're a woman, but you have
no marital experience.

490
00:51:34,425 --> 00:51:37,344
What has marriage
got to do with it?

491
00:51:38,596 --> 00:51:43,017
He was wounded in the sacrum.

492
00:51:44,518 --> 00:51:45,936
Here.

493
00:51:47,730 --> 00:51:51,108
All the sensitive nerves...

494
00:51:52,735 --> 00:51:55,738
that govern sex are located there.

495
00:51:57,573 --> 00:52:03,996
If I'd operated on those damaged nerves,
what would be the result?

496
00:52:05,956 --> 00:52:09,209
He'd lose his masculinity. Forever!

497
00:52:12,504 --> 00:52:14,256
It made me think.

498
00:52:15,633 --> 00:52:19,345
If it doesn't fester,
he has a chance to live.

499
00:52:21,180 --> 00:52:25,476
If a good doctor operates
back home,

500
00:52:25,601 --> 00:52:28,687
he may leave the nerves intact.

501
00:52:33,025 --> 00:52:35,027
That's why I changed my mind.

502
00:52:36,278 --> 00:52:37,696
I see.

503
00:52:39,490 --> 00:52:43,869
I have no confidence
in the work I'm doing here.

504
00:52:43,994 --> 00:52:45,996
It's all wrong.

505
00:52:46,872 --> 00:52:49,124
I kill those who'd recover.

506
00:52:49,249 --> 00:52:52,503
And men, better off dead,
live as cripples.

507
00:52:53,087 --> 00:52:54,588
However...

508
00:52:59,009 --> 00:53:04,306
for men, becoming impotent

509
00:53:04,431 --> 00:53:07,184
is worse than being crippled.

510
00:53:09,812 --> 00:53:11,230
I'm tired.

511
00:53:12,314 --> 00:53:15,693
Give me a morphine shot.
I want some sleep.

512
00:53:34,169 --> 00:53:40,426
Nishi, stay until I fall asleep,
like you did last time.

513
00:53:42,469 --> 00:53:44,680
Hold me, if you want to.

514
00:53:45,556 --> 00:53:51,019
- If I'll do, sir.
- I wouldn't ask anyone else.

515
00:53:52,104 --> 00:53:55,566
- Will you stay till morning?
- Yes, sir.

516
00:53:55,691 --> 00:54:01,822
Don't worry, you'll be safe with me.
I won't even touch you.

517
00:54:02,948 --> 00:54:04,366
Why not?

518
00:54:05,409 --> 00:54:11,415
These days, I have no interest
in women at all.

519
00:54:11,540 --> 00:54:13,584
We're in different worlds.

520
00:54:14,877 --> 00:54:17,045
I only want to sleep.

521
00:54:17,171 --> 00:54:18,839
But why, sir?

522
00:54:20,090 --> 00:54:22,468
- You really want to know?
- Yes.

523
00:54:24,970 --> 00:54:27,681
Very well, then. I'll tell you.

524
00:54:29,391 --> 00:54:33,979
Since I started using morphine,

525
00:54:34,104 --> 00:54:36,523
I'm not a man any more.

526
00:54:37,691 --> 00:54:39,693
I haven't been for a long time.

527
00:54:43,697 --> 00:54:47,284
You have a wife, don't you?

528
00:54:47,409 --> 00:54:50,871
She died three years ago,
so it doesn't matter.

529
00:54:52,915 --> 00:54:56,251
Please stop using morphine.

530
00:54:57,503 --> 00:54:59,379
Why?

531
00:54:59,505 --> 00:55:03,050
I want to be held in your arms.

532
00:55:05,177 --> 00:55:06,970
What?

533
00:55:07,095 --> 00:55:10,140
I think I love you.

534
00:55:12,518 --> 00:55:14,770
I want you to touch me.

535
00:55:14,895 --> 00:55:19,483
You love me?
What a strange girl.

536
00:55:19,608 --> 00:55:21,819
You remind me of my late father.

537
00:55:23,570 --> 00:55:27,991
- A substitute, am I?
- No! I really love you.

538
00:55:28,742 --> 00:55:32,204
It's no good,
I can't give up the morphine.

539
00:55:34,540 --> 00:55:36,041
Why not?

540
00:55:38,544 --> 00:55:44,216
I'm a doctor...
but there's nothing I can do here.

541
00:55:45,384 --> 00:55:49,054
Without the drugs, I can't go on living.

542
00:55:50,597 --> 00:55:55,227
It's the same for the soldiers.

543
00:55:56,520 --> 00:56:01,316
They kill and pass it off as patriotism
to help them forget the horrors of war.

544
00:56:01,441 --> 00:56:06,655
There are so many things
that I'd like to forget.

545
00:56:08,782 --> 00:56:14,454
Nishi, it's no use talking.
Just give me the shot.

546
00:56:14,580 --> 00:56:15,998
Oh, sir...

547
00:56:18,417 --> 00:56:20,460
Inject me then get into bed!

548
00:56:25,340 --> 00:56:26,341
Yes.

549
00:56:52,451 --> 00:56:53,785
Nishi...

550
00:56:55,662 --> 00:56:57,664
I... really missed you.

551
00:56:58,999 --> 00:57:03,545
Goodnight... Lieutenant Okabe.

552
00:57:10,385 --> 00:57:15,599
You bastard... letting maggots hatch!
You swine!

553
00:57:18,435 --> 00:57:20,354
What's the matter?

554
00:57:21,271 --> 00:57:26,276
He removed a bandage
and let flies settle on the wound.

555
00:57:26,401 --> 00:57:28,528
And now it's festered!

556
00:57:28,654 --> 00:57:31,323
Why did you do that?

557
00:57:31,448 --> 00:57:34,993
He was afraid of being sent back
to the front line with such a minor injury.

558
00:57:35,118 --> 00:57:39,039
He's just trying to get sent home!

559
00:57:39,164 --> 00:57:42,751
What if the infection gets worse
and you lose your leg?

560
00:57:42,876 --> 00:57:46,213
Living as a cripple
is better than dying.

561
00:57:46,338 --> 00:57:50,550
My wife gave birth after I shipped out.

562
00:57:51,969 --> 00:57:54,054
I've never seen my son.

563
00:57:57,724 --> 00:58:00,936
Nurse Nishi, Dr. Okabe wants
to see you immediately.

564
00:58:06,274 --> 00:58:09,987
Nishi... I'm off to the front lines.

565
00:58:11,279 --> 00:58:15,242
One doctor, two nurses
and three medics.

566
00:58:15,367 --> 00:58:19,121
We leave tomorrow morning.

567
00:58:19,621 --> 00:58:22,416
- Were you ordered to?
- That's right.

568
00:58:23,709 --> 00:58:25,377
It's a tough battle.

569
00:58:26,461 --> 00:58:31,675
There's only one doctor there.
He can't cope alone.

570
00:58:32,426 --> 00:58:34,219
It's an emergency.

571
00:58:35,220 --> 00:58:38,473
So, it's goodbye for a while, Nishi.

572
00:58:39,224 --> 00:58:42,436
Doctor, please take me with you.

573
00:58:43,562 --> 00:58:46,982
The front line's too dangerous.
You could be killed. Stay here.

574
00:58:47,107 --> 00:58:51,069
No! I don't want to leave you, Doctor!

575
00:58:51,194 --> 00:58:52,612
Why not?

576
00:58:53,405 --> 00:58:55,240
Because I love you.

577
00:58:56,742 --> 00:58:58,035
Love?

578
00:59:02,164 --> 00:59:04,207
Do as you like, Nishi.

579
00:59:05,125 --> 00:59:08,670
But don't expect us
to have a life together.

580
00:59:10,047 --> 00:59:12,758
This is war.
We could die any day.

581
00:59:14,134 --> 00:59:15,427
I wonder...

582
00:59:15,552 --> 00:59:20,766
The only way to survive
is to regard everyone as a stranger.

583
00:59:21,683 --> 00:59:23,101
So stay.

584
00:59:23,226 --> 00:59:25,479
Matron said that as well.

585
00:59:27,105 --> 00:59:28,690
But I refuse.

586
00:59:30,233 --> 00:59:32,778
- It's an order.
- I refuse.

587
00:59:32,903 --> 00:59:35,739
- You'd disobey an order?
- Yes.

588
00:59:38,784 --> 00:59:40,744
A traitor to Japan.

589
00:59:40,869 --> 00:59:45,082
Doctor, what I'm afraid of
more than anything...

590
00:59:46,333 --> 00:59:51,755
is working apart from you,
and dying apart from you.

591
00:59:55,342 --> 00:59:58,345
It'll be fine. I'll be back.

592
00:59:59,763 --> 01:00:04,518
- Wait for me.
- No, please take me with you.

593
01:00:06,269 --> 01:00:08,021
You're stubborn.

594
01:00:09,022 --> 01:00:10,732
Who else, then?

595
01:00:11,942 --> 01:00:13,568
Nurse Tsuruzaki.

596
01:00:13,693 --> 01:00:19,407
She's new and inexperienced,
I'll take care of her.

597
01:00:33,839 --> 01:00:36,216
We're even further from Japan.

598
01:00:36,341 --> 01:00:38,343
That doesn't bother me.

599
01:00:38,468 --> 01:00:40,637
We're nearer to death.

600
01:00:42,514 --> 01:00:44,182
I don't care.

601
01:00:46,101 --> 01:00:48,436
Are you ready to die?

602
01:00:48,562 --> 01:00:51,690
The cherry blossom
has such a short life.

603
01:00:53,150 --> 01:00:55,110
The sooner the better.

604
01:01:03,034 --> 01:01:04,452
Halt!

605
01:01:15,463 --> 01:01:18,884
- Is Surgeon Lieutenant Okabe present?
- Yes. What is it?

606
01:01:19,009 --> 01:01:22,387
- I have your new orders, sir.
- Go ahead.

607
01:01:23,096 --> 01:01:28,351
You are to stay with us
until further orders, sir.

608
01:01:28,476 --> 01:01:30,270
Very well, we're in your hands.

609
01:01:30,395 --> 01:01:33,773
It's extremely dangerous ahead,
so we'll escort you, sir.

610
01:01:33,899 --> 01:01:35,358
Good man.

611
01:02:26,243 --> 01:02:28,245
We've arrived, sir.

612
01:02:32,958 --> 01:02:35,210
Excuse the men, ma'am.

613
01:02:35,335 --> 01:02:39,256
It's the first time they've clapped eyes
on a Japanese nurse.

614
01:02:39,381 --> 01:02:41,216
They're ecstatic.

615
01:02:44,386 --> 01:02:46,263
Time to head back.

616
01:02:49,140 --> 01:02:52,894
HEADQUARTERS

617
01:02:54,312 --> 01:02:57,941
Lieutenant Ishida, in command
of this outpost, sir.

618
01:02:58,066 --> 01:02:59,609
Please be seated.

619
01:03:02,153 --> 01:03:07,742
Our headquarters are situated
fifty kilometers from here.

620
01:03:07,867 --> 01:03:11,579
The enemy has commenced
a large-scale attack.

621
01:03:12,289 --> 01:03:17,460
They've broken through our lines,
and we've been cut off.

622
01:03:17,585 --> 01:03:22,382
I see. So that's why our journey
was cut short.

623
01:03:22,507 --> 01:03:24,217
Yes, sir.

624
01:03:24,342 --> 01:03:28,722
The enemy are better equipped
and outnumber us.

625
01:03:28,847 --> 01:03:31,558
We're unable to break through.

626
01:03:31,683 --> 01:03:36,813
- So we're surrounded?
- Yes, sir, and they've attacked twice.

627
01:03:37,605 --> 01:03:42,569
A mobile squad helped fight them off.

628
01:03:43,611 --> 01:03:45,905
And there's just one platoon here?

629
01:03:46,031 --> 01:03:50,702
Yes, sir, equipped with four light
machine guns. That's all we have.

630
01:03:51,745 --> 01:03:53,747
Any civilian Chinese?

631
01:03:53,872 --> 01:03:57,584
A handful of children
and elderly civilians.

632
01:04:00,045 --> 01:04:01,546
- Doctor...
- What is it?

633
01:04:01,671 --> 01:04:05,342
One of the comfort woman
has diarrhea.

634
01:04:05,467 --> 01:04:09,262
I suspect it could be cholera.
Please could you examine her, sir?

635
01:04:11,473 --> 01:04:12,974
Attention!

636
01:04:32,202 --> 01:04:34,829
No mistake. It's cholera, alright.

637
01:04:35,663 --> 01:04:37,999
She's badly dehydrated.

638
01:04:38,124 --> 01:04:44,047
Nishi, quarantine her
and give her warm water for 48 hours.

639
01:04:44,172 --> 01:04:45,840
She may pull through.

640
01:04:46,716 --> 01:04:48,760
How many comfort women are here?

641
01:04:49,844 --> 01:04:51,346
Two more, sir.

642
01:04:51,471 --> 01:04:55,100
They may have it, too,
so isolate them.

643
01:04:55,225 --> 01:04:58,937
Disinfect this hut thoroughly.

644
01:04:59,062 --> 01:05:01,272
- It's off limits to the men.
- Yes, sir.

645
01:05:05,527 --> 01:05:09,155
Cholera? That's one more enemy
to deal with.

646
01:05:11,950 --> 01:05:14,160
Is there nothing we can do?

647
01:05:16,746 --> 01:05:18,581
No medicine beats cholera.

648
01:05:19,749 --> 01:05:21,793
Just isolation and disinfection.

649
01:05:23,628 --> 01:05:27,173
Ideally, you should raze the village
and withdraw all troops.

650
01:05:28,425 --> 01:05:30,009
That's impossible.

651
01:05:32,178 --> 01:05:38,184
This is a strategic point.
We've been ordered to hold it at any cost.

652
01:05:39,269 --> 01:05:45,650
In any case, the cholera must be
contained, otherwise we all die.

653
01:05:47,193 --> 01:05:52,198
Issue the men an acid gargle
before meals.

654
01:05:54,659 --> 01:06:00,498
Sir, the soldiers want
the comfort women who aren't sick.

655
01:06:17,765 --> 01:06:19,184
Here they are!

656
01:06:20,101 --> 01:06:21,769
Back to your quarters!

657
01:06:25,815 --> 01:06:28,902
That's not allowed.
They're in quarantine.

658
01:06:34,657 --> 01:06:38,661
How about you, then?
A nurse would be much more fun.

659
01:06:54,719 --> 01:06:58,097
What are you doing?
Nurses aren't prostitutes!

660
01:07:00,725 --> 01:07:04,062
You're hungry, aren't you?
Hungry for a man?

661
01:07:05,772 --> 01:07:07,524
I'll pleasure you.

662
01:07:07,649 --> 01:07:09,067
You animal!

663
01:07:10,235 --> 01:07:12,570
This is the front line.

664
01:07:12,695 --> 01:07:17,075
We either kill men,
screw women or eat rations.

665
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:18,660
That's all!

666
01:07:19,410 --> 01:07:23,248
We get what we can
while we're still alive!

667
01:07:28,753 --> 01:07:30,255
You idiots!

668
01:07:31,005 --> 01:07:32,840
You want to die of cholera?

669
01:07:33,841 --> 01:07:35,260
Get out!

670
01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:42,392
You doctors get your pick of the nurses.
We don't.

671
01:08:02,078 --> 01:08:06,165
Twelve men and two comfort women
are infected now.

672
01:08:07,292 --> 01:08:09,043
Plus seven dead.

673
01:08:10,211 --> 01:08:11,838
How does it look?

674
01:08:13,381 --> 01:08:15,800
There will be more.

675
01:08:15,925 --> 01:08:20,888
The problem is that we've lost
half of our fighting strength.

676
01:08:22,098 --> 01:08:24,892
If they attack, we'll be wiped out.

677
01:08:26,686 --> 01:08:33,568
Sir, all of the remaining Chinese civilians
have slipped away.

678
01:08:35,236 --> 01:08:37,071
Afraid of the cholera?

679
01:08:37,822 --> 01:08:40,450
No doubt some spies
were amongst them.

680
01:08:40,575 --> 01:08:41,951
Spies?

681
01:08:42,076 --> 01:08:46,247
They must have introduced
the cholera virus.

682
01:08:47,498 --> 01:08:49,792
They must have fed something to her.

683
01:08:51,044 --> 01:08:55,673
That means... the enemy knows
our exact circumstances?

684
01:08:56,507 --> 01:09:00,136
Yes. We can expect an attack any time.

685
01:09:00,261 --> 01:09:03,181
You should contact HQ
and ask for reinforcements.

686
01:09:04,349 --> 01:09:08,478
We can't, sir.
Our radio equipment is down.

687
01:09:08,603 --> 01:09:10,563
Send a courier, then.

688
01:09:12,273 --> 01:09:14,108
It would be certain death.

689
01:09:15,777 --> 01:09:20,615
We're surrounded,
no one could break through alive.

690
01:09:23,576 --> 01:09:27,455
We're expecting a truck
tomorrow morning.

691
01:09:27,580 --> 01:09:30,041
We'll just have to wait it out.

692
01:09:33,628 --> 01:09:36,255
What's the matter, sir?

693
01:09:37,924 --> 01:09:39,967
Looks like I've caught it.

694
01:09:52,522 --> 01:09:55,191
Sergeant, a signal!

695
01:10:02,281 --> 01:10:05,868
That's bad. They'll attack tonight.

696
01:10:34,647 --> 01:10:37,942
Nurse Nishi, the doctor's asking for you.
Go at once.

697
01:10:44,323 --> 01:10:46,159
Take a break, nurse.

698
01:10:46,284 --> 01:10:49,412
You've worked all night,
we'll take over.

699
01:10:50,663 --> 01:10:52,540
- Nurse Tsuruzaki!
- Yes.

700
01:11:27,533 --> 01:11:29,285
- Nishi?
- Yes, sir.

701
01:11:29,410 --> 01:11:30,703
Enter.

702
01:11:35,291 --> 01:11:37,335
Reporting for duty.

703
01:11:40,046 --> 01:11:42,632
What's the latest count?

704
01:11:42,757 --> 01:11:45,134
Four new cases, sir.

705
01:11:49,680 --> 01:11:52,225
If I catch it, I'll pass it to you.

706
01:11:54,352 --> 01:11:56,646
Same thing if you catch it.

707
01:11:57,605 --> 01:11:59,899
Why did you summon me, sir?

708
01:12:03,611 --> 01:12:06,072
It's time for my shot of morphine.

709
01:12:07,490 --> 01:12:10,159
- I refuse.
- But I need it.

710
01:12:12,787 --> 01:12:15,289
Nishi, that's an order!

711
01:12:15,414 --> 01:12:20,002
Morphine is only for the most
critical of patients.

712
01:12:21,045 --> 01:12:26,884
Nishi, I'm starting to suffer
from withdrawal symptoms.

713
01:12:27,009 --> 01:12:29,428
Soon the fits will come.

714
01:12:29,554 --> 01:12:34,016
I don't want the others
to see me half-crazed.

715
01:12:36,477 --> 01:12:38,604
I beg you.
Bring me the morphine!

716
01:12:40,481 --> 01:12:47,363
If you don't quit now, Doctor,
it will affect your brain and heart.

717
01:12:47,488 --> 01:12:49,115
You'll die.

718
01:12:50,867 --> 01:12:53,119
A man like me is better off dead.

719
01:12:54,370 --> 01:12:58,749
It's also the drugs
that are keeping us apart.

720
01:13:00,668 --> 01:13:02,295
Please give it up.

721
01:13:03,921 --> 01:13:05,798
What would I gain?

722
01:13:08,134 --> 01:13:10,011
You'd gain me.

723
01:13:13,598 --> 01:13:15,558
You're a woman, Nishi.

724
01:13:16,767 --> 01:13:20,730
Yes, a woman who loves you.

725
01:13:22,148 --> 01:13:24,191
How do I quit?

726
01:13:24,317 --> 01:13:26,402
Please do as I say...

727
01:13:28,321 --> 01:13:30,781
as if I were a superior officer.

728
01:13:32,658 --> 01:13:35,411
You're ordering me to quit?

729
01:13:37,163 --> 01:13:40,708
I'll tie you up
and do what I have to do.

730
01:13:41,959 --> 01:13:44,795
- Tie me up?
- Yes.

731
01:13:47,673 --> 01:13:51,844
Well... we're caught
between cholera and the enemy.

732
01:13:54,931 --> 01:13:57,516
This could be our last night.

733
01:13:59,101 --> 01:14:01,938
Be my superior officer tonight.

734
01:14:02,063 --> 01:14:05,942
Do what you must,
but don't let anyone in.

735
01:14:17,078 --> 01:14:19,830
The Commander is down with cholera.

736
01:14:20,998 --> 01:14:23,334
I shall take over the command.

737
01:14:24,752 --> 01:14:27,546
An enemy attack is expected tonight.

738
01:14:28,756 --> 01:14:30,633
Man your positions!

739
01:14:53,155 --> 01:14:55,157
Just tonight...

740
01:15:07,336 --> 01:15:11,590
They'll attack tonight.
Reinforcements arrive tomorrow.

741
01:15:12,591 --> 01:15:15,386
We must not surrender the village!

742
01:15:28,524 --> 01:15:29,942
Nishi...

743
01:15:32,778 --> 01:15:34,697
- Nishi...
- Yes?

744
01:15:44,707 --> 01:15:46,709
You had it tough.

745
01:15:49,086 --> 01:15:50,880
I'm fine.

746
01:15:53,799 --> 01:15:55,843
Untie me.

747
01:15:59,263 --> 01:16:01,724
How long was I thrashing about?

748
01:16:01,849 --> 01:16:03,267
Five hours.

749
01:16:10,816 --> 01:16:12,985
Hey, two more have got it!

750
01:16:22,495 --> 01:16:26,415
Please hold me in your arms.

751
01:16:27,333 --> 01:16:29,335
Love me as a woman.

752
01:16:30,461 --> 01:16:31,879
I can't.

753
01:16:33,297 --> 01:16:36,926
I want to be a real woman,
not just a doll.

754
01:16:38,177 --> 01:16:40,262
Make love to me.

755
01:16:40,387 --> 01:16:45,017
I can't.
I'm not a man any more.

756
01:16:45,142 --> 01:16:48,395
No... that's all in your mind.

757
01:16:49,271 --> 01:16:52,650
Without the morphine, you can.

758
01:16:55,277 --> 01:16:59,281
Nishi... touch me.

759
01:17:10,793 --> 01:17:14,338
That's what I am.
You understand now?

760
01:17:17,091 --> 01:17:21,220
- I can't love you.
- No, it's alright.

761
01:17:24,515 --> 01:17:29,395
Hold me close,
as tight as you can.

762
01:17:32,064 --> 01:17:33,858
It's no use, Nishi.

763
01:17:34,942 --> 01:17:37,862
Don't give up. You can do it.

764
01:17:38,821 --> 01:17:42,408
It's no good.
I'll never return to my old self.

765
01:17:43,659 --> 01:17:47,163
No... you can.

766
01:17:52,877 --> 01:17:55,462
Present time: 0100 hours.

767
01:17:55,588 --> 01:17:59,592
Not long until dawn.
Hold out till then.

768
01:18:03,345 --> 01:18:07,141
Their light weapons don't frighten me.

769
01:18:08,559 --> 01:18:13,105
But if they bring in mortars,
we're all dead.

770
01:18:34,043 --> 01:18:35,377
Nishi...

771
01:18:36,962 --> 01:18:38,881
I can't believe it.

772
01:18:39,006 --> 01:18:41,675
Nurse Nishi has won.

773
01:18:42,927 --> 01:18:44,929
I'm myself again.

774
01:18:47,306 --> 01:18:49,266
It's like a miracle.

775
01:18:50,226 --> 01:18:54,813
Please say that you love your Sakura.

776
01:18:58,525 --> 01:19:02,529
You want me to say
I love you?

777
01:19:03,656 --> 01:19:06,492
I want you all to myself.

778
01:19:07,785 --> 01:19:09,828
You already have me.

779
01:19:09,954 --> 01:19:11,872
I want your heart, too.

780
01:19:13,999 --> 01:19:18,837
Not in wartime, no.
There's only fleeting pleasure.

781
01:19:19,713 --> 01:19:21,548
Not for me.

782
01:19:23,509 --> 01:19:26,553
I don't want to be a passing fancy.

783
01:19:28,555 --> 01:19:31,475
I want to be your true lover.

784
01:19:36,814 --> 01:19:41,443
But I have no heart to offer you now.

785
01:19:44,780 --> 01:19:47,908
Then I'll search for it.

786
01:19:54,081 --> 01:19:56,208
It's 0200 hours.

787
01:19:56,333 --> 01:20:00,296
Another three hours
and then we'll be safe.

788
01:20:01,672 --> 01:20:05,759
The enemy likes to attack at dawn!
Stay alert!

789
01:20:26,905 --> 01:20:29,283
- Sakura...
- Yes?

790
01:20:30,701 --> 01:20:32,119
I love you.

791
01:20:33,120 --> 01:20:35,414
Now I can say it truthfully.

792
01:20:37,624 --> 01:20:40,627
I'll never let you go.

793
01:20:43,630 --> 01:20:45,924
Tonight we reached
our greatest ecstasy.

794
01:20:47,301 --> 01:20:51,221
Though by tomorrow,
we may be dead.

795
01:20:53,390 --> 01:20:58,645
- You don't mind that?
- This is all that's important to me now.

796
01:21:02,316 --> 01:21:05,819
Get me the wine.
It's my last bottle.

797
01:21:08,989 --> 01:21:10,366
Let's drink a toast.

798
01:21:22,753 --> 01:21:26,965
I didn't know that military women
were so sweet.

799
01:21:27,883 --> 01:21:31,303
- Military women?
- I mean you nurses.

800
01:21:32,971 --> 01:21:34,973
Put on my uniform.

801
01:21:47,319 --> 01:21:49,196
Does it suit me?

802
01:21:49,321 --> 01:21:52,408
You look wonderful.
You make a fine officer.

803
01:21:59,039 --> 01:22:01,834
- Boots!
- Yes, sir.

804
01:22:20,561 --> 01:22:23,897
Would they salute me
if I went out?

805
01:22:24,022 --> 01:22:26,024
First, they'd laugh.

806
01:22:26,150 --> 01:22:27,860
Sword and gun!

807
01:22:29,111 --> 01:22:30,779
I'm afraid not.

808
01:22:34,158 --> 01:22:38,579
Dr. Okabe, pour me some wine.

809
01:22:39,413 --> 01:22:40,706
Yes, sir!

810
01:22:42,624 --> 01:22:44,209
Here, Major Nishi.

811
01:22:49,089 --> 01:22:51,091
- Sergeant!
- What is it?

812
01:22:51,216 --> 01:22:52,634
The enemy!

813
01:23:01,435 --> 01:23:04,104
I prefer being a woman.

814
01:23:05,522 --> 01:23:09,526
Then let me give you
some pleasure.

815
01:23:11,820 --> 01:23:15,616
I can hear your heart thumping.

816
01:23:15,741 --> 01:23:17,534
It's the wine.

817
01:23:20,120 --> 01:23:21,455
Nishi...

818
01:23:24,833 --> 01:23:28,545
I wish we'd met in Japan
in peacetime.

819
01:23:50,192 --> 01:23:52,027
Here comes the attack.

820
01:23:58,992 --> 01:24:01,870
The enemy...
There's no escape.

821
01:24:02,996 --> 01:24:06,416
- Will you die with me?
- Yes. By your side.

822
01:24:07,668 --> 01:24:12,714
I've lived 40 years.
A long life, yet short too.

823
01:24:13,966 --> 01:24:16,301
I guess this is the end.

824
01:24:18,220 --> 01:24:22,224
I can die happy,
because I love you.

825
01:24:35,654 --> 01:24:37,489
Your mark, Sakura?

826
01:24:38,574 --> 01:24:42,035
I'll give you a mark, too.
Where?

827
01:24:44,037 --> 01:24:46,540
The same place as yours.

828
01:24:50,210 --> 01:24:54,631
Sakura... thanks to you,
I can die like a soldier.

829
01:24:57,676 --> 01:24:59,720
You must not weep for me.

830
01:25:15,068 --> 01:25:16,820
Enemy attack, sir!

831
01:25:19,031 --> 01:25:20,532
Follow me!

832
01:25:32,294 --> 01:25:34,421
You two stay here!

833
01:25:35,088 --> 01:25:37,090
Keep your head down!

834
01:25:38,508 --> 01:25:41,261
Hold your fire! It's still too dark!

835
01:25:42,471 --> 01:25:46,016
Don't waste ammunition!
Wait till they're close!

836
01:25:48,226 --> 01:25:52,105
- What's the situation?
- We're completely surrounded, sir.

837
01:25:52,230 --> 01:25:57,069
They're using mortars to soften us up.

838
01:25:57,778 --> 01:26:00,238
It's just before they attack.

839
01:26:00,364 --> 01:26:02,824
It doesn't look good.

840
01:26:02,949 --> 01:26:07,204
We still have an hour till dawn.
There's a slim chance.

841
01:26:07,329 --> 01:26:08,747
Right!

842
01:26:19,091 --> 01:26:23,303
Orderlies and nurses are soldiers, too!
You must take up arms!

843
01:26:33,647 --> 01:26:37,567
Fire! Give them all you've got!

844
01:27:02,259 --> 01:27:04,511
Hey, pull yourself together!

845
01:27:06,054 --> 01:27:07,931
Protect your patients!

846
01:27:14,104 --> 01:27:16,440
Here they come! Dig in!

847
01:27:48,930 --> 01:27:51,516
Sir, the sergeant's dead!

848
01:27:52,559 --> 01:27:54,603
Right, I'll take command.

849
01:28:01,276 --> 01:28:06,239
Fight, Tsuruzaki!
Fire at least one shot before you die!

850
01:28:06,364 --> 01:28:07,866
I'm scared!

851
01:28:08,950 --> 01:28:11,828
- Come on!
- No!

852
01:28:14,664 --> 01:28:16,541
- Come back!
- Stay here!

853
01:28:16,666 --> 01:28:18,627
Tsuruzaki!
Grab her!

854
01:28:20,003 --> 01:28:23,423
- She's gone mad!
- Following her would be suicide!

855
01:28:44,778 --> 01:28:50,242
<i>I have killed yet again.
She was my third victim.</i>

856
01:29:47,841 --> 01:29:50,343
Nogami! Nogami!

857
01:30:27,631 --> 01:30:29,799
<i>I was still alive.</i>

858
01:30:31,593 --> 01:30:33,887
<i>Without a single scratch.</i>

859
01:31:00,080 --> 01:31:01,539
Anybody still alive?

860
01:31:08,630 --> 01:31:11,299
Halt! Who goes there?

861
01:31:12,801 --> 01:31:15,178
I'm an army nurse!

862
01:31:17,430 --> 01:31:21,810
We're reinforcements!
We routed them! You're safe now!

863
01:31:23,645 --> 01:31:27,065
Don't come any closer!
We have a cholera epidemic.

864
01:31:27,190 --> 01:31:28,608
Cholera?

865
01:31:28,733 --> 01:31:31,945
Send medical personnel immediately.

866
01:31:32,070 --> 01:31:34,948
- Any other survivors?
- I don't know.

867
01:31:35,824 --> 01:31:39,452
The cholera and the fighting
killed most of them.

868
01:31:42,956 --> 01:31:45,083
Understood. Wait here!

869
01:32:04,894 --> 01:32:08,523
<i>Tsuruzaki... forgive me.</i>

870
01:32:11,067 --> 01:32:15,238
<i>This is how I will end up, too.</i>

871
01:32:47,187 --> 01:32:51,608
<i>All the bodies were stripped
of their clothing.</i>

872
01:32:53,860 --> 01:32:57,655
<i>Weapons, clothing, boots...</i>

873
01:32:59,115 --> 01:33:03,870
<i>The enemy took everything
that they could possibly use.</i>

874
01:33:07,499 --> 01:33:08,917
Doctor!

875
01:33:11,086 --> 01:33:12,504
Doctor!

876
01:33:14,214 --> 01:33:16,216
Lieutenant Okabe!
