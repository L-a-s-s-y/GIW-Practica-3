00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:41,292
THE WIND WILL CARRY US

2
00:00:42,919 --> 00:00:46,297
A film by Abbas KIAROSTAMI

3
00:00:52,345 --> 00:00:54,430
Where's the tunnel then?

4
00:00:54,597 --> 00:00:56,474
We've passed it.

5
00:00:56,641 --> 00:00:57,433
When?

6
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,727
Someone's been sleeping!

7
00:01:00,395 --> 00:01:01,354
Where is it?

8
00:01:01,521 --> 00:01:04,274
We've passed it, back near Biston.

9
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:06,985
We're heading nowhere.

10
00:01:07,151 --> 00:01:09,737
Read the address to see where it is.

11
00:01:10,154 --> 00:01:12,240
How many times do I have to read it?

12
00:01:12,407 --> 00:01:15,034
After the junction,
we take a winding road.

13
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:17,120
This is the winding road.

14
00:01:17,328 --> 00:01:19,080
We're on it.

15
00:01:19,956 --> 00:01:21,958
After this road, we head downhill.

16
00:01:22,125 --> 00:01:25,169
Then there's a single tree.

17
00:01:25,336 --> 00:01:27,463
There are a lot here.

18
00:01:27,922 --> 00:01:30,174
- What's after that?
- Nothing.

19
00:01:30,633 --> 00:01:33,261
I know what there is. Nothing.

20
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,722
- Nothing?
- There's a road near the tree.

21
00:01:35,888 --> 00:01:37,473
I'll tell you what there is.

22
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:42,395
<i>"Near the tree is a wooded lane,
greener than the dreams of God."</i>

23
00:01:44,147 --> 00:01:46,983
What's after the tree?
Read the address.

24
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:49,611
It says a tall, single tree.

25
00:01:49,777 --> 00:01:51,988
There's a lot on this hillside.

26
00:01:52,572 --> 00:01:54,198
Is it very tall?

27
00:01:54,699 --> 00:01:57,869
Yes, it says it's very tall.

28
00:01:58,036 --> 00:02:00,288
It must be different
from the others then.

29
00:02:00,455 --> 00:02:03,249
The single tree? There are so many.

30
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:05,335
They're all on the hill.

31
00:02:05,501 --> 00:02:08,463
That's what it says here.

32
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:11,758
I don't think this
will get us anywhere.

33
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,885
There it is.

34
00:02:14,052 --> 00:02:16,012
There, look, a single tree!

35
00:02:16,137 --> 00:02:17,764
- Where?
- Up there.

36
00:02:19,807 --> 00:02:20,683
I see it...

37
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:23,770
What a big tree! Look at it.

38
00:02:25,772 --> 00:02:27,857
He was right.

39
00:02:28,024 --> 00:02:29,859
Jahan, take a look.

40
00:02:30,193 --> 00:02:30,902
Where?

41
00:02:31,069 --> 00:02:33,988
Too late now, you'll have to look up
through the roof

42
00:02:34,155 --> 00:02:36,658
but you won't see it.

43
00:02:36,783 --> 00:02:40,244
Or through the rear window if
you're brave enough to turn round.

44
00:02:41,913 --> 00:02:43,706
It's so big!

45
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:49,545
We've passed the single tree.

46
00:02:49,712 --> 00:02:51,255
And loads of others.

47
00:02:51,381 --> 00:02:53,174
Two more up there. It's beautiful!

48
00:02:53,341 --> 00:02:57,261
I said we're reaching
two single trees.

49
00:02:58,805 --> 00:03:01,224
It would help
if we could ask someone.

50
00:03:01,391 --> 00:03:04,143
Don't worry, we'll find someone.

51
00:03:04,686 --> 00:03:05,895
We can ask them.

52
00:03:06,062 --> 00:03:08,564
Slow down a bit.

53
00:03:09,524 --> 00:03:11,651
- We may not find anyone.
- We will.

54
00:03:11,818 --> 00:03:14,487
This is farmland,
they're out working.

55
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,498
We have to ask.

56
00:03:25,748 --> 00:03:29,001
Don't worry, we'll find someone.

57
00:03:31,796 --> 00:03:35,216
I can see a black spot
in the distance.

58
00:03:35,591 --> 00:03:38,886
Over there. He can't hear us.

59
00:03:39,262 --> 00:03:41,472
Wait, I'll go and ask him.

60
00:03:42,473 --> 00:03:43,850
Ask that one.

61
00:03:44,016 --> 00:03:46,769
Ask her.

62
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:48,354
Hello, ma'am.

63
00:03:48,521 --> 00:03:49,856
Hello, I'm honoured.

64
00:03:50,022 --> 00:03:52,191
How do we get to Siah Dareh?

65
00:03:53,484 --> 00:03:57,989
200 yards after the junction,
turn left.

66
00:03:58,573 --> 00:04:00,783
Thank you. Good-bye.

67
00:04:04,203 --> 00:04:06,205
Look, it's behind the hill.

68
00:04:06,873 --> 00:04:10,126
Wait till we pass that tree.
Look into the distance.

69
00:04:10,293 --> 00:04:12,170
On the hill.

70
00:04:12,628 --> 00:04:15,757
- Siah Dareh's over there?
- Yes, that's it.

71
00:04:15,882 --> 00:04:17,967
It says:
"At the foot of the mountain."

72
00:04:18,676 --> 00:04:20,720
Hello, why are you late?

73
00:04:20,887 --> 00:04:22,722
- Why are you late?
- You've been waiting for us?

74
00:04:22,889 --> 00:04:24,515
- Yes.
- Who told you to wait?

75
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,808
My uncle.

76
00:04:25,975 --> 00:04:27,435
I see, your uncle is...

77
00:04:27,435 --> 00:04:28,770
Mr Hashemi Masti.

78
00:04:29,854 --> 00:04:32,440
It's a long way to your village...

79
00:04:32,607 --> 00:04:33,441
It's not far!

80
00:04:33,733 --> 00:04:36,569
Not far?
What do you think of your village?

81
00:04:36,903 --> 00:04:41,032
I've lived here since I was born,
I know it.

82
00:04:41,365 --> 00:04:43,785
We're your guests then?

83
00:04:44,327 --> 00:04:45,578
Yes.

84
00:04:47,705 --> 00:04:49,457
Do I turn left here?

85
00:05:00,134 --> 00:05:02,637
- You were waiting for us then?
- Yes.

86
00:05:03,054 --> 00:05:05,097
Since two p.m.

87
00:05:05,431 --> 00:05:09,477
I've been waiting since school
finished for the day.

88
00:05:09,644 --> 00:05:11,562
My uncle said:

89
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:15,733
"My friends are coming.
Bring them to the house."

90
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,611
- Did he say why we've come?
- Yes.

91
00:05:18,778 --> 00:05:21,364
But you mustn't tell anyone.

92
00:05:21,489 --> 00:05:23,199
- All right.
- Good boy.

93
00:05:24,283 --> 00:05:28,454
If anyone asks, say we're looking
for lost treasure.

94
00:05:29,372 --> 00:05:30,331
Good idea.

95
00:05:31,332 --> 00:05:36,087
If anyone asks, say we're looking
for treasure.

96
00:05:36,712 --> 00:05:38,965
Imagine I ask you:

97
00:05:39,215 --> 00:05:41,259
- "What are they here for?"
- Treasure.

98
00:05:41,384 --> 00:05:42,969
It could mean trouble.

99
00:05:43,261 --> 00:05:44,428
Not at all.

100
00:05:46,389 --> 00:05:47,890
What a beautiful village!

101
00:05:48,057 --> 00:05:49,976
Yes, it's very beautiful.

102
00:05:50,309 --> 00:05:53,187
You've hidden it well.

103
00:05:53,271 --> 00:05:54,647
We haven't hidden it!

104
00:05:55,147 --> 00:05:57,358
The ancestors built it here.

105
00:05:57,525 --> 00:05:59,360
It was them then!

106
00:06:00,486 --> 00:06:02,989
They built it like this
so no one would steal it.

107
00:06:03,155 --> 00:06:06,409
Tell me, why do you think
they built it here?

108
00:06:06,868 --> 00:06:11,122
Because I wasn't there.

109
00:06:11,747 --> 00:06:15,376
You weren't here before then?

110
00:06:15,543 --> 00:06:18,170
Did you arrive recently?

111
00:06:21,841 --> 00:06:24,343
I think the car has a problem.

112
00:06:25,887 --> 00:06:27,346
It's stalling.

113
00:06:28,097 --> 00:06:30,600
It struggles on hills.

114
00:06:31,142 --> 00:06:33,769
The gauge isn't working.

115
00:06:34,312 --> 00:06:36,772
Yes, it has a problem.

116
00:06:57,501 --> 00:06:59,086
Farzad, get out.

117
00:07:01,505 --> 00:07:04,008
- Is there water here?
- Yes, over there.

118
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:06,677
Get out, guys, and check the car.

119
00:07:06,844 --> 00:07:09,305
Try to find out what's wrong.

120
00:07:20,691 --> 00:07:22,652
Has your car broken down?

121
00:07:22,818 --> 00:07:25,363
Our car? It's given up the ghost.

122
00:07:26,113 --> 00:07:27,365
Meaning?

123
00:07:29,158 --> 00:07:30,952
It can't go on.

124
00:07:31,118 --> 00:07:33,454
You know, a car is like a man.

125
00:07:33,955 --> 00:07:37,458
It needs to rest and restore itself.

126
00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:40,294
It's given up the ghost.
It's overheating.

127
00:07:43,005 --> 00:07:45,800
Can it be mended?

128
00:07:46,801 --> 00:07:48,177
Yes, it will work again.

129
00:07:48,511 --> 00:07:51,847
Don't ask so many questions
or I'll give up the ghost too...

130
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:53,808
at this altitude.

131
00:07:53,891 --> 00:07:55,393
I've forgotten my book.

132
00:07:55,559 --> 00:07:57,603
- What?
- I've forgotten my book.

133
00:07:57,979 --> 00:08:00,690
Don't worry,
the others will bring it.

134
00:08:01,065 --> 00:08:02,483
I have exams.

135
00:08:02,608 --> 00:08:05,194
They'll be coming up
to join us soon.

136
00:08:05,569 --> 00:08:07,446
I have to study.

137
00:08:07,613 --> 00:08:09,490
I'll tell them to bring it.

138
00:08:09,824 --> 00:08:13,911
I have to study
to have a good grade.

139
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:15,413
What a pest...

140
00:08:15,579 --> 00:08:19,583
Ali, bring him up the book.

141
00:08:25,423 --> 00:08:26,424
Where is it?

142
00:08:26,882 --> 00:08:28,718
On top of the dashboard.

143
00:08:31,679 --> 00:08:33,514
People always come this way?

144
00:08:34,348 --> 00:08:36,892
No, there are several
different paths.

145
00:08:37,810 --> 00:08:39,395
It's a tough one.

146
00:08:39,729 --> 00:08:41,564
This isn't the main path.

147
00:08:42,023 --> 00:08:43,691
Where is it?

148
00:08:43,816 --> 00:08:47,445
It's a long way off.
This path is shorter.

149
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:50,239
- Is that why we've taken it?
- Yes.

150
00:09:01,876 --> 00:09:04,045
Wait, why are you going so fast?

151
00:09:06,005 --> 00:09:07,631
It was the best way!

152
00:09:07,798 --> 00:09:10,009
That's what you want.

153
00:09:10,259 --> 00:09:12,720
All right, but aren't you the guide?

154
00:09:13,054 --> 00:09:15,347
Are you ennoyed?

155
00:09:15,723 --> 00:09:18,392
Not "ennoyed", "annoyed"!

156
00:09:19,226 --> 00:09:20,436
Annoyed?

157
00:09:20,686 --> 00:09:23,981
Not yet, but if you carry on,
I soon will be.

158
00:10:00,392 --> 00:10:02,353
Welcome, engineer.

159
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:03,604
Hello.

160
00:10:03,896 --> 00:10:05,856
- We're honoured.
- The honour's mine.

161
00:10:07,608 --> 00:10:08,943
This is it.

162
00:10:09,151 --> 00:10:10,569
Welcome.

163
00:10:14,323 --> 00:10:16,492
This is one of the rooms.

164
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:22,289
What did she say?

165
00:10:22,414 --> 00:10:26,919
If it's too small,
there are other rooms.

166
00:10:27,336 --> 00:10:31,298
Thank you, we'll only be staying
a couple of nights.

167
00:10:31,674 --> 00:10:33,175
Make yourself at home.

168
00:10:33,342 --> 00:10:35,302
This is the bathroom.

169
00:10:35,469 --> 00:10:36,846
Another bedroom...

170
00:10:37,221 --> 00:10:39,098
That's good. Thank you.

171
00:10:39,265 --> 00:10:41,559
- Where's the old lady's house?
- Who?

172
00:10:41,892 --> 00:10:44,895
- The lady who's ill.
- You mean Malek?

173
00:10:45,271 --> 00:10:46,480
Yes, son.

174
00:10:46,564 --> 00:10:49,191
She lives over there.

175
00:10:52,194 --> 00:10:54,238
You can see it from the roof.

176
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:56,615
- Which way?
- This way.

177
00:10:58,242 --> 00:11:00,286
- Can we see it from here?
- Yes.

178
00:11:03,247 --> 00:11:05,583
See that blue window?

179
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:06,625
Which one?

180
00:11:06,792 --> 00:11:10,713
Over there, near the lady
sitting on the steps.

181
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:12,882
You can't see much from here.

182
00:11:13,048 --> 00:11:15,801
Let's go up higher, I'll show you.

183
00:11:16,135 --> 00:11:17,761
- Which way?
- This way.

184
00:11:18,012 --> 00:11:19,305
Let's go.

185
00:11:23,601 --> 00:11:25,102
Farzad.

186
00:11:26,228 --> 00:11:29,190
Why don't you bring us back
the soup bowl?

187
00:11:29,356 --> 00:11:31,442
I'll return it.

188
00:11:32,359 --> 00:11:33,736
I need it.

189
00:11:33,861 --> 00:11:35,070
Who is that lady?

190
00:11:35,237 --> 00:11:36,697
That lady there?

191
00:11:36,989 --> 00:11:38,073
No, the neighbour.

192
00:11:38,324 --> 00:11:39,867
Mim Khamman.

193
00:11:40,034 --> 00:11:41,243
What does that mean?

194
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:43,120
My aunt on my father's side.

195
00:11:43,454 --> 00:11:46,665
- Hello, engineer.
- Hello, are you well?

196
00:11:46,916 --> 00:11:49,585
- How's your family?
- Very well.

197
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,795
- Who's that?
- My mother.

198
00:11:52,046 --> 00:11:53,631
- Are you well?
- Yes, thank you.

199
00:11:53,797 --> 00:11:55,633
Are you Mr Hashemi's sister?

200
00:11:55,925 --> 00:11:57,760
He sends his greetings.

201
00:11:57,968 --> 00:11:59,428
He wasn't able to come.

202
00:11:59,595 --> 00:12:00,638
I understand.

203
00:12:00,888 --> 00:12:02,431
I'm at your service.

204
00:12:02,765 --> 00:12:05,976
Farzad, help them bring the gear in.

205
00:12:06,143 --> 00:12:07,561
All right.

206
00:12:07,895 --> 00:12:10,105
Where are you going?
Is she your aunt?

207
00:12:10,231 --> 00:12:11,815
Yes.

208
00:12:12,191 --> 00:12:13,943
Why don't we go to your mother's?

209
00:12:14,068 --> 00:12:17,780
She says that our house
is too small

210
00:12:18,113 --> 00:12:19,823
and that you deserve better.

211
00:12:24,954 --> 00:12:27,039
I think your mother's wrong.

212
00:12:27,998 --> 00:12:30,167
Small things have their value too.

213
00:12:31,293 --> 00:12:32,711
You're small but skilful.

214
00:12:32,878 --> 00:12:34,964
I'm going to grow.

215
00:12:35,381 --> 00:12:38,717
The house won't grow though.

216
00:12:42,012 --> 00:12:45,516
You'll grow up and go to school.

217
00:12:45,891 --> 00:12:48,727
- How far does your school go?
- Until 11.

218
00:12:49,436 --> 00:12:52,231
You want to keep on studying after?

219
00:12:52,564 --> 00:12:56,986
I'll go to Momenieh until I'm 15.

220
00:12:58,112 --> 00:13:00,489
For the final years,
I'll go to Kermanshah.

221
00:13:04,868 --> 00:13:06,370
Where is it?

222
00:13:07,746 --> 00:13:10,457
Over there, look.

223
00:13:19,341 --> 00:13:21,885
It's over there. Look.

224
00:13:24,346 --> 00:13:25,973
The blue window.

225
00:13:27,474 --> 00:13:30,185
- The blue window?
- And that's her son.

226
00:13:30,853 --> 00:13:32,688
I see, he's her son.

227
00:13:32,813 --> 00:13:33,689
Yes.

228
00:13:36,358 --> 00:13:38,527
Where's the cemetery?

229
00:13:39,153 --> 00:13:41,071
Up on the hill.

230
00:13:44,074 --> 00:13:45,326
I have to go.

231
00:13:45,492 --> 00:13:49,038
I'll take the others to Hammad's.

232
00:13:50,122 --> 00:13:52,041
Are you worried about them
or your book?

233
00:13:52,207 --> 00:13:55,127
My book. I have an exam tomorrow.

234
00:13:57,379 --> 00:13:58,505
You'll come back?

235
00:13:58,672 --> 00:14:03,218
Yes, I'm going to the fields
to get my things.

236
00:14:12,478 --> 00:14:14,229
Where's the engineer from?

237
00:14:16,398 --> 00:14:18,442
Tehran or Hamadan?

238
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:50,182
Get up, you've slept enough,

239
00:14:50,349 --> 00:14:52,017
you layabouts.

240
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:55,312
Get up, I've brought fresh apples.

241
00:14:56,188 --> 00:14:57,815
This is for Ali

242
00:14:59,149 --> 00:15:00,651
and this one for Keyvan.

243
00:15:00,818 --> 00:15:02,945
- Hello.
- Hello, are you well?

244
00:15:03,112 --> 00:15:05,906
I have some fresh bread for you.

245
00:15:06,407 --> 00:15:08,117
- What is it?
- Bread.

246
00:15:08,534 --> 00:15:11,370
We have fresh bread.
What more can you want?

247
00:15:11,703 --> 00:15:13,914
You won't have another chance
like this.

248
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:16,500
This is for me.

249
00:15:17,543 --> 00:15:21,338
The big apple is for uncle Jahan.

250
00:15:23,549 --> 00:15:24,967
How about that!

251
00:15:30,264 --> 00:15:33,475
This isn't Jahan's apple.
I think it's yours.

252
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:36,770
Yes, yes, it's coming. Here.

253
00:15:36,895 --> 00:15:38,313
All right.

254
00:15:42,234 --> 00:15:44,194
- Have you had your share?
- Yes.

255
00:15:44,778 --> 00:15:46,071
Where are you going?

256
00:15:46,321 --> 00:15:47,489
To school.

257
00:15:48,365 --> 00:15:49,825
- To school?
- Yes.

258
00:15:50,117 --> 00:15:52,703
Do you have time
to show us the village?

259
00:15:53,287 --> 00:15:54,872
No, I have exams.

260
00:15:55,205 --> 00:15:56,748
I'll go with you to school.

261
00:15:56,915 --> 00:15:57,583
All right.

262
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:00,461
- There's no problem?
- No.

263
00:16:03,797 --> 00:16:05,757
Where's my camera?

264
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:08,552
Ali, where is it?

265
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,053
I haven't seen it.

266
00:16:10,179 --> 00:16:12,055
Look in the glove-box.

267
00:16:13,265 --> 00:16:15,517
- Wait for me.
- Farzad, put the bread there.

268
00:16:17,186 --> 00:16:18,479
Hello, engineer.

269
00:16:18,812 --> 00:16:20,355
Hello.

270
00:16:21,857 --> 00:16:23,400
Farzad, wrap up the bread

271
00:16:23,567 --> 00:16:26,987
or it will dry out.

272
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:29,364
Would you like tea?

273
00:16:29,531 --> 00:16:31,909
Yes, thank you.
My colleagues are sleeping.

274
00:16:32,284 --> 00:16:34,536
We'll have a walk and come back.

275
00:16:34,703 --> 00:16:35,913
Off you go.

276
00:16:47,216 --> 00:16:48,509
Which way's your school?

277
00:16:48,675 --> 00:16:50,302
This way and that.

278
00:16:50,552 --> 00:16:52,387
You have two schools then?

279
00:16:52,554 --> 00:16:55,724
No, there are two paths to school.

280
00:16:56,099 --> 00:16:57,142
Where's the square?

281
00:16:57,392 --> 00:16:58,185
This way.

282
00:16:58,352 --> 00:17:02,272
You don't mind.
Come this way, I'll get my camera.

283
00:17:06,944 --> 00:17:09,154
What a handsome white village!

284
00:17:09,988 --> 00:17:11,573
Why is it called "Black Valley"?

285
00:17:11,782 --> 00:17:13,951
The ancestors called it that.

286
00:17:14,201 --> 00:17:16,078
Can't you call it "White Valley"?

287
00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:18,997
No, we have to call it by its name.

288
00:17:19,623 --> 00:17:21,416
It has to stay that way.

289
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:24,670
That's how it is.

290
00:17:24,836 --> 00:17:27,214
<i>"When you're fated to be black...</i>

291
00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:30,759
<i>"...Even holy water
cannot whiten you."</i>

292
00:17:32,636 --> 00:17:34,388
How do you know that poem?

293
00:17:34,596 --> 00:17:38,600
Our teacher recites poems to us
from time to time.

294
00:17:42,271 --> 00:17:43,522
For homework?

295
00:17:43,647 --> 00:17:46,441
No. He recites and I learn them.

296
00:17:48,151 --> 00:17:49,653
You must be a good student.

297
00:17:49,778 --> 00:17:50,612
Yes.

298
00:17:50,946 --> 00:17:52,364
Well done!

299
00:17:52,823 --> 00:17:55,450
What grade did you get
in the third term?

300
00:17:55,826 --> 00:18:00,163
We haven't finished our exams yet.

301
00:18:01,707 --> 00:18:04,042
In the second term, then?

302
00:18:04,543 --> 00:18:05,877
Twelve.

303
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:10,007
And the first term?

304
00:18:11,216 --> 00:18:12,467
Ten.

305
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,388
When do the exams end?

306
00:18:16,555 --> 00:18:19,016
They start today
and go on for two weeks.

307
00:18:19,766 --> 00:18:23,145
- Good luck.
- Come in.

308
00:18:24,605 --> 00:18:25,981
How is she?

309
00:18:26,398 --> 00:18:27,316
Who?

310
00:18:27,733 --> 00:18:30,319
- You don't know who I mean?
- Mrs Malek?

311
00:18:31,069 --> 00:18:32,779
She's so-so.

312
00:18:33,238 --> 00:18:35,324
What does that mean?

313
00:18:35,699 --> 00:18:38,201
She's still in bed.

314
00:18:38,535 --> 00:18:41,079
She doesn't eat, she doesn't speak.

315
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:43,665
Wait, I'll fetch it.

316
00:18:55,093 --> 00:18:55,886
Here.

317
00:18:56,094 --> 00:18:58,639
Just a second.
I'm tying my shoelace.

318
00:18:59,431 --> 00:19:01,642
She can't recognise anyone,
she can't speak.

319
00:19:01,808 --> 00:19:03,477
What did the doctor say?

320
00:19:04,061 --> 00:19:07,230
That there's no hope.

321
00:19:07,481 --> 00:19:10,025
- The doctor said that?
- Yes.

322
00:19:14,237 --> 00:19:15,614
Who's watching her?

323
00:19:15,739 --> 00:19:19,868
My mother, the neighbours,
the family, my young uncle.

324
00:19:20,535 --> 00:19:21,828
Your young uncle?

325
00:19:24,706 --> 00:19:29,127
He's called in three times.

326
00:19:29,503 --> 00:19:31,380
His holidays are over.

327
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:34,925
My grandmother's better.

328
00:19:36,635 --> 00:19:38,053
How old is she?

329
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:39,638
100... 150...

330
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:41,807
100 or 150?

331
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:42,683
100.

332
00:19:43,809 --> 00:19:45,102
Special rate?

333
00:19:45,227 --> 00:19:46,061
Yes.

334
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:49,231
After one hundred,
the rest doesn't matter.

335
00:19:49,815 --> 00:19:50,982
Do you know that or not?

336
00:19:51,191 --> 00:19:52,275
I don't know.

337
00:19:52,818 --> 00:19:54,361
We grow old, you know.

338
00:19:54,653 --> 00:19:57,948
I have to go, I have exams.

339
00:19:58,115 --> 00:19:58,949
I'll be back.

340
00:19:59,199 --> 00:20:02,077
Come back quickly. Don't forget.

341
00:20:02,786 --> 00:20:04,454
Hello, Tajdolat.

342
00:20:04,996 --> 00:20:07,374
Hello, are you well?

343
00:20:11,545 --> 00:20:14,423
Are you looking for something?

344
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:17,676
My camera.
We left it here and it's gone.

345
00:20:17,968 --> 00:20:19,761
You didn't lock the car.

346
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:22,764
One night has passed,
you expect it to be there?

347
00:20:23,056 --> 00:20:24,891
Hello, good luck.

348
00:20:25,058 --> 00:20:27,644
Thank you.

349
00:20:27,894 --> 00:20:29,688
Thank you very much.

350
00:20:30,105 --> 00:20:33,942
It's a miracle it's still here.

351
00:20:36,153 --> 00:20:38,572
The guys forgot it
and didn't lock the car.

352
00:20:41,616 --> 00:20:43,034
Welcome.

353
00:20:43,827 --> 00:20:45,454
Thank you. You're kind.

354
00:20:45,954 --> 00:20:50,167
Here, even if your car's gold,
no one will touch it.

355
00:20:50,584 --> 00:20:54,087
Opposite the school,
the students are curious.

356
00:20:54,421 --> 00:20:55,797
It's best to lock it.

357
00:20:56,047 --> 00:20:56,965
All right.

358
00:20:57,132 --> 00:20:59,301
Are you in telecommunications?

359
00:21:00,218 --> 00:21:02,888
Telecommunications? Yes.

360
00:21:03,638 --> 00:21:04,431
This place

361
00:21:04,598 --> 00:21:07,184
is a world of communication.
Why are you here?

362
00:21:07,976 --> 00:21:09,853
Yes, that's obvious.

363
00:21:10,812 --> 00:21:14,524
I've never seen a woman
serve before.

364
00:21:14,816 --> 00:21:16,902
Where did you spring from?

365
00:21:17,235 --> 00:21:18,069
What?

366
00:21:18,403 --> 00:21:21,156
You have parents, don't you?

367
00:21:22,616 --> 00:21:24,534
Who served your father his tea?

368
00:21:25,327 --> 00:21:26,244
My mother.

369
00:21:26,411 --> 00:21:30,123
Why say you've never seen
such a thing? All women serve.

370
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:32,876
They have three trades:

371
00:21:32,959 --> 00:21:33,960
by day,

372
00:21:34,795 --> 00:21:37,964
they're workers. In the evening,
they serve and at night they work.

373
00:21:39,216 --> 00:21:41,092
Except for your mother.

374
00:21:43,637 --> 00:21:45,055
Thanks all the same!

375
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:47,557
I've told you time and again
not to park here.

376
00:21:48,475 --> 00:21:53,271
Park next to the engineer.

377
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:56,942
When you start it up,
you pollute the café.

378
00:21:57,108 --> 00:21:58,610
You lose me my customers.

379
00:21:59,528 --> 00:22:00,695
Where else can I park?

380
00:22:00,862 --> 00:22:04,574
Where the engineer's parked.

381
00:22:05,283 --> 00:22:07,994
You choke us when you start it up.

382
00:22:08,578 --> 00:22:10,497
We swallow fumes instead of tea.

383
00:22:10,789 --> 00:22:11,998
I park right here.

384
00:22:11,998 --> 00:22:15,627
You can't. You have no right.

385
00:22:16,461 --> 00:22:19,297
It's my café, my territory.

386
00:22:19,548 --> 00:22:21,758
You can't park your car here.

387
00:22:22,092 --> 00:22:23,134
What's wrong?

388
00:22:23,218 --> 00:22:25,345
Park where the engineer's parked.

389
00:22:27,138 --> 00:22:28,348
What's going on?

390
00:22:28,515 --> 00:22:31,393
It's my café, my territory.

391
00:22:31,685 --> 00:22:34,354
Leave him alone...

392
00:22:34,771 --> 00:22:37,065
Mind your own business.

393
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,985
I go to a lot of trouble, I work.

394
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:44,030
Serving tea isn't that tiring!

395
00:22:44,447 --> 00:22:46,783
There's a difference.

396
00:22:47,409 --> 00:22:49,703
My tea relaxes you.
Who takes care of me?

397
00:22:50,579 --> 00:22:51,913
Are you tired?

398
00:22:53,248 --> 00:22:55,584
I'm the one who's exhausted.

399
00:22:55,834 --> 00:23:00,297
I've been out harvesting
in the blazing sun,

400
00:23:00,463 --> 00:23:01,882
in the full heat of summer.

401
00:23:02,048 --> 00:23:03,925
Is serving tea that tiring?

402
00:23:04,509 --> 00:23:05,844
So I'm not working?

403
00:23:06,011 --> 00:23:08,346
I don't make efforts?

404
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:10,807
Your work isn't all that counts.

405
00:23:11,725 --> 00:23:14,019
Remember the first day

406
00:23:15,061 --> 00:23:17,355
that you served tea
to your future husband.

407
00:23:17,522 --> 00:23:20,108
You appreciated it and so did he.

408
00:23:20,817 --> 00:23:24,571
Those days shouldn't be over now.

409
00:23:25,113 --> 00:23:28,867
You have to remember that day
for the tea...

410
00:23:30,994 --> 00:23:33,413
The first days are different
from now.

411
00:23:33,622 --> 00:23:36,958
Serving tea to your husband
is work now?

412
00:23:37,208 --> 00:23:38,043
Is it the same?

413
00:23:38,209 --> 00:23:40,337
Yes, but it's not work.

414
00:23:40,670 --> 00:23:44,883
Whether you make tea or serve it,
it's work.

415
00:23:45,342 --> 00:23:48,219
I serve you tea, it does you good.

416
00:23:48,845 --> 00:23:51,264
But no one takes care of me
to help me relax.

417
00:23:51,598 --> 00:23:53,808
I know you're exhausted.

418
00:23:54,809 --> 00:23:57,020
Serving tea is work these days.

419
00:23:57,604 --> 00:23:59,522
Don't take any photos.

420
00:24:00,941 --> 00:24:02,859
I have three jobs.

421
00:24:03,068 --> 00:24:05,320
I have three jobs, not you.

422
00:24:07,197 --> 00:24:10,867
And the third is the hardest
and most important.

423
00:24:11,034 --> 00:24:12,661
Don't take any photos!

424
00:24:13,036 --> 00:24:15,789
- I should have kept it.
- I'll put it away.

425
00:24:19,417 --> 00:24:21,711
- I said no photos.
- All right.

426
00:24:22,379 --> 00:24:23,630
I won't do it again.

427
00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:27,634
Don't men have a third job?

428
00:24:28,718 --> 00:24:30,178
Only women?

429
00:24:30,971 --> 00:24:31,930
We don't?

430
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:34,099
If men don't do

431
00:24:34,182 --> 00:24:36,101
their third job,

432
00:24:36,393 --> 00:24:38,353
they'll be dishonoured.

433
00:24:41,398 --> 00:24:44,275
Their third job weighs
as heavily as a mountain.

434
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:46,778
It's a very hard job to do.

435
00:24:46,945 --> 00:24:49,823
It's not as simple as you think.

436
00:24:50,407 --> 00:24:51,324
Is that wrong?

437
00:24:52,283 --> 00:24:53,785
- Mashti Hatam!
- What?

438
00:24:54,077 --> 00:24:55,286
Come on, come on.

439
00:25:40,582 --> 00:25:43,835
The engineer's
forgotten his camera again.

440
00:25:45,211 --> 00:25:46,755
He's as distracted as me.

441
00:26:06,775 --> 00:26:08,026
What's the news?

442
00:26:08,318 --> 00:26:10,987
Nothing special.

443
00:26:18,995 --> 00:26:21,790
Take care.

444
00:28:05,894 --> 00:28:07,353
Mrs Parvin!

445
00:28:10,023 --> 00:28:11,232
I'm bringing you soup.

446
00:28:11,357 --> 00:28:13,318
May your wishes come true.

447
00:28:13,610 --> 00:28:15,111
Is she well?

448
00:28:15,278 --> 00:28:16,821
Yes.

449
00:28:19,574 --> 00:28:21,326
Have you finished?

450
00:28:37,967 --> 00:28:41,596
If you hear me, hold the line,
I'm going to higher ground.

451
00:29:18,967 --> 00:29:21,719
I'm going higher up.

452
00:29:23,429 --> 00:29:25,306
Hold the line.

453
00:30:11,436 --> 00:30:13,313
If you hear me, I'm not hanging up.

454
00:30:13,479 --> 00:30:16,983
I'm going to higher ground
so we can talk.

455
00:30:18,735 --> 00:30:21,321
If we're cut off, call me back.

456
00:31:11,871 --> 00:31:14,749
Yes, hello... It's you.

457
00:31:15,666 --> 00:31:17,668
I thought it was Mrs Godarzi.

458
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:21,881
I told you not to call me.
I'll call you.

459
00:31:24,801 --> 00:31:27,512
Godarzi calls me about work.

460
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:32,100
So why have you brought me
all the way up here?

461
00:31:34,894 --> 00:31:36,687
I'm sorry, go ahead.

462
00:31:37,730 --> 00:31:39,357
Really? When?

463
00:31:43,027 --> 00:31:44,946
I can't be there.

464
00:31:48,658 --> 00:31:51,452
Tell them you couldn't reach me.

465
00:31:54,247 --> 00:31:56,124
How is she? Better?

466
00:32:02,046 --> 00:32:04,298
Hello, are you well, father?

467
00:32:04,966 --> 00:32:07,135
I'm listening. I'll be home soon.

468
00:32:10,096 --> 00:32:13,599
I've bought it for you. It's red.

469
00:32:14,392 --> 00:32:17,270
Put mother on.
I have to talk to her.

470
00:32:20,106 --> 00:32:23,276
Listen, firstly I'm sorry.

471
00:32:23,401 --> 00:32:25,361
Then, my condolences.

472
00:32:25,653 --> 00:32:30,199
If someone asks for me,
say you couldn't reach me.

473
00:32:31,451 --> 00:32:33,953
They don't know I've hired
a cell-phone.

474
00:32:37,081 --> 00:32:39,750
I'll be back
for the seventh day of mourning.

475
00:32:40,001 --> 00:32:42,378
I promise I'll be there.

476
00:32:44,755 --> 00:32:48,342
Don't talk to me like that.
This is the wrong time.

477
00:32:48,843 --> 00:32:50,678
All right. Is there anything else?

478
00:32:50,928 --> 00:32:53,181
Take care.

479
00:33:21,209 --> 00:33:22,084
Hello.

480
00:33:22,251 --> 00:33:23,085
Hello.

481
00:33:24,045 --> 00:33:25,671
Why aren't you singing now?

482
00:33:26,589 --> 00:33:28,841
You sing so well.

483
00:33:32,762 --> 00:33:34,180
Go on, keep singing.

484
00:33:35,515 --> 00:33:36,933
I dare not.

485
00:33:37,099 --> 00:33:39,644
But why?
You're down there and I'm here.

486
00:33:41,896 --> 00:33:43,898
We can't look each other in the eye.

487
00:33:45,358 --> 00:33:46,943
I can't see you.

488
00:33:47,193 --> 00:33:49,320
I can see you.

489
00:33:49,779 --> 00:33:51,572
What are you doing down there?

490
00:33:51,864 --> 00:33:54,283
I'm digging a well.

491
00:33:55,409 --> 00:33:57,370
You don't dig wells on hills.

492
00:33:58,037 --> 00:34:01,123
- I'm digging a ditch.
- Why a ditch?

493
00:34:02,041 --> 00:34:03,626
For telecommunications.

494
00:34:03,709 --> 00:34:05,294
Why are you alone?

495
00:34:06,337 --> 00:34:08,339
Working alone makes things simple.

496
00:34:08,756 --> 00:34:10,800
It's good, you don't have a boss.

497
00:34:11,217 --> 00:34:12,802
What's that behind you?

498
00:34:13,970 --> 00:34:15,388
Turn round...

499
00:34:16,097 --> 00:34:17,348
To the left,

500
00:34:17,765 --> 00:34:20,893
the one you touched.
Careful you don't break it.

501
00:34:21,143 --> 00:34:23,062
Try to free it. Pull it out.

502
00:34:23,771 --> 00:34:24,981
Toss it up to me.

503
00:34:31,028 --> 00:34:32,363
He was tall!

504
00:34:32,488 --> 00:34:33,531
It's your size.

505
00:34:33,698 --> 00:34:35,741
Is it the left leg or the right?

506
00:34:36,158 --> 00:34:39,412
It's a leg bone. It's not a shoe.

507
00:34:47,128 --> 00:34:48,838
Are you well, Mrs Godarzi?

508
00:34:49,046 --> 00:34:51,716
Thank you, you're very kind...

509
00:34:52,550 --> 00:34:55,386
It's very difficult reaching you.

510
00:34:56,596 --> 00:34:59,640
It was the same in Tehran,
always engaged.

511
00:35:01,309 --> 00:35:02,935
Yes... We're ready.

512
00:35:03,603 --> 00:35:05,896
Yes, they're ready too...
Everyone's ready.

513
00:35:09,859 --> 00:35:11,110
Yes, if you don't mind,

514
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:15,197
when you call,
you have to wait a few minutes

515
00:35:15,865 --> 00:35:18,034
until I drive up to higher ground.

516
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:20,286
Yes, that very place.

517
00:35:20,703 --> 00:35:22,830
Yes, yes. All right.

518
00:35:23,623 --> 00:35:26,751
Don't mention it...
Thank you... Good-bye.

519
00:35:31,005 --> 00:35:32,423
Behzad... Behzad.

520
00:35:33,382 --> 00:35:34,216
Hello.

521
00:35:34,925 --> 00:35:36,469
Are you well?

522
00:35:36,719 --> 00:35:39,472
- Why are you here?
- I've come to see you.

523
00:35:39,805 --> 00:35:41,307
How did you know I was here?

524
00:35:41,432 --> 00:35:45,519
When I brought the bread,
I asked Mim Kharaman,

525
00:35:46,145 --> 00:35:47,813
"Where's Behzad?"

526
00:35:51,651 --> 00:35:53,944
She said,
"He took a towel and went out."

527
00:35:54,195 --> 00:35:56,822
You weren't down near the spring.

528
00:35:56,989 --> 00:35:59,158
I tried the other side

529
00:35:59,367 --> 00:36:04,038
but you weren't there either.
You weren't at the spring.

530
00:36:04,455 --> 00:36:05,790
How can you cross?

531
00:36:06,123 --> 00:36:08,167
There's a bridge.

532
00:36:12,213 --> 00:36:14,965
You don't ask how I am?
Where were you?

533
00:36:15,257 --> 00:36:18,636
We've had no news from you.
Nothing!

534
00:36:19,136 --> 00:36:21,222
I work in the fields.

535
00:36:21,347 --> 00:36:24,558
You're always working
or at school.

536
00:36:24,725 --> 00:36:26,018
Or sleeping.

537
00:36:26,310 --> 00:36:27,853
Mind you don't fall.

538
00:36:28,396 --> 00:36:30,356
- You call that a bridge?
- Yes.

539
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:32,858
Your personal bridge?

540
00:36:33,109 --> 00:36:35,736
All the children use it.

541
00:36:35,986 --> 00:36:37,321
- How are you?
- Okay.

542
00:36:39,323 --> 00:36:40,533
How's the invalid?

543
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:41,659
Who?

544
00:36:41,909 --> 00:36:44,745
You still ask who?
It's obvious.

545
00:36:46,122 --> 00:36:48,249
- Oh, Mrs Malek?
- Yes.

546
00:36:49,667 --> 00:36:53,170
She didn't eat the soup

547
00:36:54,088 --> 00:36:56,215
from Mash Hajer and the others.

548
00:36:56,549 --> 00:36:58,300
How many cooks does she have?

549
00:36:58,551 --> 00:37:01,512
They're not her cooks.
The soup is an offering.

550
00:37:01,762 --> 00:37:03,431
All right.

551
00:37:03,639 --> 00:37:04,473
Why?

552
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:07,685
If the invalid
eats one particular soup

553
00:37:08,018 --> 00:37:10,521
the maker's wish will come true.

554
00:37:11,021 --> 00:37:12,815
Do you have a wish too?

555
00:37:13,524 --> 00:37:16,110
I have one, yes:
to pass my exams.

556
00:37:16,235 --> 00:37:17,945
I have another one too.

557
00:37:18,112 --> 00:37:18,946
What is it?

558
00:37:19,196 --> 00:37:21,949
I want Mrs Malek to get better.

559
00:37:23,159 --> 00:37:25,369
- To get better?
- Yes.

560
00:37:29,623 --> 00:37:32,877
Can you find us some milk

561
00:37:33,335 --> 00:37:34,920
for breakfast?

562
00:37:35,504 --> 00:37:37,757
I don't have any cattle.

563
00:37:37,965 --> 00:37:39,925
I'm alone.

564
00:37:40,217 --> 00:37:43,179
Tell Farzad to fetch you some.

565
00:37:46,223 --> 00:37:48,517
I don't understand...

566
00:37:48,809 --> 00:37:51,979
Ask the boy, he'll fetch you some.

567
00:37:53,105 --> 00:37:54,940
We're in the country,

568
00:37:55,649 --> 00:37:57,943
we'd like to consume local produce.

569
00:37:58,527 --> 00:38:02,156
I don't have any.
I don't have any milk or cattle.

570
00:38:02,656 --> 00:38:04,867
I have a lot of work.

571
00:38:06,577 --> 00:38:08,412
Where are the people?

572
00:38:08,913 --> 00:38:12,625
Yesterday,
walking around the village,

573
00:38:14,084 --> 00:38:16,462
I only saw children and old people.

574
00:38:16,712 --> 00:38:20,716
The young men work the land.
They're farmers.

575
00:38:21,091 --> 00:38:22,468
No one's idle here.

576
00:38:22,593 --> 00:38:25,054
The old people and children
stay in the village.

577
00:38:26,013 --> 00:38:27,723
Where are the young people?

578
00:38:27,932 --> 00:38:31,227
I just told you:
they're working the land.

579
00:38:31,477 --> 00:38:33,270
The corn and barley

580
00:38:33,437 --> 00:38:35,523
are ready for harvesting.

581
00:38:39,735 --> 00:38:42,321
The young people work
for three months.

582
00:38:42,613 --> 00:38:45,533
In winter, they don't work.

583
00:38:45,950 --> 00:38:50,704
They earn their living
over three months.

584
00:38:51,455 --> 00:38:53,833
In winter,
they sit around drinking tea.

585
00:38:54,542 --> 00:38:57,419
There's not a lot to do in winter.

586
00:39:03,467 --> 00:39:06,470
Apparently, they're not that idle!

587
00:39:07,054 --> 00:39:10,808
No, they do nothing.

588
00:39:11,517 --> 00:39:13,936
They sit around the stove
for warmth.

589
00:39:15,062 --> 00:39:17,690
They spend evenings together.

590
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:23,153
Certain produce is sown in winter...

591
00:39:26,532 --> 00:39:28,450
And harvested in summer.

592
00:39:29,410 --> 00:39:30,744
I don't know.

593
00:39:32,872 --> 00:39:36,834
Your harvest will soon be ripe.
Congratulations.

594
00:39:37,167 --> 00:39:38,335
Thank you.

595
00:39:40,421 --> 00:39:42,047
How many children do you have?

596
00:39:44,216 --> 00:39:45,259
Nine.

597
00:39:45,634 --> 00:39:47,928
Well done, nine children!

598
00:39:48,095 --> 00:39:48,804
Yes.

599
00:39:53,851 --> 00:39:55,853
How many girls and how many boys?

600
00:39:56,103 --> 00:39:58,606
Five girls and four boys.

601
00:40:01,567 --> 00:40:04,028
See, you're not idle!

602
00:40:10,993 --> 00:40:12,202
May God preserve them.

603
00:40:12,578 --> 00:40:13,621
Thank you.

604
00:40:17,791 --> 00:40:19,835
You don't want to get up?

605
00:40:21,253 --> 00:40:22,838
We have to get up?

606
00:40:22,963 --> 00:40:24,381
You don't want to?

607
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:27,760
Is there any news?

608
00:40:28,093 --> 00:40:30,387
News, but not what you think.

609
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:32,806
But there is something.

610
00:40:35,809 --> 00:40:38,354
She didn't eat the soup

611
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:41,065
sent by Mrs Hatcher and Mrs Terayn.

612
00:40:42,232 --> 00:40:43,359
Meaning what?

613
00:40:43,609 --> 00:40:45,069
Meaning...

614
00:40:55,829 --> 00:40:57,665
Hold the line.

615
00:42:06,859 --> 00:42:08,193
I'll go up the hill.

616
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:12,364
If we're cut off, call me back.
I can't call you.

617
00:43:22,643 --> 00:43:25,395
Hello. Are you well, Mrs Godarzi?

618
00:43:26,230 --> 00:43:29,441
Sorry, it takes a few minutes
to reach the high ground.

619
00:43:33,695 --> 00:43:35,531
You can't foresee that.

620
00:43:35,697 --> 00:43:37,658
One day she's well,
the next she isn't.

621
00:43:37,825 --> 00:43:39,368
Her condition varies.

622
00:43:42,204 --> 00:43:45,791
We're all waiting. We have to wait.

623
00:43:46,917 --> 00:43:49,628
She has company.
Her son has come a long way.

624
00:43:49,962 --> 00:43:51,755
He's waiting like us.

625
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:58,095
When will we be back?
In a couple of days maybe.

626
00:43:58,887 --> 00:43:59,888
Good-bye.

627
00:44:04,101 --> 00:44:07,396
I knew that warm voice
belonged to a warm-hearted man.

628
00:44:08,272 --> 00:44:10,774
Hello. How are you?

629
00:44:14,653 --> 00:44:16,113
It's deep!

630
00:44:17,072 --> 00:44:20,075
Three metres, as stated
in the contract with the engineer.

631
00:44:30,252 --> 00:44:32,045
I think you may be right.

632
00:44:32,296 --> 00:44:34,506
Working alone is better.

633
00:44:36,633 --> 00:44:38,552
It's harder...

634
00:44:40,888 --> 00:44:42,764
but there are advantages.

635
00:44:43,849 --> 00:44:45,601
- Do you understand me?
- No.

636
00:44:49,104 --> 00:44:51,398
I mean that no one bothers you.

637
00:44:51,607 --> 00:44:54,526
A boss. You don't have a boss.

638
00:44:54,818 --> 00:44:55,736
Yeah?

639
00:44:56,403 --> 00:44:58,322
He comes and disturbs us.

640
00:44:58,780 --> 00:45:00,365
She brought me some milk.

641
00:45:00,490 --> 00:45:03,202
There.
Do you want me to give you some?

642
00:45:03,535 --> 00:45:07,164
No, thank you kindly.
She brought it for you.

643
00:45:11,293 --> 00:45:14,463
I think Farhad dug Biston
on his own.

644
00:45:15,255 --> 00:45:16,548
Do you know him?

645
00:45:16,715 --> 00:45:20,385
Yes. He's a local,
he lives three miles away.

646
00:45:20,719 --> 00:45:22,221
A local? Well done.

647
00:45:23,138 --> 00:45:24,765
But it wasn't Farhad

648
00:45:25,349 --> 00:45:26,767
who dug Biston.

649
00:45:26,975 --> 00:45:27,976
I know.

650
00:45:28,685 --> 00:45:29,937
Who then?

651
00:45:30,270 --> 00:45:32,356
It was love. The love of Shirin.

652
00:45:32,731 --> 00:45:35,192
Bravo. You know love too.

653
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:37,694
A man without love cannot live.

654
00:45:59,591 --> 00:46:00,801
How are you?

655
00:46:01,051 --> 00:46:02,094
I'm okay.

656
00:46:02,219 --> 00:46:03,303
Where are you going?

657
00:46:03,428 --> 00:46:05,889
As usual,
we're going to eat strawberries.

658
00:46:07,474 --> 00:46:09,768
- Where's Jahan?
- Sleeping, as usual.

659
00:46:10,018 --> 00:46:10,978
You'll bring him back?

660
00:46:11,144 --> 00:46:13,647
You know,
he doesn't eat strawberries.

661
00:46:14,773 --> 00:46:16,775
Who called?

662
00:46:17,609 --> 00:46:19,486
- Mrs Godarzi.
- What did she say?

663
00:46:19,987 --> 00:46:22,072
Greetings. She wanted news.

664
00:46:22,531 --> 00:46:24,116
What did you tell her?

665
00:46:24,283 --> 00:46:26,285
Nothing, that it was progressing.

666
00:46:26,410 --> 00:46:28,620
Progressing? What is?

667
00:46:28,912 --> 00:46:31,415
Eating strawberries is work.

668
00:46:32,165 --> 00:46:34,209
- She didn't want any?
- No.

669
00:46:34,418 --> 00:46:36,378
The strawberries are better
in Tehran.

670
00:46:36,545 --> 00:46:39,214
Fresh air, fresh milk.

671
00:46:39,381 --> 00:46:41,883
I haven't seen any milk.

672
00:46:42,467 --> 00:46:45,262
We're not allowed milk here.

673
00:46:46,305 --> 00:46:47,431
He's right.

674
00:46:47,639 --> 00:46:49,266
Don't be long. Don't go too far!

675
00:46:49,433 --> 00:46:50,684
No, we're just here.

676
00:46:52,686 --> 00:46:54,271
Good-bye.

677
00:47:23,300 --> 00:47:24,801
I have bread for you.

678
00:47:24,926 --> 00:47:26,803
Are you well?
Thank you. That's kind.

679
00:47:27,095 --> 00:47:27,804
You're welcome.

680
00:47:27,929 --> 00:47:29,681
- How are you?
- I'm okay.

681
00:47:30,724 --> 00:47:32,184
How is she?

682
00:47:32,434 --> 00:47:33,352
Who?

683
00:47:33,852 --> 00:47:35,437
You still ask who?

684
00:47:35,854 --> 00:47:37,189
She's well.

685
00:47:37,522 --> 00:47:39,066
- She's well?
- Yes.

686
00:47:40,233 --> 00:47:41,651
How do you know?

687
00:47:41,693 --> 00:47:45,197
My mother went to see her.

688
00:47:45,947 --> 00:47:47,157
And?

689
00:47:47,324 --> 00:47:50,786
My mother says she's well.

690
00:47:53,163 --> 00:47:54,664
Has she eaten or not?

691
00:47:54,831 --> 00:47:56,208
Yesterday evening,

692
00:47:56,583 --> 00:47:59,211
she took her a meal.

693
00:47:59,503 --> 00:48:01,463
She didn't touch it.

694
00:48:01,671 --> 00:48:05,801
My young uncle fed her.

695
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:08,929
He's fallen out with my mother.

696
00:48:09,513 --> 00:48:10,806
They don't speak.

697
00:48:11,098 --> 00:48:13,642
Why? He wanted to feed her?

698
00:48:13,850 --> 00:48:17,437
No. They fell out a long time ago.

699
00:48:18,146 --> 00:48:19,564
Why is he your "young uncle"?

700
00:48:19,689 --> 00:48:21,817
- How many do you have?
- Three.

701
00:48:22,192 --> 00:48:24,694
- Are the others older?
- Yes.

702
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:27,697
Bravo. Where are they?

703
00:48:28,031 --> 00:48:31,701
One is in Ahwaz,
the other in Kermanshah

704
00:48:32,244 --> 00:48:34,204
and I don't know
where the third one is.

705
00:48:34,413 --> 00:48:35,789
Don't they visit their mother?

706
00:48:35,997 --> 00:48:41,378
Yesterday evening,
my uncle told my mother

707
00:48:41,711 --> 00:48:43,422
that his holidays were over.

708
00:48:44,297 --> 00:48:47,134
But they've fallen out.
How did he tell her?

709
00:48:47,467 --> 00:48:51,054
My uncle speaks to her
but my mother doesn't reply.

710
00:48:52,973 --> 00:48:55,142
- The others aren't coming?
- No.

711
00:48:55,392 --> 00:48:57,811
Yesterday, my uncle

712
00:48:57,978 --> 00:49:01,064
told my mother
that he has to go back.

713
00:49:02,482 --> 00:49:03,733
He's leaving then?

714
00:49:03,859 --> 00:49:04,484
Yes.

715
00:49:04,818 --> 00:49:06,236
What about us?

716
00:49:06,403 --> 00:49:07,571
I don't know.

717
00:49:07,696 --> 00:49:10,449
I have exams that I have to take.

718
00:49:10,615 --> 00:49:13,118
Apart from you,
we don't have anyone here.

719
00:49:13,660 --> 00:49:15,495
I don't know. I have exams.

720
00:49:15,662 --> 00:49:17,914
All right, off you go.
I'll see what I'll do.

721
00:49:18,165 --> 00:49:19,291
Thanks anyhow.

722
00:49:20,208 --> 00:49:21,585
Good-bye.

723
00:49:22,210 --> 00:49:23,712
Take care.

724
00:49:23,962 --> 00:49:24,880
All right.

725
00:49:33,597 --> 00:49:35,307
Hello.

726
00:49:35,474 --> 00:49:37,434
Have a good day.

727
00:49:37,809 --> 00:49:39,895
I've brought water from the spring.

728
00:49:41,313 --> 00:49:44,024
Thank you. I've brought fresh bread.

729
00:49:44,316 --> 00:49:46,943
Thank you very much.
Put it over there.

730
00:49:47,235 --> 00:49:49,362
I'll put it here!

731
00:49:49,738 --> 00:49:51,740
I'll get breakfast.

732
00:49:52,282 --> 00:49:55,660
I'll go and wake my colleagues then.

733
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:05,670
Yesterday, I asked

734
00:50:05,795 --> 00:50:09,257
your sister to bring us milk.

735
00:50:10,091 --> 00:50:11,718
She probably forgot.

736
00:50:12,511 --> 00:50:13,553
It was me.

737
00:50:13,845 --> 00:50:15,722
No, I spoke to your sister.

738
00:50:15,889 --> 00:50:17,390
No, it was me.

739
00:50:17,849 --> 00:50:19,643
- It was you?
- Yes.

740
00:50:19,809 --> 00:50:21,728
She was pregnant.

741
00:50:22,062 --> 00:50:24,064
I was pregnant.

742
00:50:25,982 --> 00:50:26,983
It was you?

743
00:50:27,359 --> 00:50:28,401
Yes, in person.

744
00:50:28,610 --> 00:50:29,569
Seriously!

745
00:50:29,694 --> 00:50:31,655
Yes, I've had the baby

746
00:50:31,905 --> 00:50:35,992
and I've come back here to work.

747
00:50:36,368 --> 00:50:37,994
Where is it?

748
00:50:38,245 --> 00:50:39,746
- Is that your baby?
- Yes.

749
00:50:39,913 --> 00:50:41,790
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

750
00:50:42,082 --> 00:50:43,750
How many children do you have?

751
00:50:44,459 --> 00:50:45,669
Ten.

752
00:50:46,002 --> 00:50:48,547
Five girls and five boys.

753
00:50:49,548 --> 00:50:52,050
Five boys and five girls... Bravo!

754
00:50:52,217 --> 00:50:53,385
Thank you.

755
00:50:53,885 --> 00:50:55,720
Tell me,

756
00:50:55,971 --> 00:50:59,724
can the factory still produce more?

757
00:51:01,184 --> 00:51:03,728
How should I know?

758
00:51:05,105 --> 00:51:08,024
Give the milk to the baby first.

759
00:51:08,984 --> 00:51:11,278
Don't worry about my colleagues.

760
00:52:36,404 --> 00:52:37,906
Are you well, Mrs Godarzi?

761
00:52:38,114 --> 00:52:39,574
Can you hear me?

762
00:52:40,116 --> 00:52:41,826
I can hear you too.

763
00:52:42,827 --> 00:52:44,913
Good day. How are you?

764
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:51,211
What can I say? We're all ready.

765
00:52:52,337 --> 00:52:53,463
Everything's fine.

766
00:52:59,469 --> 00:53:02,639
Listen... Up here...

767
00:53:05,350 --> 00:53:07,852
Yes...
We're getting bored too but...

768
00:53:11,064 --> 00:53:13,566
It seems to be the only solution.

769
00:53:17,987 --> 00:53:20,407
There's no doubt about it.

770
00:53:24,285 --> 00:53:26,871
It could be any day now,
we can't say...

771
00:53:31,042 --> 00:53:33,670
She hasn't eaten for three days.

772
00:53:36,715 --> 00:53:39,092
No, there's no doubt.

773
00:53:41,219 --> 00:53:44,514
We just have to wait.
There's no other solution.

774
00:53:47,434 --> 00:53:49,144
Can I ask a favour of you?

775
00:53:49,269 --> 00:53:52,605
Lengthen the crew's mission.
I promised them...

776
00:53:56,234 --> 00:53:57,777
No, probably not.

777
00:53:58,862 --> 00:54:00,363
Don't worry.

778
00:54:02,824 --> 00:54:04,325
Good-bye.

779
00:54:08,288 --> 00:54:10,081
Isn't that ditch finished yet?

780
00:54:11,708 --> 00:54:13,710
I've hit a rock.

781
00:54:15,962 --> 00:54:17,255
Good luck.

782
00:54:18,715 --> 00:54:21,092
I can see, in fact. I can hear.

783
00:54:22,510 --> 00:54:24,637
We've reached a dead-end too.

784
00:54:27,223 --> 00:54:30,560
You're lucky, you have a pickaxe.
We don't have one.

785
00:54:34,439 --> 00:54:36,357
We can't do anything.

786
00:54:36,775 --> 00:54:39,319
I can provide you with a pickaxe.

787
00:54:40,069 --> 00:54:42,280
Our problem can't be solved
by a pickaxe.

788
00:54:43,281 --> 00:54:45,909
If it could, things would be easier.

789
00:54:47,076 --> 00:54:48,995
One blow of a pickaxe would do.

790
00:54:51,247 --> 00:54:54,709
Instead of a pickaxe,
you can offer me some tea.

791
00:54:55,168 --> 00:54:57,962
Please, help yourself.

792
00:55:04,761 --> 00:55:06,971
If you give me
your Juliet's address,

793
00:55:07,347 --> 00:55:09,849
I'll ask her to provide us
with milk.

794
00:55:10,683 --> 00:55:11,976
In the village,

795
00:55:12,519 --> 00:55:16,981
knock on any door
and they'll give you milk.

796
00:55:20,735 --> 00:55:22,362
I didn't find any.

797
00:55:24,239 --> 00:55:26,699
Even at the sea,
there's no water for me!

798
00:55:29,118 --> 00:55:31,162
Can't I ask her for some?

799
00:55:31,371 --> 00:55:33,081
No problem.

800
00:55:33,373 --> 00:55:35,208
She's at Kakrahman's.

801
00:55:35,416 --> 00:55:37,168
Go to the village...

802
00:55:37,293 --> 00:55:41,089
You'll find her there.

803
00:55:42,090 --> 00:55:43,591
Kakrahman's house...

804
00:55:43,758 --> 00:55:47,220
Ask anyone,
they'll know where it is.

805
00:55:55,019 --> 00:55:56,229
Get in.

806
00:55:56,688 --> 00:55:57,605
I'm not disturbing you?

807
00:55:57,730 --> 00:55:59,065
You're welcome.

808
00:56:02,277 --> 00:56:03,570
Sorry.

809
00:56:06,990 --> 00:56:09,284
- Are you well?
- Fine, thanks.

810
00:56:10,827 --> 00:56:11,870
Sorry to disturb you.

811
00:56:12,036 --> 00:56:15,123
You're welcome, it's my route.
I'll take you.

812
00:56:15,999 --> 00:56:18,001
I often see you on this road.

813
00:56:18,126 --> 00:56:20,378
- You're not a local?
- No.

814
00:56:21,588 --> 00:56:23,673
You seem to have problems.

815
00:56:24,966 --> 00:56:26,050
One problem!

816
00:56:26,259 --> 00:56:29,470
In any case,
every affair has its own problems.

817
00:56:29,804 --> 00:56:33,516
Anything over a hundred years old
is considered an antique.

818
00:56:33,933 --> 00:56:36,144
What are you talking about?

819
00:56:36,561 --> 00:56:38,605
You don't work underground?

820
00:56:38,771 --> 00:56:41,733
Because of this bone, you think

821
00:56:42,150 --> 00:56:44,736
we're looking for treasure
or antiques?

822
00:56:45,403 --> 00:56:46,946
I don't think that.

823
00:56:47,113 --> 00:56:48,573
I'm almost sure of it.

824
00:56:51,284 --> 00:56:53,995
You haven't come for the ceremony?

825
00:56:54,871 --> 00:56:56,831
The cat's out of the bag!

826
00:56:58,124 --> 00:57:01,169
Our crew was joking with the kid.

827
00:57:04,172 --> 00:57:07,425
They said
that we've come for treasure.

828
00:57:08,384 --> 00:57:12,430
We didn't want people to know
why we're really here.

829
00:57:13,473 --> 00:57:17,018
His family lives in the village.
It's a small village too.

830
00:57:18,311 --> 00:57:19,646
That's why he believed it.

831
00:57:20,271 --> 00:57:22,231
Later, we told him the secret.

832
00:57:22,941 --> 00:57:24,901
When I was little, I felt the same.

833
00:57:25,485 --> 00:57:28,947
Whenever someone told me a secret,

834
00:57:29,322 --> 00:57:31,658
I always wanted to tell others.

835
00:57:32,367 --> 00:57:34,035
And in the end, I would.

836
00:57:35,078 --> 00:57:39,082
I think I enjoyed telling it
more than I enjoyed keeping it.

837
00:57:39,749 --> 00:57:41,209
That's interesting.

838
00:57:43,169 --> 00:57:46,798
You're an educated man.
What do you think of this ceremony?

839
00:57:49,384 --> 00:57:52,762
How can I put it? It's painful.

840
00:57:54,806 --> 00:57:57,809
There have been two lines
on my mother's face for years.

841
00:57:58,309 --> 00:58:00,269
- Lines?
- Yes, lines.

842
00:58:00,395 --> 00:58:01,729
You mean scars?

843
00:58:01,813 --> 00:58:02,939
Yes, scars.

844
00:58:03,189 --> 00:58:06,651
They are marked during the ceremony.

845
00:58:07,110 --> 00:58:08,236
The first scar

846
00:58:09,737 --> 00:58:12,824
was for the death of my aunt.

847
00:58:13,366 --> 00:58:15,743
My poor mother did it

848
00:58:15,910 --> 00:58:18,705
to show her love to my father.

849
00:58:19,706 --> 00:58:20,623
The second,

850
00:58:22,959 --> 00:58:26,754
was for the boss of the factory
where my father worked.

851
00:58:28,464 --> 00:58:32,010
One of his cousins had died.

852
00:58:33,928 --> 00:58:38,725
So that my father
wouldn't lose his job,

853
00:58:39,642 --> 00:58:43,813
my mother mourned a great deal.

854
00:58:44,147 --> 00:58:46,816
She scratched her face.
I couldn't believe it.

855
00:58:47,275 --> 00:58:50,236
There was a lot of competition
at the factory

856
00:58:50,361 --> 00:58:53,906
between the men to hold
onto their jobs.

857
00:58:54,365 --> 00:58:57,076
Need and necessity, you see?

858
00:58:57,535 --> 00:58:59,245
Everyone played along.

859
00:58:59,454 --> 00:59:02,665
There was a great deal of pressure.
They all needed work.

860
00:59:03,458 --> 00:59:06,753
No question of showing pity
or giving in,

861
00:59:06,919 --> 00:59:08,588
everyone displayed themselves,

862
00:59:08,755 --> 00:59:12,842
pushed themselves forward
to please the boss.

863
00:59:13,384 --> 00:59:17,221
Each wanted to show that he grieved
more than the others.

864
00:59:17,388 --> 00:59:20,933
That he was with him.
That he was loyal...

865
00:59:22,727 --> 00:59:26,731
That kind of thing
doesn't interest me.

866
00:59:28,149 --> 00:59:29,317
When I think about it,

867
00:59:30,109 --> 00:59:32,320
it's painful.

868
00:59:33,613 --> 00:59:35,114
Let me tell you...

869
00:59:35,490 --> 00:59:38,701
I think the origins of this ceremony

870
00:59:38,951 --> 00:59:40,828
are bound to the economy.

871
00:59:41,204 --> 00:59:44,582
What I just told you is engraved

872
00:59:44,832 --> 00:59:47,376
in their memories. It has been

873
00:59:47,543 --> 00:59:51,172
for years and for generations now.

874
00:59:51,798 --> 00:59:53,466
You look on it from the outside.

875
00:59:53,633 --> 00:59:55,551
It may interest you.

876
00:59:55,885 --> 00:59:57,053
But personally...

877
00:59:59,639 --> 01:00:01,849
May I get out here?

878
01:00:02,016 --> 01:00:03,726
- Where are you going?
- To school, this way.

879
01:00:03,976 --> 01:00:04,811
I'll drop you.

880
01:00:05,019 --> 01:00:06,604
I'll see Farzad too.

881
01:00:06,896 --> 01:00:08,815
He has exams,
I'll see what he's done.

882
01:00:28,918 --> 01:00:30,211
Sir, thank you.

883
01:00:30,461 --> 01:00:32,213
Thank you again. Good-bye.

884
01:00:32,463 --> 01:00:33,464
Good-bye.

885
01:00:35,508 --> 01:00:38,261
- Are those the exam papers?
- Yes.

886
01:00:38,511 --> 01:00:41,264
- Don't be too harsh on them.
- I'm not.

887
01:00:46,394 --> 01:00:49,814
Tell our little colleague
to come and see me.

888
01:00:54,360 --> 01:00:55,444
Excuse me!

889
01:00:55,570 --> 01:00:57,280
- What?
- Please do me a favour.

890
01:00:57,488 --> 01:00:59,991
Don't tell Farzad
what we were just saying.

891
01:01:00,199 --> 01:01:01,868
All right. Don't worry.

892
01:01:24,640 --> 01:01:26,392
Go on, get in the other side.

893
01:01:29,770 --> 01:01:30,813
Hurry up, get in.

894
01:01:31,022 --> 01:01:32,273
- I can't come now.
- Why?

895
01:01:32,523 --> 01:01:34,901
I need one more answer for the exam.

896
01:01:35,443 --> 01:01:36,652
What is it?

897
01:01:36,819 --> 01:01:38,487
The fourth question.

898
01:01:40,865 --> 01:01:42,533
- You don't know the answer?
- No.

899
01:01:42,825 --> 01:01:44,118
Why?

900
01:01:44,911 --> 01:01:46,329
Because I don't.

901
01:01:46,704 --> 01:01:48,122
What was it?

902
01:01:48,456 --> 01:01:50,666
"What happens to the Good and Evil

903
01:01:50,791 --> 01:01:53,044
"on Judgement Day?"

904
01:01:53,836 --> 01:01:54,962
That's obvious.

905
01:01:55,254 --> 01:01:57,715
The Good go to hell
and the Evil to heaven.

906
01:01:58,007 --> 01:01:59,467
- Is that right?
- Yes.

907
01:02:01,844 --> 01:02:05,806
No. The Good go to heaven,
the Evil go to hell.

908
01:02:05,973 --> 01:02:07,808
Hurry in and write that,
then come back.

909
01:02:11,312 --> 01:02:12,521
Off you go.

910
01:03:23,301 --> 01:03:25,261
Help yourself to tea if you want.

911
01:03:25,511 --> 01:03:26,429
What?

912
01:03:26,929 --> 01:03:28,931
Help yourself to tea if you want.

913
01:03:36,522 --> 01:03:39,191
- You want some too?
- No, not for me.

914
01:03:44,113 --> 01:03:45,406
Do you want tea?

915
01:03:45,573 --> 01:03:46,615
No.

916
01:04:08,721 --> 01:04:10,723
You're a coward if you come back.

917
01:04:17,521 --> 01:04:18,814
Hello, Tajdolat.

918
01:04:19,065 --> 01:04:22,318
May your wish come true. Mother says
the invalid ate the soup.

919
01:04:22,568 --> 01:04:24,320
Put the bowl over there.

920
01:04:31,369 --> 01:04:32,745
Hello, Farzad.

921
01:04:33,788 --> 01:04:34,914
- Are you well?
- Yes.

922
01:04:35,206 --> 01:04:36,874
- Where are you going?
- To school.

923
01:04:37,124 --> 01:04:38,834
- I'll go with you.
- Come on.

924
01:04:41,045 --> 01:04:42,213
Good-bye.

925
01:04:44,298 --> 01:04:45,383
Did the exams go well?

926
01:04:45,758 --> 01:04:46,592
Yes.

927
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:49,887
- How's the invalid?
- Well.

928
01:04:50,888 --> 01:04:52,807
- Well?
- Yes.

929
01:04:53,516 --> 01:04:55,601
Yesterday evening, she ate

930
01:04:55,768 --> 01:04:57,812
Tajdolat's soup.

931
01:04:58,062 --> 01:04:59,480
Tajdolat? The serving woman?

932
01:04:59,647 --> 01:05:01,399
Yes. She ate it all.

933
01:05:01,982 --> 01:05:04,110
- Have there been other signs?
- Yes.

934
01:05:04,985 --> 01:05:06,529
She's speaking!

935
01:05:06,737 --> 01:05:07,988
She's speaking?

936
01:05:08,364 --> 01:05:10,449
Come and sit here a minute.

937
01:05:13,077 --> 01:05:14,870
What do you mean, she's speaking?

938
01:05:15,121 --> 01:05:18,082
My grandmother spoke to my uncle
yesterday evening.

939
01:05:19,083 --> 01:05:21,585
She recognised him.

940
01:05:21,877 --> 01:05:26,132
Then she asked for news
of the family...

941
01:05:31,220 --> 01:05:34,432
My uncle wept.

942
01:05:34,807 --> 01:05:38,853
He asked my mother,
"Am I a bad son?"

943
01:05:38,978 --> 01:05:42,731
My mother said, "No you're not bad.

944
01:05:43,232 --> 01:05:45,067
"You're just very busy."

945
01:05:45,443 --> 01:05:48,195
Then they made up.

946
01:05:48,571 --> 01:05:53,159
He said he was leaving
for Kermanshah

947
01:05:53,534 --> 01:05:56,036
to ask for leave, then he'd be back.

948
01:05:56,620 --> 01:05:59,206
Fancy that! He's left then.

949
01:06:07,840 --> 01:06:09,550
Can you answer me frankly?

950
01:06:09,717 --> 01:06:10,593
Yes.

951
01:06:12,887 --> 01:06:14,889
Do you think I'm bad?

952
01:06:17,016 --> 01:06:17,725
No.

953
01:06:19,226 --> 01:06:21,103
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

954
01:06:23,022 --> 01:06:24,857
How can you be sure?

955
01:06:27,067 --> 01:06:29,445
I know.

956
01:06:31,614 --> 01:06:32,948
You're good.

957
01:06:36,869 --> 01:06:39,413
Well, since I'm good,

958
01:06:39,622 --> 01:06:41,874
can you get me a bowl
to fetch milk?

959
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:46,587
When I go to the fields,
I'll find one.

960
01:06:46,962 --> 01:06:48,547
I want it now.

961
01:06:48,714 --> 01:06:50,925
It will only take two minutes.

962
01:06:51,091 --> 01:06:52,426
I'm late.

963
01:06:52,676 --> 01:06:56,013
I have to go.
That lady will find you one.

964
01:06:56,931 --> 01:06:57,723
Go on.

965
01:06:59,683 --> 01:07:02,478
Mim Hamideh, hello.

966
01:07:02,770 --> 01:07:05,898
Do you have a milk bowl
for the engineer?

967
01:07:06,023 --> 01:07:07,191
Yes, by the window.

968
01:07:07,483 --> 01:07:08,359
All right.

969
01:07:38,138 --> 01:07:40,849
She says to bring the bowl back.

970
01:07:42,059 --> 01:07:44,728
I have to go.

971
01:07:44,937 --> 01:07:45,938
Off you go.

972
01:08:01,495 --> 01:08:03,581
May God give you pride.

973
01:08:05,165 --> 01:08:07,334
May God give you good health.

974
01:08:08,168 --> 01:08:10,296
May God give you a long life.

975
01:09:07,519 --> 01:09:09,021
- Excuse me.
- Don't mention it.

976
01:09:10,439 --> 01:09:12,191
- Are you well?
- Yes, thank you.

977
01:09:12,441 --> 01:09:14,276
Is Kakrahman's house here?

978
01:09:14,568 --> 01:09:15,986
What do you want? Milk?

979
01:09:16,236 --> 01:09:18,030
Yes, please.

980
01:09:19,865 --> 01:09:22,201
I'd be grateful for some fresh milk.

981
01:09:22,409 --> 01:09:23,702
All right.

982
01:09:28,999 --> 01:09:30,167
I'm disturbing you.

983
01:09:30,334 --> 01:09:31,710
Don't worry.

984
01:09:34,088 --> 01:09:36,006
- Are you well?
- Yes, thank you.

985
01:09:40,219 --> 01:09:41,512
What a fine house.

986
01:09:41,804 --> 01:09:43,347
Make yourself at home.

987
01:09:43,472 --> 01:09:44,640
Is this Kakrahman's house?

988
01:09:44,848 --> 01:09:45,933
No.

989
01:09:46,225 --> 01:09:49,269
Oh, I'm sorry.
I was told to get milk from him.

990
01:09:49,603 --> 01:09:51,063
It's next door.

991
01:09:51,313 --> 01:09:53,607
Where is Kakrahman's house?

992
01:09:53,941 --> 01:09:56,151
Next door.

993
01:09:56,318 --> 01:09:58,195
Sorry, I didn't understand.

994
01:09:58,362 --> 01:09:59,279
It's next door.

995
01:09:59,571 --> 01:10:00,823
Thank you very much.

996
01:10:10,499 --> 01:10:12,334
Is this Kakrahman's house?

997
01:10:12,501 --> 01:10:13,711
Welcome.

998
01:10:14,002 --> 01:10:15,254
Good luck.

999
01:10:15,963 --> 01:10:19,341
I was sent here for milk.
Can you give me some?

1000
01:10:19,633 --> 01:10:21,593
Go down to the cellar...
Watch your head.

1001
01:10:21,844 --> 01:10:22,970
This way?

1002
01:10:27,641 --> 01:10:29,935
Go on down. Mind your head.

1003
01:10:30,227 --> 01:10:31,311
All right.

1004
01:10:32,813 --> 01:10:33,939
Why is it so dark here?

1005
01:10:34,106 --> 01:10:37,943
There's a hurricane lamp,
it's not dark.

1006
01:10:38,277 --> 01:10:40,362
Is there someone down there?

1007
01:10:40,612 --> 01:10:42,156
Yes, Miss Zeynab.

1008
01:10:42,865 --> 01:10:45,951
Zeynab, come here,
this gentleman needs milk.

1009
01:10:47,161 --> 01:10:48,871
It's so dark here.

1010
01:11:07,931 --> 01:11:09,099
Is anyone here?

1011
01:11:14,480 --> 01:11:15,606
Come in.

1012
01:11:15,689 --> 01:11:17,733
Can you milk the cow for me?

1013
01:11:17,900 --> 01:11:19,610
Wait, I'll do it.

1014
01:11:21,737 --> 01:11:24,948
It's so dark.
How can you milk in here?

1015
01:11:25,657 --> 01:11:28,827
I'm used to it. I work here.

1016
01:11:29,203 --> 01:11:32,080
You'll get used to it if you stay.

1017
01:11:33,040 --> 01:11:35,083
I'll be gone
before I get used to it.

1018
01:11:35,417 --> 01:11:38,378
We have a flashlight.
The electricity is off.

1019
01:11:40,088 --> 01:11:42,883
<i>"If you come to my house..."</i>

1020
01:11:43,675 --> 01:11:44,760
What?

1021
01:11:44,968 --> 01:11:48,263
<i>"Oh, kind one, bring me the lamp</i>

1022
01:11:48,555 --> 01:11:50,140
<i>"and a window through which</i>

1023
01:11:50,265 --> 01:11:54,144
<i>"I can watch the crowd
in the happy street."</i>

1024
01:11:54,812 --> 01:11:55,562
What?

1025
01:11:55,729 --> 01:11:57,564
Nothing, it was a poem.

1026
01:11:58,899 --> 01:12:00,400
How old are you?

1027
01:12:01,485 --> 01:12:02,611
Sixteen.

1028
01:12:03,111 --> 01:12:05,823
Sixteen. Have you been to school?

1029
01:12:06,240 --> 01:12:07,115
Yes.

1030
01:12:07,825 --> 01:12:09,701
- For how long?
- Five years.

1031
01:12:10,160 --> 01:12:12,162
Five years.... That's good.

1032
01:12:12,704 --> 01:12:14,456
Do you know Forough?

1033
01:12:18,377 --> 01:12:19,211
Yes.

1034
01:12:19,837 --> 01:12:22,089
- Who is she?
- Gohar's daughter.

1035
01:12:22,297 --> 01:12:25,509
No, the one I'm talking about
is a poet.

1036
01:12:27,636 --> 01:12:28,971
What's your name?

1037
01:12:34,059 --> 01:12:35,936
Can't you tell me?

1038
01:12:36,520 --> 01:12:37,896
It doesn't matter.

1039
01:12:38,689 --> 01:12:40,524
Okay, I'll recite a poem to you.

1040
01:12:40,732 --> 01:12:44,736
It will occupy us while you milk.

1041
01:12:49,867 --> 01:12:51,743
You won't answer me?

1042
01:12:52,828 --> 01:12:53,745
Go ahead.

1043
01:12:55,122 --> 01:12:57,082
I was saying that...

1044
01:12:58,333 --> 01:13:00,794
<i>"In my night, so brief, alas</i>

1045
01:13:01,003 --> 01:13:03,964
<i>"The wind
is about to meet the leaves."</i>

1046
01:13:05,591 --> 01:13:07,301
Do you understand that?

1047
01:13:09,261 --> 01:13:10,762
The two are meeting.

1048
01:13:11,555 --> 01:13:15,267
It's like when you went
to see Yossef.

1049
01:13:16,059 --> 01:13:17,352
At the well.

1050
01:13:17,603 --> 01:13:19,062
At the well?

1051
01:13:19,187 --> 01:13:20,397
Bravo.

1052
01:13:22,107 --> 01:13:26,194
<i>"My night so brief is filled
with devastating anguish.</i>

1053
01:13:27,321 --> 01:13:28,780
<i>"Hark!</i>

1054
01:13:28,989 --> 01:13:31,116
<i>"Do you hear the whisper
of the shadows?"</i>

1055
01:13:31,450 --> 01:13:33,368
Do you understand the shadows?

1056
01:13:33,911 --> 01:13:35,621
That means darkness.

1057
01:13:37,581 --> 01:13:40,292
<i>"This happiness
feels foreign to me.</i>

1058
01:13:41,627 --> 01:13:44,713
<i>"I am accustomed to despair.</i>

1059
01:13:45,339 --> 01:13:48,926
<i>"Hark! Do you hear the whisper
of the shadows?</i>

1060
01:13:50,969 --> 01:13:52,721
<i>"There, in the night,
something is happening.</i>

1061
01:13:52,930 --> 01:13:55,098
<i>"The moon is red and anxious.</i>

1062
01:13:55,515 --> 01:13:59,603
<i>"And, clinging to this roof
that could collapse at any moment,</i>

1063
01:14:00,395 --> 01:14:03,857
<i>"The clouds, like a crowd
of mourning women,</i>

1064
01:14:04,399 --> 01:14:07,611
<i>"Await the birth of the rain,</i>

1065
01:14:08,445 --> 01:14:11,615
<i>"One second, and then nothing.</i>

1066
01:14:13,408 --> 01:14:16,203
<i>"Behind this window,
the night trembles,</i>

1067
01:14:16,662 --> 01:14:19,373
<i>"And the earth stops spinning.</i>

1068
01:14:20,332 --> 01:14:23,126
<i>"Behind this window, a stranger</i>

1069
01:14:23,585 --> 01:14:26,463
<i>"Worries about you and me.</i>

1070
01:14:29,341 --> 01:14:31,259
<i>"You, in your greenery,</i>

1071
01:14:32,344 --> 01:14:35,263
<i>"Lay your hands
- those burning memories -</i>

1072
01:14:35,764 --> 01:14:37,975
<i>"On my loving hands</i>

1073
01:14:38,892 --> 01:14:42,187
<i>"And entrust your lips,
replete with life's warmth,</i>

1074
01:14:42,604 --> 01:14:45,273
<i>"To the touch of my loving lips."</i>

1075
01:14:45,565 --> 01:14:47,275
It's full.

1076
01:14:47,609 --> 01:14:49,945
<i>"The wind will carry us."</i>

1077
01:14:50,237 --> 01:14:51,488
The bowl is full.

1078
01:14:51,697 --> 01:14:52,739
Yes, yes...

1079
01:14:53,407 --> 01:14:55,534
<i>"The wind will carry us!"</i>

1080
01:14:56,034 --> 01:14:57,953
I'm one of Yossef's friends.

1081
01:14:58,412 --> 01:15:00,539
In fact, I'm his boss.

1082
01:15:00,747 --> 01:15:02,582
Thank you very much.

1083
01:15:02,874 --> 01:15:06,336
Raise the lamp
so I can see your face.

1084
01:15:08,130 --> 01:15:09,214
I haven't seen Yossef,

1085
01:15:09,464 --> 01:15:11,591
so at least let me know his taste.

1086
01:15:16,388 --> 01:15:18,056
You won't tell me your name

1087
01:15:19,016 --> 01:15:21,101
and you won't let me see your face.

1088
01:15:21,560 --> 01:15:25,188
At least light the ground
so I don't trip up.

1089
01:15:30,485 --> 01:15:32,237
How long did she study?

1090
01:15:32,863 --> 01:15:33,488
Who?

1091
01:15:33,655 --> 01:15:35,699
That woman whose poem you recited.

1092
01:15:36,033 --> 01:15:37,159
Forough?

1093
01:15:37,409 --> 01:15:39,703
I think she was in school
until the fourth or fifth year.

1094
01:15:41,204 --> 01:15:45,709
You know, writing poetry
has nothing to do with diplomas.

1095
01:15:46,084 --> 01:15:49,379
If you have talent,
you can do it too.

1096
01:15:49,546 --> 01:15:50,881
How much do I owe you?

1097
01:15:51,089 --> 01:15:52,174
Don't mention it.

1098
01:15:52,466 --> 01:15:54,009
Thank you very much.

1099
01:15:54,217 --> 01:15:55,802
Pay my mother.

1100
01:15:57,929 --> 01:15:59,097
Thank you very much.

1101
01:15:59,347 --> 01:16:00,098
Don't mention it.

1102
01:16:01,349 --> 01:16:02,559
Good-bye.

1103
01:16:09,941 --> 01:16:11,276
Good luck.

1104
01:16:11,526 --> 01:16:12,819
How much do I owe you?

1105
01:16:13,028 --> 01:16:14,321
Three hundred tomans.

1106
01:16:15,739 --> 01:16:16,782
- Here.
- You're welcome.

1107
01:16:16,907 --> 01:16:18,408
Thank you again.

1108
01:16:19,951 --> 01:16:20,827
Good-bye.

1109
01:16:25,791 --> 01:16:29,461
Why did you take the money?
Go and give it back to him.

1110
01:16:30,837 --> 01:16:32,130
He wanted to pay.

1111
01:16:34,674 --> 01:16:35,842
Sir...

1112
01:16:47,813 --> 01:16:49,564
You're our honoured guest.

1113
01:16:49,731 --> 01:16:51,066
No. Keep it.

1114
01:16:51,775 --> 01:16:53,151
Thank you very much.

1115
01:16:53,401 --> 01:16:54,611
Really.

1116
01:16:55,570 --> 01:16:56,988
You honour us.

1117
01:16:59,908 --> 01:17:01,201
Thank you again.

1118
01:17:13,797 --> 01:17:16,800
Each of us has a commitment.

1119
01:17:17,425 --> 01:17:19,761
I have one too, to my family.

1120
01:17:19,928 --> 01:17:22,347
I've come here to work too.

1121
01:17:22,722 --> 01:17:26,393
Listen,
don't confuse work and family.

1122
01:17:26,726 --> 01:17:28,895
We have to know, give or take a day,

1123
01:17:29,146 --> 01:17:32,524
when we'll finally return to Tehran.

1124
01:17:33,191 --> 01:17:35,861
You said it would happen
in the first three days.

1125
01:17:36,153 --> 01:17:38,989
You said, "Next week."
And then nothing happened.

1126
01:17:39,239 --> 01:17:40,782
Two weeks and still nothing!

1127
01:17:40,949 --> 01:17:43,994
- And now?
- I promise, within three days.

1128
01:17:44,411 --> 01:17:45,579
What if it doesn't happen?

1129
01:17:46,329 --> 01:17:48,915
She seems to be better now.

1130
01:17:49,249 --> 01:17:50,876
Her son left yesterday.

1131
01:17:51,042 --> 01:17:53,962
If she'd been in a bad way,

1132
01:17:54,296 --> 01:17:55,839
he wouldn't have left.

1133
01:17:56,047 --> 01:17:57,591
How do you know that?

1134
01:17:57,799 --> 01:17:59,634
We just know.

1135
01:18:00,093 --> 01:18:02,888
It's not something
you can hide from us.

1136
01:18:03,180 --> 01:18:05,056
She's better, this is useless.

1137
01:18:05,348 --> 01:18:09,269
You say that you know
but you know nothing.

1138
01:18:10,520 --> 01:18:11,980
First of all, her son

1139
01:18:13,648 --> 01:18:16,610
is a guard at Kermanshah.

1140
01:18:16,902 --> 01:18:19,905
He's gone back to warn his boss.

1141
01:18:20,238 --> 01:18:22,824
It's 45 miles away.
He can be back in a day.

1142
01:18:23,116 --> 01:18:25,952
If we want to go to Tehran,
it's 450 miles away.

1143
01:18:26,203 --> 01:18:27,537
450 miles, understand?

1144
01:18:27,787 --> 01:18:30,916
We have to go to Tehran.
450 miles in one day!

1145
01:18:31,208 --> 01:18:33,251
We didn't say we'd come back...

1146
01:18:33,835 --> 01:18:37,547
If no one decides for us,
we have to decide for ourselves.

1147
01:18:37,881 --> 01:18:39,841
I can't decide for you.

1148
01:18:40,300 --> 01:18:41,051
You decide.

1149
01:18:41,176 --> 01:18:43,845
I can't decide.
God's the one who decides.

1150
01:18:44,095 --> 01:18:46,014
Who drew up this shooting?

1151
01:18:46,765 --> 01:18:49,935
I can't strangle her!
What am I supposed to do?

1152
01:18:50,352 --> 01:18:51,978
We're not asking you
to strangle her.

1153
01:18:52,187 --> 01:18:53,647
What then?

1154
01:18:53,772 --> 01:18:55,982
How much longer
do we have to stay here?

1155
01:18:56,441 --> 01:18:59,152
What if the event never occurs?

1156
01:18:59,277 --> 01:19:00,779
And what if it does?

1157
01:19:00,946 --> 01:19:04,616
That means you're in contact
with God or the Angel of Death.

1158
01:19:05,367 --> 01:19:07,118
Who are you in contact with?

1159
01:19:07,452 --> 01:19:10,205
We can't stay here like this.

1160
01:19:10,664 --> 01:19:12,749
Who's to say that within a week...

1161
01:19:12,999 --> 01:19:16,086
I have a feeling
it'll happen in the next three days.

1162
01:19:16,628 --> 01:19:19,172
You keep repeating the same thing!

1163
01:19:20,131 --> 01:19:22,300
Look, Keyvan,
you know what?

1164
01:19:22,550 --> 01:19:25,095
Give me three days. Just three.

1165
01:19:25,804 --> 01:19:27,180
Perhaps it will happen.

1166
01:19:27,472 --> 01:19:29,641
- And what if it doesn't?
- Let's say it will.

1167
01:19:29,849 --> 01:19:31,059
We're wasting time.

1168
01:19:31,434 --> 01:19:32,936
Can't you plan things?

1169
01:19:33,270 --> 01:19:36,106
Plan things? No, I can't do that.

1170
01:19:36,273 --> 01:19:39,359
We say the same thing.
If you can't do it, who can?

1171
01:19:41,278 --> 01:19:42,153
Only God can.

1172
01:19:42,320 --> 01:19:45,657
If it happens, we shoot our report
and return to Tehran.

1173
01:19:46,074 --> 01:19:49,202
All right. We just need to know
what to do.

1174
01:19:49,452 --> 01:19:50,954
Say it takes three months...

1175
01:19:51,079 --> 01:19:52,372
- Behzad.
- Yes.

1176
01:19:54,207 --> 01:19:55,875
I've brought you bread.

1177
01:19:57,377 --> 01:19:58,878
Put it over there.

1178
01:20:00,130 --> 01:20:02,882
Listen, kid,
can't you hold your tongue?

1179
01:20:04,718 --> 01:20:05,677
I can.

1180
01:20:06,553 --> 01:20:09,889
Who told you to talk
about her son leaving?

1181
01:20:11,057 --> 01:20:12,934
I can't lie.

1182
01:20:13,101 --> 01:20:15,895
It's not a matter of lying.
Who asked you to lie?

1183
01:20:17,147 --> 01:20:20,608
They asked where my uncle was.
I said that he'd left.

1184
01:20:21,151 --> 01:20:24,070
They asked how he was
and you said he'd left.

1185
01:20:25,905 --> 01:20:28,158
We don't want anything
from your uncle.

1186
01:20:28,742 --> 01:20:31,453
They asked me.
I said that he had left.

1187
01:20:32,912 --> 01:20:34,831
They asked how she was.

1188
01:20:35,915 --> 01:20:37,375
It wasn't about your uncle.

1189
01:20:40,253 --> 01:20:44,549
Have they taught you anything
at school?

1190
01:20:44,966 --> 01:20:46,092
Yes.

1191
01:20:46,426 --> 01:20:48,970
You don't give an answer
until you're asked a question.

1192
01:20:50,096 --> 01:20:54,059
Yes, I've been taught that.

1193
01:21:00,023 --> 01:21:01,775
I don't want any more bread.

1194
01:21:02,025 --> 01:21:03,234
You understand?

1195
01:21:03,860 --> 01:21:06,029
If you have good news, come here.

1196
01:21:06,321 --> 01:21:08,823
If not, don't bother coming back!

1197
01:21:09,074 --> 01:21:09,657
All right.

1198
01:21:09,866 --> 01:21:11,409
- Understand?
- Yes.

1199
01:21:11,743 --> 01:21:13,453
Put the bread down there and go.

1200
01:21:15,372 --> 01:21:16,456
Hello, engineer.

1201
01:21:18,583 --> 01:21:21,836
My mother wants to know
if you want the milk cold or hot.

1202
01:21:23,296 --> 01:21:25,215
Warm it up.

1203
01:22:25,608 --> 01:22:27,026
Good day.

1204
01:22:30,321 --> 01:22:33,158
There's nothing more to say,
Mrs Godarzi.

1205
01:22:33,700 --> 01:22:35,535
As I told you before.

1206
01:22:37,829 --> 01:22:39,539
No, it's the same.

1207
01:22:41,499 --> 01:22:42,208
What?

1208
01:22:45,670 --> 01:22:48,047
No, we don't know what to do.

1209
01:22:51,176 --> 01:22:52,385
What does that mean?

1210
01:22:55,513 --> 01:22:57,891
That's impossible, Mrs Godarzi.

1211
01:23:02,562 --> 01:23:03,771
That means...

1212
01:23:03,897 --> 01:23:08,026
we pretend that we've done nothing
for two weeks.

1213
01:23:11,279 --> 01:23:13,364
Put him on, I want to talk to him...

1214
01:23:16,159 --> 01:23:18,328
I want to talk to him...

1215
01:23:22,081 --> 01:23:24,250
At least give him my message.

1216
01:23:27,837 --> 01:23:30,089
I simply can't do that.

1217
01:23:34,886 --> 01:23:37,096
No. Why do they want the material?

1218
01:23:39,057 --> 01:23:40,934
No, answer me.

1219
01:23:41,684 --> 01:23:43,478
Why do they want the material?

1220
01:23:47,649 --> 01:23:50,276
We don't want to use it as a pillow.

1221
01:23:55,281 --> 01:23:55,990
Yes...

1222
01:23:57,825 --> 01:23:59,994
In any case, that's impossible.

1223
01:24:05,625 --> 01:24:06,417
Yes...

1224
01:24:10,797 --> 01:24:13,466
It sounds as if we're guilty!

1225
01:24:18,972 --> 01:24:21,558
I'll contact him myself.

1226
01:24:22,267 --> 01:24:24,269
I'll call... Good-bye.

1227
01:28:37,814 --> 01:28:38,940
Hello, are you well?

1228
01:28:39,106 --> 01:28:40,525
- Yes, thank you.
- What do you want?

1229
01:28:40,775 --> 01:28:43,820
Can I have a word with Farzad?

1230
01:28:44,111 --> 01:28:44,779
Sohrabi?

1231
01:28:44,987 --> 01:28:45,738
Yes.

1232
01:28:49,033 --> 01:28:50,368
He's sitting an exam.

1233
01:28:50,660 --> 01:28:52,995
I know. It won't take a minute.

1234
01:28:53,287 --> 01:28:55,164
Please call him for me.

1235
01:28:57,834 --> 01:28:58,835
Sohrabi!

1236
01:29:03,464 --> 01:29:04,882
You're wanted.

1237
01:29:14,058 --> 01:29:15,268
Are you well?

1238
01:29:16,811 --> 01:29:17,645
Yes.

1239
01:29:18,354 --> 01:29:19,939
Are you sitting an exam?

1240
01:29:20,523 --> 01:29:21,399
Yes.

1241
01:29:26,863 --> 01:29:30,616
Is there a question
that you can't answer?

1242
01:29:31,742 --> 01:29:33,327
No, I know them all.

1243
01:29:34,787 --> 01:29:37,206
I want to apologise
about this morning.

1244
01:29:38,541 --> 01:29:40,251
Do you remember the first day

1245
01:29:40,459 --> 01:29:43,129
when you asked
if the car wasn't working?

1246
01:29:43,462 --> 01:29:46,340
I answered, "It's given up
the ghost." Do you remember?

1247
01:29:47,842 --> 01:29:51,470
That day, we were driving uphill.
The car gave up the ghost.

1248
01:29:54,056 --> 01:29:54,974
Yes.

1249
01:29:56,642 --> 01:29:59,562
It had worked too hard
and gave up the ghost.

1250
01:30:00,730 --> 01:30:01,522
Yes.

1251
01:30:02,648 --> 01:30:04,942
What did I say?

1252
01:30:05,192 --> 01:30:08,362
A car, just like men,
can give up the ghost.

1253
01:30:08,946 --> 01:30:10,656
And I'll say it again now...

1254
01:30:12,533 --> 01:30:14,452
Men, like machines,

1255
01:30:14,702 --> 01:30:16,037
can give up the ghost.

1256
01:30:16,871 --> 01:30:17,997
Right?

1257
01:30:18,998 --> 01:30:23,502
You haven't worked this morning.
You're not tired.

1258
01:30:24,003 --> 01:30:25,504
Yes, but...

1259
01:30:26,088 --> 01:30:29,383
you know that's not always the case.

1260
01:30:29,759 --> 01:30:32,053
Sometimes, when you're idle,
you give up the ghost.

1261
01:30:32,303 --> 01:30:33,346
You understand?

1262
01:30:33,512 --> 01:30:36,515
You go crazy doing nothing.
You blow your top!

1263
01:30:36,849 --> 01:30:38,851
All right, forget it, it's over.

1264
01:30:40,019 --> 01:30:41,854
Let's be friends again.

1265
01:30:43,481 --> 01:30:44,607
Shake my hand.

1266
01:30:49,320 --> 01:30:50,404
Shake my hand...

1267
01:30:57,578 --> 01:31:01,123
If you can hear me, hold the line.
I'm going higher up.

1268
01:31:01,415 --> 01:31:02,917
Hold the line.

1269
01:31:04,085 --> 01:31:05,920
I'll see you later.

1270
01:31:23,854 --> 01:31:25,231
Come on, Behzad.

1271
01:31:25,439 --> 01:31:28,901
Forget the cemetery,
come and eat some strawberries...

1272
01:32:14,905 --> 01:32:16,490
Hold the line.

1273
01:32:19,410 --> 01:32:20,661
I'm listening...

1274
01:32:23,581 --> 01:32:24,832
Hello.

1275
01:32:29,086 --> 01:32:30,254
He told you that?

1276
01:32:33,257 --> 01:32:35,176
Did you give him my message?

1277
01:32:38,929 --> 01:32:41,474
Did you repeat my very words?

1278
01:32:47,730 --> 01:32:50,149
Unfortunately, I can't do anything.

1279
01:32:53,194 --> 01:32:54,195
Yes...

1280
01:32:57,239 --> 01:32:58,115
Yes...

1281
01:33:01,535 --> 01:33:02,495
Yes...

1282
01:33:04,705 --> 01:33:05,706
No...

1283
01:33:06,082 --> 01:33:07,166
Good-bye...

1284
01:35:53,582 --> 01:35:54,833
Sir...

1285
01:35:56,502 --> 01:35:59,004
One of your neighbours
is buried alive.

1286
01:35:59,421 --> 01:36:01,090
Go and help him...

1287
01:36:01,215 --> 01:36:02,049
Where?

1288
01:36:02,341 --> 01:36:04,009
Up there, in the cemetery.

1289
01:36:28,575 --> 01:36:29,410
Sir...

1290
01:36:29,827 --> 01:36:33,163
One of your neighbours
is buried alive.

1291
01:36:33,580 --> 01:36:35,082
Where?

1292
01:36:35,249 --> 01:36:37,334
Up there, in the cemetery.

1293
01:36:37,418 --> 01:36:40,754
Yes. Help him if you can.

1294
01:36:42,756 --> 01:36:45,259
A shovel... Take it and go.
It will help.

1295
01:36:45,384 --> 01:36:47,469
I don't have one.

1296
01:37:09,283 --> 01:37:11,493
Sir! Sir!

1297
01:37:14,830 --> 01:37:17,333
Have you seen my friends anywhere?

1298
01:37:17,583 --> 01:37:21,920
They bought three baskets
of strawberries and went.

1299
01:37:22,338 --> 01:37:24,006
Three baskets of strawberries?

1300
01:37:24,423 --> 01:37:26,091
Where did they go?

1301
01:37:26,300 --> 01:37:28,052
Up there somewhere.

1302
01:37:38,604 --> 01:37:39,813
Run...

1303
01:37:40,439 --> 01:37:43,567
Run, Farzad. Come on, get in.
I'm in a hurry. Get in.

1304
01:37:43,984 --> 01:37:45,235
- Hello. Okay?
- Yes.

1305
01:37:45,652 --> 01:37:46,904
- Did you sit your exam?
- Yes.

1306
01:37:47,321 --> 01:37:48,572
Get in, let's go.

1307
01:37:48,739 --> 01:37:50,240
No, I'll walk.

1308
01:37:50,657 --> 01:37:53,577
You're still mad at me?
I apologised.

1309
01:37:54,828 --> 01:37:56,914
- Come on, get in.
- No, I'll walk.

1310
01:38:02,753 --> 01:38:04,838
I'm going up.
Don't you want to come?

1311
01:38:37,079 --> 01:38:38,747
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

1312
01:38:38,956 --> 01:38:42,084
- Have you seen my colleagues?
- Yes, they went that way.

1313
01:38:42,501 --> 01:38:45,003
Which way? Over the hill? Where?

1314
01:38:45,421 --> 01:38:47,506
I don't know.
They went through that gate.

1315
01:38:47,923 --> 01:38:50,008
- Towards the hill?
- I have no idea.

1316
01:38:50,175 --> 01:38:52,511
- Did they have the gear?
- They had their bags.

1317
01:38:54,054 --> 01:38:55,722
- Thank you.
- May God preserve you.

1318
01:39:17,744 --> 01:39:19,997
Farzad, I'm going up the hill.
Want to come?

1319
01:39:20,164 --> 01:39:22,916
No, I'm not coming,
I'm going to the fields.

1320
01:39:23,083 --> 01:39:23,917
Come on, get in...

1321
01:39:24,168 --> 01:39:25,419
No. I'm going to the farm.

1322
01:39:25,752 --> 01:39:27,838
- Come on, I'll bring you back.
- No.

1323
01:39:49,193 --> 01:39:52,529
Why haven't you got out?
Go on, get out.

1324
01:40:54,591 --> 01:40:56,260
Take the wheel.

1325
01:40:59,471 --> 01:41:01,557
Give my colleagues the keys.
Don't forget.

1326
01:41:16,321 --> 01:41:17,573
Will he make it, doctor?

1327
01:41:17,781 --> 01:41:20,701
Yes, he just needed oxygen.

1328
01:41:20,909 --> 01:41:23,829
Ajab and a respirator
will put him right.

1329
01:41:24,204 --> 01:41:27,124
We've sent him to town.
Oxygen will save him.

1330
01:41:27,583 --> 01:41:29,668
- Where are you going?
- Down there.

1331
01:41:29,960 --> 01:41:32,588
There's a sick woman.
Perhaps you could see her.

1332
01:41:32,713 --> 01:41:33,547
All right.

1333
01:41:33,839 --> 01:41:36,341
- Do you mind?
- No, no problem.

1334
01:41:53,400 --> 01:41:55,902
It's a miracle he survived.

1335
01:41:56,737 --> 01:41:57,988
He was lucky.

1336
01:41:58,447 --> 01:42:00,532
The stone got stuck

1337
01:42:00,657 --> 01:42:03,452
before it struck his head.

1338
01:42:03,577 --> 01:42:06,371
Then some stones gave way.

1339
01:42:06,580 --> 01:42:09,082
He was trapped,

1340
01:42:09,291 --> 01:42:12,628
as if he was in a tiny cell.

1341
01:42:13,462 --> 01:42:16,381
He needed oxygen.

1342
01:42:17,215 --> 01:42:19,301
If he gets oxygen,

1343
01:42:19,718 --> 01:42:22,638
he'll pull through all right.

1344
01:42:23,055 --> 01:42:25,140
He was covered in dirt.

1345
01:42:25,974 --> 01:42:29,728
<i>"If my guardian angel
is the one I know,</i>

1346
01:42:30,562 --> 01:42:33,857
<i>"he'll protect glass from stone."</i>

1347
01:42:34,024 --> 01:42:36,109
Yes, that's a fine poem.

1348
01:42:38,195 --> 01:42:40,697
So the "glass" remained intact?

1349
01:42:40,822 --> 01:42:42,908
Yes, it remained intact.

1350
01:42:43,200 --> 01:42:44,451
He'll be saved.

1351
01:42:44,868 --> 01:42:48,205
- Doctor, do you mind if I smoke?
- No, you should mind.

1352
01:42:48,330 --> 01:42:50,666
- What?
- You should mind.

1353
01:42:51,541 --> 01:42:54,878
Not me. It's no concern of mine
if you smoke.

1354
01:42:58,840 --> 01:43:00,509
The air is so pure here.

1355
01:43:00,717 --> 01:43:04,471
It'll take more than your cigarette
to pollute it.

1356
01:43:06,723 --> 01:43:08,392
I only measure my strength
with my lungs.

1357
01:43:08,642 --> 01:43:11,144
If you're in good health, carry on.

1358
01:43:17,776 --> 01:43:20,278
Doctor, what's your speciality?

1359
01:43:20,362 --> 01:43:24,950
I don't have one. That way,
I look after the whole body.

1360
01:43:25,701 --> 01:43:27,786
If I specialised,

1361
01:43:28,203 --> 01:43:31,957
I'd be limited.

1362
01:43:36,128 --> 01:43:39,423
You must have
a lot of patients then.

1363
01:43:39,673 --> 01:43:42,175
Almost no one.

1364
01:43:43,218 --> 01:43:47,389
I have to ride around,
looking at nature's beauty,

1365
01:43:47,806 --> 01:43:51,560
calling on people,
doing the odd circumcision,

1366
01:43:51,977 --> 01:43:53,645
giving jabs,

1367
01:43:54,062 --> 01:43:55,272
piercing ears, etc.

1368
01:43:55,522 --> 01:43:58,608
If I'm no use to others,

1369
01:43:59,025 --> 01:44:03,029
at least I make the most of life.
I observe nature.

1370
01:44:03,238 --> 01:44:04,906
Observing nature is better

1371
01:44:05,282 --> 01:44:09,035
than playing backgammon.
Or doing nothing.

1372
01:44:09,369 --> 01:44:11,037
This is the place, doctor.

1373
01:44:11,621 --> 01:44:14,124
Idleness leads to corruption.

1374
01:44:16,960 --> 01:44:20,714
Well, well, it's our invalid!
She's my friend.

1375
01:44:21,131 --> 01:44:22,799
She's as old as Methuselah.

1376
01:44:22,924 --> 01:44:25,010
Hello, are you well?

1377
01:44:25,719 --> 01:44:27,387
It's been a while!

1378
01:44:29,473 --> 01:44:32,392
I have things to do.
I'll come back. Are you staying?

1379
01:44:46,364 --> 01:44:48,450
You haven't seen my colleagues?

1380
01:44:48,533 --> 01:44:50,202
No.

1381
01:45:38,041 --> 01:45:39,292
Madam.

1382
01:46:20,834 --> 01:46:22,502
You left the baby!

1383
01:46:22,627 --> 01:46:24,296
I went to fetch you some milk.

1384
01:46:24,462 --> 01:46:26,131
You haven't seen my colleagues?

1385
01:46:26,423 --> 01:46:28,925
No. I only saw them this morning.

1386
01:46:31,303 --> 01:46:32,971
This morning.

1387
01:46:33,513 --> 01:46:34,764
And this afternoon?

1388
01:46:36,016 --> 01:46:38,935
- Did they have the gear?
- No, they had nothing.

1389
01:46:54,534 --> 01:46:57,037
I've prescribed her some pills.

1390
01:46:57,454 --> 01:46:59,956
Give them to her

1391
01:47:00,373 --> 01:47:02,459
to ease the pain.

1392
01:47:07,881 --> 01:47:10,800
We don't have a car
to get to the chemist's.

1393
01:47:11,217 --> 01:47:13,720
Give her medicine.

1394
01:47:14,137 --> 01:47:14,971
There's none left.

1395
01:47:15,388 --> 01:47:16,222
What's the matter?

1396
01:47:17,891 --> 01:47:19,142
It's her prescription.

1397
01:47:19,225 --> 01:47:20,060
Whose?

1398
01:47:20,810 --> 01:47:21,645
The invalid's.

1399
01:47:22,896 --> 01:47:25,357
The old woman? I'll fetch it.

1400
01:47:27,442 --> 01:47:29,110
Can you drop me off?

1401
01:47:29,527 --> 01:47:30,779
Yes, of course.

1402
01:47:34,115 --> 01:47:35,784
Good-bye. Drive safely.

1403
01:47:37,285 --> 01:47:39,037
I'm like a general without an army.

1404
01:47:39,204 --> 01:47:40,872
Where do you want to go?

1405
01:47:41,206 --> 01:47:43,458
I'm going to the hospital.

1406
01:47:44,960 --> 01:47:48,713
Are you worried about your car
or about the victim?

1407
01:47:49,130 --> 01:47:49,965
What do you think?

1408
01:47:50,382 --> 01:47:52,467
I think that before we get there,

1409
01:47:52,592 --> 01:47:55,095
the victim will be up and gone.

1410
01:47:55,387 --> 01:47:57,472
No, I beg of you,

1411
01:47:57,889 --> 01:47:59,975
give her the medication.

1412
01:48:00,266 --> 01:48:02,519
They're painkillers.

1413
01:48:03,436 --> 01:48:06,064
Two tablets in the morning
and two at night,

1414
01:48:06,272 --> 01:48:08,775
dissolved in water.

1415
01:48:12,445 --> 01:48:14,948
You said two in the morning
and two at night?

1416
01:48:15,365 --> 01:48:16,616
Yes.

1417
01:48:17,033 --> 01:48:20,954
When you go to the chemist's,

1418
01:48:21,830 --> 01:48:25,375
you have to be very determined

1419
01:48:25,583 --> 01:48:27,669
or they won't give you everything.

1420
01:48:27,877 --> 01:48:29,129
Is it hard to come by?

1421
01:48:29,546 --> 01:48:32,882
That's not the issue.
Chemists are like that.

1422
01:48:33,383 --> 01:48:37,137
She's suffering, poor thing.
We can't do anything.

1423
01:48:37,679 --> 01:48:40,181
Let her take this and sleep.

1424
01:48:40,306 --> 01:48:42,600
Doctor, what's wrong with her?

1425
01:48:42,809 --> 01:48:44,477
Oh, excuse me a second.

1426
01:48:48,565 --> 01:48:52,318
Speak louder. It's windy.
I can't hear you.

1427
01:48:56,197 --> 01:48:57,449
I can't hear you.

1428
01:49:00,785 --> 01:49:02,454
How do you know?

1429
01:49:03,872 --> 01:49:05,957
I said, how do you know?

1430
01:49:08,293 --> 01:49:10,378
I can't hear. Speak louder.

1431
01:49:16,718 --> 01:49:17,802
We were cut off.

1432
01:49:21,222 --> 01:49:22,474
You were saying, doctor...

1433
01:49:22,891 --> 01:49:25,393
What's wrong with her?

1434
01:49:26,394 --> 01:49:29,105
Nothing,

1435
01:49:29,230 --> 01:49:31,316
she's just old and weak.

1436
01:49:32,442 --> 01:49:35,779
She's just a bag of bones

1437
01:49:36,196 --> 01:49:39,532
and she's not very well at all.

1438
01:49:41,618 --> 01:49:43,703
Old age is a terrible illness.

1439
01:49:44,370 --> 01:49:47,874
Yes, but there are worse illnesses.

1440
01:49:48,374 --> 01:49:49,626
Death...

1441
01:49:50,794 --> 01:49:52,045
- Death?
- Yes.

1442
01:49:52,462 --> 01:49:54,547
Death is the worst.

1443
01:49:55,548 --> 01:49:57,884
When you close your eyes
on this world,

1444
01:49:58,093 --> 01:50:00,178
this beauty, the wonders of nature

1445
01:50:00,887 --> 01:50:02,555
and the generosity of God,

1446
01:50:02,680 --> 01:50:06,434
it means
you'll never be coming back.

1447
01:50:12,023 --> 01:50:14,943
They say that the other world
is more beautiful.

1448
01:50:15,902 --> 01:50:17,153
But...

1449
01:50:17,612 --> 01:50:21,366
who has come back from there
to tell us

1450
01:50:21,825 --> 01:50:24,327
if it's beautiful or not?

1451
01:50:25,620 --> 01:50:30,208
<i>"They tell me she is as beautiful
as a houri from heaven!</i>

1452
01:50:31,042 --> 01:50:32,293
<i>"Yet I say</i>

1453
01:50:32,710 --> 01:50:35,630
<i>"That the juice of the vine
is better.</i>

1454
01:50:36,047 --> 01:50:40,218
<i>"Prefer the present
to these fine promises.</i>

1455
01:50:41,052 --> 01:50:44,806
<i>"Even a drum sounds melodious
from afar...</i>

1456
01:50:46,474 --> 01:50:48,560
<i>"Prefer the present..."</i>

1457
01:54:46,881 --> 01:54:48,132
Hello.

1458
01:54:48,883 --> 01:54:50,551
Hello.
