1
00:01:57,994 --> 00:02:00,914
Dad, what are you doing
with his tail?

2
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:04,209
I'm putting it under his head...

3
00:02:04,375 --> 00:02:07,170
so he'll be reborn as a person
with a ponytail...

4
00:02:07,337 --> 00:02:08,797
and not as a clog with a tail
.

5
00:02:09,297 --> 00:02:10,757
Oh, really?

6
00:02:15,303 --> 00:02:19,808
Everyone dies,
but no one is ever truly dead.

7
00:02:33,363 --> 00:02:34,531
Let's go.

8
00:03:03,643 --> 00:03:09,816
THE CAVE OF THE YELLOW DOG

9
00:03:28,626 --> 00:03:30,587
Now the ladle is broken, too.

10
00:03:48,229 --> 00:03:50,148
Chuluna, come here.

11
00:03:53,151 --> 00:03:54,319
Hurry up!

12
00:05:13,523 --> 00:05:17,777
Come on. You're home.

13
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,363
Mum!

14
00:05:21,447 --> 00:05:24,909
My daughter,
look how you've grown.

15
00:05:26,577 --> 00:05:27,954
Dad!

16
00:05:28,121 --> 00:05:30,099
My big girl!
Did you have a good trip?

17
00:05:30,123 --> 00:05:32,309
- Yes.
- How did you get here?

18
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:33,543
The driver brought me.

19
00:05:35,503 --> 00:05:37,922
- Did you miss us?
- Yes, very much.

20
00:05:38,089 --> 00:05:39,966
- Did you learn a lot?
- Yes.

21
00:05:43,469 --> 00:05:45,596
The school uniform looks
so good on her.

22
00:05:46,347 --> 00:05:47,557
It really does.

23
00:05:48,308 --> 00:05:50,768
But the collar is too tight.

24
00:05:50,935 --> 00:05:52,228
It's meant to be like that.

25
00:05:53,146 --> 00:05:54,314
Here's your deel.

26
00:05:55,064 --> 00:05:56,190
Dad?

27
00:05:58,693 --> 00:06:01,321
- What is it, my child?
- What were you doing outside?

28
00:06:01,487 --> 00:06:02,905
I was watching the sheep.

29
00:06:05,158 --> 00:06:06,617
Did the wolf come back?

30
00:06:09,162 --> 00:06:10,163
Yes.

31
00:06:12,832 --> 00:06:14,935
Did you learn many new songs?

32
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:16,044
Yes.

33
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:18,379
Teach them to your sister, okay?

34
00:06:18,546 --> 00:06:19,964
Let me help you.

35
00:06:29,098 --> 00:06:32,769
Dad, do you want to see
my school books?

36
00:06:32,935 --> 00:06:34,312
Sure.

37
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:42,862
You've grown so much!

38
00:06:43,029 --> 00:06:45,031
Let's have a look then.

39
00:06:48,534 --> 00:06:50,119
Okay.

40
00:06:57,418 --> 00:06:59,212
Is this your maths book?

41
00:06:59,379 --> 00:07:01,148
What nice writing.

42
00:07:01,172 --> 00:07:02,882
Look, I got a star.

43
00:07:04,384 --> 00:07:06,010
Let's see.

44
00:07:08,304 --> 00:07:09,389
Yes.

45
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:12,266
Another star!

46
00:07:54,642 --> 00:07:57,538
Mum, can I have some dung?

47
00:07:57,562 --> 00:07:59,063
Go ahead and take some.

48
00:08:04,277 --> 00:08:06,446
Come on, let's play with it!

49
00:08:09,073 --> 00:08:14,054
We'll build the yurts
on top of each other, like in the city.

50
00:08:14,078 --> 00:08:14,996
Okay.

51
00:08:16,456 --> 00:08:22,795
If we were in the city,
I'd like to live at the very top.

52
00:08:22,962 --> 00:08:26,757
It's much too dark down below.

53
00:08:28,801 --> 00:08:31,804
Like this.

54
00:08:34,849 --> 00:08:36,017
There we are.

55
00:09:11,552 --> 00:09:13,447
Nansal, instead of playing...

56
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:15,890
could you collect some dung
to cure the meat?

57
00:09:16,057 --> 00:09:19,828
But I've never collected
dung before.

58
00:09:19,852 --> 00:09:21,187
Then just give it a try.

59
00:09:22,605 --> 00:09:24,482
Come on, little one,
I need the basket.

60
00:09:44,585 --> 00:09:48,381
- Nansal, please don't go too far away!
- All right!

61
00:10:08,234 --> 00:10:10,778
Those two vultures are still circling.

62
00:10:11,529 --> 00:10:13,906
- Greetings.
- Greetings.

63
00:10:16,617 --> 00:10:19,245
- Is your herd grazing well?
- Yes, everything's fine.

64
00:10:19,412 --> 00:10:20,580
Has it been a good summer?

65
00:10:20,746 --> 00:10:22,540
- Yes, and for you?
- For us, too.

66
00:10:23,291 --> 00:10:26,419
- Good hunting?
- Yes, the hunting is good.

67
00:10:27,628 --> 00:10:30,339
- Where're you coming from?
- We were at Baruun Gol.

68
00:10:32,466 --> 00:10:36,863
We were hunting wolves there.

69
00:10:36,887 --> 00:10:40,433
Is it peaceful in your area?

70
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:43,394
No, it's not very peaceful
around here.

71
00:10:44,687 --> 00:10:46,439
There are more and more wolves.

72
00:10:47,064 --> 00:10:49,233
Yes, there are lots of them.

73
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:52,236
That's true.

74
00:12:36,048 --> 00:12:38,134
Almost fell and died.

75
00:13:07,246 --> 00:13:09,165
Who's there?

76
00:13:16,505 --> 00:13:19,800
Many people are selling their livestock
and moving to the city.

77
00:13:19,967 --> 00:13:21,802
- That's true.
- Right.

78
00:13:24,305 --> 00:13:27,391
Times are changing.

79
00:13:27,558 --> 00:13:30,853
Yes, only stray dogs
are left behind.

80
00:13:31,562 --> 00:13:35,524
The bad part is that
they're mixing with the wolves.

81
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:38,944
They got two more of my sheep
last night!

82
00:13:39,111 --> 00:13:40,613
Oh, my!

83
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:42,883
It's been happening
everywhere lately.

84
00:13:42,907 --> 00:13:46,970
Something ought to be done.

85
00:13:46,994 --> 00:13:48,162
Nowadays...

86
00:13:48,329 --> 00:13:53,167
When I was young, everyone
used to fight the wolves together.

87
00:13:53,334 --> 00:13:58,398
But now, fewer
and fewer people live here.

88
00:13:58,422 --> 00:14:01,425
This is true.
I have to go and check on my sheep.

89
00:14:01,592 --> 00:14:03,862
?
Do you get around much

90
00:14:03,886 --> 00:14:08,200
Not really, but tomorrow I'm off to sell
the skins of the sheep that were killed.

91
00:14:08,224 --> 00:14:11,995
I ordered some ammunition
with Badam.

92
00:14:12,019 --> 00:14:15,248
Could you pick it up for me
if you get the chance?

93
00:14:15,272 --> 00:14:16,774
Sure, I can do that.

94
00:14:18,859 --> 00:14:20,361
I'm taking you home.

95
00:14:26,867 --> 00:14:28,786
Wait for me. Here you go.

96
00:14:40,089 --> 00:14:43,217
Come on,
let's go, little one.

97
00:14:54,645 --> 00:14:59,567
Come here, little one.

98
00:15:03,445 --> 00:15:04,905
Here you go!

99
00:15:07,908 --> 00:15:09,827
So where's your mother?

100
00:15:12,454 --> 00:15:16,876
Where is she?
Where is she?

101
00:15:37,062 --> 00:15:39,940
Dear, where did you get that dog?

102
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:45,279
I found him.
I want to play with him.

103
00:15:45,446 --> 00:15:49,867
You were to collect dung,
but decided to play instead.

104
00:15:50,492 --> 00:15:52,286
What if his owner wants him back?

105
00:15:52,912 --> 00:15:54,997
I won't give him back!

106
00:15:55,164 --> 00:15:58,417
You think so? What a cutie.

107
00:15:59,293 --> 00:16:03,714
Maybe he got lost.

108
00:16:10,596 --> 00:16:12,473
He's so cute!

109
00:16:13,557 --> 00:16:19,396
Maybe someone left him behind
when they moved on.

110
00:16:21,065 --> 00:16:24,526
- Let me.
- I'll give him mine, too.

111
00:16:40,167 --> 00:16:43,504
I named him Zochor.
See the spots?

112
00:17:04,942 --> 00:17:06,276
Listen, Nansal!

113
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:10,406
- You must bring him back.
- No!

114
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:14,243
What do you mean, "No"?
Bring him back!

115
00:17:15,661 --> 00:17:17,162
No.

116
00:17:17,329 --> 00:17:19,498
He probably lived with wolves.

117
00:17:19,665 --> 00:17:22,126
There were no wolves
where I found him.

118
00:17:23,127 --> 00:17:24,169
Oh, really?

119
00:17:25,546 --> 00:17:27,339
Only wolves live in caves.

120
00:17:28,882 --> 00:17:30,175
I found him.

121
00:17:33,012 --> 00:17:35,014
Now he belongs to me.

122
00:17:42,646 --> 00:17:44,815
Why weren't you more strict
from the start?

123
00:17:45,315 --> 00:17:48,027
If you had said no immediately,
it would be easier now.

124
00:17:50,029 --> 00:17:54,199
It could be fate that he came to us.

125
00:18:23,854 --> 00:18:24,980
Go away!

126
00:18:29,485 --> 00:18:31,028
Get going! Go!

127
00:20:44,828 --> 00:20:48,624
After you come back tomorrow,
we'll make preparations to move on.

128
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:49,708
All right.

129
00:20:53,879 --> 00:20:56,340
Do you need anything?
Flour? Rice?

130
00:20:57,633 --> 00:21:00,886
That can wait until we've moved on,
but I do need a new ladle.

131
00:21:01,053 --> 00:21:01,970
Okay.

132
00:21:13,815 --> 00:21:16,026
And have Nansal
send the dog away.

133
00:21:17,236 --> 00:21:19,947
- Take care of yourselves!
- Yes. Drive carefully.

134
00:23:47,928 --> 00:23:53,809
You sure are beastly!

135
00:24:07,072 --> 00:24:09,699
Nansal, would you give me a hand
with the cheese?

136
00:24:16,373 --> 00:24:18,417
I'll lift, and you pull it out.

137
00:24:19,376 --> 00:24:20,710
Come on.

138
00:24:23,422 --> 00:24:25,757
A little more.

139
00:24:25,924 --> 00:24:27,426
Okay.

140
00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:30,762
Bring me the wooden board, please
.

141
00:24:42,607 --> 00:24:44,109
Be careful not to fall.

142
00:24:52,075 --> 00:24:53,243
Put it here.

143
00:24:53,410 --> 00:24:54,744
Hold it like that.

144
00:24:55,745 --> 00:24:57,038
Wait, don't let go.

145
00:25:07,007 --> 00:25:09,426
Shouldn’t you cut it in half first?

146
00:25:15,265 --> 00:25:18,268
- The cheese turned out nicely.
- That's true.

147
00:25:25,025 --> 00:25:30,071
Mum, I hid Zochor between the sheep
so Dad wouldn't find him.

148
00:25:38,788 --> 00:25:43,084
That won't help.
Please take him back.

149
00:25:43,251 --> 00:25:47,464
You're mean!
He's so cute.

150
00:25:49,799 --> 00:25:53,303
I don't see
why you don't want him.

151
00:25:54,721 --> 00:25:56,932
It's not about wanting him or not.

152
00:25:59,476 --> 00:26:01,895
Let's put this aside.

153
00:26:06,983 --> 00:26:09,528
Stretch your hand, like I'm doing.

154
00:26:10,987 --> 00:26:14,282
Now try to bite
the palm of your hand.

155
00:26:17,869 --> 00:26:19,263
I can't!

156
00:26:19,287 --> 00:26:22,874
You can't?
Try it again.

157
00:26:27,254 --> 00:26:29,172
And now?

158
00:26:29,381 --> 00:26:31,025
It doesn't work.

159
00:26:31,049 --> 00:26:34,636
You see? Although it seems so close,
it's still too far away to bite.

160
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:37,806
You can't have everything
that you see.

161
00:26:43,228 --> 00:26:46,439
I just can't do it!

162
00:27:32,527 --> 00:27:37,365
Nansal, please don't leave
any young animals behind.

163
00:27:39,534 --> 00:27:46,916
Always keep that mountain in sight.
And don't get lost.

164
00:27:48,793 --> 00:27:51,314
Dad already taught me.

165
00:27:51,338 --> 00:27:54,900
The tip of the mountain
is my landmark.

166
00:27:54,924 --> 00:27:57,010
What a smart girl!

167
00:28:02,891 --> 00:28:05,185
Off you go, then.
And ride carefully.

168
00:28:14,736 --> 00:28:20,075
Zochor, come on! Zochor, come on!
Zochor, come on!

169
00:29:16,381 --> 00:29:21,136
Mum, why didn't you wake me?

170
00:29:21,302 --> 00:29:23,513
Why did you want to get up
so early?

171
00:29:24,013 --> 00:29:26,141
I wanted...

172
00:29:27,767 --> 00:29:32,206
to go to town with Dad.

173
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:33,356
Why?

174
00:29:35,191 --> 00:29:36,818
To look at all the houses.

175
00:29:36,985 --> 00:29:39,738
Why's that?

176
00:29:42,073 --> 00:29:47,203
People can pee
inside their houses there.

177
00:29:47,370 --> 00:29:51,958
Is that so?
People can pee inside their houses?

178
00:29:53,001 --> 00:29:54,627
Nansal said so.

179
00:29:54,794 --> 00:29:56,921
- Nansal said that?
- Yes.

180
00:30:14,397 --> 00:30:17,066
Zochor, can you bite it?

181
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:22,363
Zochor.

182
00:30:23,281 --> 00:30:25,408
Just try it!

183
00:30:30,914 --> 00:30:32,540
Here, Zochor.

184
00:30:41,549 --> 00:30:44,385
You can't do it either.

185
00:30:50,850 --> 00:30:53,061
Zochor! Zochor!

186
00:30:54,145 --> 00:30:59,359
Zochor, do you want to go back
to your cave or stay with me?

187
00:31:01,152 --> 00:31:02,237
Zochor?

188
00:31:03,029 --> 00:31:05,114
That tastes good, doesn't it?

189
00:31:14,916 --> 00:31:20,004
Mum, can I wear the deel
that you're sewing?

190
00:31:22,298 --> 00:31:25,885
It won't fit you.
It's for your sister.

191
00:31:26,970 --> 00:31:29,389
She has to go back to school soon.

192
00:31:34,435 --> 00:31:37,397
Will she be gone for so long again?

193
00:31:37,564 --> 00:31:40,984
Yes, for a long time.

194
00:31:44,487 --> 00:31:46,465
I'll miss her.

195
00:31:46,489 --> 00:31:48,241
Will you miss her?

196
00:31:54,581 --> 00:31:57,166
Go and get your brother.
He's crying.

197
00:33:12,325 --> 00:33:13,826
Where did he go?

198
00:33:36,432 --> 00:33:37,475
Zochor?

199
00:33:46,234 --> 00:33:47,819
Where are you?

200
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:04,377
Zochor! Zochor!

201
00:34:14,470 --> 00:34:15,972
Stay here.

202
00:34:54,844 --> 00:34:56,054
Zochor!

203
00:34:57,305 --> 00:34:58,306
Zochor!

204
00:35:01,726 --> 00:35:02,769
Zochor!

205
00:35:11,819 --> 00:35:12,987
Zochor!

206
00:35:14,113 --> 00:35:15,156
Zochor!

207
00:35:24,123 --> 00:35:25,666
Wait, wait.

208
00:35:33,007 --> 00:35:34,133
I'll feed you
.

209
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:39,931
Come on.

210
00:35:40,098 --> 00:35:44,102
Fine. You can eat on your own.
You eat, too.

211
00:35:53,945 --> 00:35:58,199
The herd came back on its own.
I have to go and look for your sister.

212
00:35:59,575 --> 00:36:02,703
- Can you take care of your brother?
- Yes, I can.

213
00:36:13,214 --> 00:36:14,966
Do you want more?

214
00:36:25,977 --> 00:36:26,894
There.

215
00:37:49,268 --> 00:37:50,353
Zochor.

216
00:38:04,116 --> 00:38:06,827
Zochor!
Hello, Zochor.

217
00:38:08,371 --> 00:38:10,122
What are you doing here?

218
00:38:13,751 --> 00:38:17,004
I was so afraid that you'd left me!

219
00:38:18,422 --> 00:38:22,134
You just sleep wherever you want,
don't you?

220
00:38:27,014 --> 00:38:29,350
We have to go home.

221
00:38:31,018 --> 00:38:32,853
Wake up, Zochor.

222
00:39:18,107 --> 00:39:22,361
Stop it.
You can't play with Buddha.

223
00:39:22,987 --> 00:39:24,864
You can't play with Buddha.

224
00:39:25,031 --> 00:39:26,699
I'm telling Mum!

225
00:41:28,404 --> 00:41:32,783
It'll dry nicely here.

226
00:42:14,033 --> 00:42:15,659
Take a big sip.

227
00:42:52,696 --> 00:42:56,867
You're lucky the dog didn't end up
in the Cave of the Yellow Dog.

228
00:42:59,453 --> 00:43:02,748
What's
the Cave of the Yellow Dog?

229
00:43:03,499 --> 00:43:06,418
I'll tell you the story.

230
00:43:07,461 --> 00:43:11,924
Long ago,
a rich family lived in these lands.

231
00:43:12,758 --> 00:43:15,678
They had a beautiful daughter.

232
00:43:16,345 --> 00:43:19,723
One day,
the daughter became very ill.

233
00:43:19,890 --> 00:43:22,768
No medicine could help...

234
00:43:25,229 --> 00:43:29,191
so the father decided
to ask a wise man for advice.

235
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:34,589
The wise man said, "Your yellow dog
is angry. You must send him away."

236
00:43:34,613 --> 00:43:38,468
The father asked, " But why?
He protects us and our herd."

237
00:43:38,492 --> 00:43:43,205
The man replied, "That's what I have to
say and what you wanted to know"
.

238
00:43:43,831 --> 00:43:50,272
The father didn't have the heart
to kill the yellow dog...

239
00:43:50,296 --> 00:43:54,049
but for his daughter's sake,
he had to do something.

240
00:43:55,843 --> 00:44:00,323
So he hid the dog in a cave
from which it was impossible to escape.

241
00:44:00,347 --> 00:44:06,645
He brought it food every day.
One day, the clog was gone
.

242
00:44:07,313 --> 00:44:10,065
But the daughter really did get better.

243
00:44:12,067 --> 00:44:15,613
The reason being...

244
00:44:16,488 --> 00:44:22,286
that the daughter was in love
with a young man.

245
00:44:22,453 --> 00:44:25,640
And with the yellow dog gone
...

246
00:44:25,664 --> 00:44:33,664
the couple could meet
without being disturbed.

247
00:44:41,138 --> 00:44:43,098
I think it's stopped raining.

248
00:44:50,064 --> 00:44:53,501
My daughter took over for her father
today, and look what happened.

249
00:44:53,525 --> 00:44:55,920
- Oh, well.
- Many thanks!

250
00:44:55,944 --> 00:44:58,280
Goodbye. Travel safely.

251
00:45:18,175 --> 00:45:19,385
Zochor, let's go.

252
00:45:20,135 --> 00:45:21,303
Stay healthy.

253
00:45:21,470 --> 00:45:23,263
Have a good trip home.

254
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:16,316
My two little dwarfs.

255
00:46:19,862 --> 00:46:21,864
Come on, let's put them to bed.

256
00:46:24,241 --> 00:46:26,618
You get ready for bed, too.

257
00:46:49,391 --> 00:46:51,268
What is it this time?

258
00:47:23,926 --> 00:47:27,054
Mum, do you remember
your previous lives?

259
00:47:27,221 --> 00:47:29,032
I don't think so.

260
00:47:29,056 --> 00:47:30,098
Why not?

261
00:47:31,642 --> 00:47:35,020
Only little children can do that.
They often tell colorful stories.

262
00:47:35,187 --> 00:47:37,689
People say they're talking
about previous lives.

263
00:47:41,652 --> 00:47:43,695
Did I talk about those things?

264
00:47:43,862 --> 00:47:45,989
Of course.
You talked quite a lot.

265
00:47:46,156 --> 00:47:48,468
What kind of stories did I tell?

266
00:47:48,492 --> 00:47:51,328
Go to sleep,
or your siblings will wake up.

267
00:48:30,868 --> 00:48:32,619
Grandma...

268
00:48:32,786 --> 00:48:35,205
what happened to the yellow dog?

269
00:48:35,372 --> 00:48:39,334
The young couple got married,
and then they had a child.

270
00:48:40,002 --> 00:48:44,172
Perhaps the dog was reborn
with a ponytail.

271
00:48:45,340 --> 00:48:46,633
Really?

272
00:48:48,218 --> 00:48:51,388
Will I be reborn as a person
In my next life?

273
00:48:52,306 --> 00:48:54,683
Come here.
I'll show you something.

274
00:49:20,918 --> 00:49:24,880
Tell me when a grain of rice
balances on the tip of the needle.

275
00:49:37,893 --> 00:49:40,145
That's impossible!

276
00:49:42,105 --> 00:49:46,234
See, my child? That's how hard
It is to be born again as a person.

277
00:49:46,401 --> 00:49:50,948
That's why
a human life is so valuable.

278
00:50:16,765 --> 00:50:19,226
I see a child on a camel.

279
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:26,334
- Yes, you're right.
- Or on a horse.

280
00:50:26,358 --> 00:50:27,693
Where?

281
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:32,864
- Look there!
- Oh, that.

282
00:50:34,366 --> 00:50:37,285
I see lots of animals at once.

283
00:50:37,953 --> 00:50:41,748
I found an elephant.

284
00:50:42,499 --> 00:50:44,001
Yes, I see him!

285
00:50:46,461 --> 00:50:48,255
I see a giraffe.

286
00:50:49,131 --> 00:50:51,109
What's a giraffe?

287
00:50:51,133 --> 00:50:54,094
Look!
What does he look like?

288
00:50:54,886 --> 00:50:57,305
- I don't know.
- See?

289
00:50:58,098 --> 00:50:59,766
I'd say that's a giraffe!

290
00:51:09,693 --> 00:51:10,736
Not so close.

291
00:51:46,980 --> 00:51:48,482
Come out of the smoke.

292
00:51:51,985 --> 00:51:58,867
I'll sing to you, and you dance.

293
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:30,690
Mum, I have to tell you something.

294
00:52:31,316 --> 00:52:33,068
What is it?

295
00:52:33,735 --> 00:52:36,005
Nansalmaa's lying.

296
00:52:36,029 --> 00:52:37,114
How's that?

297
00:52:41,034 --> 00:52:42,119
What did she say?

298
00:52:42,786 --> 00:52:46,039
That she saw a giraffe and stuff.

299
00:52:49,376 --> 00:52:53,255
Let her be,
and don't laugh at her.

300
00:52:56,424 --> 00:52:57,759
Maybe...

301
00:53:00,971 --> 00:53:05,016
she's talking about a previous life,
just like you said.

302
00:53:05,767 --> 00:53:06,977
Yes, maybe.

303
00:53:09,896 --> 00:53:12,774
If it's true...

304
00:53:19,906 --> 00:53:21,158
Imagine!

305
00:53:24,703 --> 00:53:25,829
It's so funny.

306
00:53:32,002 --> 00:53:33,086
Now we'll dance.

307
00:54:18,131 --> 00:54:19,132
Zochor!

308
00:54:20,759 --> 00:54:21,801
Zochor?

309
00:54:23,345 --> 00:54:24,596
Zochor!

310
00:54:33,980 --> 00:54:35,106
Zochor!

311
00:54:45,951 --> 00:54:47,786
Zochor...

312
00:55:14,771 --> 00:55:18,275
- I'm home.
- So good to have you back!

313
00:55:18,441 --> 00:55:19,609
Zochor.

314
00:55:20,026 --> 00:55:22,862
Did you get everything done?
Are you tired?

315
00:55:23,029 --> 00:55:24,572
The trip wasn't too bad.

316
00:55:25,699 --> 00:55:28,285
I sold the sheepskins.

317
00:55:34,708 --> 00:55:37,585
- Did you see Uncle Dorj?
- Yes, I visited him.

318
00:55:40,171 --> 00:55:43,901
Did you talk to him about Nansal?

319
00:55:43,925 --> 00:55:47,929
Yes, he agreed to let her live with him
while she's at school.

320
00:55:49,639 --> 00:55:52,851
But we don't know
if that's all right with Nansal.

321
00:55:53,018 --> 00:55:56,396
I could also get a job in town,
at a department store, for example.

322
00:55:56,771 --> 00:56:00,650
A salary like that
wouldn't be enough for us to live on.

323
00:56:05,363 --> 00:56:08,450
- Where are the children?
- They're playing outside.

324
00:56:24,883 --> 00:56:27,320
Just like I promised.

325
00:56:27,344 --> 00:56:29,095
How nice.

326
00:56:30,764 --> 00:56:34,118
Can this resist heat?
What a color.

327
00:56:34,142 --> 00:56:37,812
- This is also for us.
- Small and light.

328
00:56:38,938 --> 00:56:41,900
A torch. How practical.

329
00:56:42,901 --> 00:56:45,278
I figured we could use one
.

330
00:56:53,161 --> 00:56:55,205
How did the elections turn out?

331
00:56:55,789 --> 00:56:58,392
They say they'll be repeated.

332
00:56:58,416 --> 00:57:00,251
Why is that?

333
00:57:02,420 --> 00:57:04,714
I don't know.

334
00:57:09,386 --> 00:57:10,637
Zochor.

335
00:57:11,679 --> 00:57:13,723
Come now, do as I say.

336
00:57:15,183 --> 00:57:19,312
Come to me, my little ones.

337
00:57:20,397 --> 00:57:23,108
I missed you so much.

338
00:57:24,776 --> 00:57:27,112
Come here.

339
00:57:29,072 --> 00:57:31,157
- Here, little one.
- Here, little one.

340
00:57:34,994 --> 00:57:36,913
Here, for you.

341
00:57:39,082 --> 00:57:40,542
Here.

342
00:57:40,708 --> 00:57:42,377
- Here we go.
- Here we go.

343
00:57:44,295 --> 00:57:46,840
- Here.
- That's for you.

344
00:57:47,006 --> 00:57:48,842
Wow, so many...

345
00:57:51,094 --> 00:57:54,597
Wait, I'll show you
how it works.

346
00:58:13,992 --> 00:58:16,244
Like this.

347
00:58:28,381 --> 00:58:30,192
Let me see.

348
00:58:30,216 --> 00:58:31,217
Wait, wait.

349
00:58:32,802 --> 00:58:36,014
He'll come to you all by himself.

350
00:58:37,056 --> 00:58:38,516
That's how it works.

351
00:58:42,061 --> 00:58:44,355
That's how it works.

352
00:58:46,024 --> 00:58:47,066
Zochor!

353
00:58:48,610 --> 00:58:52,155
Listen, Nansal!
Didn't I tell you to send the dog away?

354
00:59:11,674 --> 00:59:14,802
- Did you pack your ammunition?
- Yes. Thank you.

355
00:59:14,969 --> 00:59:17,222
This is the clog
I was telling you about.

356
00:59:17,597 --> 00:59:18,932
The dog looks healthy.

357
00:59:20,767 --> 00:59:22,661
He'll surely make a good hunting dog.

358
00:59:22,685 --> 00:59:24,979
- H is color is good for hunting.
- That's true.

359
00:59:26,231 --> 00:59:28,209
Is your hunting dog getting too old?

360
00:59:28,233 --> 00:59:31,736
Yes, he won't be able to help
for much longer.

361
00:59:33,029 --> 00:59:36,866
Where did you get him?
Is he a hunting breed?

362
00:59:37,033 --> 00:59:38,802
My daughter found him.

363
00:59:38,826 --> 00:59:40,787
I found him in a cave.

364
00:59:41,829 --> 00:59:42,956
In a cave?

365
00:59:43,706 --> 00:59:46,709
I told you often enough
that we can't keep him.

366
01:00:45,560 --> 01:00:46,644
Here's your deel.

367
01:00:47,103 --> 01:00:49,230
Wasn't the last wolf attack
bad enough?

368
01:00:53,693 --> 01:00:55,737
What does that have to do
with the dog?

369
01:00:57,071 --> 01:01:00,033
I'm worried about our future.

370
01:01:02,201 --> 01:01:05,747
If he lived with wolves, they'll follow
his trail and decimate our herd.

371
01:01:10,752 --> 01:01:12,962
We don't know where he comes from.

372
01:01:18,092 --> 01:01:21,113
- Mum, come quick!
- What happened?

373
01:01:21,137 --> 01:01:23,723
Mum, come quick!

374
01:01:25,266 --> 01:01:28,811
Get back, children.
Water, quick!

375
01:01:28,978 --> 01:01:31,064
Careful! Don't get burnt!

376
01:01:34,734 --> 01:01:37,654
What bad luck.

377
01:01:39,072 --> 01:01:40,615
Such a pity.

378
01:01:46,746 --> 01:01:47,789
Let's see.

379
01:01:49,499 --> 01:01:51,668
Too bad about your dad's present.

380
01:02:28,871 --> 01:02:32,291
Mum, can I play with the torch?

381
01:02:32,458 --> 01:02:35,044
- Yes, but be careful.
- Okay.

382
01:02:40,258 --> 01:02:41,801
Nansal!

383
01:02:45,263 --> 01:02:51,227
Nansal, look at me!
Nansal, look at me!

384
01:02:55,690 --> 01:02:56,733
Get up.

385
01:02:59,569 --> 01:03:01,154
Come on, let's play!

386
01:06:25,483 --> 01:06:28,152
Nansal, come and help us!

387
01:06:56,514 --> 01:06:59,100
What a good job you're doing!!!

388
01:07:31,424 --> 01:07:33,134
Look at the little one!

389
01:07:34,010 --> 01:07:37,013
- Careful that you don't fall!
- Get down.

390
01:07:38,389 --> 01:07:39,849
Come on, don't fall.

391
01:09:04,892 --> 01:09:06,185
There.

392
01:09:25,996 --> 01:09:28,165
Nansal, come and clean up!

393
01:10:54,835 --> 01:11:01,133
What would we do without you,
great livestock herder?

394
01:11:05,346 --> 01:11:07,765
Nansal, please stay
with your brother.

395
01:11:20,861 --> 01:11:23,239
Watch him.

396
01:11:24,281 --> 01:11:26,742
Don't let him get out.

397
01:12:10,786 --> 01:12:14,724
Beautiful country of Khangai, thank you
for letting us spend the summer here.

398
01:12:14,748 --> 01:12:15,624
Yes, you are right.

399
01:14:59,705 --> 01:15:01,975
Nansal, get back on the cart!

400
01:15:01,999 --> 01:15:04,668
I was just picking up
Batbayar's belt!

401
01:15:11,842 --> 01:15:13,051
Chuluna, stop!

402
01:15:17,055 --> 01:15:19,141
The child is gone!

403
01:15:19,308 --> 01:15:22,519
Nansal, where's your brother?
Have you seen him?

404
01:15:23,145 --> 01:15:26,583
- He's not here!
- Wasn't he there?

405
01:15:26,607 --> 01:15:27,608
He's gone!

406
01:15:28,400 --> 01:15:30,944
Where's my boy?
He's not here!

407
01:15:33,822 --> 01:15:36,200
Stay with the children.
I'll ride back.

408
01:15:37,868 --> 01:15:39,536
Mum, what's wrong?

409
01:19:02,948 --> 01:19:04,032
My son.

410
01:19:15,377 --> 01:19:16,920
Let's have a look at you.

411
01:19:52,164 --> 01:19:53,665
Little one.

412
01:19:59,337 --> 01:20:00,630
Zochor.

413
01:21:13,995 --> 01:21:16,915
- Okay.
- Over here.

414
01:21:17,624 --> 01:21:18,875
Here we go.

415
01:21:22,003 --> 01:21:24,506
Look how comfortable it is.

416
01:21:24,714 --> 01:21:29,135
- Keep an eye on your brother.
- Watch your brother and hold onto him.

417
01:21:29,886 --> 01:21:32,764
You have to hold him
if he tries to climb out.

418
01:21:34,182 --> 01:21:35,851
I had better tie you down.

419
01:21:45,944 --> 01:21:47,779
Hold on to him.

420
01:21:50,907 --> 01:21:53,869
I'll take your horse.

421
01:21:55,871 --> 01:21:57,163
Nansal, hold on!

422
01:23:10,695 --> 01:23:17,702
We remind you to vote...

423
01:23:17,869 --> 01:23:21,998
in the upcoming elections.

424
01:23:22,165 --> 01:23:30,165
We hope you'll make
the right decision.

425
01:25:41,596 --> 01:25:49,479
SPECIAL THANKS
TO THE BATCHULUUN FAMILY

426
01:26:58,923 --> 01:27:01,593
You're always asleep
when I want to play.

427
01:27:04,220 --> 01:27:05,638
Maybe...

428
01:27:08,224 --> 01:27:15,148
you were a real lazybones
in a previous life.
