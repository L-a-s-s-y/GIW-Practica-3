1
00:00:08,239 --> 00:00:11,039
(Woman screams)

2
00:02:15,679 --> 00:02:17,719
(Woman 1 ) I am there.

3
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:21,159
- (Woman 2) Is she in contact?
- (Man) Shh.

4
00:02:21,279 --> 00:02:23,159
(Woman 1 )Yes, I am there.

5
00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:31,959
(Laboured breathing)

6
00:02:41,999 --> 00:02:44,239
I see.

7
00:02:44,359 --> 00:02:46,519
(Laboured breathing)

8
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:49,679
I see.

9
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:53,799
(Object fluttering)

10
00:02:56,519 --> 00:02:58,399
There's the contact.

11
00:02:58,559 --> 00:03:01,839
She's just entered... into contact.

12
00:03:01,959 --> 00:03:05,639
She's entered... into contact.

13
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:08,159
- Into contact.
- (Woman 1 breathing heavily)

14
00:03:27,839 --> 00:03:28,959
(Screams)

15
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:50,279
(Spirits moaning)

16
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:15,239
The dead! I see the dead!

17
00:04:15,879 --> 00:04:17,759
The city of the dead!

18
00:04:17,879 --> 00:04:19,679
(Gasping)

19
00:04:19,799 --> 00:04:20,799
But...

20
00:04:20,919 --> 00:04:23,319
No! Hold the link.
Don't break it.

21
00:04:23,439 --> 00:04:27,119
Hold it. It's critical for Mary.
Don't break the link. Don't break it.

22
00:04:27,239 --> 00:04:29,439
(Screams)

23
00:04:29,599 --> 00:04:32,399
Mary! Mary!

24
00:04:32,559 --> 00:04:34,879
(Gasping)

25
00:04:34,999 --> 00:04:37,599
(Spirits moaning, muttering)

26
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:41,039
(Screaming)

27
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,519
(Muttering continues)

28
00:04:48,799 --> 00:04:50,799
(Spirits moaning)

29
00:04:50,919 --> 00:04:53,319
(Rope creaking on branch)

30
00:05:10,799 --> 00:05:12,199
I'm afraid Mary's dead.

31
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:15,399
No! (Sobbing)

32
00:05:15,559 --> 00:05:17,559
No! No!

33
00:05:17,679 --> 00:05:21,319
(Sobbing) Mary! Mary!

34
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:24,079
(Siren wailing)

35
00:05:51,159 --> 00:05:53,239
All right.

36
00:05:53,359 --> 00:05:56,679
Maybe I've got no imagination,

37
00:05:56,799 --> 00:06:00,759
but your story
is a little tough to swallow.

38
00:06:04,439 --> 00:06:06,919
James McLuhan.

39
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:09,799
Busted twice
for peddling and possession.

40
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:12,959
That's right. So?

41
00:06:13,079 --> 00:06:16,199
And you expect me to believe

42
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:19,359
that Mary Woodhouse
died out of sheer fright

43
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:21,999
while you were having a séance?

44
00:06:22,119 --> 00:06:23,999
Mm-hmm.

45
00:06:25,599 --> 00:06:28,239
OK, fellas, you help us,

46
00:06:29,159 --> 00:06:31,599
we'll help you.

47
00:06:31,719 --> 00:06:33,359
What were you on?

48
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:36,239
Coke? Grass?

49
00:06:36,359 --> 00:06:39,199
- Where's the stash? Down the toilet?
- (Woman) You don't deserve any help!

50
00:06:39,319 --> 00:06:41,159
You're a comic-book version sergeant.

51
00:06:42,119 --> 00:06:46,239
Well, look better
in your mug shot, you know?

52
00:06:46,359 --> 00:06:49,799
The Great Theresa,
the master medium.

53
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:53,279
Yeah, for you,
it's all in the book of, uh...

54
00:06:53,399 --> 00:06:56,319
Your book of... what's it again?

55
00:06:56,439 --> 00:06:58,879
- Enoch.
- Yeah. Enoch.

56
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:01,399
According to you,

57
00:07:01,559 --> 00:07:06,839
this poor girl is dead because of a book
that was written 4,000 years ago, correct?

58
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:08,879
That's right.

59
00:07:08,999 --> 00:07:13,319
I would find such an unusual paradox
of tremendous appeal terribly stimulating

60
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:16,759
- if I were a sleuth.
- Hmm.

61
00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:20,559
The explanation
in every detail of a crime

62
00:07:20,679 --> 00:07:22,359
before it's been committed.

63
00:07:22,999 --> 00:07:26,599
Lady, you're either on grass
or you're pulling my leg.

64
00:07:27,119 --> 00:07:29,759
(Chuckles)
No. The problem is in your mind.

65
00:07:29,879 --> 00:07:31,799
It can't accept the truth.

66
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:35,799
But I'll help you just the same.

67
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:40,039
- In the Book of Enoch, the killer is...
- Jesus! Sergeant, come here and look!

68
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:42,079
(Spirit moaning)

69
00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:44,239
(Meaning)

70
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:15,119
(Sergeant) Who's playing games here?

71
00:08:15,239 --> 00:08:18,159
Come out of the floor,
out of nowhere.

72
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:22,159
Who lives downstairs?

73
00:08:22,279 --> 00:08:25,559
It's vacant.
Has been for 26 years.

74
00:08:25,679 --> 00:08:29,599
- But how the heck did...
- Don't you start acting up, too.

75
00:08:29,719 --> 00:08:32,439
It's only a prank,
and I'll find out what's behind it

76
00:08:32,599 --> 00:08:35,279
even if I have to tear
the whole building apart.

77
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:37,759
Keep refusing the truth.

78
00:08:37,879 --> 00:08:40,519
At this very precise moment,

79
00:08:40,639 --> 00:08:43,319
in some other distant town,

80
00:08:43,439 --> 00:08:46,279
horrendously awful things
are happening,

81
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:49,439
things that would shatter
your imagination.

82
00:08:50,039 --> 00:08:52,639
(Bird squawking)

83
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:01,399
(Squawking continues)

84
00:09:07,719 --> 00:09:10,839
(Wind howling)

85
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:51,639
(Muttering)

86
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:55,279
(Door creaks)

87
00:10:07,239 --> 00:10:09,119
(Chuckling)

88
00:10:25,159 --> 00:10:27,759
(Squishing)

89
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,639
(Whimpering)

90
00:11:12,999 --> 00:11:15,719
Hi, Officer. I'm, uh,
looking for Sergeant Clay.

91
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,759
-And who are you?
- Oh, I'm Peter Bell.

92
00:11:17,879 --> 00:11:20,079
- You see, I'm with the New York...
- Don't tell me.

93
00:11:20,199 --> 00:11:22,079
You're a newspaper reporter, right?

94
00:11:22,199 --> 00:11:25,039
I can smell you guys a mile away.

95
00:11:25,159 --> 00:11:26,999
You're right. I'm a journalist.

96
00:11:27,119 --> 00:11:29,399
Look, there's this rumour
down at the station house that, uh,

97
00:11:29,559 --> 00:11:33,199
well, someone kind of died mysteriously,
and I wanna talk to Sergeant Bell about it.

98
00:11:33,319 --> 00:11:35,319
It's not gonna be any mystery
how the next guy dies

99
00:11:35,439 --> 00:11:38,159
if I let any unauthorised people
in that house.

100
00:11:41,199 --> 00:11:44,639
Look, uh... isn't there a way that, uh,

101
00:11:44,759 --> 00:11:48,239
maybe you and I could come
to a gentlemen's agreement?

102
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:51,079
You're talking into my deaf ear, pal.

103
00:11:51,199 --> 00:11:54,639
Now, take my advice and beat it
before the sergeant comes out.

104
00:11:58,519 --> 00:12:00,759
(Sighs) OK.

105
00:12:00,879 --> 00:12:03,119
I'll take your advice.

106
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:08,119
(Wind howling)

107
00:12:23,879 --> 00:12:27,039
It's like we're in the wrong season suddenly.
Damn dust.

108
00:12:27,159 --> 00:12:30,119
All these high winds.
Pretty unusual.

109
00:12:31,759 --> 00:12:34,839
By the way, I hear Cindy Horan
never went home last night.

110
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:37,759
80? Ha, it sure wouldn't
be the first time.

111
00:12:37,879 --> 00:12:40,399
- I remember once she was sitting in...
- (Rattling)

112
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:42,199
(Shatters loudly)

113
00:13:17,759 --> 00:13:19,919
You know something?

114
00:13:20,759 --> 00:13:24,199
Ever since Father Thomas
hanged himself,

115
00:13:24,319 --> 00:13:26,879
Dunwich ain't been the same.

116
00:13:26,999 --> 00:13:29,119
It's kind of scary.

117
00:13:29,239 --> 00:13:34,079
Uh, a few beers, and you fellas start seeing
ghouls and devils all over the place.

118
00:13:34,199 --> 00:13:35,919
Well, you saw what happened,
didn't you?

119
00:13:36,039 --> 00:13:38,439
Sure, but that doesn't mean
there isn't any explanation.

120
00:13:38,599 --> 00:13:41,719
Could've been a truck passing by,
a vibration.

121
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:44,319
Anyway, I've lost my mirror.

122
00:13:44,439 --> 00:13:46,359
You forget who our ancestors were.

123
00:13:46,519 --> 00:13:50,679
(Chuckles) No. I've forgot
how many beers you've drunk.

124
00:13:50,799 --> 00:13:53,439
- So let's have another. House buys.
- (Rumbling)

125
00:14:06,599 --> 00:14:08,879
- I got to go.
- But wait. What about the be...

126
00:14:08,999 --> 00:14:10,959
- See you.
- Me too. Wait up, Mike.

127
00:14:11,079 --> 00:14:14,199
- I'll see you around. So long.
- Now, wait. Mike! Ross!

128
00:14:20,679 --> 00:14:23,119
Brand-new building,
new construction.

129
00:14:24,439 --> 00:14:26,119
Tell you.

130
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:29,039
(Chuckles)

131
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:33,359
Build garbage like this.
I'm gonna lose all of my customers.

132
00:14:37,879 --> 00:14:39,679
The language is risqué, I admit it,

133
00:14:39,799 --> 00:14:43,519
but the overall message
couldn't have been more puritanical.

134
00:14:43,639 --> 00:14:47,759
And, uh, why did you choose
the topic of incest?

135
00:14:48,919 --> 00:14:52,599
When I was eight years old,
I wanted to marry my father.

136
00:14:52,719 --> 00:14:55,919
I guess all girls that age
want to marry their fathers.

137
00:14:57,359 --> 00:14:59,919
Anyway,
I got over it pretty quickly.

138
00:15:00,039 --> 00:15:02,559
He was a drunk.

139
00:15:02,679 --> 00:15:06,119
One day, he just picked up
and left my mother and me.

140
00:15:06,799 --> 00:15:10,879
Did this leave any particular
emotional feeling in you at the time?

141
00:15:11,719 --> 00:15:13,399
Emptiness.

142
00:15:13,559 --> 00:15:15,679
That and pity for my mother.

143
00:15:15,799 --> 00:15:19,319
- I began to hate all men, and I...
- (Door opens)

144
00:15:19,439 --> 00:15:22,719
Excuse me, Gerry.
Oh, hi, Sandra.

145
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:25,039
- How are you?
- Hello, Emily.

146
00:15:25,159 --> 00:15:27,719
Well, how come so early?

147
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:30,799
I mean, I thought
we'd made it for 8:00.

148
00:15:30,919 --> 00:15:33,279
- That's the trouble. I can't make it tonight.
- Huh?

149
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:35,879
- I have to see Bob.
- Oh, Bob.

150
00:15:37,039 --> 00:15:40,279
- You're not upset, are you?
- No, I'm not upset.

151
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:42,599
I may be a little worried perhaps.

152
00:15:42,719 --> 00:15:46,199
I mean, you have been seeing
an awful lot of him, haven't you, lately?

153
00:15:46,319 --> 00:15:48,279
Aw. (Chuckles)

154
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:50,359
- Poor Bob.
- Hmm?

155
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:52,919
He's a sick and lonely kid.

156
00:15:55,359 --> 00:15:58,159
I don't see why people hate him so.

157
00:15:58,279 --> 00:16:01,799
His mother was what you'd call
a woman of easy virtue.

158
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:03,999
No husband, no morals.

159
00:16:04,119 --> 00:16:08,639
Here in Dunwich, anybody like that
is also branded a witch.

160
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:10,799
(Sighs) Look, Sandra,

161
00:16:10,919 --> 00:16:13,679
I don't believe those idiots

162
00:16:13,799 --> 00:16:17,839
who tell me that our ancestors
were Salem witch burners, all right?

163
00:16:17,959 --> 00:16:19,919
OK, OK.

164
00:16:21,599 --> 00:16:23,639
- Gerry, I am sorry.
- Don't worry.

165
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:26,879
- I'll see you tomorrow, around 9:00?
- Sure thing.

166
00:16:26,999 --> 00:16:28,679
- Bye.
- Bye.

167
00:16:30,039 --> 00:16:32,319
- So long, Sandra.
- Bye-bye. And take it easy.

168
00:16:32,439 --> 00:16:34,639
(Laughs) Check. Bye.

169
00:16:34,759 --> 00:16:36,439
Bye.

170
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:39,319
(Door closes)

171
00:16:39,439 --> 00:16:41,799
(Sighs) OK, Sandra,
where were we?

172
00:16:43,239 --> 00:16:45,719
On the same old problem - men.

173
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:49,999
Why do they have
to make life so difficult?

174
00:16:51,039 --> 00:16:52,119
(Screams)

175
00:16:52,239 --> 00:16:54,799
- (Shrieks)
- (Gerry) Sandra!

176
00:16:54,919 --> 00:16:56,519
Sandra.

177
00:16:57,439 --> 00:17:00,079
Did he hurt you?
Did he claw you?

178
00:17:00,199 --> 00:17:02,519
Oh, he was just frightened.

179
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:05,839
Strange. It's the first time
he ever acted up like that.

180
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:13,319
(Gerry) He loves to have you pet him.
He always comes to you when you're here.

181
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:15,159
Something must have frightened him.

182
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:18,839
(Horn blaring)

183
00:17:21,319 --> 00:17:24,959
(Man) Honey, you give me
the dirtiest thoughts.

184
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:29,119
I'm telling you, you're gonna end up
a dirty old man,

185
00:17:29,239 --> 00:17:32,039
a pervert, peeping Tom.

186
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:36,159
Talk about box lunches. Man!

187
00:17:37,719 --> 00:17:39,719
I saw a porno flick once

188
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:43,399
where this guy got so carried away,
he humped himself to death.

189
00:17:43,559 --> 00:17:46,999
- Too much of a good thing.
- Yeah, but what a way to go.

190
00:17:49,519 --> 00:17:51,319
Ah!

191
00:17:54,879 --> 00:17:57,159
What's the matter?
Never see a body unearthed before?

192
00:17:57,759 --> 00:18:00,199
- Any law against looking?
- Yeah.

193
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:03,559
OK. I'm leaving.

194
00:18:04,439 --> 00:18:06,079
Stupid.

195
00:18:06,199 --> 00:18:08,039
What time you got?

196
00:18:08,159 --> 00:18:10,839
- Let's flip to see who goes in the hole.
- All right.

197
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:12,879
Call it.

198
00:18:12,999 --> 00:18:15,959
- Heads.
- Tails. In the hole, sucker.

199
00:18:16,919 --> 00:18:19,079
Oh, shit.

200
00:18:25,519 --> 00:18:27,519
(: Whistling)

201
00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:43,239
(I Whistling continues)

202
00:19:24,599 --> 00:19:26,319
What are you still doing here, pal?

203
00:19:26,439 --> 00:19:29,119
- Ah, come on, fellas.
- What do you want from us?

204
00:19:29,239 --> 00:19:32,199
Nothing. I'm just curious
about this girl here, that's all.

205
00:19:32,319 --> 00:19:34,319
Look, why don't you guys
go ahead with your work,

206
00:19:34,439 --> 00:19:35,919
and, uh, pretend I'm not around.

207
00:19:36,039 --> 00:19:38,599
Well, move,
cos we're almost finished.

208
00:19:44,879 --> 00:19:46,679
(Grunts)

209
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:54,039
(Whirring)

210
00:20:10,639 --> 00:20:12,679
(Casket hits ground)

211
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:29,719
(Grunting)

212
00:20:45,159 --> 00:20:46,759
It's five o'clock.

213
00:20:46,879 --> 00:20:49,279
We've bust our balls enough.
Let's go.

214
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:55,159
Amen.

215
00:20:55,279 --> 00:20:56,599
Hey, hey.

216
00:20:56,719 --> 00:20:59,039
You're not gonna... You're not gonna
leave her like that, are you?

217
00:20:59,159 --> 00:21:00,879
Uh, union hours.

218
00:21:00,999 --> 00:21:03,879
Anyways, what does she care?
She's not in any hurry.

219
00:21:04,919 --> 00:21:06,719
Is she?

220
00:21:06,839 --> 00:21:08,799
(Sighs)

221
00:21:35,879 --> 00:21:38,559
(Gasping)

222
00:21:54,639 --> 00:21:56,559
(Whimpering)

223
00:22:03,559 --> 00:22:05,519
(Faint scream)

224
00:22:12,399 --> 00:22:14,559
(Banging on casket, faint)

225
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:21,159
(Screams)

226
00:22:21,279 --> 00:22:22,919
(Airplane passing overhead)

227
00:22:36,759 --> 00:22:39,239
(Whimpering)

228
00:22:49,519 --> 00:22:52,319
(Grunting)

229
00:23:05,399 --> 00:23:08,199
(Gasping)

230
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:14,159
(Gasping slows)

231
00:23:17,399 --> 00:23:19,719
(Gasping stops)

232
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:40,959
(Screams)

233
00:23:45,519 --> 00:23:46,799
Oh, my God!

234
00:23:46,919 --> 00:23:49,719
(Screaming, gasping)

235
00:23:50,999 --> 00:23:52,359
(Gasps)

236
00:23:55,999 --> 00:23:56,999
(Gasping continues)

237
00:24:02,999 --> 00:24:04,119
(Screams)

238
00:24:14,079 --> 00:24:15,999
(Whimpering)

239
00:24:23,599 --> 00:24:25,159
(Whimpering continues)

240
00:24:31,559 --> 00:24:33,399
(Screaming)

241
00:24:43,879 --> 00:24:47,359
(Theresa) But for you,
Mary would have suffered a terrible death.

242
00:24:49,759 --> 00:24:51,599
I was just lucky.

243
00:24:51,719 --> 00:24:54,079
No. It was written.

244
00:24:55,239 --> 00:24:58,079
Are you acquainted
with the Book of Enoch?

245
00:24:58,199 --> 00:25:02,119
A text which dates back
to more than 4,000 years ago.

246
00:25:02,239 --> 00:25:05,559
It contains man's first
recorded description of his...

247
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:10,079
his boundless mortal fear
in the face of malice itself.

248
00:25:10,199 --> 00:25:14,599
A demanding, implacable enemy
whose search for blood is never satiated.

249
00:25:14,719 --> 00:25:16,759
Mary, tell your experience -

250
00:25:16,879 --> 00:25:19,439
everything you witnessed
during our last séance.

251
00:25:20,879 --> 00:25:22,719
The city of the dead.

252
00:25:24,199 --> 00:25:26,079
The living dead.

253
00:25:27,319 --> 00:25:29,919
A cursed city

254
00:25:30,039 --> 00:25:32,079
where the gates of hell
have been opened.

255
00:25:32,759 --> 00:25:34,239
(Bell clears throat)

256
00:25:34,999 --> 00:25:37,719
Where, uh...
Where exactly is this city?

257
00:25:40,119 --> 00:25:42,559
I don't know where it is.

258
00:25:42,679 --> 00:25:46,839
All I know is that it's called... Dunwich.

259
00:25:47,999 --> 00:25:50,519
Well, I've never heard of it, uh...

260
00:25:50,639 --> 00:25:53,959
How do you know?
I mean, how can you be so sure?

261
00:25:54,679 --> 00:25:56,439
I read the name.

262
00:25:57,359 --> 00:25:59,039
On a tombstone.

263
00:25:59,159 --> 00:26:03,599
Mr Bell, if those gates are left open,
it may be the end of humanity.

264
00:26:04,639 --> 00:26:07,159
We've got to try to get them shut again.

265
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:10,519
At midnight on Monday,
we go into All Saints' Day.

266
00:26:10,639 --> 00:26:12,759
The Night of the Dead begins then.

267
00:26:12,879 --> 00:26:15,759
And if the portals of hell
don't get shut before,

268
00:26:15,879 --> 00:26:18,759
no dead body will ever be able
to rest in peace again.

269
00:26:18,879 --> 00:26:21,279
And so the dead will rise up
and take over the Earth, and...

270
00:26:21,399 --> 00:26:23,239
You must.
You've got to get to Dunwich.

271
00:26:23,359 --> 00:26:26,439
You must re-close those gates.

272
00:26:45,799 --> 00:26:48,119
(Faint squeaking)

273
00:27:01,359 --> 00:27:02,959
Bob?

274
00:27:03,079 --> 00:27:05,119
Bob, are you here?

275
00:27:06,599 --> 00:27:08,719
(Gasps)

276
00:27:09,999 --> 00:27:15,999
Bob?

277
00:27:17,639 --> 00:27:19,359
Oh!

278
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:25,599
- (Bob whimpering)
- Bob?

279
00:27:25,719 --> 00:27:28,839
(Whimpering, sobbing)

280
00:27:30,599 --> 00:27:32,399
Bob! (Gasps)

281
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:34,359
Bob!

282
00:27:34,519 --> 00:27:36,719
What's happened?
Did you hurt yourself?

283
00:27:36,839 --> 00:27:39,559
(Loud meowing)

284
00:27:40,959 --> 00:27:42,839
Oh!

285
00:27:42,959 --> 00:27:44,919
(Yowling)

286
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:49,999
- Bob!
- (Yowling continues)

287
00:27:50,119 --> 00:27:52,999
Bob! (Screams)

288
00:27:53,119 --> 00:27:54,159
Bob!

289
00:27:55,559 --> 00:27:58,319
Bob, don't leave me alone!
I'm afraid.

290
00:27:58,439 --> 00:28:00,199
(Growling)

291
00:28:01,839 --> 00:28:02,879
(Whimpering)

292
00:28:10,639 --> 00:28:12,559
(Screaming)

293
00:28:19,199 --> 00:28:21,119
(Muffled screaming)

294
00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:36,239
(Phone rings)

295
00:28:37,119 --> 00:28:38,959
Hello?

296
00:28:39,559 --> 00:28:41,039
Ah, it's you, Mr Robbins.

297
00:28:41,159 --> 00:28:43,759
No, Emily's not here, I'm afraid.

298
00:28:44,879 --> 00:28:48,039
- What's that?
- She's usually home this hour of the night.

299
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:51,919
I hope nothing's happened to her.
There's been a lot of strange talk circulating.

300
00:28:52,039 --> 00:28:55,039
Oh, come now, Mr Robbins.
Ignore it.

301
00:28:55,159 --> 00:28:59,159
People here in this town thrive on that stuff.
You should know that by now.

302
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:01,599
She'll be home in another couple of minutes.

303
00:29:01,719 --> 00:29:04,279
Ah, if you need me for any reason though,
feel free to call.

304
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:08,119
I should be at the studio
for at least another hour or so, OK?

305
00:29:08,239 --> 00:29:11,079
(Laughs)
Goodbye, Mr Robbins. Goodbye.

306
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:29,079
(Wind howling)

307
00:29:39,399 --> 00:29:42,119
(Breathing heavily)

308
00:29:42,239 --> 00:29:44,639
No, no.
Come on, Tommy, please.

309
00:29:44,759 --> 00:29:46,999
- No. Please, Tommy.
- Hey.

310
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:48,959
What the devil's the matter, honey?

311
00:29:49,079 --> 00:29:52,399
You treat me like I was a stranger.
What have I done? Tell me.

312
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:55,839
How come you picked out here to park?
This place gives me the willies.

313
00:29:55,959 --> 00:29:58,719
Oh, Rose, go on.
You're not a little child now.

314
00:29:58,839 --> 00:30:02,239
You don't really believe in that
stupid Salem witch stuff, do you?

315
00:30:02,359 --> 00:30:04,239
No, of course not.

316
00:30:11,199 --> 00:30:13,359
(Low growling)

317
00:30:29,519 --> 00:30:31,999
(Rose moaning, gasps)

318
00:30:32,119 --> 00:30:35,039
- Now what's wrong?
- Sorry, Tommy, but...

319
00:30:35,159 --> 00:30:39,599
I keep thinking that, like,
somebody's out there spying on us.

320
00:30:39,719 --> 00:30:42,239
Come on.
There isn't anyone out there.

321
00:30:42,999 --> 00:30:45,239
Watch.
I'll turn on the headlights.

322
00:30:48,639 --> 00:30:50,999
(Gasping, whimpering)

323
00:30:56,399 --> 00:30:58,159
(Engine rattling)

324
00:31:06,279 --> 00:31:07,999
(Rattling)

325
00:31:13,239 --> 00:31:15,759
(Rattling continues)

326
00:31:22,079 --> 00:31:23,839
(Screams)

327
00:31:44,359 --> 00:31:46,119
(Gagging)

328
00:32:04,319 --> 00:32:06,199
(Door rattling)

329
00:32:36,919 --> 00:32:38,199
(Retching)

330
00:32:40,199 --> 00:32:42,719
(Growling, bone crunching)

331
00:32:42,839 --> 00:32:44,719
(Screaming)

332
00:32:54,839 --> 00:32:58,079
You know this Dunwich?
It's not even on the map.

333
00:32:58,199 --> 00:33:01,119
So, you don't believe me, do you?

334
00:33:02,079 --> 00:33:05,079
That's not the point.
Just gonna be harder to find, that's all.

335
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:08,239
We don't even know
where to start, do we?

336
00:33:08,359 --> 00:33:11,679
You know, I get my inner visions, too,
you know?

337
00:33:11,799 --> 00:33:15,199
Just let me meditate
over a bottle of scotch and, uh...

338
00:33:15,319 --> 00:33:16,999
And?

339
00:33:18,439 --> 00:33:20,359
I'll take you anywhere.

340
00:33:29,199 --> 00:33:30,799
(Clanks)

341
00:33:39,159 --> 00:33:41,399
(Indistinct police radio chatter)

342
00:33:49,599 --> 00:33:52,199
(Man sobbing)

343
00:33:52,319 --> 00:33:54,399
(Man) Well,
she certainly wasn't strangled.

344
00:33:55,719 --> 00:33:58,359
Doesn't seem to have been
any kind of physical abuse.

345
00:33:58,519 --> 00:34:01,799
- What was the cause of her death then?
- Some kind of cardiac arrest.

346
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:04,639
Only, that expression on her face
looks like pure fear,

347
00:34:04,759 --> 00:34:06,599
- like something scared her to death.
- Scared her to...

348
00:34:06,719 --> 00:34:08,119
Excuse me, Mr Robbins.

349
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:10,119
Do you know if your daughter
had a heart condition?

350
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:11,919
- No.
- No?

351
00:34:12,039 --> 00:34:13,959
- No, no. She was...
- (Gerry) Mr Robbins.

352
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:17,439
- Oh, God. God! My little girl!
- Well, what's our procedure?

353
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:19,879
Sit tight. Everything depends
on the autopsy.

354
00:34:19,999 --> 00:34:21,199
I'll sit tight.

355
00:34:21,319 --> 00:34:23,119
You'll get your orders after that
from the D.A.

356
00:34:23,239 --> 00:34:25,519
OK, but let me hear from you, Joe.

357
00:34:27,919 --> 00:34:30,679
- What's your opinion, Gerry?
- (Sighs)

358
00:34:30,799 --> 00:34:33,359
What's there to say?
I'm at a total loss.

359
00:34:33,519 --> 00:34:35,559
It was... It was Bob.

360
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:37,319
That pervert.
You can bet on it.

361
00:34:37,439 --> 00:34:42,039
They should've put him away for life after
what he tried to do with poor little Ann Ross.

362
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:45,239
Listen, I'll call out all cars
after that boy.

363
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:48,879
And I wouldn't be surprised if he could tell us
what happened to Rosie Kelvin

364
00:34:48,999 --> 00:34:50,839
and Frank's kid, too.

365
00:34:50,959 --> 00:34:52,439
(Officer) Sheriff Russell!

366
00:34:52,599 --> 00:34:55,079
Sheriff, what the dickens is this?

367
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:58,359
(Squishing)

368
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:07,559
Good Lord.

369
00:35:07,679 --> 00:35:10,999
That kid's gonna fry.
Mark my word.

370
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:14,399
(Horns blaring)

371
00:35:20,319 --> 00:35:23,519
So, your, uh, newspaper editor
wouldn't believe you, huh?

372
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:29,039
Listen, when Adrian De Niro
told me about two years ago

373
00:35:29,159 --> 00:35:32,599
that I'd meet a girl who'd been buried alive,
I didn't believe him either.

374
00:35:32,719 --> 00:35:34,279
I mean, I laughed right in his face.

375
00:35:36,039 --> 00:35:37,559
De Niro was aware of many things.

376
00:35:39,559 --> 00:35:41,279
He knew all about the city of the dead.

377
00:35:43,399 --> 00:35:45,999
OK. OK.

378
00:35:46,119 --> 00:35:47,999
Say I believe you...

379
00:35:48,119 --> 00:35:50,039
Did you see...
When you were in this trance,

380
00:35:50,159 --> 00:35:53,399
did you see anything
besides that tombstone?

381
00:35:53,559 --> 00:35:55,559
Oh, yes.

382
00:35:55,679 --> 00:35:56,879
I saw a priest...

383
00:36:00,879 --> 00:36:04,759
who, by hanging himself,
opened the gates of hell.

384
00:36:06,599 --> 00:36:08,279
He must be destroyed.

385
00:36:08,839 --> 00:36:11,919
(Woman) ...our daily bread.
Forgive us our trespasses

386
00:36:12,039 --> 00:36:14,799
as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

387
00:36:14,919 --> 00:36:18,239
And lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.

388
00:36:18,359 --> 00:36:21,839
For thine is the kingdom
and the power and the glory.

389
00:36:21,959 --> 00:36:24,639
(Sobs) Amen.

390
00:36:24,759 --> 00:36:28,999
- The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want.
- This way, please.

391
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:31,519
He maketh me lie down
in green pastures.

392
00:36:31,639 --> 00:36:34,559
Yea, though I walk through
the valley of the shadow of death...

393
00:36:34,679 --> 00:36:35,999
Where is she?

394
00:36:36,119 --> 00:36:40,039
- Where is my Emily?
- They're still preparing her, Mrs Robbins.

395
00:36:40,159 --> 00:36:42,199
(Sobbing)

396
00:37:42,359 --> 00:37:43,999
Mrs Holden.

397
00:37:44,119 --> 00:37:45,679
- Mrs Holden?
- Yes.

398
00:37:45,799 --> 00:37:47,519
Mrs Holden died last night

399
00:37:47,639 --> 00:37:50,439
and according to Dr Thompson
was frightened to death.

400
00:37:50,599 --> 00:37:52,159
Frightened to death?

401
00:37:52,279 --> 00:37:55,599
- That's what he said. Fear.
- Of what?

402
00:37:55,719 --> 00:37:58,719
Damned if I know, Doc.
It's the strangest thing I ever heard of.

403
00:38:00,639 --> 00:38:02,399
Fear.

404
00:38:02,559 --> 00:38:06,159
There's been talk that Rose Kelvin
and Tommy Fisher disappeared, too.

405
00:38:06,279 --> 00:38:08,999
They went to the movies last night,
and nobody's seen them since.

406
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:12,679
That makes five people who've disappeared
in the last 48 hours.

407
00:38:12,799 --> 00:38:14,279
I think it's Bob.

408
00:38:14,399 --> 00:38:17,279
I don't believe in this
superstitious nonsense.

409
00:38:17,399 --> 00:38:21,199
- Yeah. Maybe you're right.
- Sure.

410
00:38:21,319 --> 00:38:24,759
Remember two years ago
when Bob took my little Ann into the woods?

411
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:27,359
It was a miracle we found them in time.

412
00:38:27,879 --> 00:38:29,839
Yeah, well, I say it's him.

413
00:38:29,959 --> 00:38:32,439
He's the one causing
all the trouble around here.

414
00:38:32,599 --> 00:38:35,079
God only knows
what he did to poor Emily.

415
00:38:35,199 --> 00:38:38,519
All I know is the air in Dunwich
is getting awful thick.

416
00:38:38,639 --> 00:38:43,119
Soon as I can find somebody to buy
my shop and my house, I'm vamoosing.

417
00:38:43,239 --> 00:38:44,959
You can bet your ass.

418
00:38:45,079 --> 00:38:46,759
- (Mrs Robbins sobbing)
- Calm down, dear.

419
00:38:46,879 --> 00:38:49,199
Take it easy. Calm down.

420
00:38:49,319 --> 00:38:52,759
My baby.
My poor baby.

421
00:38:52,879 --> 00:38:55,519
You'd... You'd...

422
00:38:55,639 --> 00:38:58,239
You'd better take John-John out.

423
00:38:58,359 --> 00:38:59,839
Yes, of course.

424
00:38:59,959 --> 00:39:02,279
John-John, come on, let's go outside.

425
00:39:02,399 --> 00:39:04,959
We'll take a walk.
You have to be strong now.

426
00:39:05,079 --> 00:39:07,439
You have to find the courage
to face life, John-John.

427
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:11,039
You have to be a man now.
You know what I mean? Hmm?

428
00:39:43,719 --> 00:39:45,599
(Gasping)

429
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:49,639
(Door squeaking)

430
00:39:49,759 --> 00:39:51,679
- (Rumbling)
- (Gasps)

431
00:39:52,319 --> 00:39:54,599
(Sobbing)

432
00:39:56,919 --> 00:39:58,679
(Whimpering)

433
00:40:17,559 --> 00:40:18,959
I'm hungry.

434
00:40:19,079 --> 00:40:22,879
Good. There's a lollipop
in the glove box.

435
00:40:25,639 --> 00:40:27,399
Look, I'm not joking.
I'm starved.

436
00:40:27,559 --> 00:40:32,159
Look, you're the one that got me out here
in the armpit of the world, chasing your...

437
00:40:32,279 --> 00:40:34,079
galloping cadavers.

438
00:40:35,439 --> 00:40:38,399
Come on. Let's go have
a snack some place, huh?

439
00:40:39,039 --> 00:40:40,239
OK.

440
00:40:42,999 --> 00:40:45,319
You, uh, wanna give up?

441
00:40:45,439 --> 00:40:49,599
Look, why don't you get in the car
and we'll go and check out the local cuisine.

442
00:40:52,719 --> 00:40:55,799
(Sighs) Don't be upset.

443
00:40:55,919 --> 00:40:59,079
Upset? Who's upset?

444
00:40:59,199 --> 00:41:01,879
According to your theory,
we have less than 48 hours

445
00:41:01,999 --> 00:41:04,199
before this, uh, All Saints' Day.

446
00:41:04,999 --> 00:41:06,959
Oh, please, not now.
Do you mind?

447
00:41:07,079 --> 00:41:08,159
Come on.

448
00:41:08,279 --> 00:41:11,919
Let's go check out
the, uh, local cuisine, huh?

449
00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:08,959
(Sighs)

450
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:19,639
(Growling)

451
00:42:19,759 --> 00:42:23,199
- (Screaming)
- (Squashing)

452
00:42:26,759 --> 00:42:29,639
(Screaming continues)

453
00:42:31,879 --> 00:42:34,039
(Wind howling)

454
00:42:51,639 --> 00:42:54,759
(Animal cackling)

455
00:43:15,559 --> 00:43:17,879
(Squeaking)

456
00:43:29,959 --> 00:43:32,359
(Low growling)

457
00:43:39,879 --> 00:43:41,079
(Meaning)

458
00:43:54,959 --> 00:43:56,759
(Meaning continues)

459
00:44:23,399 --> 00:44:25,519
(Breathing heavily)

460
00:44:33,519 --> 00:44:35,679
(John-John whimpering)

461
00:44:45,079 --> 00:44:47,319
(Meaning)

462
00:44:56,239 --> 00:44:58,119
(Owl hoots in distance)

463
00:45:01,679 --> 00:45:03,239
(Whimpering)

464
00:45:05,839 --> 00:45:07,599
Mommy!

465
00:45:09,799 --> 00:45:11,679
Daddy! Mommy! Daddy!

466
00:45:12,359 --> 00:45:15,199
Mommy! Mommy!
What's the matter, honey?

467
00:45:15,319 --> 00:45:18,079
Emily's back.
I saw her looking in the window.

468
00:45:18,199 --> 00:45:20,359
She wanted to catch me. (Sobbing)

469
00:45:20,519 --> 00:45:24,399
Emily went away forever, John-John.
She's in heaven.

470
00:45:24,559 --> 00:45:28,959
I saw her, I swear.
I saw her. I really did.

471
00:45:29,079 --> 00:45:30,799
We'd better call the doctor.

472
00:45:31,639 --> 00:45:34,639
I'm all right.
I don't need a doctor.

473
00:45:34,759 --> 00:45:36,879
I don't want a doctor!
I saw her!

474
00:45:36,999 --> 00:45:39,839
You've had a big day.
You're upset.

475
00:45:39,959 --> 00:45:43,959
Hmm. We all are.
Off you go now. Go to bed.

476
00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:46,399
I don't wanna go, Mommy.
I'm scared.

477
00:45:46,559 --> 00:45:49,959
- Emily's gonna catch me. I know it.
- Oh!

478
00:46:28,919 --> 00:46:30,839
(Clattering)

479
00:46:34,399 --> 00:46:37,039
(Clattering continues)

480
00:46:49,959 --> 00:46:52,439
(Phone rings)

481
00:46:54,879 --> 00:46:57,079
(Sighs)

482
00:47:10,679 --> 00:47:13,439
- Hello?
- It's me, Sandra.

483
00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:15,519
You have to come right away.

484
00:47:15,639 --> 00:47:19,079
No, there's no time to explain.
You wouldn't believe me anyway.

485
00:47:19,199 --> 00:47:22,439
Just come, please.
I'm having a nervous breakdown.

486
00:47:22,599 --> 00:47:26,599
Yes, UK, Sandra. Just calm down
and control yourself. What is it?

487
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:28,399
- (Moaning)
- There are only two possibilities.

488
00:47:28,559 --> 00:47:29,959
Either I'm going out of my mind,

489
00:47:30,079 --> 00:47:32,359
or something very,
very strange is happening.

490
00:47:32,519 --> 00:47:35,879
Look, take it easy.
I'll be there in ten minutes, honey.

491
00:47:35,999 --> 00:47:37,639
Bye.

492
00:47:50,919 --> 00:47:53,879
(Breathing heavily)

493
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:04,919
(Owl hoots in distance)

494
00:48:10,559 --> 00:48:12,959
(Sighs)

495
00:48:15,919 --> 00:48:18,679
(Groans)

496
00:48:37,839 --> 00:48:38,999
(Doorbell rings)

497
00:48:46,559 --> 00:48:49,279
- Gerry, is that you?
- Yeah, it's me.

498
00:48:54,199 --> 00:48:58,039
Come in.

499
00:49:10,079 --> 00:49:12,039
What do you need that for?

500
00:49:13,159 --> 00:49:15,879
I don't know.
Maybe a crucifix would be better.

501
00:49:15,999 --> 00:49:19,519
A crucifix? What the hell
are you talking about?

502
00:49:21,439 --> 00:49:23,119
(Sighs)

503
00:49:23,239 --> 00:49:25,559
Tell me the truth.

504
00:49:25,679 --> 00:49:29,559
- Do you consider me a basket case?
- No. Not at all. Why?

505
00:49:29,679 --> 00:49:31,799
You're nurturing a pet neurosis.
That's all.

506
00:49:31,919 --> 00:49:35,599
Like about 70%% of the female population
of this country.

507
00:49:35,719 --> 00:49:39,079
80, according to you,
I'm not stark raving mad?

508
00:49:39,199 --> 00:49:40,519
At least not yet.

509
00:49:40,639 --> 00:49:42,279
Don't be silly, of course not.

510
00:49:42,399 --> 00:49:44,439
Sometimes you may drink
a little more than you should,

511
00:49:44,599 --> 00:49:47,359
but that's no reason to be taken away
and put into a loony house.

512
00:49:47,519 --> 00:49:50,839
No. No, I'd rather not right now,
and you really shouldn't either.

513
00:49:52,359 --> 00:49:55,439
All right.
You'd better see for yourself.

514
00:49:55,599 --> 00:49:57,319
It's in the kitchen.

515
00:49:57,439 --> 00:49:59,839
- The kitchen?
- Uh-huh.

516
00:49:59,959 --> 00:50:01,919
(Exhales)

517
00:50:10,639 --> 00:50:12,599
(Gasps) Oh, Christ.

518
00:50:36,039 --> 00:50:38,359
Was I just imagining things?

519
00:50:38,999 --> 00:50:40,519
No, it can't be. It's not...

520
00:50:40,639 --> 00:50:43,239
Uh-huh. It's her.
Mrs Holden.

521
00:50:43,359 --> 00:50:46,039
This morning she was inside
a coffin at the funeral home,

522
00:50:46,159 --> 00:50:47,999
and now she's here in my kitchen.

523
00:50:48,119 --> 00:50:49,919
How? How did she get here?

524
00:50:50,039 --> 00:50:54,399
I don't know. I heard a noise. I came to look,
and there she was on my floor.

525
00:50:54,559 --> 00:50:58,279
I called you right after.
I thought I was losing my mind.

526
00:50:58,399 --> 00:51:02,319
OK. Let's use our heads
and not panic. Calm down.

527
00:51:02,439 --> 00:51:05,519
We've got to find out
how she got here, all right?

528
00:51:05,639 --> 00:51:09,279
I couldn't give a damn how she got here!
I just want her gone!

529
00:51:09,399 --> 00:51:12,639
Look, let's get out of here.
I can't take the sight of her.

530
00:51:12,759 --> 00:51:14,719
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

531
00:51:20,679 --> 00:51:24,279
(Sighs) At this point, a good, stiff drink
is the only medicine.

532
00:51:25,879 --> 00:51:27,719
What are you gonna do?

533
00:51:29,159 --> 00:51:31,079
Well, I don't believe
in the Twilight Zone,

534
00:51:31,199 --> 00:51:33,199
so I guess I'll call the sheriff
on this matter.

535
00:51:33,319 --> 00:51:36,399
-And what will you tell him?
- Well, exactly what you told me.

536
00:51:36,559 --> 00:51:39,159
That you heard this noise,
that you came running and saw her there.

537
00:51:39,279 --> 00:51:41,639
- And the rest is up to them.
- (Moaning)

538
00:51:41,759 --> 00:51:43,119
(Gasps)

539
00:51:43,239 --> 00:51:45,159
(Creaking)

540
00:51:45,279 --> 00:51:46,719
(Gerry) What was that?

541
00:51:46,839 --> 00:51:50,039
- (Low growling)
- (Breathing sharply)

542
00:52:08,879 --> 00:52:10,839
(Door creaking)

543
00:52:10,959 --> 00:52:13,199
(Gerry) It's half-closed.
We left it wide open.

544
00:52:29,999 --> 00:52:31,759
What the...

545
00:52:33,639 --> 00:52:35,919
Huh. Someone took her away.

546
00:52:36,039 --> 00:52:37,639
Or maybe she just left.

547
00:52:37,759 --> 00:52:41,439
Don't be ridiculous. Bodies don't get up
and walk away by themselves.

548
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:43,639
- (Clattering)
- (Gasps)

549
00:52:44,759 --> 00:52:47,599
She's still here!
She's still in the house!

550
00:52:48,399 --> 00:52:49,959
- (Screams) She's in here!
- Sandra.

551
00:52:50,079 --> 00:52:52,359
- I know she's in the house.
- Sandra, get a hold of yourself.

552
00:52:52,519 --> 00:52:54,759
- I don't want to see her anymore!
- Sandra, this is no way to...

553
00:52:54,879 --> 00:52:56,999
- Gerry, get her out! Please!
- For God's sakes, calm down!

554
00:52:57,119 --> 00:52:58,999
- Tell her to go!
- Yes. Yes.

555
00:52:59,119 --> 00:53:01,959
She's in here! Do you hear her?
Gerry, she's in here!

556
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:04,239
- I can't take it anymore!
- OK, Sandra.

557
00:53:04,359 --> 00:53:06,039
- (Clattering stops)
- Sandra, calm down.

558
00:53:06,159 --> 00:53:07,639
- Calm down. Come on.
- You hear?

559
00:53:07,759 --> 00:53:10,079
Calm down. Don't let your imagination
run away with you.

560
00:53:10,199 --> 00:53:12,719
I don't know what the hell
is going on in here either, Sandra.

561
00:53:12,839 --> 00:53:15,159
So we're gonna take it step by step

562
00:53:15,279 --> 00:53:17,759
and search every room in the house,
all right?

563
00:53:17,879 --> 00:53:21,239
And we'll find the reason. All right, Sandra?
Now you're gonna follow me.

564
00:53:21,359 --> 00:53:24,719
Follow me now.
Come on now. That's it.

565
00:53:25,879 --> 00:53:27,279
-All right?
-All right.

566
00:53:27,399 --> 00:53:29,799
- OK.
- I'll do whatever you say.

567
00:53:47,519 --> 00:53:56,959
(Light switch clicks)

568
00:54:02,559 --> 00:54:04,759
- (Door opens)
- (Light switch clicks)

569
00:54:09,879 --> 00:54:11,799
(Sighs)

570
00:54:12,999 --> 00:54:15,639
I don't think I'll manage
to sleep here tonight.

571
00:54:15,759 --> 00:54:18,159
Well, if you want to stay at my studio
or the house, you're always welcome.

572
00:54:18,279 --> 00:54:21,239
- (Gasps)
- (Roaring)

573
00:54:22,919 --> 00:54:24,719
- (Growling)
- (Sandra screams)

574
00:54:28,439 --> 00:54:30,439
(Breathing sharply)

575
00:54:34,839 --> 00:54:36,279
(Sandra) Wh...

576
00:54:36,399 --> 00:54:37,799
(Exclaims)

577
00:54:37,919 --> 00:54:40,039
(Gasping)

578
00:54:41,199 --> 00:54:43,359
(Sandra moaning)

579
00:54:44,799 --> 00:54:46,439
Good God, it's blood!

580
00:54:47,239 --> 00:54:49,039
Blood! Oh!

581
00:54:49,159 --> 00:54:50,999
Oh!

582
00:55:00,639 --> 00:55:02,319
(Wind howling)

583
00:55:02,439 --> 00:55:04,639
- (Priest) Dunwich?
- (Bell) Yeah.

584
00:55:04,759 --> 00:55:06,639
-Yes, yes, I know it.
- (Church bells ringing)

585
00:55:06,759 --> 00:55:10,239
- Odd that you're looking for Dunwich.
- Yeah, as a matter of fact, uh...

586
00:55:10,359 --> 00:55:12,719
Yes, that's the town
where Father Thomas...

587
00:55:12,839 --> 00:55:16,039
Terrible. Oh, terrible!

588
00:55:16,919 --> 00:55:21,079
You know that Dunwich was built
on the ruins of the original Salem,

589
00:55:21,199 --> 00:55:25,119
the village of witches
and heresy... and evil.

590
00:55:25,239 --> 00:55:27,239
Yes, but, uh, can you tell us
how to get there?

591
00:55:28,039 --> 00:55:32,639
It's not easy. You'll have to go back,
towards the highway.

592
00:55:32,759 --> 00:55:36,319
And as you approach it,
there's a road going left.

593
00:55:36,439 --> 00:55:39,039
- Mm-hmm.
- Blocked by a landslide.

594
00:55:39,159 --> 00:55:41,919
- That will take you to Dunwich.
- Thanks a lot.

595
00:55:42,039 --> 00:55:44,159
Uh, just out of curiosity...

596
00:55:45,039 --> 00:55:48,159
(Chuckles nervously)
Why are you folks going down there?

597
00:55:48,279 --> 00:55:50,879
- (Mary) Erm...
- Well, we're just looking up a friend.

598
00:55:50,999 --> 00:55:53,039
Oh, I see.

599
00:55:57,119 --> 00:55:59,039
Thanks again.

600
00:56:14,999 --> 00:56:17,039
(Sighs)

601
00:56:17,159 --> 00:56:18,439
The Lord help us.

602
00:56:19,879 --> 00:56:21,679
(Groans)

603
00:56:37,039 --> 00:56:39,359
(Groans, sighs)

604
00:56:44,679 --> 00:56:46,559
Hey, Bob.

605
00:56:48,879 --> 00:56:50,679
Hi,Ann.

606
00:56:54,839 --> 00:56:56,879
What are you doing
in the back seat of my dad's car?

607
00:56:56,999 --> 00:56:58,999
I didn't know where to sleep.

608
00:56:59,119 --> 00:57:01,439
- You won't tell on me, will you?
- No, of course not.

609
00:57:01,599 --> 00:57:04,519
Only, you get some awful weird ideas.
Come on. Smoke a little joint with me.

610
00:57:04,639 --> 00:57:06,279
Only then you'd better split, OK?

611
00:57:06,399 --> 00:57:07,759
- (Ross) Ann!
- (Gasps) It's him!

612
00:57:07,879 --> 00:57:09,919
- Go on! Get out of here!
- What are you doing?

613
00:57:10,039 --> 00:57:12,879
- Nothing, Dad. We were just...
- Get in the house! Get...!

614
00:57:13,639 --> 00:57:17,799
- I... I can explain everything, Mr Ross!
- Shut up, you bastard!

615
00:57:18,519 --> 00:57:20,039
(Whirring)

616
00:57:20,159 --> 00:57:21,999
(Screams)

617
00:57:22,119 --> 00:57:24,999
What were you trying to do
to my daughter? Huh?

618
00:57:27,199 --> 00:57:28,919
Please let me explain, Mr Ross.

619
00:57:29,039 --> 00:57:31,239
I was only looking for a place to sleep.

620
00:57:31,359 --> 00:57:33,239
I swear!

621
00:57:35,919 --> 00:57:38,559
- Pervert! Murderer!
- No! No.

622
00:57:39,439 --> 00:57:41,039
No.

623
00:57:42,639 --> 00:57:44,919
Oh!

624
00:57:47,719 --> 00:57:48,959
(Grunting)

625
00:57:53,839 --> 00:57:55,919
(Grunting continues)

626
00:57:56,039 --> 00:57:57,799
No! No!

627
00:58:00,879 --> 00:58:03,399
(Grunting)

628
00:58:11,279 --> 00:58:13,279
(Panting)

629
00:58:36,319 --> 00:58:38,999
(Screaming)

630
00:59:12,319 --> 00:59:13,999
(Doorbell rings)

631
00:59:27,079 --> 00:59:29,959
I guess there's nobody in.
That's strange.

632
00:59:31,079 --> 00:59:32,679
What do you plan on doing?

633
00:59:32,799 --> 00:59:34,919
I have a feeling
this is where the answer is.

634
00:59:35,039 --> 00:59:37,599
We've got to find the undertaker
or someone from the funeral parlour.

635
00:59:37,719 --> 00:59:39,679
Maybe they've gone to the cemetery.

636
00:59:39,799 --> 00:59:41,599
You go.
I'll wait in your office.

637
00:59:41,719 --> 00:59:44,399
I don't think I could take
a cemetery right now.

638
00:59:44,559 --> 00:59:46,639
Fair enough.

639
01:00:16,839 --> 01:00:21,519
(Bell) "Dweller of the twilight void."
That's heavy. Well?

640
01:00:21,639 --> 01:00:24,519
Yes. That's it.

641
01:00:25,159 --> 01:00:28,999
That's the very same tombstone
that I saw in my trance.

642
01:00:30,119 --> 01:00:31,679
Great.

643
01:00:31,799 --> 01:00:35,239
Welcome to the city of the dead.
Now what do we do?

644
01:00:35,359 --> 01:00:39,239
We must find the priest's grave
and uncover him.

645
01:00:39,359 --> 01:00:42,799
There isn't much time left.
All Saints' Day begins at midnight.

646
01:00:42,919 --> 01:00:44,359
Well, where do we start?

647
01:00:47,159 --> 01:00:49,839
OK. Well, it's gotta be
one of these.

648
01:00:49,959 --> 01:00:53,199
You know, it's a good thing
he didn't hang himself in Arlington.

649
01:01:33,039 --> 01:01:35,439
- (Bell) Hey!
- Yes?

650
01:01:36,239 --> 01:01:39,199
Excuse me. Uh, I wonder
if you could give us some information.

651
01:01:39,319 --> 01:01:40,679
Sure.

652
01:01:40,799 --> 01:01:44,279
Well, we're, uh...
we're looking for a tombstone of a...

653
01:01:44,399 --> 01:01:46,719
of a... of a priest
who hanged himself.

654
01:01:47,639 --> 01:01:48,719
Father Thomas?

655
01:01:53,319 --> 01:01:54,999
We don't know his name.

656
01:01:56,519 --> 01:01:58,839
Well, why are you looking
for his burial site?

657
01:01:58,959 --> 01:02:00,799
It's, uh...

658
01:02:00,919 --> 01:02:04,519
It's a long story,
one you might not want to believe.

659
01:02:05,199 --> 01:02:09,359
Try me. I'm just about ready
to believe anything at this point.

660
01:02:09,519 --> 01:02:11,679
And that's the whole story.

661
01:02:12,639 --> 01:02:15,919
My God in heaven.
The living dead.

662
01:02:16,039 --> 01:02:18,359
And that's why you're here
in Dunwich?

663
01:02:18,519 --> 01:02:21,399
(Gerry) What do you want to do?
What are you hoping to accomplish?

664
01:02:21,559 --> 01:02:24,359
The death of Father Thomas

665
01:02:24,519 --> 01:02:27,359
gave birth to some... some evil...

666
01:02:27,519 --> 01:02:28,639
(Wood creaking)

667
01:02:29,679 --> 01:02:31,519
(Sandra gasps)

669
01:02:33,759 --> 01:02:36,879

- (All grunting)

670
01:02:38,039 --> 01:02:40,279
(Screaming)

671

(Screaming continues)

(Gasping, screaming)

677
01:03:47,079 --> 01:03:49,519
(Phone rings)

678
01:04:05,679 --> 01:04:07,679
Yeah? Who's speaking?

679
01:04:17,559 --> 01:04:20,319
All right, John-John.
Now listen to me.

680
01:04:20,439 --> 01:04:23,199
You take it easy, and you stay right there,
and don't move.

681
01:04:23,319 --> 01:04:25,799
And I'll be right over.

682
01:04:25,919 --> 01:04:27,959
What happened?

683
01:04:28,079 --> 01:04:31,559
That was Emily's little brother,
John-John.

684
01:04:31,679 --> 01:04:34,639
He just told me that Emily
killed her parents.

685
01:04:38,279 --> 01:04:41,239
Emily died two days ago.

686
01:04:42,319 --> 01:04:44,639
(Faint whimpering)

687
01:05:08,319 --> 01:05:10,639
(Wind howling)

688
01:05:21,639 --> 01:05:23,919
Gerry! Gerry!

689
01:05:24,039 --> 01:05:26,199
- I'm scared, Gerry! I'm scared!
- (Gerry) Easy now.

690
01:05:26,319 --> 01:05:28,839
It's all over.
Everything's going to be all right.

691
01:05:28,959 --> 01:05:32,319
- Would you girls take care of him, please?
- (Sandra) Sure. Come on.

692
01:05:35,839 --> 01:05:36,879
- My car?
- Yeah.

693
01:05:36,999 --> 01:05:38,679
OK.

694
01:05:38,799 --> 01:05:40,799
In you get.

695
01:05:41,599 --> 01:05:44,439
God. God almighty.

696
01:05:44,599 --> 01:05:46,439
Totally butchered.

697
01:05:46,599 --> 01:05:48,919
Literally ripped to shreds,
those two.

698
01:05:50,959 --> 01:05:53,119
You're sure it was Emily?

699
01:05:53,239 --> 01:05:55,919
Yeah, but she was all different.

700
01:05:56,039 --> 01:06:00,599
Emily was like...
She was like... She was dead.

701
01:06:00,719 --> 01:06:02,759
And she was eating
Mommy and Daddy.

702
01:06:02,879 --> 01:06:05,839
Poor kid.
You poor darling.

703
01:06:05,959 --> 01:06:07,719
Gerry. Gerry, listen.

704
01:06:07,839 --> 01:06:09,439
We got to go to the funeral parlour.

705
01:06:09,599 --> 01:06:12,399
And then we got to look for that...
that grave of the priest.

706
01:06:12,559 --> 01:06:14,759
-All right.
-Well?

707
01:06:16,039 --> 01:06:18,359
- The kid all right?
- Scared to death.

708
01:06:22,319 --> 01:06:24,719
John-John, it's all right.

709
01:06:24,839 --> 01:06:26,799
- It's gonna be all right.
- (Engine starts)

710
01:06:26,919 --> 01:06:28,559
It's all over now.

711
01:07:00,759 --> 01:07:02,159
Now listen, Sandra.

712
01:07:02,279 --> 01:07:05,199
Go to the studio with John-John, stay there,
and don't let him out of your sight.

713
01:07:05,319 --> 01:07:06,679
- Yeah, sure.
- Not for any reason.

714
01:07:06,799 --> 01:07:08,239
Listen, Gerry,
we'd better get a move on.

715
01:07:08,359 --> 01:07:10,839
We only have a couple hours
before All Saints' Day.

716
01:07:10,959 --> 01:07:12,879
- God knows what else could happen.

No! No!

Go away!

736
01:10:39,119 --> 01:10:41,199
No! Emily!

737
01:10:41,319 --> 01:10:43,599
. No!
(-Panting)

- (Meaning stops)

739

Listen, there's a police car around
the corner. Mary's there, too.

740
01:10:49,079 --> 01:10:51,679
- You go straight to it. Go!

Yeah, I'm in car two with Sheriff Russell.
We're on Main Street.

745
01:11:21,759 --> 01:11:24,199
(Bell) We got to go look
for Father Thomas's grave.

746

You want some of my men?

747
01:11:25,759 --> 01:11:28,359
No, I think it'd be better
if you, uh, took care of the kid.

748
01:11:28,519 --> 01:11:31,679
- All right. I'll take care of the kid.
- Do what the sheriff tells you, OK?

749
01:11:31,799 --> 01:11:33,999
- Mary?
- Coming.
