Directed by

22
00:02:02,109 --> 00:02:04,600
A handsome youth
in the morning,

23
00:02:05,109 --> 00:02:09,299
once lured by that merciless wind,
is by dusk a heap of bones.

24
00:02:10,049 --> 00:02:13,069
ln the end, all must die.

25
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:18,840
Countless people have sinned
on their way towards death.

26
00:02:19,729 --> 00:02:23,919
Could the law
even begin to punish them all?

27
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:27,359
Some may slip
through the law's net,

28
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:31,239
but they cannot elude
their own consciences.

29
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:34,530
Religion dreams of a world
where sinners

30
00:02:35,079 --> 00:02:38,979
are punished after death
for sins unpunished during Iife.

31
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:42,560
That world is Hell.

32
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:57,090
This is a tale of things...

33
00:02:58,729 --> 00:03:06,669
not of this world.

34
00:03:10,139 --> 00:03:15,789
A tale of the River Sanzu...

35
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:21,350
the eternal limbo of dead children.

36
00:03:46,549 --> 00:03:49,919
CONCEPTS OF HELL

37
00:03:50,549 --> 00:03:55,819
Buddhism is not alone
in positing the existence of hell.

38
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,590
Zoroastrianism, Christianity,
and Islam, among others,

39
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:02,470
all share similar beliefs.

40
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:06,530
ln India, the idea arose together
with that of reincarnation

41
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,539
even before Buddhism appeared

42
00:04:10,039 --> 00:04:14,169
and evolved into the concept
l just mentioned.

43
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:17,970
The Sanskrit word
for hell, ''naraha,''

44
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:20,910
comes from the word
for ''abominable'' or ''excruciating.''

45
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:26,910
The Japanese adapted
this word as narahu.

46
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,210
That guy from last night is dead.

47
00:04:41,229 --> 00:04:42,809
Really? He's dead?

48
00:04:45,369 --> 00:04:47,179
So what if he is?

49
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:49,679
Tamura!

50
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:54,330
By the way, congratulations.
You and Yukiko are finally engaged.

51
00:04:58,119 --> 00:05:00,960
l heard something interesting

52
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:04,679
about your future father-in-law,
Professor Yajima.

53
00:05:05,289 --> 00:05:09,919
ln Japan, the most common
conception is that of the ''Eight Hells''

54
00:05:10,729 --> 00:05:13,950
found in Buddhist sutras.

55
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:18,809
ln fact, the number of sutras
on the subject is enormous.

56
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:25,119
People call him a saint, but scratch
the surface and you'll find a dark past.

57
00:05:25,879 --> 00:05:28,369
There's a sin
he wants to atone for.

58
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:33,919
lt was during the war,
in Malaya.

59
00:05:40,789 --> 00:05:43,919
Just who is this Tamura?

60
00:05:44,729 --> 00:05:46,570
How can he be so awful?

61
00:05:46,999 --> 00:05:49,580
Can't I get away
from him somehow?

62
00:05:50,439 --> 00:05:54,280
Last night would have been
the happiest night of my life

63
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:56,929
but for that damned accident.

64
00:06:53,429 --> 00:06:54,739
Hello.

65
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:02,020
Professor and Mrs. Yajima,
thank you very much.

66
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:05,179
You'll see:
l'll make Yukiko happy.

67
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:07,429
Take good care of her, Shimizu.

68
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:10,350
Yes, sir.

69
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:13,910
Yukiko, l'm so happy.

70
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:16,330
Thank you, Mother.

71
00:07:21,229 --> 00:07:23,450
Mr. Shimizu...

72
00:07:23,929 --> 00:07:26,799
Yukiko's our only child,
and she's a bit spoiled.

73
00:07:27,369 --> 00:07:29,919
But with you
we can rest easy.

74
00:07:30,439 --> 00:07:32,689
Please look after her.

75
00:07:33,869 --> 00:07:37,910
Study hard, and be a scholar
in my husband's footsteps.

76
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:39,910
l will.

77
00:07:40,179 --> 00:07:41,820
Congratulations.

78
00:07:42,549 --> 00:07:43,979
Tamura!

79
00:07:46,189 --> 00:07:48,299
Surprised to see me?

80
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:53,330
l'd have rung the bell, but l was furious
when you turned me away last time.

81
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,619
Anyway, congratulations.

82
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:04,489
We should have
a drink to celebrate.

83
00:08:05,669 --> 00:08:10,559
But uninvited guests shouldn't
stay too long, so l'll be going.

84
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:15,539
l came to return this.

85
00:08:27,529 --> 00:08:29,700
Shimizu, l'll give you a ride.

86
00:08:31,659 --> 00:08:34,680
Mrs. Yajima,
your clock's stopped.

87
00:08:35,739 --> 00:08:39,340
They say that's a bad omen.

88
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:42,290
Good night.

89
00:08:51,119 --> 00:08:52,930
Don't be a fool.
Take it.

90
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:55,540
You're behind
on rent and tuition.

91
00:08:57,489 --> 00:08:59,570
l like you, man.

92
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,479
l know everything.

93
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:11,850
You've been sleeping
with Yukiko.

94
00:09:16,779 --> 00:09:18,830
l'll bet she's pregnant.

95
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:26,269
Could you turn there?

96
00:09:26,989 --> 00:09:30,180
- It's a bad road.
- l want to make a stop.

97
00:09:44,170 --> 00:09:45,749
Look out!

98
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:02,330
Bastard! You hit me!

99
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:18,540
Hey! Goddamn you!

100
00:10:19,109 --> 00:10:23,830
l'm Tiger Kyoichi
of the Gondo gang!

101
00:10:26,909 --> 00:10:28,519
Kyoichi!

102
00:10:30,879 --> 00:10:33,629
Kyoichi! Are you all right?
Get up!

103
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:35,940
What happened?

104
00:10:37,259 --> 00:10:39,979
Tamura, stop the car!
You hit that guy!

105
00:10:40,529 --> 00:10:42,430
l'm not stopping.
Nobody saw us.

106
00:10:42,859 --> 00:10:44,820
That drunk jumped
in front of me.

107
00:10:45,259 --> 00:10:47,979
That doesn't matter.
We hit him!

108
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:50,729
What?

109
00:10:51,070 --> 00:10:53,970
You made me take this road.

110
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:55,999
lt wasn't my fault.

111
00:11:02,979 --> 00:11:05,320
That man could be dead.

112
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:09,790
lf he is
Tamura and l are murderers.

113
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,659
ls something wrong?

114
00:11:22,029 --> 00:11:23,729
No, it's nothing.

115
00:11:24,239 --> 00:11:25,879
l just couldn't sleep last night.

116
00:11:26,269 --> 00:11:27,850
Don't overdo it.

117
00:11:28,239 --> 00:11:30,960
Stop by tonight.
Yukiko's expecting you.

118
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:49,440
CONCEPTS OF HELL

119
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:27,790
Kyoichi!

120
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:29,529
Mother.

121
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:40,950
You sure you didn't see
who did it?

122
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:42,889
Shut up!

123
00:12:43,249 --> 00:12:44,769
l said l didn't know!

124
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:46,840
Damn it!

125
00:12:48,249 --> 00:12:49,920
When l find who did this -

126
00:12:51,989 --> 00:12:55,389
''At 9 p.m., in Kamiuma
in Setagaya Ward,

127
00:12:56,029 --> 00:12:59,159
Kioichi Shiga, 34,
a leader of the Gondo gang,

128
00:12:59,769 --> 00:13:04,080
was struck by a passing vehicle
while inebriated

129
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:07,909
and died of a brain hemorrhage
at a nearby hospital.

130
00:13:09,009 --> 00:13:11,639
There were no witnesses.
The driver remains unknown.''

131
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:16,850
So you want to turn me in
for manslaughter?

132
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:19,950
We're the ones who killed him.

133
00:13:20,649 --> 00:13:22,379
We caused it.

134
00:13:23,090 --> 00:13:24,639
Let's go together.

135
00:13:25,019 --> 00:13:26,129
Please.

136
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:28,479
That might ease your conscience,
but l'm not interested.

137
00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:30,389
lt'd be stupid.

138
00:13:30,759 --> 00:13:33,340
He was drunk.
He ran into the road.

139
00:13:33,869 --> 00:13:37,440
lt was basically suicide.
Besides, he was just some yakuza scum.

140
00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:42,290
He's not worth
the best years of our lives.

141
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:46,609
Leaving so soon?

142
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:53,050
l turned your luck around.
If l go down, you go with me.

143
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:06,399
lN MEMORIAM
THE GONDO SYNDICATE

144
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:14,159
The gang paid for the funeral,

145
00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:17,570
but how will we get by now?

146
00:14:19,609 --> 00:14:25,239
Hey, Mom, you must've seen
the car that hit him.

147
00:14:28,149 --> 00:14:29,879
You were out there.

148
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:31,940
No, l didn't.

149
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:35,619
But Yoko...

150
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:38,330
what would you do
if you knew who did it?

151
00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:40,820
l'd find the guy
and kill him.

152
00:14:41,869 --> 00:14:43,710
Look what he's done to us.

153
00:14:44,139 --> 00:14:46,450
l didn't tell the police,

154
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:48,960
but l saw the car.

155
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:56,519
Ten years ago...

156
00:14:57,749 --> 00:15:00,499
a truck killed my husband.

157
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:03,850
The driver
didn't even go to prison,

158
00:15:04,359 --> 00:15:06,609
while l lost my man.

159
00:15:07,290 --> 00:15:09,810
Telling the cops
won't do a damn thing.

160
00:15:10,330 --> 00:15:13,609
Yoko, you and l
can avenge Kyoichi.

161
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:16,989
We can kill the guys who did it
and not get caught.

162
00:15:18,739 --> 00:15:20,080
We must.

163
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:41,050
Yukiko.

164
00:15:47,899 --> 00:15:49,769
You really kept me waiting.

165
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:52,729
l just had to see you today.

166
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:55,340
Shiro...

167
00:15:56,509 --> 00:15:57,999
l'm...

168
00:15:59,379 --> 00:16:00,989
ls something wrong?

169
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:06,609
Yukiko, l...

170
00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:10,420
killed a man.

171
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:12,249
Listen.

172
00:16:12,629 --> 00:16:14,769
There were two of them.

173
00:16:15,229 --> 00:16:18,889
We'll trace the license number.

174
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:23,190
We'll kill them
no matter how long ii takes.

175
00:16:23,769 --> 00:16:25,820
Understood?
l thought so.

176
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:35,440
Let's talk to my father.

177
00:16:36,119 --> 00:16:38,080
He'll surely think of something.

178
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,330
l can't stay here.

179
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,149
Something's chasing me.

180
00:16:42,519 --> 00:16:45,830
Shiro, please stay calm.

181
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:49,519
There aren't any taxis.

182
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,129
Taxis?

183
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:54,980
Let's walk to the station.

184
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,959
l don't feel like taking a taxi.

185
00:16:58,469 --> 00:17:00,639
The faster l get there,
the better.

186
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:03,879
Please, forget the taxi.

187
00:17:04,379 --> 00:17:06,399
l'd really rather walk.

188
00:17:06,850 --> 00:17:08,959
You're acting like a child!

189
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:18,109
Get in.

190
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,169
Where to?

191
00:17:30,639 --> 00:17:32,159
The police station.

192
00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:34,560
Please drive slowly.

193
00:17:54,689 --> 00:17:55,800
Yukiko!

194
00:17:59,399 --> 00:18:01,070
Shiro...

195
00:18:01,929 --> 00:18:03,480
l don't want to die.

196
00:18:04,669 --> 00:18:06,280
l don't want to die.

197
00:18:06,669 --> 00:18:07,959
Yukiko!

198
00:18:31,659 --> 00:18:34,760
Shimizu, it'll be all right.

199
00:18:35,669 --> 00:18:37,250
Everything hinges on fate.

200
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,000
Professor...

201
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:43,669
if l hadn't insisted on a taxi -

202
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:47,379
l may as well
have killed her myself.

203
00:18:50,419 --> 00:18:51,909
Dear.

204
00:19:17,810 --> 00:19:19,119
Mrs. Yajima.

205
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:29,709
You don't belong here.

206
00:19:31,419 --> 00:19:33,260
Go away, please.

207
00:19:34,159 --> 00:19:35,649
Go away, please!

208
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:37,520
Mrs. Yajima!

209
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:42,119
Give Yukiko back to me.

210
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,379
Give her back!

211
00:19:47,669 --> 00:19:48,980
Fumi!

212
00:19:50,709 --> 00:19:52,730
Give back my daughter.

213
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:55,679
That's right: Suffer.

214
00:20:56,679 --> 00:21:01,070
You were about to let
your conscience sell me out.

215
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:05,379
Will you win, or will l?

216
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:07,290
Stop it!

217
00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:12,070
Don't get so worked up.

218
00:21:17,659 --> 00:21:19,030
Hey...

219
00:21:19,399 --> 00:21:21,149
have a drink with me.

220
00:21:21,570 --> 00:21:23,619
l've got the blues too.

221
00:21:24,699 --> 00:21:26,100
Let's dance.

222
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:42,490
l'm Yoko.
Who are you?

223
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:45,179
Listen...

224
00:21:45,959 --> 00:21:47,889
why don't we go
somewhere else?

225
00:21:50,199 --> 00:21:51,020
l'm going home.

226
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:52,169
No!

227
00:21:52,459 --> 00:21:57,260
HOTEL YOSHINO

228
00:22:19,659 --> 00:22:21,270
''Shiro Shimizu.''

229
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:24,850
lt's him.

230
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:29,730
He's the one who hilled Kyoichi.

231
00:22:37,109 --> 00:22:40,389
Can l see you again tonight?

232
00:22:41,850 --> 00:22:43,050
Sure.

233
00:22:43,379 --> 00:22:44,990
l'm glad.

234
00:22:54,330 --> 00:22:56,379
Be at the bar at 9:00, okay?

235
00:22:56,830 --> 00:22:59,990
Don't forget.
9:00 p.m.

236
00:23:06,969 --> 00:23:10,810
lt's him.
No mistake about it.

237
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:26,359
You've got the stuff,
don't you?

238
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,100
Yeah.

239
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:42,020
Kyoichi, it won't be long.

240
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,980
l'm going to settle the score.

241
00:23:45,439 --> 00:23:49,859
Once l finish them off
l'll come join you.

242
00:24:27,990 --> 00:24:30,949
''Mother's condition critical.
Come immediately. Father.''

243
00:24:43,899 --> 00:24:46,389
TENJOEN

244
00:25:03,889 --> 00:25:05,320
OLD AGE HOME

245
00:25:19,199 --> 00:25:26,409
The kindness...

246
00:25:28,050 --> 00:25:32,850
of my father...

247
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:39,280
and mother...

248
00:26:02,810 --> 00:26:04,419
You are?

249
00:26:04,919 --> 00:26:07,609
Oh, you're Shiro from Tokyo!

250
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:09,300
Yes.

251
00:26:16,530 --> 00:26:20,040
l'm Kinuko.
They took me in last year.

252
00:26:20,699 --> 00:26:21,429
l see.

253
00:26:21,699 --> 00:26:22,840
This way.

254
00:26:44,389 --> 00:26:45,730
Mother...

255
00:26:46,290 --> 00:26:47,369
it's Shiro.

256
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:54,709
Mother.

257
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,290
Mother...

258
00:27:00,469 --> 00:27:01,929
how's Father?

259
00:27:06,609 --> 00:27:08,189
Stop it, silly man!

260
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:17,570
You know
your son's pretty cute.

261
00:27:18,219 --> 00:27:19,949
Such nice eyes.

262
00:27:20,359 --> 00:27:22,530
l just might cheat on you.

263
00:27:22,990 --> 00:27:24,949
l want to go back to Tokyo!

264
00:27:25,399 --> 00:27:27,419
Cut the crap.

265
00:27:29,770 --> 00:27:33,639
lt's no surprise,
with me like this.

266
00:27:43,109 --> 00:27:43,980
Auntie.

267
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:51,520
You're Shiro, aren't you?

268
00:27:53,990 --> 00:27:57,530
l'm Sachiko.
l sent the telegram.

269
00:27:58,230 --> 00:28:00,340
How nice that he came!

270
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,230
Thank you.

271
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:12,669
Her father paints.
They moved in next door last year.

272
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:18,290
He's an old friend
of your father's.

273
00:28:19,750 --> 00:28:21,389
Next door?

274
00:28:22,550 --> 00:28:26,119
l may not make it to Oshoro.

275
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,060
Father.

276
00:28:38,699 --> 00:28:41,659
Or Takashima.

277
00:29:02,359 --> 00:29:04,109
Ah, Shiro, you're here.

278
00:29:04,530 --> 00:29:05,459
Father.

279
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:08,419
Your mother's a little better.

280
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:14,070
l'm having a painting of Hell
made for Jiganji Temple.

281
00:29:15,669 --> 00:29:18,219
This is Ensai Taniguchi.

282
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:22,550
He paints well,
but he drank himself to ruin

283
00:29:23,179 --> 00:29:24,879
and ended up here.

284
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:28,439
Father, aren't you taking
your walk this morning?

285
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:31,050
Morning.

286
00:29:31,359 --> 00:29:34,080
You're up early, Detective.

287
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:39,139
Almost done, eh?

288
00:29:41,929 --> 00:29:46,209
So this is where
all the bad people go, eh, Sachiko?

289
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:57,209
Ensai, you got
an answer for me yet?

290
00:29:59,550 --> 00:30:01,219
The answer's no.

291
00:30:01,619 --> 00:30:05,050
l won't give Sachiko
to a man like you.

292
00:30:07,189 --> 00:30:08,500
ls that right?

293
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:14,409
Ensai...

294
00:30:15,669 --> 00:30:18,159
aren't you wanted
for fraud in Osaka?

295
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:21,149
The prefectural police called

296
00:30:22,270 --> 00:30:24,139
about a forged painting.

297
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:27,990
Are you going to arrest me?

298
00:30:28,609 --> 00:30:31,129
They'd make a fine couple!

299
00:30:31,649 --> 00:30:35,490
And a cop in the family
could come in handy, right?

300
00:30:36,719 --> 00:30:38,209
Let's do this:

301
00:30:38,590 --> 00:30:42,840
When the picture's done,
we'll all have a long talk.

302
00:30:43,859 --> 00:30:46,000
Dr. Kusama
the old man's gotten worse!

303
00:30:46,459 --> 00:30:48,419
Please come quickly!
- If l must.

304
00:30:50,369 --> 00:30:52,590
- Hurry!
- Yeah, yeah.

305
00:30:59,209 --> 00:31:01,490
- Quickly, Doctor!
- l know!

306
00:31:09,119 --> 00:31:11,459
The doctor's here.

307
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:20,219
lt's not just him, Doctor.
We're all weak.

308
00:31:21,270 --> 00:31:23,000
lt's the food here.

309
00:31:23,939 --> 00:31:26,550
You're skimming
our welfare payments.

310
00:31:27,070 --> 00:31:28,530
Who's skimming?

311
00:31:28,909 --> 00:31:31,899
The welfare office
gives us 62 yen a day.

312
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:34,530
We spend 70.

313
00:31:35,550 --> 00:31:37,129
The food's plenty nutritious.

314
00:31:51,359 --> 00:31:52,649
Sachiko.

315
00:32:06,439 --> 00:32:08,810
You're going to marry me, right?

316
00:32:09,310 --> 00:32:11,179
Let go! Please!

317
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:26,980
You like Sachiko, don't you?

318
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:44,219
The evening is clear.
The autumn wind blows.

319
00:32:45,949 --> 00:32:52,129
Bell crickets cry
in the moonlight.

320
00:32:57,429 --> 00:33:00,389
The sky above my hometown...

321
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:08,300
How fare my mother and father...

322
00:33:47,209 --> 00:33:48,699
Shiro!

323
00:33:51,419 --> 00:33:52,879
You scared me to death!

324
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:55,600
l thought you got hit.

325
00:33:58,089 --> 00:33:59,429
You did?

326
00:34:05,159 --> 00:34:08,790
l saw you walking
absent-mindedly along the tracks.

327
00:34:18,110 --> 00:34:20,389
You've been here four days now.

328
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:23,350
Your mother seems a little better.

329
00:34:24,119 --> 00:34:25,989
l'd given up hope.

330
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:32,560
She said she'd take me to Tokyo
when she got better.

331
00:34:33,259 --> 00:34:35,750
l'm really looking forward to that.

332
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:39,290
Tamura!

333
00:34:40,670 --> 00:34:42,219
Long time no see.

334
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:45,469
l thought l'd drop by
and see how you're doing.

335
00:34:46,170 --> 00:34:47,900
What did you do
after l left?

336
00:34:54,580 --> 00:34:56,630
l'll be going home now.

337
00:35:01,589 --> 00:35:05,159
The spitting image
of Yukiko, huh?

338
00:35:07,690 --> 00:35:09,589
The Yajimas are a bit better.

339
00:35:10,029 --> 00:35:13,100
He said they'd stop here
on a lecture tour.

340
00:35:13,699 --> 00:35:15,310
They'll probably arrive tonight.

341
00:35:15,770 --> 00:35:19,080
Tamura, please!
Go back to Tokyo immediately.

342
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:21,639
Stay away from me!

343
00:35:22,409 --> 00:35:24,750
l'll be at that inn over there.

344
00:35:25,239 --> 00:35:26,940
l plan to stay a while.

345
00:35:27,350 --> 00:35:28,750
See you.

346
00:35:39,759 --> 00:35:41,540
Shiro!

347
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:54,969
Your mother's taken
a sudden turn for the worse.

348
00:35:57,679 --> 00:35:58,850
Wait!

349
00:36:03,710 --> 00:36:08,369
You're returning to Tokyo
if she dies, right?

350
00:36:09,190 --> 00:36:11,739
Take me with you!
Please!

351
00:36:29,369 --> 00:36:30,659
Mother!

352
00:37:24,029 --> 00:37:29,679
l bow in homage
to the Buddha.

353
00:37:30,639 --> 00:37:35,589
l sing in praise
of Bodhisattva Jizo.

354
00:37:36,610 --> 00:37:43,580
This is a tale of things...

355
00:37:44,719 --> 00:37:49,989
not of this world.

356
00:38:01,830 --> 00:38:05,170
Hey, Professor Yajima
and his wife are here.

357
00:38:14,150 --> 00:38:15,549
Professor.

358
00:38:16,779 --> 00:38:17,949
Mrs. Yajima.

359
00:38:20,319 --> 00:38:23,980
Shimizu, there's no need
to say anything.

360
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:26,610
Let's make a fresh start.

361
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:39,830
Yukiko!

362
00:38:58,790 --> 00:39:00,250
Dr. Kusama...

363
00:39:00,730 --> 00:39:03,449
l may be small-time,
but l'm still a journalist.

364
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:07,469
What did Mrs. Shimizu die of?

365
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:09,210
Angina pectoris.

366
00:39:10,969 --> 00:39:12,719
What's that supposed to mean?

367
00:39:13,139 --> 00:39:16,100
Are you suggesting
my diagnosis was wrong?

368
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:18,580
l demand an apology!

369
00:39:19,210 --> 00:39:20,639
You're wrong.

370
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:22,279
What?

371
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:24,190
Who the hell are you?

372
00:39:34,659 --> 00:39:38,610
Mrs. Shimizu died
from malpractice.

373
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:42,170
You knew your diagnosis
was wrong,

374
00:39:42,670 --> 00:39:45,159
but a second opinion
was too much bother.

375
00:39:45,670 --> 00:39:46,960
What?

376
00:39:47,310 --> 00:39:48,799
That's not true!

377
00:39:49,339 --> 00:39:51,650
lt was Gozo who killed Ito!

378
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:54,339
Father!

379
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:58,860
Cavorting with his mistress
with his wife ill in the next room!

380
00:39:59,779 --> 00:40:02,469
lto and l were once lovers.

381
00:40:03,020 --> 00:40:06,060
He stole her from me!
- l what?

382
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:09,110
Everyone knows that!

383
00:40:09,589 --> 00:40:10,900
lmpudent parasite!

384
00:40:11,259 --> 00:40:12,110
What?

385
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:13,330
Fool!

386
00:40:13,630 --> 00:40:16,000
You inhuman wretch!
Have you no shame?

387
00:40:17,699 --> 00:40:19,429
That heartless shit!

388
00:40:20,810 --> 00:40:22,270
ldiot!

389
00:40:24,409 --> 00:40:27,400
Have no fear, Doctor.

390
00:40:28,750 --> 00:40:31,500
You're not
the only murderer here.

391
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:35,159
- Who did l kill?
- Silence!

392
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:43,179
Everyone here
is complicit in murder.

393
00:40:48,029 --> 00:40:49,810
What the hell
are you talking about?

394
00:40:50,230 --> 00:40:51,810
Even you, Detective Hariya.

395
00:40:52,199 --> 00:40:56,150
Last summer you took a bribe
to frame a man.

396
00:40:57,310 --> 00:41:00,380
He was so ashamed
he killed himself.

397
00:41:01,850 --> 00:41:03,400
Mr. Akagawa...

398
00:41:04,619 --> 00:41:07,429
you killed a man
with an inaccurate article.

399
00:41:07,989 --> 00:41:08,920
l did not!

400
00:41:09,219 --> 00:41:12,150
l went to him and apologized!
But he was -

401
00:41:12,719 --> 00:41:14,299
Already dead.

402
00:41:17,929 --> 00:41:21,770
Next we have
the godlike director

403
00:41:22,469 --> 00:41:28,040
of this charmingly shabby
old folks' home,

404
00:41:28,969 --> 00:41:32,540
the Tenjoen,
or ''Heavenly Garden.''

405
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:37,060
Not content
with this pretty mistress,

406
00:41:37,650 --> 00:41:41,110
he has another in town

407
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:44,360
the plump owner
of the Tonchuken Tavern.

408
00:41:45,690 --> 00:41:47,270
Tamura, that's enough!

409
00:41:55,770 --> 00:41:59,279
And you, Professor!
What about your comrades in Malaya?

410
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:01,339
Sir!

411
00:42:02,639 --> 00:42:05,540
Old Tome's dead!

412
00:42:10,819 --> 00:42:13,429
You two killed him!

413
00:42:14,190 --> 00:42:18,319
All you think about is
the damn tenth anniversary festival!

414
00:42:19,060 --> 00:42:23,980
TENJOEN OLD AGE HOME
TENTH ANNIVERSARY FESTIVAL

415
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:18,040
Day after day...

416
00:43:18,650 --> 00:43:26,239
this world fades
into the distance.

417
00:43:29,060 --> 00:43:34,509
Year after year...

418
00:43:35,429 --> 00:43:39,650
my death draws ever closer.

419
00:43:42,569 --> 00:43:48,110
Today is the funeral...

420
00:43:49,049 --> 00:43:53,969
of another.

421
00:43:56,049 --> 00:43:59,040
Tomorrow...

422
00:43:59,619 --> 00:44:02,960
it will be mine.

423
00:44:13,699 --> 00:44:15,429
They look delicious!

424
00:44:16,509 --> 00:44:18,060
Are they safe?

425
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:20,839
At least they're cheap, Doctor.

426
00:44:21,350 --> 00:44:22,810
And they haven't gone bad yet.

427
00:44:23,179 --> 00:44:25,520
l don't need
a food poisoning scandal.

428
00:44:26,020 --> 00:44:27,569
Who cares?

429
00:44:27,949 --> 00:44:31,520
They're for the old folks,
not us.

430
00:44:32,190 --> 00:44:34,330
Always putting others first!

431
00:44:38,100 --> 00:44:41,500
HIT-AND-RUN VEHICLE
IDENTIFIED FROM SKID MARKS

432
00:44:58,949 --> 00:45:03,369
My father insists
l go into town for some paint.

433
00:45:04,659 --> 00:45:06,270
l should be back tonight.

434
00:45:06,659 --> 00:45:08,770
Sorry to leave
when it's so busy.

435
00:45:09,429 --> 00:45:10,980
Did Mr. Tamura leave?

436
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:12,589
Yes.

437
00:45:13,529 --> 00:45:16,369
And l'm returning to Tokyo
with Professor Yajima tomorrow.

438
00:45:16,929 --> 00:45:18,739
So soon?

439
00:45:19,170 --> 00:45:23,179
l wanted you to take Father and me
hiking along Kiyosawa Gorge.

440
00:45:23,909 --> 00:45:25,369
You're no fun.

441
00:45:29,310 --> 00:45:30,920
ls this a love scene?

442
00:45:31,319 --> 00:45:35,739
Here l was planning
to sneak off alone with Shiro.

443
00:45:37,020 --> 00:45:39,040
You like him, don't you?

444
00:45:39,489 --> 00:45:41,480
Me, l love this man!

445
00:45:41,929 --> 00:45:46,319
Shiro, which one of us
do you like?

446
00:45:47,699 --> 00:45:49,250
Sachiko?

447
00:45:51,069 --> 00:45:51,860
Excuse me.

448
00:45:52,139 --> 00:45:53,279
See you later.

449
00:45:54,100 --> 00:45:56,290
Shiro, won't you go with me?

450
00:45:56,770 --> 00:45:59,670
l forgot earlier.
Are you Shiro Shimizu?

451
00:46:00,679 --> 00:46:02,199
This is for you.

452
00:46:05,020 --> 00:46:06,569
Who's it from?

453
00:46:12,989 --> 00:46:15,509
l just had to see you.

454
00:46:16,029 --> 00:46:18,279
l've come all the way here.

455
00:46:19,299 --> 00:46:23,199
Shiro, please meet me
on the rope bridge.

456
00:46:24,770 --> 00:46:25,699
Yoho.

457
00:46:51,799 --> 00:46:54,929
lt's been a while, Shiro.

458
00:46:55,770 --> 00:46:58,110
You know my name?

459
00:46:59,670 --> 00:47:01,600
Of course.

460
00:47:02,339 --> 00:47:04,619
l know everything about you.

461
00:47:36,969 --> 00:47:42,330
l was Kyoichi Shiga's woman.
He's the man you hit and killed.

462
00:47:59,699 --> 00:48:01,659
His mother saw the whole thing.

463
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:04,679
We found you and Tamura
right away.

464
00:48:19,049 --> 00:48:20,630
Now l've come...

465
00:48:22,989 --> 00:48:24,690
to kill you.

466
00:48:26,489 --> 00:48:30,029
l was in love with you
until l found out who you were.

467
00:48:30,690 --> 00:48:33,089
Now l just want to kill you.

468
00:48:34,869 --> 00:48:36,600
l'm sorry.

469
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:09,520
Don't do it.
There's plenty of time to die.

470
00:49:13,369 --> 00:49:17,089
l knew this would happen.
l know everything, you know.

471
00:49:17,770 --> 00:49:20,259
Tamura! Who are you?

472
00:49:21,110 --> 00:49:22,569
lf it weren't for you -

473
00:49:22,949 --> 00:49:26,230
Just do as l say
and you'll be fine.

474
00:49:46,670 --> 00:49:48,159
Tamura!

475
00:50:04,020 --> 00:50:06,159
Tonight marks our anniversary.

476
00:50:06,619 --> 00:50:08,580
We have little to offer
but please enjoy!

477
00:50:09,029 --> 00:50:11,750
Mr. Shimizu
you pulled out all the stops!

478
00:50:12,299 --> 00:50:14,520
You gave us fish
with heads for a change!

479
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:27,460
HAPPY ANNIVERSARY!
THE TONCHUKEN TAVERN

480
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:29,409
Happy anniversary!

481
00:50:29,779 --> 00:50:33,589
The tavern owner has given us
a gift of their famous roast pork.

482
00:50:35,319 --> 00:50:37,489
And l'll sing for you too.

483
00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:39,710
Poor singer that you are!

484
00:50:40,119 --> 00:50:42,199
Let's hear it
for the boss lady!

485
00:50:43,029 --> 00:50:45,020
Your attention, please!

486
00:50:46,029 --> 00:50:50,659
All along the slopes...

487
00:50:53,739 --> 00:50:57,839
of the mountain...

488
00:51:00,810 --> 00:51:05,170
the scything...

489
00:51:09,889 --> 00:51:13,929
is finished.

490
00:51:31,509 --> 00:51:34,880
Special tonight:
a kiss for everyone!

491
00:51:42,190 --> 00:51:44,619
lt's a strip show!

492
00:51:45,489 --> 00:51:46,779
No!

493
00:51:49,190 --> 00:51:52,000
Sir, can't we get some
of those fish heads too?

494
00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:54,900
Yeah, where's my head?

495
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:57,650
lsn't Tonchuken's
famous roast pork

496
00:51:58,139 --> 00:52:01,130
a lot better than rotten fish?

497
00:52:03,009 --> 00:52:06,790
Eat that pork! Drink that booze!
Pork! Booze! Booze!

498
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:10,670
Eat that pork! Drink that booze!
Pork! Booze! Booze!

499
00:52:11,850 --> 00:52:13,960
Forgive my appearance,
Professor.

500
00:52:14,420 --> 00:52:16,440
Won't you join us?

501
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:19,730
Do you know where Shiro is?

502
00:52:20,290 --> 00:52:22,839
- l'm afraid not.
- Too bad.

503
00:52:23,830 --> 00:52:26,989
Eat that pork! Drink that booze!
Pork! Booze! Booze!

504
00:52:50,589 --> 00:52:52,670
Who's in there?

505
00:53:01,060 --> 00:53:03,869
What are you doing here?

506
00:53:04,429 --> 00:53:06,860
l'll never let you go!

507
00:53:18,119 --> 00:53:24,360
Mount Bandai in Aizu
is a treasure mountain

508
00:53:37,969 --> 00:53:42,770
Tied together, hugging tight

509
00:53:43,610 --> 00:53:48,389

Kusatsu's a nice place
Come pay a visit

515
00:54:20,380 --> 00:54:24,330
Flowers blossom
even in the hot springs

516
00:54:46,839 --> 00:54:48,239
Kinuko!

517
00:55:02,219 --> 00:55:05,409
l knew it!
l just knew it!

518
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:11,509
Don't act so surprised.

519
00:55:11,900 --> 00:55:14,920
l'm sick of being your plaything
out here in the boonies.

520
00:55:16,029 --> 00:55:17,400
That's it!

521
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:21,219
l'll kill you both!

522
00:55:21,810 --> 00:55:24,179
Father, it was all my fault!

523
00:55:25,409 --> 00:55:26,639
You son of a bitch!

524
00:55:26,980 --> 00:55:29,119
Stop it!
Don't kill him!

525
00:55:29,580 --> 00:55:31,069
This was my doing!

526
00:55:40,619 --> 00:55:41,909
Damn you!

527
00:55:45,029 --> 00:55:46,199
Father!

528
00:55:48,060 --> 00:55:49,259
You whore!

529
00:56:21,770 --> 00:56:24,230
Shiro, keep your mouth shut.

530
00:56:24,730 --> 00:56:27,750
Go back and sit down
as if nothing happened, okay?

531
00:57:00,199 --> 00:57:01,630
Professor.

532
00:57:02,009 --> 00:57:03,529
Thank you for everything.

533
00:57:03,909 --> 00:57:07,250

535
00:57:13,420 --> 00:57:14,819
Professor!

536

Yukiko!

537
00:57:48,350 --> 00:57:49,659
Let's go.

538
00:58:08,569 --> 00:58:11,730
Hey, more sake!
Bring more sake!

539
00:58:12,339 --> 00:58:15,529
You want sake?
I have some.

540
00:58:17,850 --> 00:58:19,460
Who are you?

541
00:58:19,850 --> 00:58:24,389
A relative of a former
resident of the home.

542
00:58:25,190 --> 00:58:26,739
l came to help celebrate.

543
00:58:27,119 --> 00:58:29,290
How about a drink
for everyone?

544
00:58:29,759 --> 00:58:31,719
lt's not poisoned, is it?

545
00:58:32,159 --> 00:58:34,239
What a thing to say!

546
00:58:34,699 --> 00:58:37,330
l'll drink some first
to show it isn't.

547
00:58:37,869 --> 00:58:40,830
- Fine, pour me some.
- Allow me.

548
00:58:42,270 --> 00:58:48,600
Even those
in the prime of life

549
00:58:49,850 --> 00:58:55,270
Have suddenly died

550
00:58:57,619 --> 00:59:02,839
With the coming of dawn

551
00:59:09,569 --> 00:59:14,520
Tonight they lay their heads

552
00:59:16,110 --> 00:59:20,619
On their pillows

553
00:59:22,449 --> 00:59:25,060
But when morning comes...

554
00:59:25,580 --> 00:59:28,770
lf you'll allow me,
l'll test this for poison.

555
00:59:29,389 --> 00:59:31,699
Well, one last drink.

556
00:59:32,190 --> 00:59:33,920
Cheers!

557
00:59:39,600 --> 00:59:40,529
Tamura!

558
00:59:43,869 --> 00:59:47,409
Shiro, it's terrible! The Yajimas
threw themselves in front of the train!

559
00:59:58,310 --> 01:00:00,299
Tamura!
You son of a bitch!

560
01:00:07,319 --> 01:00:10,130
You killed my son Kyoichi!

561
01:00:10,690 --> 01:00:12,940
You pushed Yoko off that bridge!

562
01:00:13,429 --> 01:00:15,239
l know everything!

563
01:00:15,670 --> 01:00:18,360
l know everything!

564
01:00:18,900 --> 01:00:20,920
l'll kill you!

565
01:00:22,509 --> 01:00:24,469
l'll kill you!

566
01:00:30,380 --> 01:00:32,279
Bastards!

567
01:00:33,619 --> 01:00:35,839
Those fish were rancid!

568
01:01:53,569 --> 01:01:55,179
Shiro.

569
01:01:59,150 --> 01:02:00,440
Tamura!

570
01:02:05,049 --> 01:02:06,630
What is this place?

571
01:02:07,560 --> 01:02:09,080
This place?

572
01:02:10,659 --> 01:02:14,000
This is the path to Hell,

573
01:02:14,630 --> 01:02:17,880
the border between life and death.

574
01:02:18,969 --> 01:02:21,719
This is the River Sanzu.

575
01:02:25,170 --> 01:02:28,100
You and l...

576
01:02:30,139 --> 01:02:33,330
are going to Hell together.

577
01:02:39,690 --> 01:02:43,380
You hear that crying?

578
01:02:44,759 --> 01:02:46,279
Listen.

579
01:02:46,659 --> 01:02:48,799
lt's a baby crying.

580
01:02:49,960 --> 01:02:52,069
lt's calling you.

581
01:02:52,799 --> 01:02:55,170
Calling me?

582
01:02:56,339 --> 01:02:59,000
Why is it calling me?

583
01:03:05,880 --> 01:03:08,159
Tamura, tell me!

584
01:03:08,650 --> 01:03:10,429
Why is it calling me?

585
01:03:32,839 --> 01:03:34,270
Where am l?

586
01:03:42,279 --> 01:03:45,299
l am Enma, king of Hell.

587
01:03:46,549 --> 01:03:49,889
l am lord
of the Eight Hells of Fire

588
01:03:50,520 --> 01:03:53,360
and the Eight Hells of Ice.

589
01:03:55,130 --> 01:04:00,049
l sit in judgment of all
who slither into the underworld

590
01:04:01,670 --> 01:04:05,100
and pass sentence
on their sins.

591
01:04:06,770 --> 01:04:08,699
Shiro Shimizu,

592
01:04:09,139 --> 01:04:14,119
recall now
your multitude of crimes.

593
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:19,429
Look into the all-revealing mirror.

594
01:04:43,210 --> 01:04:46,989
Bastard! You hit me!

595
01:05:09,139 --> 01:05:12,509
You are sentenced to the torments
of the Eight Hells!

596
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:48,110
The first pile of stones

597
01:05:49,480 --> 01:05:56,719
ls for their fathers

598
01:05:58,589 --> 01:06:06,710
The second pile of stones

599
01:06:08,360 --> 01:06:12,839
ls for their mothers

600
01:06:15,940 --> 01:06:23,299
The third pile of stones

601
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:29,980
ls for brothers
and sisters back home

602
01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:41,319
Thus they pray
for the happiness

603
01:06:42,759 --> 01:06:47,449
Of those left behind

604
01:06:49,969 --> 01:06:58,000
By day they play

605
01:06:59,279 --> 01:07:04,350
Alone with their stones

606
01:07:10,159 --> 01:07:11,909
There's a baby crying.

607
01:07:13,989 --> 01:07:15,739
lt's calling me.

608
01:07:17,500 --> 01:07:19,310
Where's it coming from?

609
01:07:25,270 --> 01:07:32,600
The demons of hell

610
01:07:34,279 --> 01:07:40,839
Appear before them

611
01:07:41,889 --> 01:07:43,940
And ask:
''What is this you're doing?''

612
01:07:46,460 --> 01:07:48,270
Where am l?

613
01:07:49,130 --> 01:07:53,549
This is the bank
of the River Sanzu,

614
01:07:54,330 --> 01:07:58,750
where children are held in limbo
for having died before their parents.

615
01:07:59,770 --> 01:08:07,980
Your parents
Ieft behind in the world

616
01:08:12,320 --> 01:08:13,280
Yukiko!

617
01:08:17,219 --> 01:08:22,110
They do nothing
but mourn your death

618
01:08:32,509 --> 01:08:33,879
Forgive me!

619
01:08:34,940 --> 01:08:38,339
lt's as if l killed you myself.

620
01:08:38,980 --> 01:08:40,469
Forgive me.

621
01:09:36,169 --> 01:09:37,900
The baby's crying.

622
01:09:40,410 --> 01:09:42,719
The baby with which
we were blessed.

623
01:09:45,709 --> 01:09:47,579
You... were pregnant?

624
01:09:50,280 --> 01:09:53,120
l meant to tell you that night.

625
01:09:53,990 --> 01:09:59,259
The crash killed
both me and our child.

626
01:10:05,499 --> 01:10:06,810
Yukiko...

627
01:10:08,400 --> 01:10:10,270
forgive me!

628
01:10:14,509 --> 01:10:16,030
Forgive me!

629
01:10:19,879 --> 01:10:22,629
Give our child a name.

630
01:10:24,549 --> 01:10:26,329
lt's a girl.

631
01:10:28,690 --> 01:10:31,350
The poor thing needs a name.

632
01:10:34,660 --> 01:10:38,320
May l choose the name?
''Harumi.''

633
01:10:39,799 --> 01:10:43,929
From the characters
for ''spring'' and ''beauty.''

634
01:10:45,570 --> 01:10:46,860
lsn't it pretty?

635
01:10:51,709 --> 01:10:52,999
Harumi.

636
01:11:00,650 --> 01:11:02,759
So we had a child.

637
01:11:04,759 --> 01:11:06,020
Oh, no!

638
01:11:06,629 --> 01:11:10,110
l couldn't raise her alone

639
01:11:11,060 --> 01:11:14,129
so l set her on a lotus leaf
on the river.

640
01:11:16,539 --> 01:11:19,379
She'll be swept away!

641
01:11:20,209 --> 01:11:21,820
Swept away forever!

642
01:11:22,480 --> 01:11:24,289
Hurry and save her!

643
01:11:25,480 --> 01:11:26,350
Harumi!

644
01:11:31,280 --> 01:11:32,450
Harumi!

645
01:11:57,509 --> 01:12:01,049
l can't go any further.
You must look after her alone.

646
01:12:01,719 --> 01:12:04,329
We go together,
no matter where it takes us.

647
01:12:06,419 --> 01:12:08,730
The baby's being swept away.

648
01:12:09,419 --> 01:12:13,289
Put my grave right next to yours,

649
01:12:14,329 --> 01:12:17,049
and find the best spot
to bury my parents.

650
01:12:18,770 --> 01:12:19,759
Shiro!

651
01:12:20,400 --> 01:12:22,450
Yukiko!

652
01:12:25,440 --> 01:12:26,929
Harumi!

653
01:12:40,520 --> 01:12:47,990
A Iife is naught
but two score and ten years.

654
01:12:55,270 --> 01:12:58,079
Here meet
the Six Paths of existence.

655
01:12:58,740 --> 01:13:02,169
You who have no home
in the Three Unenlightened WorIds,

656
01:13:02,810 --> 01:13:06,730
as punishment for your sins
in the world of the Iiving,

657
01:13:07,450 --> 01:13:10,200
must wander aimlessly
along these six paths.

658
01:13:21,360 --> 01:13:22,700
Harumi!

659
01:13:23,060 --> 01:13:25,669
Have you seen my child?

660
01:13:28,570 --> 01:13:29,679
Professor!

661
01:13:31,509 --> 01:13:32,530
Mrs. Yajima!

662
01:13:34,709 --> 01:13:35,969
Shimizu!

663
01:13:36,740 --> 01:13:38,610
We had a child!

664
01:13:39,209 --> 01:13:42,459
Where did she
float away to?

665
01:13:44,520 --> 01:13:45,950
My daughter...

666
01:13:47,320 --> 01:13:48,629
Yukiko!

667
01:13:51,990 --> 01:13:54,329
Professor, Mrs. Yajima...

668
01:13:55,860 --> 01:13:57,150
forgive me.

669
01:13:57,860 --> 01:14:01,139
lf it weren't for me
none of this misery

670
01:14:02,469 --> 01:14:04,219
would have come to pass.

671
01:14:05,709 --> 01:14:06,910
Forgive me.

672
01:14:07,240 --> 01:14:08,969
Give me back my daughter!

673
01:14:09,879 --> 01:14:11,780
Fumi! Stop that!

674
01:14:13,009 --> 01:14:16,820
Shimizu, we too
have descended into Hell.

675
01:14:17,620 --> 01:14:18,850
Professor!

676
01:14:19,389 --> 01:14:22,350
Yukiko's death
drove my wife mad.

677
01:14:24,190 --> 01:14:25,999
We chose to die.

678
01:14:27,589 --> 01:14:30,310
Professor, we meet again.

679
01:14:35,669 --> 01:14:38,660
lt was your fate
to fall down to Hell.

680
01:14:39,469 --> 01:14:42,100
Here's another reason:

681
01:14:45,280 --> 01:14:49,379
ln Malaya you stole
a comrade's last sip of water.

682
01:14:50,679 --> 01:14:52,139
You killed him.

683
01:14:54,889 --> 01:14:56,200
lt's true!

684
01:14:57,459 --> 01:14:58,860
He's right!

685
01:15:05,030 --> 01:15:08,049
That's my canteen!
It's mine!

686
01:15:12,639 --> 01:15:16,240
l killed a man!

687
01:15:26,089 --> 01:15:27,520
Yamaguchi.

688
01:15:31,389 --> 01:15:32,560
Water!

689
01:15:33,530 --> 01:15:34,990
Give me water!

690
01:15:40,070 --> 01:15:41,679
Water!

691
01:15:43,169 --> 01:15:45,339
Water!

692
01:16:41,129 --> 01:16:44,910
Give me water.

693
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:47,270
You who are dead

694
01:16:47,900 --> 01:16:51,740
lf it's water you want,
drink your fill.

695
01:16:53,009 --> 01:16:57,730
This is the pus wrung
from your festering carcasses

696
01:16:59,009 --> 01:17:01,730
and a cesspool
of your foul wastes.

697
01:17:02,280 --> 01:17:04,389
Drink all you wish!

698
01:17:21,329 --> 01:17:24,139
You bastard!
You killed me!

699
01:17:28,379 --> 01:17:29,429
l'm sorry!

700
01:17:29,740 --> 01:17:31,820
l'll strangle you!

701
01:17:40,120 --> 01:17:42,959
Die! Die!

702
01:17:55,770 --> 01:17:57,139
Harumi!

703
01:18:02,709 --> 01:18:06,459
You killed me!

704
01:18:11,990 --> 01:18:14,209
l'm sorry.
Forgive me.

705
01:18:17,660 --> 01:18:18,950
Forgive me!

706
01:18:20,629 --> 01:18:23,320
Quiet!
l don't want to hear it!

707
01:18:40,350 --> 01:18:42,280
You who are dead

708
01:18:42,719 --> 01:18:44,969
this is the first Hell.

709
01:18:46,020 --> 01:18:51,530
Here flesh is peeled, bones crushed,
eyes plucked out and limbs severed.

710
01:18:52,530 --> 01:18:55,160
Every time
you make a sound

711
01:18:55,700 --> 01:18:58,310
or even a whimper,

712
01:18:58,829 --> 01:19:03,549
you are returned to Iife
to face the torments of Hell again.

713
01:19:06,509 --> 01:19:08,030
Kinuko!

714
01:19:31,799 --> 01:19:35,110
You were
negligent as a doctor.

715
01:19:35,740 --> 01:19:39,610
You made countless misdiagnoses
without a shred of shame.

716
01:19:40,310 --> 01:19:44,089
You were a slave
to money and debauchery.

717
01:19:44,780 --> 01:19:47,329
You will be sawed to pieces.

718
01:20:17,709 --> 01:20:22,900
As a policeman you were supposed
to protect the law-abiding,

719
01:20:23,780 --> 01:20:25,889
yet you were driven
only by self-interest.

720
01:20:26,350 --> 01:20:29,749
You implicated a man
in a crime he didn't commit.

721
01:20:30,490 --> 01:20:32,629
Your hands will be cut off.

722
01:20:45,509 --> 01:20:49,520
You were the most atrocious of all
the epitome of corruption.

723
01:20:50,610 --> 01:20:55,240
Your sins outnumber
the stones along the River Sanzu.

724
01:20:56,079 --> 01:20:59,829
You will suffer
each and every torment of Hell.

725
01:21:01,020 --> 01:21:03,629
First you will be flayed.

726
01:22:38,950 --> 01:22:41,410
Take me away from here, Shiro!

727
01:22:42,690 --> 01:22:45,730
l loved you
the minute l saw you!

728
01:22:47,360 --> 01:22:48,669
Kinuko!

729
01:22:49,400 --> 01:22:50,329
Father!

730
01:22:51,829 --> 01:22:53,730
- Whore!
- Let me go!

731
01:22:54,169 --> 01:22:55,480
You bitch!

732
01:22:55,839 --> 01:22:57,829
Let go of me!

733
01:22:58,770 --> 01:22:59,789
Bitch!

734
01:23:00,110 --> 01:23:01,400
Father!

735
01:23:04,209 --> 01:23:05,639
Shiro...

736
01:23:07,110 --> 01:23:10,419
you're to come with me.

737
01:23:12,919 --> 01:23:21,709
You will dwell with me
in this dark hell forever.

738
01:23:23,259 --> 01:23:26,009
No! l want to live!

739
01:23:30,200 --> 01:23:31,810
My baby's crying!

740
01:23:32,740 --> 01:23:34,320
She's calling me!

741
01:23:34,839 --> 01:23:36,980
You still don't understand?

742
01:23:37,709 --> 01:23:39,759
You're a fool.

743
01:23:42,520 --> 01:23:48,560
Loving someone, worrying about them,
suffering for them -

744
01:23:49,560 --> 01:23:51,400
all useless now!

745
01:23:54,089 --> 01:23:57,429
You tried to sell me out
for their sake.

746
01:23:58,060 --> 01:24:00,959
For their sake you committed
one sin after another.

747
01:24:01,530 --> 01:24:04,929
This all happened
due to you and your meddling!

748
01:24:10,009 --> 01:24:13,610
Do you think
you can escape from Hell?

749
01:24:18,520 --> 01:24:20,100
Just try it!

750
01:24:38,469 --> 01:24:40,780
This is the Lake of Blood

751
01:24:41,270 --> 01:24:45,579
to which those guilty of adultery,
Iust, Iicense and lechery

752
01:24:46,350 --> 01:24:51,829
are condemned
for their immoral conduct.

753
01:24:57,660 --> 01:24:58,770
Shiro!

754
01:25:01,089 --> 01:25:02,139
l won't let you go!

755
01:25:02,530 --> 01:25:03,990
l won't let you go!

756
01:25:04,360 --> 01:25:05,320
Let go!

757
01:25:06,230 --> 01:25:11,209
l may not make it to Oshoro

758
01:25:14,810 --> 01:25:19,639
Or Takashima

759
01:25:24,120 --> 01:25:25,639
Shiro!

760
01:25:28,959 --> 01:25:31,419
Yukiko! Harumi!

761
01:25:36,759 --> 01:25:38,509
Help me!

762
01:25:39,169 --> 01:25:41,629
Yukiko! Harumi!

763
01:25:49,110 --> 01:25:51,740
Yukiko! Harumi!

764
01:26:13,299 --> 01:26:15,410
Sachiko!

765
01:26:23,539 --> 01:26:25,410
Father!

766
01:26:29,049 --> 01:26:30,660
Mother!

767
01:26:57,039 --> 01:26:58,060
Sachiko!

768
01:27:22,799 --> 01:27:24,469
l can't see a thing.

769
01:27:25,400 --> 01:27:27,270
Have l gone blind?

770
01:27:28,839 --> 01:27:29,860
Sachiko.

771
01:27:30,879 --> 01:27:33,219
Have you seen my father?

772
01:27:33,709 --> 01:27:34,969
Your father?

773
01:27:36,249 --> 01:27:39,150
lt seems
l saw him somewhere...

774
01:27:41,289 --> 01:27:42,579
but l'm not sure.

775
01:27:43,320 --> 01:27:47,009
Why do you suffer so?

776
01:27:48,060 --> 01:27:51,839
lf only we'd met sooner in life -

777
01:27:52,900 --> 01:27:55,270
Now it's all too late.

778
01:27:56,440 --> 01:27:58,929
lt's not!
l'm going to live!

779
01:27:59,440 --> 01:28:01,749
You're right.
It's not too late.

780
01:28:02,240 --> 01:28:04,639
Even now you want
to touch her.

781
01:28:05,139 --> 01:28:07,799
lt's not too late for that.

782
01:28:13,150 --> 01:28:15,780
Shiro, take her in your arms.

783
01:28:16,320 --> 01:28:20,129
Kiss her!
Then you'll become just like me:

784
01:28:20,829 --> 01:28:22,579
one of Hell's vermin!

785
01:28:56,560 --> 01:28:58,020
No! Don't!

786
01:28:58,730 --> 01:29:00,280
Mother!

787
01:29:01,299 --> 01:29:03,379
You're holding your sister.

788
01:29:03,969 --> 01:29:05,490
That's your younger sister!

789
01:29:05,870 --> 01:29:08,589
Sachiko,
Shiro's your elder brother!

790
01:29:24,589 --> 01:29:25,879
These hands!

791
01:29:26,860 --> 01:29:29,850
The blood flowing
in these hands is cursed!

792
01:29:36,270 --> 01:29:39,370
When l went to live
with your father,

793
01:29:39,969 --> 01:29:42,870
l was already pregnant
with Ensai's child.

794
01:29:44,009 --> 01:29:45,740
lto! You mean -

795
01:29:46,480 --> 01:29:49,060
So Shiro is my son?

796
01:29:49,579 --> 01:29:50,839
Yes.

797
01:29:51,620 --> 01:29:54,579
l've lied to you both
all these years.

798
01:29:56,089 --> 01:29:57,289
lto!

799
01:29:59,429 --> 01:30:02,360
lf anyone's to blame,
it's you!

800
01:30:03,400 --> 01:30:05,450
lf only l'd known!

801
01:30:07,629 --> 01:30:12,139
l wouldn't have turned
into a drunkard.

802
01:30:20,280 --> 01:30:23,530
This is fun! l like you half-wits
more all the time!

803
01:30:24,419 --> 01:30:25,530
Let's go.

804
01:30:30,589 --> 01:30:31,900
Brother, wait.

805
01:30:33,560 --> 01:30:35,310
Your baby!

806
01:30:35,860 --> 01:30:37,560
Hurry and save your baby!

807
01:30:38,429 --> 01:30:39,980
l hear her!

808
01:30:42,400 --> 01:30:45,270
Wherever you go,
you go with me.

809
01:30:46,310 --> 01:30:48,299
You can't escape from me!

810
01:30:48,740 --> 01:30:52,079
Mr. Tamura, what do you want
from my brother?

811
01:30:53,079 --> 01:30:56,360
You're a demon!
You're the accursed god of death!

812
01:30:57,020 --> 01:30:58,539
Leave us alone!

813
01:31:01,889 --> 01:31:04,579
That's right.
l'm a demon.

814
01:31:05,120 --> 01:31:07,339
l'm the god of death.

815
01:31:08,589 --> 01:31:09,929
Shiro!

816
01:31:11,230 --> 01:31:12,570
Come with me!

817
01:31:13,629 --> 01:31:15,240
Leave my brother alone!

818
01:31:20,009 --> 01:31:22,030
Come with me!

819
01:31:23,740 --> 01:31:24,940
Come on!

820
01:31:55,509 --> 01:31:56,940
Tamura...

821
01:31:57,310 --> 01:32:02,089
you sold the most precious thing
a man can possess:

822
01:32:03,020 --> 01:32:06,589
You gave your conscience
over to evil.

823
01:32:07,990 --> 01:32:10,950
Those who sign away
their conscience

824
01:32:11,520 --> 01:32:14,480
suffer all the torments
of bottomless Hell.

825
01:32:27,709 --> 01:32:29,230
Harumi!

826
01:32:54,100 --> 01:32:57,030
Shiro, help me!

827
01:32:58,940 --> 01:33:00,230
Harumi!

828
01:33:01,740 --> 01:33:03,579
The pain!

829
01:33:05,110 --> 01:33:08,009
Hear me!

830
01:33:09,549 --> 01:33:12,740
You who in Irre
piled sin upon sin

831
01:33:13,350 --> 01:33:17,480
will be trapped in Hell forever.

832
01:33:18,889 --> 01:33:21,639
Suffer! Suffer!

833
01:33:22,799 --> 01:33:28,070
This vortex of torment
will whirl for all eternity.

834
01:33:41,410 --> 01:33:43,110
Help me!

835
01:33:45,419 --> 01:33:46,940
Help me!

836
01:34:52,450 --> 01:34:53,910
Save me!

837
01:35:06,929 --> 01:35:08,299
Shiro!

838
01:35:08,870 --> 01:35:12,120
Save your child now,
or she will suffer

839
01:35:12,740 --> 01:35:14,579
endless torment in Hell.

840
01:35:15,009 --> 01:35:18,490
You will be given
this one final chance.

841
01:36:03,020 --> 01:36:06,560
Hell! This is Hell!

842
01:36:23,039 --> 01:36:24,469
Harumi!

843
01:36:52,400 --> 01:36:54,129
Yukiko!

844
01:36:57,079 --> 01:37:00,209
Shiro, save Harumi!

845
01:37:00,810 --> 01:37:02,389
Yukiko!

846
01:37:08,389 --> 01:37:09,530
Brother!

847
01:37:22,129 --> 01:37:26,610
A human Iife

848
01:37:27,570 --> 01:37:32,110
ls naught

849
01:37:33,009 --> 01:37:40,780
But two score and ten years

850
01:39:36,129 --> 01:39:37,740
Shiro!

851
01:39:46,240 --> 01:39:48,049
Brother!

852
01:40:48,219 --> 01:40:48,509
