1
00:00:06,873 --> 00:00:11,873


2
00:00:35,067 --> 00:00:40,067
WHEN THE TENTH MONTH COMES

3
00:02:42,027 --> 00:02:43,665
A gift from your son.

4
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:46,801
Why hasn't he written in such a long time?

5
00:02:47,933 --> 00:02:50,971
He's been ill and in the hospital.

6
00:02:51,804 --> 00:02:53,784
He didn't want to make you worried.

7
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:56,820
Has he recovered yet?

8
00:03:00,079 --> 00:03:01,717
Yes, he's been discharged
from the hospital.

9
00:03:03,816 --> 00:03:06,353
My dad sent me this gun!

10
00:03:07,186 --> 00:03:08,995
Tuan, is your mom back yet?

11
00:03:09,388 --> 00:03:10,765
Yes, she just came back today.

12
00:03:11,056 --> 00:03:12,763
Tell her I'll visit her tonight.

13
00:03:12,825 --> 00:03:13,633
I will.

14
00:03:17,062 --> 00:03:18,666
Let's visit Duyen tonight.

15
00:03:20,266 --> 00:03:23,475
His unit is stationed
in the Central Highlands.

16
00:03:24,837 --> 00:03:27,977
Couldn't he at least have sent
a letter back with you?

17
00:03:34,613 --> 00:03:38,789
You went all that way to visit him,
and failed to bring me back a letter?

18
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:44,595
Grandpa! My gun!

19
00:03:45,057 --> 00:03:46,365
Let me have a look at it.

20
00:03:47,026 --> 00:03:47,834
What's wrong?

21
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,430
It's not shooting anymore.

22
00:03:50,362 --> 00:03:50,999
What happened?

23
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:53,877
- Here, let me fix it.
- Stop crying, Sweetheart

24
00:03:55,634 --> 00:03:57,136
There are more presents for you!

25
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:00,816
Shhh, quiet now.

26
00:04:03,275 --> 00:04:05,551
Were you a good boy for your Grandpa?

27
00:04:06,178 --> 00:04:06,918
Here's a present for you.

28
00:04:07,246 --> 00:04:07,849
Go on - take it.

29
00:04:16,021 --> 00:04:17,364
Mom, sharpen it for me!

30
00:04:17,723 --> 00:04:19,498
Wait. I'm talking to Grandpa right now.

31
00:04:20,492 --> 00:04:21,869
Here's a knife, sharpen it now.

32
00:04:21,894 --> 00:04:22,872
Thanks.

33
00:04:24,864 --> 00:04:27,868
Did your husband say
when he'd get leave?

34
00:04:33,072 --> 00:04:36,315
He's letting others in his unit
take leave before him.

35
00:04:37,977 --> 00:04:42,221
You know, many soldiers have been far
from home for decades without leave!

36
00:04:42,915 --> 00:04:44,417
That's true...

37
00:04:57,162 --> 00:04:58,732
Duyen, you've just come home?

38
00:04:59,431 --> 00:05:00,774
Are you tired from your journey?

39
00:05:03,502 --> 00:05:04,606
Whose baby is this?

40
00:05:05,104 --> 00:05:06,606
This is Thang's little one.

41
00:05:07,072 --> 00:05:08,710
He and his wife just moved down south.

42
00:05:09,508 --> 00:05:11,715
Once they're settled
they'll send for the baby.

43
00:05:12,511 --> 00:05:14,787
For now Grandma's the babysitter!

44
00:05:15,915 --> 00:05:18,361
A gift for you from my husband.

45
00:05:20,419 --> 00:05:22,296
Oh, your husband is so thoughtful!

46
00:05:24,056 --> 00:05:25,467
He didn't have to get me a gift.

47
00:05:26,325 --> 00:05:29,966
When he heard that Dad has been ill,
he was really worried.

48
00:05:30,095 --> 00:05:31,870
He even wanted me to come home early!

49
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:36,810
But when I told him you were taking care
of him in my absence, he felt reassured.

50
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:42,446
Have you been taking
your medicine regularly?

51
00:05:43,042 --> 00:05:43,645
Yes.

52
00:05:45,544 --> 00:05:48,889
Getting him to take all his medicine
was quite a chore, let me tell you!

53
00:05:49,481 --> 00:05:51,620
Whining all the time about
when you'd come back...

54
00:05:52,551 --> 00:05:57,591
Finally I said - she'll come home safely
only if you stop talking about it!

55
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:08,239
If you keep harping on about it, she'll probably
have an accident on the way home!

56
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,136
That shut him up.

57
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:18,080
How can I not worry about
my girl traveling all alone?

58
00:06:19,211 --> 00:06:24,092
He thought you might stay down south for fear
that someone would steal your husband!

59
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:29,699
Anyone home?

60
00:06:29,855 --> 00:06:32,199
Yes! Please come in.

61
00:06:32,558 --> 00:06:33,901
Come in everyone.

62
00:06:36,829 --> 00:06:38,433
Please sit down.

63
00:06:39,932 --> 00:06:42,378
We heard that Duyen just returned.

64
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:45,242
How is everything?

65
00:06:50,376 --> 00:06:53,050
How's Tuan's Daddy? Is he well?

66
00:06:54,146 --> 00:06:55,557
Thanks for asking. He's fine.

67
00:06:57,082 --> 00:06:59,062
What rank is he up to now?

68
00:07:00,452 --> 00:07:02,329
He's just a soldier.

69
00:07:03,389 --> 00:07:04,732
Just a soldier?

70
00:07:05,224 --> 00:07:09,331
But how many stars and stripes?

71
00:07:13,899 --> 00:07:14,570
Please have some tea.

72
00:07:14,733 --> 00:07:18,647
Did you by chance meet up with my eldest son
while you were down South? He's also a soldier.

73
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:23,551
The South is a vast land,
I'm sure the chances of that are slim!

74
00:07:27,212 --> 00:07:28,987
Have some tea.

75
00:07:29,448 --> 00:07:30,392
Thanks.

76
00:07:31,383 --> 00:07:32,453
Drink up everyone.

77
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:38,659
This tea is from the South.

78
00:07:38,924 --> 00:07:39,800
How do you like it?

79
00:07:40,459 --> 00:07:42,939
It's not as good as tea from Thai Nguyen.

80
00:07:54,206 --> 00:07:57,585
Grandpa, look at my new shin!

81
00:08:39,785 --> 00:08:42,095
Anything interesting happen in town?

82
00:08:44,756 --> 00:08:47,828
I bought you a copy of "The White Ship".

83
00:08:51,263 --> 00:08:53,971
I had to stand in line forever to get it!

84
00:09:00,806 --> 00:09:02,513
Why is it all wet?

85
00:09:03,142 --> 00:09:06,248
When I was coming home on the ferry,
a woman got sea-sick and fell overboard.

86
00:09:07,045 --> 00:09:10,492
I jumped in to rescue her,
and forgot to take off my satchel.

87
00:09:11,283 --> 00:09:15,959
If I was still a student,
I'd surely get an award for my actions!

88
00:09:18,056 --> 00:09:21,367
So make her give you an award!
Who was it?

89
00:09:22,127 --> 00:09:24,505
Duyen. She just returned from
visiting her husband.

90
00:09:24,596 --> 00:09:25,904
Duyen from the theatrical troupe?

91
00:09:26,798 --> 00:09:28,277
I'm not sure.

92
00:09:31,803 --> 00:09:33,976
When the tenth month comes,

93
00:09:34,172 --> 00:09:35,981
Rice ripens in five-ton fields.

94
00:09:39,144 --> 00:09:40,851
Is this the same poem you read
to me the other day?

95
00:09:41,746 --> 00:09:42,622
That's right.

96
00:09:42,881 --> 00:09:45,122
This morning I met with the editors of
Arts and Literature magazine.

97
00:09:45,817 --> 00:09:48,195
They said that after some revision,
they would publish it.

98
00:09:49,354 --> 00:09:50,697
A poem like this needs revision?!

99
00:09:51,389 --> 00:09:53,892
They said it wasn't realistic enough.

100
00:09:54,926 --> 00:09:58,567
Farmers can now harvest 7 or 8
tons of rice from one hectare.

101
00:09:59,931 --> 00:10:00,966
But in my poem I wrote:

102
00:10:01,766 --> 00:10:03,575
"Rice ripens in five-ton fields".

103
00:10:06,605 --> 00:10:08,312
You'll become a famous poet soon!

104
00:10:09,174 --> 00:10:15,489
Then you'll probably give up teaching,
and leave this school forever.

105
00:10:20,185 --> 00:10:21,289
You're so awkward!

106
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:26,696
How can I give up teaching?

107
00:10:27,993 --> 00:10:31,702
Writing poetry is just my way of
sharing myself with others.

108
00:10:36,134 --> 00:10:37,579
Sharing yourself with others?

109
00:10:38,069 --> 00:10:41,016
Why don't you write letters
to people instead?

110
00:10:41,673 --> 00:10:46,884
You think it's easier to be
truthful in a letter?

111
00:10:47,212 --> 00:10:50,318
I can't talk to you at all!

112
00:10:51,283 --> 00:10:53,490
Thom, where are you taking my poems?

113
00:10:54,452 --> 00:10:56,591
They're all wet, I'll rewrite them for you.

114
00:11:24,416 --> 00:11:27,124
Comrade Tran Dinh Nam has deceased.

115
00:11:27,485 --> 00:11:32,195
The Fatherland has lost a faithful son,
his unit has lost a brother-in-arms,

116
00:11:32,757 --> 00:11:34,668
and his family has lost a dear relative.

117
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,772
Due to fierce fighting on the front,

118
00:11:38,229 --> 00:11:43,042
the Unit regrets it cannot send a
representative to visit the family at this time.

119
00:12:10,128 --> 00:12:11,300
Hello.

120
00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:15,243
Duyen! Please come in.

121
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:19,505
Are you feeling better?

122
00:12:19,638 --> 00:12:20,616
Yes, thanks.

123
00:12:21,906 --> 00:12:27,447
My father-in-law asked me to thank you,
and invite you to visit our house.

124
00:12:27,646 --> 00:12:30,752
No need for thanks.
Please sit down.

125
00:12:33,551 --> 00:12:35,895
You really scared me this afternoon!

126
00:12:39,658 --> 00:12:44,266
Did you by chance find a
piece of paper that I dropped?

127
00:12:46,297 --> 00:12:49,141
I found this.
Is this it?

128
00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:54,844
How can this be true?

129
00:12:56,808 --> 00:12:59,516
You've just come back from visiting him.

130
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:06,426
When did he die?

131
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,858
Almost a year ago.

132
00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:13,626
And they just told you now?

133
00:13:18,697 --> 00:13:22,042
His unit was preparing the letter of death
just as I came to visit.

134
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,544
I just thought he'd had
an accident, or was ill.

135
00:13:26,337 --> 00:13:27,839
I never imagined that...

136
00:13:28,673 --> 00:13:30,209
My God.

137
00:13:32,544 --> 00:13:34,023
So on the ferry...

138
00:13:38,216 --> 00:13:40,662
Does his father know yet?

139
00:13:54,332 --> 00:13:56,676
Please don't tell anyone.

140
00:14:01,239 --> 00:14:06,917
Duyen, I'm the first to hear this bad news.

141
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,756
Allow me to express my condolences.

142
00:14:18,723 --> 00:14:19,758
Can I escort you home?

143
00:14:20,024 --> 00:14:21,560
I prefer to go alone.

144
00:16:05,530 --> 00:16:07,203
Still playing with kites at your age?

145
00:16:07,365 --> 00:16:07,934
People will laugh at you!

146
00:16:08,066 --> 00:16:08,874
Who will laugh?

147
00:16:09,067 --> 00:16:10,205
I will!

148
00:16:13,371 --> 00:16:14,748
Can I have it back please?

149
00:16:14,873 --> 00:16:16,910
If you promise you won't
continue with such childish games.

150
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,826
My friends all make fun of me!

151
00:16:24,015 --> 00:16:24,618
What do they say?

152
00:16:24,883 --> 00:16:26,590
They say you're still a little kid.

153
00:16:26,784 --> 00:16:28,092
Promise me?

154
00:16:30,722 --> 00:16:31,757
I promise.

155
00:16:31,956 --> 00:16:34,436
Can I have it back now?

156
00:16:50,141 --> 00:16:51,745
Oh, they're watching us.

157
00:16:57,382 --> 00:16:59,521
Come with me.

158
00:17:07,992 --> 00:17:10,199
No, I'm afraid.

159
00:17:11,095 --> 00:17:12,665
Afraid of what?

160
00:17:22,607 --> 00:17:25,110
My grandma says that in the old days,
on the 15th of the 7th lunar month

161
00:17:25,443 --> 00:17:30,153
there was a ghost market here
where living and dead people could meet.

162
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:33,688
What a silly story!

163
00:17:34,285 --> 00:17:35,855
This is a temple dedicated to a past hero,
famous for defending the country.

164
00:17:36,788 --> 00:17:40,964
He was chosen to become
our village's protector spirit.

165
00:17:52,203 --> 00:17:54,774
Don't do that!
Let's get out of here.

166
00:18:00,244 --> 00:18:01,188
My last kite.

167
00:18:05,717 --> 00:18:09,392
Tomorrow I have my military health exam.

168
00:18:24,102 --> 00:18:25,672
I've talked to my Dad.

169
00:18:26,771 --> 00:18:28,944
He'll soon visit your family to
make plans for our wedding.

170
00:18:29,774 --> 00:18:32,687
We'll marry before I join the military.

171
00:19:48,586 --> 00:19:49,360
Good day to you!

172
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:50,692
Who are you?

173
00:19:50,821 --> 00:19:53,461
I'm Khang.

174
00:19:54,558 --> 00:19:57,539
Our teacher?
Please come inside!

175
00:20:01,098 --> 00:20:04,636
I've brought some special tea
for you to try.

176
00:20:05,403 --> 00:20:06,381
You're bringing me gifts?

177
00:20:08,506 --> 00:20:10,611
Duyen's husband also sent me some tea.

178
00:20:11,242 --> 00:20:12,983
Please have some.

179
00:20:18,315 --> 00:20:20,522
Whose picture is on the altar?

180
00:20:22,353 --> 00:20:23,559
That's my oldest son.

181
00:20:23,954 --> 00:20:26,628
He died in Quang Tri in 1968.

182
00:20:27,291 --> 00:20:32,291
After Duyen moved in,
his wife remarried with a widower.

183
00:20:38,702 --> 00:20:41,080
She was afraid the villagers
would speak ill of her.

184
00:20:41,539 --> 00:20:44,645
But I said, just ignore them.

185
00:20:45,943 --> 00:20:48,150
To find love again is a precious gift.

186
00:20:49,113 --> 00:20:50,319
Right.

187
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:52,817
Grandpa, look at my drawing!

188
00:20:53,217 --> 00:20:54,662
Tuan, say hello to our guest.

189
00:20:54,919 --> 00:20:55,624
Hello.

190
00:20:55,953 --> 00:20:57,023
Hello, boy.

191
00:20:59,390 --> 00:21:01,802
How lovely!
What have you drawn here?

192
00:21:02,393 --> 00:21:03,838
It's a chicken.

193
00:21:05,196 --> 00:21:06,266
Have a look.

194
00:21:06,664 --> 00:21:09,543
Grandpa, remember to make me a kite.

195
00:21:10,634 --> 00:21:11,977
My eyes are going bad.

196
00:21:12,837 --> 00:21:15,579
Wait for your Dad to come home.

197
00:21:16,373 --> 00:21:19,183
Your Dad was the best kite-flyer
in the whole village!

198
00:21:21,212 --> 00:21:24,455
Tuan's Dad just sent him a box of crayons.

199
00:21:25,015 --> 00:21:27,120
Now he spends the whole day drawing!

200
00:21:27,351 --> 00:21:29,297
The wall is full of his artwork.

201
00:22:00,751 --> 00:22:03,254
Do you know how to fix guns?

202
00:22:03,521 --> 00:22:03,965
Sure I do.

203
00:22:06,023 --> 00:22:08,401
Let's see what's wrong with it...

204
00:22:14,031 --> 00:22:16,841
Ah, I see. Just a minute.

205
00:22:21,438 --> 00:22:21,939
Finished.

206
00:22:24,608 --> 00:22:25,279
Thanks!

207
00:22:25,509 --> 00:22:26,852
Fire off a shot.

208
00:22:27,845 --> 00:22:28,915
Great!

209
00:23:08,219 --> 00:23:09,823
Grandpa, the chicken laid an egg!

210
00:23:48,158 --> 00:23:51,503
Tuan, bring me a bucket of water.

211
00:23:54,665 --> 00:23:55,939
Water the tree.

212
00:23:56,166 --> 00:23:58,612
Your Dad planted this when
he came home on leave.

213
00:23:58,936 --> 00:24:01,678
It will bear fruit soon,
and your Dad still hasn't come home.

214
00:24:02,373 --> 00:24:06,185
Let's save the fruit for
when Dad comes home.

215
00:24:07,544 --> 00:24:09,455
Right, we'll save it in your stomach!

216
00:24:19,523 --> 00:24:20,627
Hello.

217
00:24:21,058 --> 00:24:26,667
Duyen, please come in.

218
00:24:29,433 --> 00:24:32,437
I came for a visit the other day,
but you weren't home.

219
00:24:33,103 --> 00:24:35,140
Yes, my father-in-law told me.

220
00:24:39,910 --> 00:24:41,389
Have some water.

221
00:24:47,685 --> 00:24:48,993
I have a favor to ask you.

222
00:24:49,286 --> 00:24:53,792
Sure, anything. I'm happy to help.

223
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:59,497
My mother-in-law's death anniversary
is coming up.

224
00:24:59,930 --> 00:25:01,603
My father-in-law is hoping for a letter.

225
00:25:01,899 --> 00:25:04,175
Would you write one for me?

226
00:25:05,002 --> 00:25:05,673
Me?

227
00:25:06,303 --> 00:25:07,441
Yes.

228
00:25:17,748 --> 00:25:20,922
You'd like me to write a letter
from your husband?

229
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:24,760
Yes.

230
00:25:26,957 --> 00:25:33,306
Duyen, you can't hide this
from your family forever.

231
00:25:35,866 --> 00:25:41,077
They have to know
the truth sooner or later.

232
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,976
But maybe they've made a mistake.

233
00:25:45,175 --> 00:25:49,248
Maybe he's still alive somewhere,
and hasn't been able to contact anyone.

234
00:25:59,523 --> 00:26:01,434
It's not hard to write this letter.

235
00:26:03,594 --> 00:26:09,340
But it won't be easy to write it so that
everyone believes it's really from him.

236
00:26:14,371 --> 00:26:15,748
Please try for me.

237
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,015
Here are all of my husband's old letters.

238
00:26:19,143 --> 00:26:21,623
It will help if you read them.

239
00:27:22,072 --> 00:27:29,251
In early August, Pol Pot's forces invaded
several locations along the southwest border.

240
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:32,522
They have attacked locals
and damaged property.

241
00:27:33,417 --> 00:27:35,624
An alert has been raised
among our armed forces...

242
00:27:52,135 --> 00:27:54,206
You should have skipped your meeting.

243
00:27:54,738 --> 00:27:56,615
Dad will yell at us for being late.

244
00:27:57,975 --> 00:28:00,114
How could I skip
such an important meeting?

245
00:28:00,377 --> 00:28:03,187
Finally, we've been waiting forever!

246
00:28:07,417 --> 00:28:09,294
Hello everyone.

247
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:10,755
Why are you so late?

248
00:28:11,255 --> 00:28:13,599
The provincial official has arrived!

249
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:22,366
I'm so sorry I'm late.

250
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:24,971
I had to attend a meeting in town.

251
00:28:26,003 --> 00:28:26,538
It's all right.

252
00:28:26,837 --> 00:28:27,713
Bring some more food.

253
00:28:28,338 --> 00:28:31,945
You've arrived! Please join us.

254
00:28:34,411 --> 00:28:36,721
Duyen, bring some more food in here.

255
00:28:37,881 --> 00:28:39,417
Sit down.

256
00:28:40,450 --> 00:28:44,364
I wanted to come earlier, but my husband
had to attend meeting with the town council.

257
00:28:44,821 --> 00:28:47,392
Don't worry about it,
Duyen and I took care of everything.

258
00:28:47,724 --> 00:28:48,600
Bon apetit everyone!

259
00:28:49,092 --> 00:28:50,662
Where is Duyen?
Eat with us, please.

260
00:28:53,530 --> 00:28:54,099
Where's Tuan?

261
00:28:54,531 --> 00:28:56,602
He ate with the other kids earlier.

262
00:28:59,403 --> 00:29:03,146
Grandpa, a letter came from Dad!

263
00:29:07,244 --> 00:29:08,450
A letter from Dad!

264
00:29:08,645 --> 00:29:11,285
Where's the mailman?
Invite him in to join us.

265
00:29:11,782 --> 00:29:12,624
He's gone already.

266
00:29:14,785 --> 00:29:18,255
Hai, please read the letter
out loud for everyone.

267
00:29:26,196 --> 00:29:26,867
Dear Father,

268
00:29:27,464 --> 00:29:29,944
My unit will be moving to the
southwest border region.

269
00:29:30,467 --> 00:29:33,277
I have time enough to dash off
a brief letter before we move out.

270
00:29:33,870 --> 00:29:37,283
I hope this letter makes it to you in time
for Mother's death anniversary.

271
00:29:37,474 --> 00:29:40,250
Because of work, I can't make it home
to burn incense on Mother's altar.

272
00:29:40,644 --> 00:29:42,555
My wife and Tuan will do so on my behalf.

273
00:29:44,247 --> 00:29:49,162
Recently, when my wife visited, I was happy
to hear her news about the whole family.

274
00:29:49,786 --> 00:29:53,324
I do worry about your health as you get older
while I'm far from home.

275
00:29:54,057 --> 00:29:56,196
Duyen, please take care of
my Father in my place.

276
00:29:56,726 --> 00:29:59,764
I know that my absence
is difficult for you.

277
00:30:00,730 --> 00:30:02,835
Tuan, did you receive
Daddy's presents yet?

278
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,177
Your Daddy misses you very much.

279
00:30:05,302 --> 00:30:09,182
Please behave yourself.
Don't be naughty for Grandpa and Mommy.

280
00:30:09,606 --> 00:30:12,348
When I come home,
I'll make you a great big kite!

281
00:30:13,276 --> 00:30:15,779
I hope that elder sister's family is well.

282
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:18,984
Is Lam still working for
the provincial authorities?

283
00:30:19,316 --> 00:30:22,229
Duyen told me that Hai is taking
college entrance exams.

284
00:30:22,819 --> 00:30:24,765
How did he do?

285
00:30:26,222 --> 00:30:28,293
Good news everyone!
He was accepted!

286
00:30:28,992 --> 00:30:29,936
That's great news!

287
00:30:33,263 --> 00:30:35,675
He's as smart as his father.

288
00:30:36,099 --> 00:30:40,343
Give my regards to Mrs. Hien,
Mrs. Dieu and our neighbors.

289
00:30:41,004 --> 00:30:43,177
Father, I wish you good health.

290
00:30:43,573 --> 00:30:45,678
Duyen and Tuan,
I wish you peace and happiness.

291
00:30:47,210 --> 00:30:48,518
What a thoughtful son.

292
00:30:51,981 --> 00:30:55,121
Duyen, come a moment...

293
00:30:57,821 --> 00:30:59,892
Tell your husband to ask for a discharge.

294
00:31:00,156 --> 00:31:03,865
I'll have my husband find a job for him
in his department.

295
00:31:04,461 --> 00:31:08,034
Neither of you give a thought
to the future!

296
00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:16,072
I have good news for everyone.

297
00:31:17,507 --> 00:31:23,617
Our village has been chosen as the first to
participate in the “adopt-a-parent” program.

298
00:31:24,914 --> 00:31:26,257
That's really wonderful to hear!

299
00:31:26,549 --> 00:31:29,758
Program participants will “adopt” parents
whose children died in the war.

300
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:32,097
They'll take the place of the deceased.

301
00:31:32,455 --> 00:31:34,401
What a great idea!

302
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:38,332
Dad is lucky to have you for a son-in-law!

303
00:31:39,763 --> 00:31:42,141
A son-in-law is never the same as a son.

304
00:31:42,665 --> 00:31:44,008
Say goodbye to your Father.

305
00:31:47,170 --> 00:31:50,811
For the past ten years I've
worked hard to raise our son.

306
00:31:52,175 --> 00:31:53,347
Our son has grown up.

307
00:31:54,444 --> 00:31:58,756
Please watch over him,
and help him to do well in his studies.

308
00:32:02,452 --> 00:32:04,432
Say goodbye to everyone.

309
00:32:05,655 --> 00:32:07,191
Goodbye, Mrs. Hieu.

310
00:32:07,223 --> 00:32:08,361
Goodbye, I have to go home now.

311
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:14,003
Dad, we have to get home.

312
00:32:14,664 --> 00:32:16,541
Hai will leave for college
tomorrow morning.

313
00:32:20,236 --> 00:32:23,080
Hai, do your best to study well.

314
00:32:24,808 --> 00:32:27,152
I don't have a gift,
but here's a little money for your travels.

315
00:32:27,177 --> 00:32:28,656
Thank you.

316
00:32:29,112 --> 00:32:30,455
You spoil him so!

317
00:32:31,181 --> 00:32:32,285
Work hard in school, son.

318
00:32:34,317 --> 00:32:35,921
Well, we'd better be leaving soon, too.

319
00:32:36,386 --> 00:32:37,490
I have more meetings this afternoon.

320
00:32:38,488 --> 00:32:39,330
Leaving already?

321
00:32:39,622 --> 00:32:41,124
Yes, we're off.

322
00:32:42,592 --> 00:32:45,471
Sis, take some leftovers to the kids.

323
00:32:46,529 --> 00:32:48,531
No thanks. Leave them for Tuan.

324
00:32:49,232 --> 00:32:50,040
Goodbye.

325
00:33:10,687 --> 00:33:12,098
No pushing!

326
00:33:13,356 --> 00:33:15,233
Order, order!

327
00:33:18,261 --> 00:33:20,070
Careful, or you'll fall.

328
00:33:21,364 --> 00:33:23,002
Remember everyone,
tomorrow class will start early.

329
00:33:54,330 --> 00:33:56,071
Did your father-in-law get the letter?

330
00:33:56,599 --> 00:33:59,876
Yes, he did. Thank you.

331
00:34:00,803 --> 00:34:02,749
Did it come in time
for the death anniversary?

332
00:34:02,972 --> 00:34:04,007
Yes.

333
00:34:07,410 --> 00:34:10,084
No one suspected anything?

334
00:34:12,849 --> 00:34:15,796
No. Please write another letter soon.

335
00:35:25,054 --> 00:35:26,931
Hurry up, it's almost your scene.

336
00:35:27,290 --> 00:35:29,361
Smile! You look like you're at a funeral.

337
00:35:29,626 --> 00:35:32,539
I told you to replace me.

338
00:35:33,029 --> 00:35:34,372
I don't know if I can perform.

339
00:35:35,365 --> 00:35:36,776
This is no time to argue.

340
00:35:36,899 --> 00:35:37,843
Hurry up, get ready.

341
00:35:38,167 --> 00:35:40,443
We have provincial VIPs
out there tonight.

342
00:35:56,152 --> 00:36:01,363
The aggressive enemy forces
seek to swallow our country.

343
00:36:01,924 --> 00:36:06,532
But our people will never surrender!

344
00:36:07,296 --> 00:36:09,105
Our land belongs to our people.

345
00:36:09,332 --> 00:36:13,212
Anyone who dares attack us
will be ground into pieces.

346
00:36:32,155 --> 00:36:33,566
Brothers and sisters!

347
00:36:33,790 --> 00:36:34,894
It's me, Vuong Tru.

348
00:36:35,291 --> 00:36:39,671
I'm on the King's mission to find
volunteers to defend our country.

349
00:36:41,197 --> 00:36:42,642
Khang, let's leave.

350
00:36:43,533 --> 00:36:45,240
Let's watch for a while longer.

351
00:36:45,401 --> 00:36:46,880
It's so boring.

352
00:36:48,337 --> 00:36:49,475
Ok, ok. Let's go then.

353
00:36:50,406 --> 00:36:51,942
I don't want to go back home.

354
00:36:53,643 --> 00:36:55,122
So where should we go?

355
00:36:55,278 --> 00:36:57,417
Anywhere but home.

356
00:37:04,921 --> 00:37:06,400
Truong Vien, my husband!

357
00:37:07,390 --> 00:37:10,030
Our country faces troubled times,

358
00:37:10,793 --> 00:37:13,603
like a bird flying in peaceful skies
meets suddenly with a fierce storm.

359
00:37:13,796 --> 00:37:19,906
I will endure my loneliness while you
pay noble service to our country.

360
00:37:22,538 --> 00:37:25,610
Is that the woman who was
on the ferry with you that day?

361
00:37:27,477 --> 00:37:28,251
Xuan Phuong, my love!

362
00:37:29,579 --> 00:37:32,355
I can withstand any hardship
in order to fight the enemy.

363
00:37:33,649 --> 00:37:36,960
But it will be difficult to be far from you,
my dear wife.

364
00:37:38,921 --> 00:37:47,306
And my beloved mother,
with her hair turning white.

365
00:37:48,231 --> 00:37:54,978
Please take good care of her
in my absence.

366
00:37:59,242 --> 00:38:01,950
Please go in peace.

367
00:38:02,879 --> 00:38:05,689
My love for you is engraved in my head.

368
00:38:06,716 --> 00:38:09,720
I will take care of your mother
like a true daughter.

369
00:38:10,419 --> 00:38:13,798
I will face all hardships bravely.

370
00:38:15,992 --> 00:38:17,665
Truong Vien, my husband!

371
00:38:18,795 --> 00:38:24,473
This war is like a tidal wave,
causing great destruction.

372
00:38:28,070 --> 00:38:32,678
Please keep this pearl
as a rememberance of me.

373
00:38:32,809 --> 00:38:37,656
My father gave me two pearls
for my dowry.

374
00:39:03,673 --> 00:39:09,680
Now these two pearls
must be separated!

375
00:39:11,581 --> 00:39:16,581
We must now follow two different
currents in the river of life!

376
00:39:53,155 --> 00:40:02,633
Dear wife, I will long remember this day.

377
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:09,300
My husband, I will long for your return.

378
00:40:15,911 --> 00:40:20,911
I will take care of your mother.

379
00:40:27,256 --> 00:40:32,256
Think of the fight ahead.
Don't worry about us at home.

380
00:40:43,906 --> 00:40:52,519
Today we must say farewell
to each other.

381
00:40:54,216 --> 00:41:01,998
We will soon be separated by
a terrible distance,

382
00:41:04,326 --> 00:41:10,299
one in the North, one in the South,
longing for the day we'll meet again.

383
00:41:11,667 --> 00:41:18,448
Our love will stay strong
in the face of storms.

384
00:41:23,012 --> 00:41:29,987
My pillow will lie alone on our bed
throughout the long and cold nights.

385
00:41:33,722 --> 00:41:36,760
A woman alone is like
a bending willow-tree.

386
00:41:42,097 --> 00:41:45,135
Every day looking to
the horizon with longing...

387
00:41:46,602 --> 00:41:53,042
The seasons will pass. Dead flowers and
leaves will return to the earth.

388
00:41:55,210 --> 00:42:03,061
But my loyalty to you
will remain steadfast.

389
00:42:33,115 --> 00:42:34,617
What should we do now?

390
00:42:36,485 --> 00:42:38,123
Go get Hai, we'll do his scene now.

391
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:39,765
Hai!

392
00:42:54,970 --> 00:42:55,971
Order please!

393
00:42:56,705 --> 00:42:59,948
Due to some difficulty,
we cannot continue this scene.

394
00:43:00,409 --> 00:43:03,185
We'll follow with a comedy scene.

395
00:44:04,072 --> 00:44:05,176
Don't be afraid.

396
00:44:05,707 --> 00:44:07,880
I'm just a fellow villager.

397
00:44:13,982 --> 00:44:16,622
You look like a Cheo theatre character.

398
00:44:18,187 --> 00:44:20,189
That scene about seeing your husband
off to the battlefield?

399
00:44:20,422 --> 00:44:23,596
It's been happening the same way
for generations.

400
00:44:27,996 --> 00:44:29,532
Who are you?

401
00:44:30,032 --> 00:44:33,241
I told you, I'm a fellow villager.

402
00:44:35,003 --> 00:44:42,012
I once went off to the North
to fight off enemy invaders.

403
00:44:42,945 --> 00:44:45,016
Are you the Village Spirit?

404
00:44:47,716 --> 00:44:49,957
I'm neither an angel nor a saint.

405
00:44:50,385 --> 00:44:59,669
I once went off to war like your husband,
and left behind a young wife like you.

406
00:45:01,363 --> 00:45:02,307
Do you know my husband?

407
00:45:02,464 --> 00:45:06,105
Before he went away
he offered me this kite.

408
00:45:06,768 --> 00:45:08,645
Did you forget?

409
00:45:09,938 --> 00:45:14,080
I remember, he burned that kite here.

410
00:45:14,409 --> 00:45:16,514
Now I return to you this keepsake.

411
00:45:16,712 --> 00:45:19,249
Is my husband truly dead?

412
00:45:24,186 --> 00:45:29,158
He now lives on only
in people's memories.

413
00:45:29,958 --> 00:45:33,235
I live to this day for that same reason.

414
00:45:36,465 --> 00:45:40,140
Venerable Spirit, please let me
meet my husband just once more.

415
00:45:42,237 --> 00:45:44,615
I myself have no magic powers.

416
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:47,218
Only this ground is sacred.

417
00:45:47,476 --> 00:45:49,888
Please live on in peace.

418
00:46:06,261 --> 00:46:07,296
Duyen...

419
00:46:08,797 --> 00:46:09,241
It's me.

420
00:48:16,591 --> 00:48:18,070
Are your joints
still bothering you, Father?

421
00:48:18,660 --> 00:48:24,338
Since Duyen returned,
I've been doing much better.

422
00:48:30,272 --> 00:48:32,445
Letter delivery!

423
00:48:40,282 --> 00:48:41,659
Another letter from Nam, Dad!

424
00:48:44,052 --> 00:48:46,965
He's been writing so often these days.

425
00:48:50,792 --> 00:48:52,794
It's a private letter for Duyen.

426
00:48:54,062 --> 00:48:57,134
Well, sometimes husbands and wives
have private matters to discuss.

427
00:48:57,332 --> 00:48:59,471
I'm just happy we're getting
letters from him.

428
00:49:07,809 --> 00:49:08,685
Hey.

429
00:49:09,444 --> 00:49:09,922
What is it?

430
00:49:10,445 --> 00:49:11,480
Stop what you're doing for a minute.

431
00:49:13,248 --> 00:49:14,784
Read this letter.

432
00:49:19,554 --> 00:49:20,965
Do you see?

433
00:49:24,125 --> 00:49:28,198
I have great admiration for you, Duyen.

434
00:49:29,430 --> 00:49:31,933
I hope that you will face the truth.

435
00:49:33,401 --> 00:49:34,744
A real ladies' man!

436
00:49:35,069 --> 00:49:37,174
I've noticed that something has
changed about Duyen lately.

437
00:49:37,672 --> 00:49:38,980
But who wrote this letter to her?

438
00:49:39,107 --> 00:49:40,586
We need to find out.

439
00:49:49,417 --> 00:49:52,364
He has to be from this village,
not a stranger.

440
00:49:53,187 --> 00:49:55,224
We can ask the
commune authorities for help.

441
00:49:56,024 --> 00:49:57,594
This is a private matter.

442
00:49:57,859 --> 00:50:00,339
If we let the commune know about it
it will make our whole family look bad.

443
00:50:01,496 --> 00:50:02,304
My poor brother!

444
00:50:03,698 --> 00:50:05,871
He believes absolutely in his wife.

445
00:50:07,235 --> 00:50:08,805
This is not just a family matter.

446
00:50:10,772 --> 00:50:14,743
Protecting the honor of a soldier
is a community responsibility.

447
00:50:19,347 --> 00:50:21,827
The local authorities have
to help in this case...

448
00:50:23,584 --> 00:50:26,190
How can we ourselves
catch them in the act?

449
00:50:27,188 --> 00:50:29,168
This handwriting looks familiar.

450
00:50:29,624 --> 00:50:31,763
I'm sure I've seen it before...

451
00:50:33,461 --> 00:50:35,771
Yes, in my son's school exercise book!

452
00:50:36,497 --> 00:50:38,170
I'll have him bring the book here.

453
00:50:40,468 --> 00:50:42,641
Suu, are you home? Suu!

454
00:50:46,007 --> 00:50:47,008
I'm studying Dad.

455
00:50:48,443 --> 00:50:50,582
Bring me your school exercise book.

456
00:50:50,912 --> 00:50:51,856
Right now!

457
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:01,633
You shouldn't draw pictures
in your exercise book.

458
00:51:02,991 --> 00:51:07,497
Yes, the handwriting is teacher Khang's.

459
00:51:13,067 --> 00:51:14,512
This man is not from around here.

460
00:51:16,270 --> 00:51:18,841
All right, please hold on
to the letter for me.

461
00:51:19,741 --> 00:51:22,984
If it really is Khang's doing, you can
report this directly to the Department.

462
00:51:23,277 --> 00:51:25,689
I will find a way to solve this problem.

463
00:51:26,414 --> 00:51:28,587
I have many friends in the Department.

464
00:51:29,283 --> 00:51:30,557
We need to solve this issue immediately!

465
00:51:33,021 --> 00:51:34,295
How did you get a hold of this letter?

466
00:51:36,357 --> 00:51:39,964
Surely because Duyen doesn't
want to hide anything from us.

467
00:51:41,229 --> 00:51:44,073
You know that her husband is
off fighting at the front...

468
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:49,007
Protecting the honor of our soldiers
is our responsibility.

469
00:51:50,838 --> 00:51:53,512
No, I don't believe it.

470
00:51:56,310 --> 00:51:56,981
It can't be.

471
00:52:05,053 --> 00:52:07,761
She hasn't told you about her situation?

472
00:52:07,855 --> 00:52:09,732
What is there for her to tell?

473
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:13,969
No, there's nothing.

474
00:52:14,595 --> 00:52:16,165
You admit that you wrote this letter?

475
00:52:18,866 --> 00:52:20,004
Yes.

476
00:52:22,403 --> 00:52:24,713
Good, so everything's is clear.

477
00:52:33,781 --> 00:52:35,124
This is really hard to believe.

478
00:52:36,117 --> 00:52:37,187
He's such a good person.

479
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:40,394
This is obviously his letter.

480
00:52:41,989 --> 00:52:45,493
You're his rector,
don't you recognize the writing?

481
00:52:46,294 --> 00:52:48,501
Go away and play, kids.

482
00:52:50,865 --> 00:52:52,845
But read the letter again carefully.

483
00:52:53,067 --> 00:52:55,741
I don't see anything scandalous in it.

484
00:52:57,038 --> 00:53:00,611
Asking to have responsibility for
someone else's wife and children?

485
00:53:01,409 --> 00:53:02,444
That is scandalous!

486
00:53:05,079 --> 00:53:06,080
Please return the letter to me.

487
00:53:08,749 --> 00:53:10,786
It's our responsibility to keep this letter.

488
00:53:37,712 --> 00:53:38,884
Can you catch me?

489
00:53:39,213 --> 00:53:40,351
Wait for me, Mom!

490
00:53:44,051 --> 00:53:45,155
Faster!

491
00:53:48,956 --> 00:53:51,368
This is a good place for kite-flying.

492
00:53:59,734 --> 00:54:00,906
Teacher Khang made it for you?

493
00:54:01,135 --> 00:54:02,409
Yes.

494
00:54:14,215 --> 00:54:16,195
When the tenth month comes...

495
00:54:18,819 --> 00:54:20,355
Hurry up Mom!

496
00:54:20,588 --> 00:54:23,228
Wait just a minute...

497
00:54:28,996 --> 00:54:32,273
Now, when I let go,
you hold the string and run.

498
00:54:33,868 --> 00:54:35,814
It's flying!

499
00:54:41,042 --> 00:54:42,715
Take the string and run!

500
00:55:01,963 --> 00:55:03,169
Let me see, let me see...

501
00:55:03,764 --> 00:55:04,242
What is it?

502
00:55:13,741 --> 00:55:15,345
Pass it on.

503
00:55:16,744 --> 00:55:18,417
Put it away, teacher's looking!

504
00:55:27,622 --> 00:55:28,032
Give it to me.

505
00:55:36,097 --> 00:55:37,075
Who drew this?

506
00:55:47,541 --> 00:55:49,680
Suu drew it, teacher.

507
00:55:52,613 --> 00:55:53,990
Suu, it that right?

508
00:56:02,923 --> 00:56:06,302
Go out for recess everyone.
Suu, you stay here.

509
00:56:39,694 --> 00:56:40,764
Who told you about this?

510
00:56:43,664 --> 00:56:44,301
My Father did.

511
00:56:49,537 --> 00:56:50,242
Your Father?

512
00:57:00,514 --> 00:57:02,323
Go on out for recess.

513
00:57:04,919 --> 00:57:07,058
He's just a kid, it's not his fault.

514
00:57:08,189 --> 00:57:11,033
Where there's smoke, there must be fire.

515
00:58:12,620 --> 00:58:16,693
My grandma told me that in the old days,
on the 15th of the 7th lunar month

516
00:58:18,125 --> 00:58:24,371
there was a ghost market here by the temple
where living and dead people could meet.

517
00:59:29,663 --> 00:59:36,308
Nam, Nam!

518
01:01:00,187 --> 01:01:01,530
Do you have something to tell me?

519
01:01:04,758 --> 01:01:05,998
Why are you silent?

520
01:01:08,729 --> 01:01:10,333
Have I done something wrong?

521
01:01:12,900 --> 01:01:15,107
Then why do you look so sad?

522
01:01:23,644 --> 01:01:25,681
I want those still living to have happiness.

523
01:01:26,013 --> 01:01:26,650
Happiness?

524
01:01:32,319 --> 01:01:35,425
Only living people can bring
happiness to each other.

525
01:01:37,057 --> 01:01:38,832
I've completed my role in the living world.

526
01:01:39,960 --> 01:01:45,205
No, you're still with me,
I still feel you near me everyday.

527
01:01:48,168 --> 01:01:50,774
What remains of me is
something intangible.

528
01:02:02,349 --> 01:02:07,628
I have kept your death
a secret from everyone.

529
01:02:12,159 --> 01:02:14,161
Father still believes
you are coming home.

530
01:02:16,196 --> 01:02:17,675
Let Father be at peace... I

531
01:02:19,166 --> 01:02:21,976
I'll come to him.

532
01:02:38,018 --> 01:02:38,758
Khang!

533
01:02:39,086 --> 01:02:40,224
Who are you looking for?

534
01:02:40,354 --> 01:02:41,799
I'm looking for him.
Have you found him yet?

535
01:02:42,089 --> 01:02:43,227
He just disappeared...

536
01:03:40,247 --> 01:03:42,022
What are you doing up so late?

537
01:03:42,816 --> 01:03:45,296
Today is the fifteenth
of the 7th lunar month.

538
01:03:45,419 --> 01:03:48,923
I forgot to tell you to burn incense.

539
01:03:51,024 --> 01:03:52,002
Please go to bed Father.

540
01:04:30,397 --> 01:04:30,898
What's wrong?

541
01:06:35,722 --> 01:06:37,998
When the tenth month comes,

542
01:06:39,293 --> 01:06:42,206
Rice ripens in the storm-softened fields.

543
01:06:43,497 --> 01:06:50,915
I leave behind me days of longing,
filled with loss and hardship.

544
01:06:52,005 --> 01:06:54,611
While the autumn sky
shines bright and blue...

545
01:07:03,183 --> 01:07:08,394
Khang, Khang!

546
01:07:12,225 --> 01:07:15,331
I intended to say goodbye,
but you were still asleep.

547
01:07:19,766 --> 01:07:23,304
Khang, answer for me one question,
then you can leave.

548
01:07:25,706 --> 01:07:26,309
Go ahead and ask.

549
01:07:29,810 --> 01:07:33,087
Are you in love with Duyen?

550
01:07:41,188 --> 01:07:43,964
Are you running away
because you're afraid?

551
01:07:52,232 --> 01:07:54,041
I need to ask you a favor.

552
01:07:55,302 --> 01:07:56,406
Please give this letter to Duyen.

553
01:07:57,738 --> 01:08:00,309
Go ahead and read it first,
then you'll understand everything.

554
01:08:08,181 --> 01:08:11,924
I have to go if I want to
catch the early train.

555
01:08:12,886 --> 01:08:15,992
I'll write later, once I'm settled.

556
01:08:19,126 --> 01:08:20,366
Goodbye Thom.

557
01:08:31,938 --> 01:08:34,077
Duyen, I've been wanting to meet you
for the past few days.

558
01:08:34,207 --> 01:08:37,086
But I am afraid of making trouble for you,
so I decided not to contact you.

559
01:08:37,610 --> 01:08:39,453
I am returning your husband's letters.

560
01:08:40,447 --> 01:08:42,154
I've memorized every word of them.

561
01:08:42,849 --> 01:08:43,486
And I understand.

562
01:08:44,150 --> 01:08:46,960
Nothing can take the place
of those lost to us.

563
01:08:47,253 --> 01:08:51,599
You've kept your painful secret from
everyone, for the benefit of the living.

564
01:08:52,392 --> 01:08:54,895
But I cannot hide my own sentiments.

565
01:08:55,862 --> 01:09:00,140
I hope that even after such a great loss,
you and Tuan will find happiness.

566
01:09:01,401 --> 01:09:07,477
Wherever I end up, this small village
will always be in my head...

567
01:09:20,053 --> 01:09:21,828
Have you seen Duyen?

568
01:09:22,122 --> 01:09:23,465
I just saw her over there.

569
01:09:33,299 --> 01:09:39,272
Duyen, hey Duyen!

570
01:09:39,973 --> 01:09:40,678
What's the matter?

571
01:09:41,174 --> 01:09:42,152
Go back home right now...

572
01:09:42,275 --> 01:09:45,745
Your Father won't take his medicine.

573
01:09:46,613 --> 01:09:47,956
He told me to come and find you.

574
01:09:48,114 --> 01:09:49,650
I'll go right away.

575
01:09:50,049 --> 01:09:51,153
Go quickly!

576
01:09:54,254 --> 01:09:55,756
Poor girl.

577
01:09:56,623 --> 01:09:59,536
What's the matter Father?

578
01:10:02,729 --> 01:10:04,970
Send a telegram to your husband.

579
01:10:06,232 --> 01:10:08,872
Tell him to take leave and come home.

580
01:10:10,470 --> 01:10:12,313
Take this medicine first.

581
01:10:13,206 --> 01:10:15,618
You have to be strong for
when your son comes home.

582
01:10:36,663 --> 01:10:37,869
Duyen, come out here for a moment.

583
01:10:40,333 --> 01:10:42,609
Duyen, he's not doing well.

584
01:10:43,203 --> 01:10:47,481
You should send the telegram
for your Father's sake.

585
01:10:58,518 --> 01:11:00,964
Or maybe you don't want him
to come home?

586
01:11:01,187 --> 01:11:05,101
Afraid the neighbors will gossip
about you to him?

587
01:11:05,291 --> 01:11:08,101
Please don't be suspicious of me.

588
01:11:08,328 --> 01:11:10,171
Just let me think how to handle this.

589
01:11:10,430 --> 01:11:11,932
It's up to you.

590
01:11:27,914 --> 01:11:29,325
Will you stay here with Father?

591
01:11:29,482 --> 01:11:30,756
I'm going to call my sister-in-law.

592
01:11:32,018 --> 01:11:32,826
Hurry.

593
01:11:54,173 --> 01:11:56,483
Can I get a lift?

594
01:11:58,878 --> 01:12:00,323
A lift please?

595
01:12:04,150 --> 01:12:06,152
Give me a lift into town?

596
01:12:19,499 --> 01:12:20,102
What's your name?

597
01:12:20,166 --> 01:12:21,167
My name's Tuan.

598
01:12:21,301 --> 01:12:22,712
What are you going into town for?

599
01:12:23,102 --> 01:12:25,343
To send a telegram to my Father.

600
01:12:26,172 --> 01:12:27,014
What does your father do?

601
01:12:27,073 --> 01:12:27,847
He's a soldier.

602
01:12:28,675 --> 01:12:30,848
Is that so, little General!

603
01:12:31,311 --> 01:12:32,187
Yes, I'm telling the truth!

604
01:12:32,312 --> 01:12:34,849
My Grandpa told my mom to send a
telegram asking my father to take leave.

605
01:12:35,315 --> 01:12:36,521
But my mom was too busy.

606
01:12:36,916 --> 01:12:38,520
So I'm going instead.

607
01:12:38,718 --> 01:12:39,321
What's your father's name?

608
01:12:39,852 --> 01:12:41,263
My Father's name is Tran Dinh Nam.

609
01:12:41,487 --> 01:12:42,932
Tran Dinh Nam?
What village are you from?

610
01:12:43,323 --> 01:12:46,202
Trung Nghia, where you picked me up.

611
01:12:46,426 --> 01:12:49,839
You playing hooky from school today?

612
01:12:50,463 --> 01:12:51,407
I haven't started school yet.

613
01:12:51,564 --> 01:12:54,044
My mom told me I'd start school
after the harvest season.

614
01:12:57,403 --> 01:12:58,541
What a clever boy!

615
01:13:01,674 --> 01:13:03,449
Have you seen Tuan anywhere?

616
01:13:04,177 --> 01:13:05,349
No, where did he go?

617
01:13:05,912 --> 01:13:09,257
I don't know. I thought he might have
come to visit teacher Khang.

618
01:13:10,450 --> 01:13:11,656
Duyen, please come in.

619
01:13:11,818 --> 01:13:12,489
I'm in a hurry.

620
01:13:12,885 --> 01:13:14,887
Duyen, Khang has left the village.

621
01:13:18,558 --> 01:13:19,969
He left early yesterday morning.

622
01:13:20,693 --> 01:13:21,228
Where did he go?

623
01:13:22,862 --> 01:13:24,933
He was transferred to another school.

624
01:13:27,300 --> 01:13:28,574
Duyen, wait.

625
01:13:28,868 --> 01:13:31,109
He asked me to give you this letter.

626
01:13:38,411 --> 01:13:40,516
I was just getting ready to bring it to you.

627
01:14:33,466 --> 01:14:34,706
Please step down, little General!

628
01:14:35,668 --> 01:14:36,339
We're here!

629
01:14:37,003 --> 01:14:40,712
Oh, we're back at my village!

630
01:14:42,275 --> 01:14:45,279
We'd like to come to your village
and visit your family.

631
01:14:46,446 --> 01:14:47,982
Then I'll help you send your telegram.

632
01:14:48,314 --> 01:14:49,258
Okay?

633
01:14:49,482 --> 01:14:51,587
No, I won't go, I won't!

634
01:14:51,651 --> 01:14:53,653
You tricked me!

635
01:14:56,055 --> 01:14:57,329
Have a break, everyone.

636
01:14:57,623 --> 01:14:58,328
Let me talk to the boy.

637
01:15:27,487 --> 01:15:30,400
I used to be in the same unit
with your father.

638
01:15:32,391 --> 01:15:35,167
We fought together.

639
01:15:36,763 --> 01:15:37,798
You know my father?

640
01:15:38,397 --> 01:15:39,205
Yes.

641
01:15:40,666 --> 01:15:42,839
Your father won't be coming home.

642
01:15:43,736 --> 01:15:46,945
He sacrificed his life on
the southwest border front.

643
01:15:51,878 --> 01:15:53,516
Are you telling the truth?

644
01:15:55,381 --> 01:15:59,124
I'm a soldier.
I always tell the truth.

645
01:16:01,788 --> 01:16:04,735
You would have found out sooner or later.

646
01:16:04,924 --> 01:16:08,394
I don't want to hide the truth from you.

647
01:16:11,831 --> 01:16:14,744
Why are you still alive?

648
01:16:28,781 --> 01:16:30,954
Tuan, wait for me.

649
01:16:39,125 --> 01:16:39,933
Wait!

650
01:16:51,971 --> 01:16:53,416
Please don't tell my Grandpa.

651
01:16:53,940 --> 01:16:54,918
Promise me.

652
01:16:55,041 --> 01:16:56,714
Ok, I promise.

653
01:16:57,877 --> 01:16:59,447
There he is!

654
01:17:00,880 --> 01:17:01,585
Who's here?

655
01:17:03,883 --> 01:17:05,191
Tuan's home.

656
01:17:26,439 --> 01:17:28,282
Tuan, come see your Grandpa.

657
01:17:33,112 --> 01:17:36,116
Tuan, where have you been?

658
01:17:38,184 --> 01:17:41,165
I went to bring my father home
to see you.

659
01:17:54,500 --> 01:17:55,740
Dad!

660
01:17:59,939 --> 01:18:01,612
Have something to drink.

661
01:18:08,180 --> 01:18:09,318
How is he?

662
01:18:09,448 --> 01:18:10,859
Very weak now.

663
01:18:11,450 --> 01:18:11,689
Dad...

664
01:18:13,152 --> 01:18:14,096
You're home.

665
01:18:16,389 --> 01:18:18,369
He won't last much longer.

666
01:18:19,892 --> 01:18:20,802
How sad.

667
01:19:18,884 --> 01:19:19,726
Mom...

668
01:20:08,100 --> 01:20:15,951
Duyen, stay calm.

669
01:20:25,184 --> 01:20:27,824
He couldn't be here,
but we're here instead.

670
01:20:28,420 --> 01:20:29,797
I hid the truth from you, Father.

671
01:20:29,888 --> 01:20:30,958
Calm down, calm down.

672
01:20:34,459 --> 01:20:36,268
Father, this isn't right!

673
01:20:36,428 --> 01:20:37,964
Duyen, I'm a good friend
of your husband.

674
01:20:38,096 --> 01:20:39,666
I've wronged you, Father.

675
01:20:40,899 --> 01:20:43,675
No, you've done nothing wrong.

676
01:20:46,905 --> 01:20:49,977
Let your father pass in peace.

677
01:22:19,765 --> 01:22:22,439
Duyen, I've been waiting for
you and Tuan.

678
01:22:22,834 --> 01:22:23,471
Thank you.

679
01:22:26,004 --> 01:22:27,608
He'll be in my first-year class.

680
01:22:27,806 --> 01:22:29,683
Would you like to be
in my class, Tuan?

681
01:22:29,841 --> 01:22:30,148
Yes.

682
01:22:32,878 --> 01:22:33,618
Don't worry, he'll be fine.

683
01:22:34,279 --> 01:22:35,917
Do you know where Khang is now?

684
01:22:37,950 --> 01:22:42,228
He told me he'd write
when he was settled.

685
01:22:43,588 --> 01:22:45,295
He misses this school a lot.

686
01:22:45,557 --> 01:22:48,094
When you have his address,
let me know.

687
01:22:49,361 --> 01:22:49,930
Okay.

688
01:22:52,130 --> 01:22:53,973
I'd like to thank him.

689
01:22:55,567 --> 01:22:57,638
I know he'd like to hear from you.

690
01:22:57,903 --> 01:23:06,288
Time to go to class now.

691
01:23:07,913 --> 01:23:09,517
Go on, sweetheart
