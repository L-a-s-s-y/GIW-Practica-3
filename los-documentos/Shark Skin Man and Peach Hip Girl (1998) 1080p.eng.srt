1
00:00:10,219 --> 00:00:13,806
It was just after my daughter
Amy's third birthday.

2
00:00:13,973 --> 00:00:17,518
She ran up to me,
threw her arms around my legs,

3
00:00:17,685 --> 00:00:19,228
looked up and said...

4
00:00:19,228 --> 00:00:22,189
"Daddy, I've loved you
for four thousand years!"

5
00:00:22,356 --> 00:00:24,316
I gazed into her little face.

6
00:00:24,316 --> 00:00:27,361
A deep happiness enwrapped
my heart, body and soul.

Toshiko...

9
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:46,839
Toshiko!

10
00:00:49,633 --> 00:00:50,843
Want to drive!?

11
00:00:52,219 --> 00:00:54,138
You got your license, right?

12
00:00:57,558 --> 00:00:59,018
Tomorrow you have to.

13
00:01:00,644 --> 00:01:01,937
I'm quitting the hotel.

14
00:01:03,647 --> 00:01:04,773
You should, too...

15
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:07,651
...when you've saved some money.

16
00:01:09,486 --> 00:01:10,738
That guy's weird.

Original Story by
Minetaro Mochizuki

18
00:01:50,652 --> 00:01:51,653
Is something wrong?

19
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:58,327
Could you check this again, please!?

20
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,330
I'll go make a call.

21
00:02:15,761 --> 00:02:17,763
Hotel Symphonia...

22
00:02:22,059 --> 00:02:23,519
Your savings! Gone!

23
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:27,189
No, they're not gone.

24
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:30,651
I got a good stock tip,
so I invested them for you.

25
00:02:31,235 --> 00:02:33,946
You can't just take
someone's savings like that...

26
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:37,866
Hello?

27
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:39,743
Hello?

28
00:03:14,987 --> 00:03:16,155
Hey, you!

29
00:03:23,954 --> 00:03:25,164
Money, please.

30
00:03:26,498 --> 00:03:27,875
Money, please.

31
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:30,210
Money, please.

Two years later

35
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:10,162
My dad quit the mob,
but he couldn't quit the drugs.

36
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:14,875
With a regular job,
he had more money to buy them.

37
00:06:16,335 --> 00:06:18,712
He hid it from us,
but he was high all the time.

38
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:22,924
He got caught twice,
but he had the money for bail.

39
00:06:24,343 --> 00:06:28,513
Me and my mom and my brother
always used to say...

40
00:06:28,722 --> 00:06:31,516
"Why don't you just stay in jail
for a while?"

41
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:37,022
He'd be eating ice cream
all the time.

42
00:06:38,065 --> 00:06:39,358
You know, that white stuff...

43
00:06:39,941 --> 00:06:41,777
Like the ice shavings!?

44
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:45,447
Yeah, the stuff with that kind of
hard ice in it.

45
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:48,658
Our fridge was full of it.

46
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:50,744
I mean, obvious or what?

47
00:06:51,495 --> 00:06:54,956
When I was in middle school
I was sniffing glue in the living room...

48
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:58,919
...when the cops raided our house.
I ran upstairs...

49
00:06:59,169 --> 00:07:03,298
...to hide my stuff in the closet.

50
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:08,220
But when I opened the closet,
all these bags of white powder...

51
00:07:09,096 --> 00:07:11,932
...came falling out
where my dad had hidden them.

52
00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:13,892
I had it tough.

53
00:07:15,102 --> 00:07:18,313
When my old man was caught,
it was in the paper.

54
00:07:18,563 --> 00:07:20,857
At school someone pasted the article
in the class paper.

55
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:24,778
People made fun of me,
and I hadn't done anything.

56
00:07:25,487 --> 00:07:27,614
Adults, too. Not just kids.

57
00:07:28,907 --> 00:07:30,450
Adults made fun of you?

58
00:07:32,119 --> 00:07:35,580
We'd go to someone's house,
and I couldn't go in.

59
00:07:36,665 --> 00:07:39,751
"Do you know what your dad did?"
their parents would say.

60
00:07:40,502 --> 00:07:44,798
"I didn't do it, you jerk!" I'd say.
"You know your son sniffs glue?"

61
00:07:45,173 --> 00:07:48,885
When I see that in the papers,
I think of the kids...

62
00:07:50,137 --> 00:07:52,264
They're the ones who suffer.

63
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:57,144
If kids came to my place,
they'd think the juice was spiked.

64
00:07:57,644 --> 00:08:00,605
As if you'd put speed
in orange juice!

65
00:08:02,691 --> 00:08:06,611
When I was a kid,
I thought a tattoo...

66
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:10,365
...would appear on your back
when you grew up.

67
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:16,246
I really believed that!

68
00:09:12,344 --> 00:09:15,472
What are you doing, Toshiko?
Did you sleep in?

69
00:09:17,933 --> 00:09:19,017
Yes. I'm sorry.

70
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:24,898
I stayed up reading...

71
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,401
Yes.

72
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:32,781
I'm sorry. I'll be right there.

73
00:09:36,326 --> 00:09:37,369
What!

74
00:09:39,871 --> 00:09:40,872
Nothing.

75
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:44,334
You saw it, didn't you?

76
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:49,089
So what?

77
00:09:50,549 --> 00:09:52,300
Nothing.

78
00:09:53,552 --> 00:09:54,719
It's enamel.

79
00:09:56,263 --> 00:09:57,222
Enamel?

80
00:09:57,806 --> 00:09:59,641
Advertising posters like this.

81
00:10:00,058 --> 00:10:01,851
They're called "enamel posters".

82
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:06,189
You collect them?

83
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:09,276
- What's wrong with that?
- Nothing at all!

84
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:12,779
It's great.

85
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:16,908
I think they're very nice.

86
00:10:19,411 --> 00:10:22,247
You have to come way out here
in the country to find them.

87
00:10:22,497 --> 00:10:23,665
I know.

88
00:10:24,207 --> 00:10:26,751
You've got hobbies, don't you?

89
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:27,961
Yes!

90
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:31,256
If you see one of these, stop.

91
00:10:34,718 --> 00:10:36,553
Posters...

92
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:40,181
- You are laughing at me...
- No, sir!

93
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:42,767
You think you can find them
anywhere, don't you.

94
00:10:43,852 --> 00:10:44,936
Don't you!

95
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:48,023
No...

96
00:10:48,565 --> 00:10:51,484
I think my grandmother
might have one...

97
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:53,486
What kind?

98
00:10:53,737 --> 00:10:57,574
An Ohmura Kon poster
for Oronamin C.

99
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:19,971
-You're...
- Sorry!

100
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:23,558
- What are you apologizing for?
- Nothing.

101
00:11:24,643 --> 00:11:27,520
There are about ten types
that I know of.

102
00:11:29,064 --> 00:11:30,899
The Ohmura Kon posters...

103
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:35,945
Are they the good ones!?

104
00:11:36,446 --> 00:11:37,989
This one's normal.

105
00:11:38,156 --> 00:11:42,952
The ones with "Golden Bat" or
"Attack Number I!" are rare.

106
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:46,039
Rare...

107
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:48,792
Rare.

108
00:12:51,563 --> 00:12:52,981
Toshiko, where are you going?

109
00:12:53,356 --> 00:12:54,566
Post office.

110
00:12:55,692 --> 00:12:57,736
Say, "I'm going
to the post office."

111
00:12:58,403 --> 00:13:00,697
I'm going to the post office, Uncle.

112
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:02,657
Not "Uncle"...

113
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:04,784
Manager.

114
00:13:42,113 --> 00:13:43,573
Where's the guy who threw this?

115
00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:49,496
Looks like he's gone.

116
00:13:50,038 --> 00:13:52,415
- There were two girls there...
- Girls?

117
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:54,584
Is that all you think about?

118
00:13:54,876 --> 00:13:57,754
Why did Mr Tanuki go on ahead?

119
00:13:58,087 --> 00:14:00,131
Well, I don't know.

120
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:24,906
Just bump him, Sorimachi.

121
00:14:25,156 --> 00:14:28,076
May I! Die! Die!

122
00:14:28,243 --> 00:14:30,203
Sorimachi... he's getting away.

123
00:15:11,578 --> 00:15:13,413
It's freezing in here!

124
00:15:14,789 --> 00:15:17,250
Doesn't this damn heater work?

125
00:15:20,253 --> 00:15:22,046
Aren't you cold?!

126
00:15:30,513 --> 00:15:31,973
That's her phone...

127
00:15:45,737 --> 00:15:46,988
What the hell?

128
00:16:01,836 --> 00:16:02,879
Toshiko...

129
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:05,048
Are you at the post office yet?

130
00:16:19,896 --> 00:16:22,482
What's going on? Where are you?

131
00:16:22,774 --> 00:16:24,400
Get off my back!

132
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:30,073
I cut him off...

133
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:54,389
Hotel Symphonia. Mail.

134
00:17:38,266 --> 00:17:39,559
Are you all right?

135
00:17:40,685 --> 00:17:41,811
The poster.

136
00:17:45,773 --> 00:17:46,816
Bring it.

137
00:18:09,464 --> 00:18:11,716
Why didn't you wait?

138
00:18:13,885 --> 00:18:15,261
What are you doing here?

139
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:18,681
The old man told me to come
if I wasn't doing anything.

140
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:22,643
Then do something! Well?

141
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:27,440
Don't ignore me!

142
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:31,778
And... heave!

143
00:18:32,737 --> 00:18:33,946
Here's Tani...

144
00:19:24,789 --> 00:19:26,040
Excuse me...

145
00:19:28,084 --> 00:19:29,085
You still here?

146
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:20,678
Um... can I use the toilet?

147
00:20:21,971 --> 00:20:22,930
Please.

148
00:21:16,359 --> 00:21:17,443
Sawada here...

149
00:22:32,685 --> 00:22:34,687
You stink. Get out of here.

150
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:42,653
You stink! Get lost!

151
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:46,240
No!
Stop!

152
00:23:03,549 --> 00:23:05,217
Man, I'm lucky!

153
00:23:11,265 --> 00:23:12,683
This is a great jeep!

154
00:23:13,684 --> 00:23:15,269
Lovely. Well nice.

155
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:18,397
Really nice.

156
00:23:19,106 --> 00:23:23,611
Come on! Mr Tanuki's gone in ahead.
He'll be mad again!

157
00:23:24,779 --> 00:23:26,864
So what? I like this jeep.

158
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:28,491
Just come on.

159
00:23:28,949 --> 00:23:31,535
You can drive it later. Let's go!

160
00:23:31,702 --> 00:23:32,953
Nice...

161
00:23:32,953 --> 00:23:33,913
Well nice.

162
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,831
Tani-san, come on!

163
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:38,501
This is great!

164
00:23:38,709 --> 00:23:41,921
We're going! Come on, Tani-san!

165
00:23:42,296 --> 00:23:44,340
- Let's go!
- Nice.

166
00:23:44,507 --> 00:23:46,592
That guy pisses me off.

167
00:23:48,844 --> 00:23:51,680
What can you do!?
He's the boss's son.

168
00:23:51,889 --> 00:23:54,100
So why are we here!?

169
00:23:55,351 --> 00:23:57,645
Insurance. In case they need us.

170
00:23:58,437 --> 00:24:00,022
"Insurance"?!

171
00:24:49,572 --> 00:24:52,116
Didn't you teach Samehada anything?!

172
00:24:55,077 --> 00:24:56,120
Sorry...

173
00:24:56,704 --> 00:24:58,539
- Mitsuru...
- What!?

174
00:24:59,123 --> 00:25:00,791
You shouldn't talk like that.

175
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:02,084
Like what?

176
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:05,379
You don't tell people to stay back
just because they stink.

177
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:08,340
- Go to hell.
- You go to hell!

178
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:09,467
Sorimachi...

179
00:25:10,259 --> 00:25:11,385
Sorry.

180
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:14,638
Smell anything?

181
00:25:24,482 --> 00:25:25,691
Yep.

182
00:25:26,734 --> 00:25:29,945
Shampoo, rinse and
a woman on the rag.

183
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:43,042
You in there!?

184
00:25:44,043 --> 00:25:45,211
It's locked.

185
00:25:45,878 --> 00:25:47,171
Hold it here...

186
00:25:48,339 --> 00:25:49,465
No, here.

187
00:25:50,716 --> 00:25:51,675
Here?

188
00:26:07,733 --> 00:26:08,984
What are you doing!?

189
00:26:09,985 --> 00:26:11,487
What are you doing!?

190
00:26:11,654 --> 00:26:15,199
Mitsuru says there should be
a smell from the ground.

191
00:26:15,491 --> 00:26:17,576
Well, he's not
under the ground there!

192
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:18,827
I guess not.

193
00:26:22,456 --> 00:26:23,832
So what are you doing?

194
00:26:24,166 --> 00:26:25,793
- No, what are you doing?
- Over there.

195
00:26:27,086 --> 00:26:30,256
Turn your walkie-talkie on!

196
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:48,941
Get going.

197
00:26:51,026 --> 00:26:51,986
Well?

198
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:55,322
- Hey!
- What?!

199
00:26:55,322 --> 00:26:57,241
- The woman!
- What about her?

200
00:27:09,878 --> 00:27:11,338
What happened here!?

201
00:27:16,176 --> 00:27:19,430
Out the back! Who said
go down in the basement?!

202
00:27:20,222 --> 00:27:21,599
You did!

203
00:27:26,061 --> 00:27:27,938
What's the woman he's with like?

204
00:27:28,772 --> 00:27:29,898
I don't know.

205
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:32,943
I think you do...

206
00:27:35,738 --> 00:27:37,740
- What?
- Piss off!

207
00:27:45,748 --> 00:27:46,749
Asahina!

208
00:27:47,333 --> 00:27:48,751
Which way did he go?

209
00:27:50,294 --> 00:27:51,420
I'll ask...

210
00:28:06,852 --> 00:28:09,229
- What?
- I got shot!

211
00:28:11,649 --> 00:28:13,525
Samehada's that way.

212
00:28:22,034 --> 00:28:23,285
Where's Samehada?

213
00:28:25,621 --> 00:28:26,789
Where's Samehada?!

214
00:28:53,982 --> 00:28:55,317
Can we go this way!?

215
00:28:56,819 --> 00:28:59,446
I came here when I was small.

216
00:30:04,428 --> 00:30:05,763
Can you hear me?

217
00:30:06,221 --> 00:30:07,389
Mitsuru, can you hear me?

218
00:30:08,432 --> 00:30:09,391
What!

219
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:11,351
You know what.

220
00:30:13,562 --> 00:30:15,022
Ah, Mr Tanuki...

221
00:30:17,107 --> 00:30:19,109
You know who it is.

222
00:30:19,568 --> 00:30:20,611
Idiot!

223
00:30:28,035 --> 00:30:29,203
What's going on?

224
00:30:30,788 --> 00:30:32,372
Who's an idiot?

225
00:30:33,165 --> 00:30:35,250
Don't talk to me like that.

226
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:37,127
Where's Samehada?

227
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:39,713
He's crossed the river.
I can't smell him.

228
00:30:40,464 --> 00:30:42,007
You can't smell him?

229
00:30:42,633 --> 00:30:46,220
He crossed with a woman.
Why can't you do that?

230
00:30:47,596 --> 00:30:48,889
I'll get wet!

231
00:30:50,891 --> 00:30:52,100
So what?

232
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:55,354
I hate water.

233
00:30:56,980 --> 00:31:00,442
You hate water? You're not a kid!

234
00:31:01,193 --> 00:31:03,821
I'm a kid with pubic hair.

235
00:31:05,364 --> 00:31:10,160
Pubic hair? We're not here
to talk about pubic hair.

236
00:31:11,411 --> 00:31:15,666
These clothes are bullet-proof.

237
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:20,754
It's not your regular leather.

238
00:31:21,421 --> 00:31:25,384
There's iron in them. If they
lose shape, it never comes back.

239
00:31:27,177 --> 00:31:28,512
What are you talking about?

240
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:31,265
Are you out of your mind?

241
00:31:33,141 --> 00:31:34,768
Are you out of your mind?

242
00:31:40,107 --> 00:31:41,650
Well? Are you?

243
00:31:48,657 --> 00:31:49,741
Samehada...

244
00:31:51,368 --> 00:31:52,411
The money...

245
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:54,621
Where's the money!?

246
00:31:55,497 --> 00:31:57,332
It's only 100 million yen!

247
00:31:58,625 --> 00:32:02,045
You know what happens
if you steal syndicate money?

248
00:32:03,046 --> 00:32:04,715
That's why I'm running.

249
00:32:05,132 --> 00:32:06,842
You think you can run?

250
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:09,595
Why do you think I'm running!?

251
00:32:10,178 --> 00:32:12,014
Watch your mouth, son!

252
00:32:13,348 --> 00:32:14,766
Where's Sorimachi?

253
00:32:16,643 --> 00:32:17,644
Why?

254
00:32:18,645 --> 00:32:20,230
I want to ask him something.

255
00:32:21,690 --> 00:32:22,691
What!

256
00:32:23,609 --> 00:32:25,193
Not you, asshole!

257
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,237
Stop calling me that.

258
00:32:28,363 --> 00:32:29,740
Are you all listening?

259
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:32,659
Hey!

260
00:32:32,993 --> 00:32:35,120
- What?
- Do you all know?

261
00:32:36,371 --> 00:32:37,372
Know what?

262
00:32:38,206 --> 00:32:39,666
About your toupee!

263
00:32:40,334 --> 00:32:41,460
Samehada!!

264
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:49,718
This is starting to be fun!

265
00:32:50,552 --> 00:32:52,054
Ow! Damn it!

266
00:33:35,555 --> 00:33:37,849
Why do you want to come
with me!?

267
00:33:39,768 --> 00:33:40,894
It's my birthday.

268
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:44,690
Today's my birthday.

269
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:48,694
What's that got to do with me?

270
00:33:49,486 --> 00:33:50,946
I ran away.

271
00:34:03,208 --> 00:34:06,128
I don't know
what's going to happen...

272
00:34:35,282 --> 00:34:36,533
Hey, what's the matter?

273
00:34:39,578 --> 00:34:40,537
Huh?

274
00:34:42,831 --> 00:34:47,127
I never want to go back there!

275
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:49,046
Huh?

276
00:35:00,515 --> 00:35:01,558
Then...

277
00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:08,315
you don't have to go back there.

278
00:35:14,821 --> 00:35:16,156
Don't cry.

279
00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:21,745
It'll be OK.

280
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:32,839
Let's go.

281
00:35:35,675 --> 00:35:37,135
You don't have to go back.

282
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:39,304
It's true.

283
00:35:39,763 --> 00:35:41,098
How do you know?

284
00:35:41,348 --> 00:35:42,766
Maruo told me.

285
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:44,851
- It's yoga...
- Yeah.

286
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:46,019
That's crap.

287
00:35:46,394 --> 00:35:47,813
It's true!

288
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:52,025
It was "Yoga in One Month"
or "Yoga Friend" or something...

289
00:35:52,526 --> 00:35:54,569
...but there was a book like that
right next to the body.

290
00:35:54,945 --> 00:35:56,279
"Yoga Friend"?

291
00:35:57,614 --> 00:35:59,282
I'm not sure of the name.

292
00:35:59,449 --> 00:36:01,827
That doesn't sound right.

293
00:36:02,119 --> 00:36:04,746
But the guy's neck was broken.

294
00:36:05,455 --> 00:36:06,706
"Yoga Friend"?

295
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:09,459
I said I'm not sure of the name.

296
00:36:09,626 --> 00:36:11,795
I've never seen a book
with a name like that.

297
00:36:12,045 --> 00:36:13,839
Who cares about the name!

298
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:16,967
What was the other name?

299
00:36:17,968 --> 00:36:19,511
"Yoga In One Month".

300
00:36:24,224 --> 00:36:25,267
What!

301
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:27,686
There could be a book like that...

302
00:36:28,562 --> 00:36:31,648
Who cares
what the name of the book was!

303
00:36:31,648 --> 00:36:33,608
I don't understand.

304
00:36:33,859 --> 00:36:35,402
-You don't?
- No.

305
00:36:35,944 --> 00:36:37,571
I tried to keep it simple...

306
00:36:37,737 --> 00:36:40,532
Look, if I don't understand,
I don't understand!

307
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:43,368
Put it in more concrete terms.

308
00:36:43,535 --> 00:36:46,705
I'm lost at sea here
'cause of all those English terms.

309
00:36:46,705 --> 00:36:50,542
OK, I'll tell you again. Listen.

310
00:36:50,542 --> 00:36:51,710
Go on.

311
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:54,087
OK then, the soul...

312
00:36:54,713 --> 00:36:57,591
Well, the body, first...

313
00:36:57,799 --> 00:37:00,719
By the body you mean a kid...

314
00:37:01,344 --> 00:37:02,387
That's right.

315
00:37:02,679 --> 00:37:05,015
So the soul comes to the body...

316
00:37:10,103 --> 00:37:14,232
...when it leaves the woman.

317
00:37:14,983 --> 00:37:19,529
So you're saying
abortion's not necessarily bad?

318
00:37:19,779 --> 00:37:21,573
No, I think it's a bad thing.

319
00:37:21,573 --> 00:37:22,657
I do, too.

320
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:28,079
Mr Sawada told me not to
worry about it, so I felt better.

321
00:37:29,372 --> 00:37:31,666
I told you not to talk to him!

322
00:37:32,125 --> 00:37:33,710
Yeah, but...

323
00:37:36,546 --> 00:37:39,716
I feel better when I talk to him
about my problems.

324
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:43,261
Bring your problems to me!

325
00:37:47,349 --> 00:37:49,601
Yeah!?
Hey, Dog...

326
00:37:50,435 --> 00:37:52,812
Dog, get the door.

327
00:37:58,610 --> 00:37:59,694
Coming!

328
00:38:05,325 --> 00:38:06,785
Good work, guys.

329
00:38:08,995 --> 00:38:11,081
I told you not to put that
by the heater.

330
00:38:11,373 --> 00:38:12,540
Oh, sorry.

331
00:38:18,421 --> 00:38:20,173
- Is there food for us, too!?
- Yes

332
00:38:20,882 --> 00:38:23,009
We'll heat it up for you.

333
00:38:23,802 --> 00:38:26,554
Dog, put this in the microwave.

334
00:38:30,475 --> 00:38:31,685
Want to sit down?

335
00:38:32,769 --> 00:38:34,104
It's cold out there.

336
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:36,690
We've got to eat and run.

337
00:38:37,023 --> 00:38:38,275
It's hard, isn't it.

338
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:40,402
Damn right.

339
00:38:40,902 --> 00:38:43,697
We should be out looking, too..

340
00:38:45,407 --> 00:38:47,492
What's this? Wild boar?

341
00:38:47,492 --> 00:38:48,451
Eh?

342
00:38:48,868 --> 00:38:49,828
What's that!?

343
00:38:50,036 --> 00:38:51,454
I'm not sure.

344
00:38:51,454 --> 00:38:52,706
It's the wrong color.

345
00:39:40,587 --> 00:39:41,713
Who are you!?

346
00:39:43,214 --> 00:39:44,799
Who are you, I said!

347
00:39:45,175 --> 00:39:48,094
Yamada! Yamada! Yamada!

348
00:39:48,303 --> 00:39:51,181
You were watching me, Yamada.

349
00:39:54,893 --> 00:39:55,935
You were.

350
00:39:57,645 --> 00:39:58,813
Weren't you!

351
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:05,111
What!

352
00:40:05,904 --> 00:40:06,946
I hate you!

353
00:40:19,042 --> 00:40:20,377
What are you doing!?

354
00:40:21,878 --> 00:40:23,838
Everyone had left
by the time I got the bandage on.

355
00:40:24,339 --> 00:40:27,509
When we find Samehada,
we'll call you. Take a break.

356
00:40:27,717 --> 00:40:29,386
Don't tell me what to do!

357
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:31,429
Sorry.

358
00:40:32,555 --> 00:40:34,015
You don't need all that!

359
00:40:36,810 --> 00:40:38,269
I'm going to work on it.

360
00:40:40,522 --> 00:40:41,773
It'll look great.

361
00:40:49,114 --> 00:40:51,282
I don't know
if we can believe them or not...

362
00:40:54,702 --> 00:40:56,830
Who are you giving orders to?

363
00:40:59,916 --> 00:41:04,462
Samehada's your buddy, isn't he?
Find him and kill him!

364
00:41:09,050 --> 00:41:10,260
What's that look?

365
00:41:12,429 --> 00:41:13,430
Him?

366
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:19,811
Sorry.

367
00:41:21,813 --> 00:41:24,524
I hate him! I hate him!

368
00:41:35,618 --> 00:41:36,703
A man?

369
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:39,914
That's right, Yamada.

370
00:41:41,249 --> 00:41:43,710
Toshiko found herself a man
right under my very nose!

371
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:47,464
Listen to me, Yamada!

372
00:41:49,549 --> 00:41:50,967
She took off on me!

373
00:41:51,426 --> 00:41:55,138
She found a man and ran away,
Yamada!

374
00:41:56,681 --> 00:41:57,849
Yamada...

375
00:41:58,933 --> 00:42:00,935
This is bad. Bad!

376
00:42:05,356 --> 00:42:06,524
What do you think?

377
00:42:07,859 --> 00:42:09,652
It's beautiful.

378
00:42:10,236 --> 00:42:12,113
But listen...

379
00:42:17,911 --> 00:42:18,870
What!

380
00:42:22,874 --> 00:42:25,376
- Your ex-wife...
-You're the one that killed her.

381
00:42:34,802 --> 00:42:36,095
She was ugly.

382
00:42:37,138 --> 00:42:38,181
Stop it!

383
00:42:41,309 --> 00:42:42,185
She played around.

384
00:42:42,185 --> 00:42:43,394
- Don't say it.
- I will.

385
00:42:45,063 --> 00:42:46,856
A dog. A real dog.

386
00:42:49,192 --> 00:42:50,944
Ears like this.

387
00:42:51,569 --> 00:42:53,029
A dog. A dog.

388
00:42:53,488 --> 00:42:54,781
Your wife was ugly.

389
00:42:55,031 --> 00:42:56,574
She fucked a dog.

390
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:59,160
No mistake this time!

391
00:43:01,287 --> 00:43:03,957
I won't kill Toshiko.

392
00:43:04,958 --> 00:43:08,628
I've know her since
she was this little.

393
00:43:09,087 --> 00:43:10,797
It's the man I want you to kill.

394
00:43:12,507 --> 00:43:13,675
Proof?

395
00:43:14,259 --> 00:43:15,969
I don't have any proof.

396
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:20,014
But it was a man
who answered her phone.

397
00:43:21,474 --> 00:43:23,893
That means she's with a man!

398
00:43:25,478 --> 00:43:27,939
Maybe she just ran away.

399
00:43:29,816 --> 00:43:33,736
Even if that's all it is,
bring her back...

400
00:43:34,696 --> 00:43:36,114
OK, Yamada?

401
00:43:39,659 --> 00:43:41,953
I took two days off work for this!

402
00:43:42,328 --> 00:43:44,956
Bastard! Bastard!

403
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:46,916
Don't do that, Yamada!

404
00:43:47,959 --> 00:43:50,253
I told you not to phone me
except for work!

405
00:43:50,587 --> 00:43:52,547
You know what my work is,
don't you!

406
00:43:52,797 --> 00:43:55,758
Bastard! Bastard! Bastard!

407
00:43:56,217 --> 00:43:59,095
Yes! I want you to kill the man
Toshiko took off with!

408
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:04,976
The charge is the same whether
there's a man involved or not.

409
00:44:05,143 --> 00:44:08,396
Bastard! Bastard! Bastard!

410
00:44:10,064 --> 00:44:11,024
OK.

411
00:44:14,277 --> 00:44:15,320
I'll pay.

412
00:44:22,493 --> 00:44:25,163
You're a nice man.

413
00:44:28,416 --> 00:44:29,751
Cut that out!

414
00:44:30,627 --> 00:44:31,628
Stop.

415
00:45:42,615 --> 00:45:43,700
What the hell?

416
00:45:55,753 --> 00:45:56,713
What's this?

417
00:46:04,429 --> 00:46:05,388
Damn thing.

418
00:47:07,408 --> 00:47:08,367
I...

419
00:47:12,205 --> 00:47:15,500
I never want to go back
to that place!

420
00:48:08,052 --> 00:48:10,096
What does Mr Tanuki say?

421
00:48:10,555 --> 00:48:13,474
He says he's going to look
by himself.

422
00:48:15,184 --> 00:48:17,395
You know what I think,
Mr Sawada?

423
00:48:18,396 --> 00:48:21,983
There hasn't been any one woman
in the time we've been after him.

424
00:48:23,484 --> 00:48:24,777
Yeah, you're right.

425
00:48:24,944 --> 00:48:29,866
He hired those two
and did it with them all night.

426
00:48:32,535 --> 00:48:34,203
Maybe like Mr Tanuki says...

427
00:48:34,495 --> 00:48:36,956
...the long-haired hotel girl
is the one.

428
00:48:37,498 --> 00:48:39,125
Maybe she's local.

429
00:48:40,877 --> 00:48:41,961
Local girl?

430
00:50:12,551 --> 00:50:15,638
It looks like Samehada
and a girl with glasses were here.

431
00:50:16,639 --> 00:50:19,684
"It looks like" doesn't sound
like an answer.

432
00:50:20,017 --> 00:50:23,729
The hotel clerk recognized
pictures of them.

433
00:50:24,730 --> 00:50:25,773
Who's he?

434
00:50:26,649 --> 00:50:27,900
No connection.

435
00:50:28,609 --> 00:50:29,610
Mr Tanuki!

436
00:50:31,112 --> 00:50:32,947
The local yakuza says...

437
00:50:33,572 --> 00:50:35,157
...they're headed this way.

438
00:50:35,783 --> 00:50:36,742
This way?

439
00:50:37,118 --> 00:50:39,495
No, this way, I thought...

440
00:50:39,704 --> 00:50:41,497
No, this way, I think.

441
00:50:42,289 --> 00:50:44,083
This way? Which way?

442
00:51:15,031 --> 00:51:17,033
Hello, CQ? CQ?

443
00:51:17,366 --> 00:51:20,745
This is JI2CRX, Yamada.

444
00:51:21,078 --> 00:51:24,749
Y-A-M-A-D-A.

445
00:51:24,999 --> 00:51:27,043
"Yamada". It's Yamada!

446
00:51:27,835 --> 00:51:31,255
Come back,
anyone in Area I or Area 2...

447
00:51:32,173 --> 00:51:34,341
Looking for a man and a woman...

448
00:51:34,759 --> 00:51:37,845
...in a black '8 Corvette Stingray.

449
00:51:38,554 --> 00:51:41,223
A couple in a black '81 'Vette.

450
00:51:41,390 --> 00:51:42,933
Come back, please.

451
00:51:54,945 --> 00:51:56,363
Something like that.

452
00:51:56,530 --> 00:51:57,615
And then?

453
00:51:57,615 --> 00:51:59,158
Then the scene changes...

454
00:52:00,076 --> 00:52:02,661
...to a farm. I'm taking a walk.

455
00:52:04,246 --> 00:52:09,335
I've got a cute flowered dress on.

456
00:52:11,796 --> 00:52:13,005
Not in Japan...

457
00:52:14,090 --> 00:52:17,176
Old Europe, maybe...

458
00:52:21,305 --> 00:52:26,185
Suddenly a propellered plane
lands in front of me.

459
00:52:28,062 --> 00:52:33,109
A sharp-looking man gets out.

460
00:52:35,486 --> 00:52:38,322
We go into a barn...

461
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:42,660
...and take a nap there.

462
00:52:57,675 --> 00:52:58,968
Then what happens?

463
00:52:59,844 --> 00:53:01,428
After that...

464
00:53:02,304 --> 00:53:07,810
...there's food of some kind,
and music...

465
00:53:09,311 --> 00:53:10,938
We all drink wine.

466
00:53:12,022 --> 00:53:17,027
It might be my wedding.

467
00:53:17,945 --> 00:53:19,446
To the guy in the plane?

468
00:53:20,489 --> 00:53:24,743
More like a man who lives nearby...

469
00:53:25,327 --> 00:53:27,121
What happened to the guy
in the plane!?

470
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:30,499
He's gone.

471
00:53:37,089 --> 00:53:38,048
But...

472
00:53:39,008 --> 00:53:42,428
...all through the wedding
he's on my mind...

473
00:53:44,471 --> 00:53:47,975
I keep thinking about him...

474
00:53:48,934 --> 00:53:50,144
And then what?

475
00:53:51,478 --> 00:53:54,523
Then I wake up.

476
00:54:03,073 --> 00:54:04,283
Sorry.

477
00:54:08,412 --> 00:54:11,081
I'm sorry, but I'm getting
out of the business, too.

478
00:54:11,457 --> 00:54:13,876
There's never an end to it.

479
00:54:14,835 --> 00:54:16,545
Why don't you let him go!

480
00:54:17,129 --> 00:54:19,256
If you know what's going on,
help me on this.

481
00:54:19,798 --> 00:54:22,259
The point is, that I catch him.

482
00:54:23,802 --> 00:54:28,641
If I'm not the one who does,
I'm in trouble.

483
00:54:32,561 --> 00:54:36,232
So if you want me to keep my mouth
shut about that other thing...

484
00:55:36,959 --> 00:55:38,377
Buy me some juice, OK?

485
00:55:38,544 --> 00:55:39,920
Juice? Just juice?

486
00:55:41,130 --> 00:55:42,298
I'll be right back.

487
00:57:18,268 --> 00:57:21,438
Out of Service

488
00:58:43,645 --> 00:58:44,646
That hurts!

489
00:58:57,743 --> 00:58:58,744
That hurts.

490
00:59:00,829 --> 00:59:01,872
I hate that!

491
00:59:11,381 --> 00:59:12,508
Who are you!?

492
00:59:14,676 --> 00:59:15,677
Yamada.

493
00:59:16,637 --> 00:59:18,555
- Yamada?
- Yamada.

494
00:59:21,099 --> 00:59:22,893
Your nose is bleeding, Yamada.

495
00:59:40,994 --> 00:59:42,162
What!

496
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:44,748
I like you.

497
00:59:55,133 --> 00:59:56,218
I like you.

498
00:59:58,512 --> 01:00:00,138
What's with you?

499
01:00:06,144 --> 01:00:07,229
I like you.

500
01:00:12,859 --> 01:00:15,112
I don't know who hired you, but...

501
01:00:15,445 --> 01:00:16,363
I'm sorry.

502
01:00:16,363 --> 01:00:18,407
- You'd better keep your day job.
- Yes.

503
01:00:19,616 --> 01:00:21,118
- Turn around.
- Yes.

504
01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:24,913
Sing something.

505
01:00:25,205 --> 01:00:26,415
"Donna Donna."

506
01:00:27,249 --> 01:00:31,962
"On a wagon bound for market...

507
01:00:32,212 --> 01:00:36,300
there's a calf with a mournful eye."

508
01:00:37,009 --> 01:00:39,011
- Come out when the song's over.
- Yes.

509
01:00:39,803 --> 01:00:44,474
"High above him, there's a swallow...

510
01:00:45,434 --> 01:00:49,313
... winging swiftly through the sky.

511
01:00:50,355 --> 01:00:58,905
How the winds are laughing,
they laugh with all their might...

512
01:00:59,948 --> 01:01:02,618
...laugh and laugh
the whole day through..."

513
01:01:43,325 --> 01:01:45,285
- What's that?
- Some retard.

514
01:02:09,643 --> 01:02:11,561
Ow! I'm bleeding!

515
01:02:12,896 --> 01:02:15,440
What happened?!

516
01:02:15,607 --> 01:02:17,275
Ow! It hurts! Ow!

517
01:02:17,442 --> 01:02:19,319
What hurts? What happened?!

518
01:02:19,319 --> 01:02:21,238
- It's burning!!
- What is?!

519
01:02:21,405 --> 01:02:22,364
What!

520
01:02:23,615 --> 01:02:25,117
What do you mean, Yamada!

521
01:02:26,535 --> 01:02:27,744
You're coming home?

522
01:02:28,912 --> 01:02:30,330
Why, Yamada?

523
01:02:31,248 --> 01:02:32,207
Huh?

524
01:02:33,542 --> 01:02:34,501
What!

525
01:02:35,585 --> 01:02:38,839
You've failed? No, Yamada!

526
01:02:39,589 --> 01:02:41,133
That was Toshiko's man, right?

527
01:02:42,676 --> 01:02:44,010
Wasn't that the man?!

528
01:02:44,636 --> 01:02:45,804
I'm coming back.

529
01:02:48,306 --> 01:02:49,433
I'm sorry.

530
01:02:51,143 --> 01:02:52,394
I'm coming back.

531
01:02:52,561 --> 01:02:56,606
Why!? I don't understand.

532
01:02:57,733 --> 01:02:58,859
I'm sorry.

533
01:02:59,693 --> 01:03:01,611
I know you're sorry.

534
01:03:02,279 --> 01:03:04,239
But you've got to kill him, Yamada!

535
01:03:04,614 --> 01:03:07,743
I've filed the marriage forms
for Toshiko and me!

536
01:03:08,952 --> 01:03:10,036
You are...

537
01:03:11,288 --> 01:03:12,539
...a bit weird.

538
01:03:14,332 --> 01:03:15,667
There's something...

539
01:03:17,544 --> 01:03:19,880
Anyway, I'm coming home.

540
01:03:20,464 --> 01:03:22,132
What do you mean, Yamada!

541
01:03:23,967 --> 01:03:26,052
Hey, are you...

542
01:03:30,807 --> 01:03:32,017
Are you in love?!

543
01:03:32,309 --> 01:03:33,477
I'm sorry.

544
01:03:39,983 --> 01:03:41,276
Can I come home!?

545
01:03:43,320 --> 01:03:44,613
You are in love.

546
01:03:45,405 --> 01:03:47,449
- I'm coming home.
- OK, OK.

547
01:03:47,866 --> 01:03:50,494
Forget about the guy.

548
01:03:50,786 --> 01:03:53,371
Just bring Toshiko back.

549
01:03:54,623 --> 01:03:56,708
I can't do that.

550
01:03:57,959 --> 01:03:59,503
I can't do that to him.

551
01:03:59,753 --> 01:04:01,129
Yes, you can.

552
01:04:02,005 --> 01:04:03,757
I'll pay you like I said I would.

553
01:04:04,591 --> 01:04:05,926
You need money, don't you?

554
01:04:06,218 --> 01:04:08,220
You don't have any, do you...

555
01:04:18,313 --> 01:04:19,439
Is this OK?

556
01:04:19,731 --> 01:04:24,194
Yeah.
We can depend on this old guy.

557
01:04:26,863 --> 01:04:29,074
Whenever I need help,
I come to Shiota.

558
01:04:29,616 --> 01:04:30,784
It's fine.

559
01:04:34,746 --> 01:04:35,872
Just fine.

560
01:04:42,587 --> 01:04:43,588
Careful...

561
01:04:45,632 --> 01:04:46,842
What's this?

562
01:04:54,432 --> 01:04:55,600
We're here.

563
01:05:14,536 --> 01:05:16,580
This is a mess, Samehada.

564
01:05:17,539 --> 01:05:20,292
The whole syndicate is out
for your blood.

565
01:05:21,251 --> 01:05:22,752
It's fun, though.

566
01:05:23,336 --> 01:05:27,215
I'd like to try and
rip them off once, myself.

567
01:05:28,174 --> 01:05:30,260
Since the guys at the top
found out...

568
01:05:30,886 --> 01:05:32,888
...the old man with the wig
is in big trouble.

569
01:05:33,054 --> 01:05:34,180
Anyway...

570
01:05:34,347 --> 01:05:35,390
Who are you!?

571
01:05:39,269 --> 01:05:40,562
Momoijiri Toshiko.

572
01:05:40,729 --> 01:05:41,980
I don't mean your name.

573
01:05:41,980 --> 01:05:43,481
- She's with me.
- With you?

574
01:05:44,733 --> 01:05:45,692
I'm with him.

575
01:05:50,697 --> 01:05:51,698
Oh, man!

576
01:05:53,658 --> 01:05:56,536
Well, what should we do?

577
01:05:59,372 --> 01:06:01,958
First, get out of those
filthy clothes.

578
01:06:08,590 --> 01:06:09,883
That's a nice smile.

579
01:06:40,789 --> 01:06:42,165
What do you think?

580
01:07:02,894 --> 01:07:04,479
It's a bit cold, though.

581
01:07:15,824 --> 01:07:17,409
I liked the last one better, though.

582
01:07:29,629 --> 01:07:32,298
Tickets, maps, exchange rates,
everything.

583
01:07:33,008 --> 01:07:34,134
Do the contacts hurt!?

584
01:07:34,300 --> 01:07:35,343
They're fine.

585
01:07:35,969 --> 01:07:37,137
You're beautiful...

586
01:07:38,888 --> 01:07:43,768
That's sharkskin. One of a kind.

587
01:07:44,269 --> 01:07:45,895
Now, that's you!

588
01:07:47,022 --> 01:07:48,440
What do you think? Cool, huh?

589
01:07:49,232 --> 01:07:50,233
Super cool!

590
01:07:50,442 --> 01:07:51,943
Super cool!

591
01:07:53,987 --> 01:07:55,530
You're a great couple.

592
01:07:56,448 --> 01:07:57,574
We'd better hurry.

593
01:07:58,366 --> 01:07:59,325
Thanks.

594
01:08:00,410 --> 01:08:02,704
- What?
- The money, first.

595
01:08:02,954 --> 01:08:04,080
But I paid you...

596
01:08:04,664 --> 01:08:07,751
That's just for you.
You've got to pay for her. too.

597
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:10,128
How much?

598
01:08:11,129 --> 01:08:12,380
Double.

599
01:08:12,630 --> 01:08:13,923
- Double?
- Double?

600
01:08:14,507 --> 01:08:16,593
It costs money to do up a woman.

601
01:08:20,263 --> 01:08:21,598
Listen, Samehada...

602
01:08:22,182 --> 01:08:25,685
...even I heard
you had a woman with you.

603
01:08:26,102 --> 01:08:29,230
That was a pretty dramatic escape,
but I'm on the line here, too.

604
01:08:30,982 --> 01:08:32,233
I'll send you the money.

605
01:08:32,233 --> 01:08:33,777
- Now.
- Now?

606
01:08:33,777 --> 01:08:36,654
- Now?
- Now. In cash.

607
01:08:37,197 --> 01:08:38,281
I can't!

608
01:08:38,281 --> 01:08:40,450
Well, forget it, then.

609
01:08:41,868 --> 01:08:43,286
Listen, Samehada...

610
01:08:45,288 --> 01:08:48,291
Your ass is on the line here,
but so is mine.

611
01:08:49,042 --> 01:08:52,629
What happens if they find out
I helped you?

612
01:08:53,296 --> 01:08:56,007
I've got to drop everything
and get out of here!

613
01:08:57,634 --> 01:08:59,219
The movers told me...

614
01:09:00,053 --> 01:09:02,680
...I've got too much stuff
and they can't take any chairs.

615
01:09:04,307 --> 01:09:07,185
I'm a chair collector!
Chairs are my life!

616
01:09:07,393 --> 01:09:08,770
Don't you understand?

617
01:09:09,270 --> 01:09:12,774
I'm going to leave them behind
and run! I'll need money!

618
01:09:13,441 --> 01:09:16,444
You understand that, don't you?
I'll need money!

619
01:09:20,073 --> 01:09:23,660
I'll be back in two hours.
You watch her.

620
01:10:09,914 --> 01:10:11,332
What are you doing!?

621
01:10:16,671 --> 01:10:17,964
What do you think?

622
01:10:18,423 --> 01:10:21,009
I think it's best
not to get involved.

623
01:10:21,176 --> 01:10:22,260
Why?

624
01:10:23,178 --> 01:10:26,431
Never get mixed up
in man-woman problems.

625
01:10:26,639 --> 01:10:27,640
Why not?

626
01:10:29,601 --> 01:10:31,978
My wife's just run off on me.

627
01:10:35,190 --> 01:10:38,234
With a young guy who came around
selling fire extinguishers.

628
01:10:42,906 --> 01:10:45,617
I'm sure
he was a good-looking guy.

629
01:10:47,744 --> 01:10:52,373
If he'd only been a jerk like you!
Then she wouldn't have gone.

630
01:11:53,184 --> 01:11:54,143
Yes.

631
01:11:57,605 --> 01:11:58,606
I'm sorry.

632
01:11:58,982 --> 01:12:01,317
I've got Samehada's girl.

633
01:12:02,944 --> 01:12:04,529
I should be there...

634
01:12:05,113 --> 01:12:07,865
...in about 90 minutes.

635
01:12:08,283 --> 01:12:09,325
Then...huh?

636
01:12:19,210 --> 01:12:20,420
Where's the girl?

637
01:12:22,839 --> 01:12:24,507
Sawada took her.

638
01:12:28,177 --> 01:12:29,345
Get out of here.

639
01:12:32,557 --> 01:12:34,392
Get going, now!

640
01:12:35,768 --> 01:12:39,814
I told him you'd be gone a while.
He believed me and took the girl.

641
01:12:53,661 --> 01:12:54,704
Where!?

642
01:12:56,456 --> 01:12:57,874
If 1 tell you, you'll follow him.

643
01:13:03,254 --> 01:13:05,548
OK, I did a deal with Sawada.
I'm sorry.

644
01:13:07,550 --> 01:13:09,135
But this saves your neck.

645
01:13:11,179 --> 01:13:12,555
You don't need to be like that.

646
01:13:17,101 --> 01:13:19,562
You don't even know her well.

647
01:13:21,606 --> 01:13:23,733
She doesn't mean anything to you.

648
01:13:25,026 --> 01:13:26,027
It's true!

649
01:14:05,274 --> 01:14:06,275
Sorry.

650
01:14:30,591 --> 01:14:31,759
An Oronamin C poster...

651
01:14:31,926 --> 01:14:33,845
...with a "Golden Bat"
or "Attack Number I!" on it...

652
01:14:33,845 --> 01:14:35,263
From a gum machine?

653
01:14:35,638 --> 01:14:37,765
- Yeah, a gum machine.
- One of those 20-yen prizes?

654
01:14:37,932 --> 01:14:39,934
Not those. They're 200 yen now.

655
01:14:40,101 --> 01:14:42,770
The Masked Rider figures.
They're great.

656
01:14:42,979 --> 01:14:45,481
What's the cop got to do with that?

657
01:14:45,857 --> 01:14:48,901
It's embarrassing, though,
being there with all those kids.

658
01:14:48,901 --> 01:14:50,153
What about the cop!?

659
01:14:50,528 --> 01:14:53,364
There was this guy
always hanging around the arcade.

660
01:14:53,531 --> 01:14:54,824
And he was a cop!?

661
01:14:54,824 --> 01:14:57,243
Yeah. I figured him
for some kind of weirdo...

662
01:14:57,577 --> 01:14:59,871
...but then I found out
he collected these things too.

663
01:14:59,871 --> 01:15:01,622
We started trading,
like, at McDonalds...

664
01:15:01,914 --> 01:15:03,791
...Then I found out.
He's the guy who told me.

665
01:15:03,958 --> 01:15:04,917
"Yoga Friend"...

666
01:15:05,501 --> 01:15:06,669
"Yoga Friend"?

667
01:15:07,003 --> 01:15:08,671
The book next to the body.

668
01:15:09,505 --> 01:15:10,756
That was "Yoga Castle".

669
01:15:10,965 --> 01:15:12,967
"Castle"? Like in "castle"?

670
01:15:13,384 --> 01:15:14,385
Yeah.

671
01:15:15,178 --> 01:15:16,387
Where can we get it!

672
01:15:42,705 --> 01:15:43,789
Shit!

673
01:16:12,360 --> 01:16:13,528
Are you OK?

674
01:16:15,571 --> 01:16:17,031
I can't do it. Damn!

675
01:17:22,138 --> 01:17:23,723
Sawada? Sawada!?

676
01:17:23,973 --> 01:17:25,933
Don't you even know
who Sawada is!?

677
01:17:25,933 --> 01:17:27,435
Fuka-chan...

678
01:17:27,727 --> 01:17:28,894
Who's Fuka-chan?

679
01:17:29,228 --> 01:17:31,689
- Huh?
- He was Samehada's buddy!

680
01:17:51,292 --> 01:17:53,044
What did he say?

681
01:17:55,379 --> 01:17:59,508
I just got shit because
you and Sawada were buddies!

682
01:18:02,595 --> 01:18:04,180
Where is Mr Sawada?

683
01:18:05,431 --> 01:18:06,891
He disappeared.

684
01:18:09,226 --> 01:18:10,936
Maybe he's hiding somewhere...

685
01:18:17,652 --> 01:18:18,736
Hey!

686
01:18:18,736 --> 01:18:19,737
Gonna piss.

687
01:18:20,655 --> 01:18:23,407
Watch your manners
or I'll get mad!

688
01:18:24,492 --> 01:18:26,243
I don't want to go inside.

689
01:18:53,604 --> 01:18:55,773
Where's the girl?

690
01:18:58,275 --> 01:18:59,568
Where is she?

691
01:19:00,111 --> 01:19:01,195
Don't shoot!

692
01:19:02,154 --> 01:19:03,406
Where is she?!

693
01:19:04,448 --> 01:19:07,493
She and Sawada disappeared.

694
01:19:13,999 --> 01:19:15,042
Where's the money!?

695
01:20:06,719 --> 01:20:08,220
Toshiko! I've been worried!

696
01:20:12,099 --> 01:20:13,476
Samehada!

697
01:20:14,477 --> 01:20:15,770
Samehada!

698
01:20:26,238 --> 01:20:27,198
Yamada...

699
01:20:28,449 --> 01:20:29,450
Yamada!

700
01:20:34,330 --> 01:20:35,372
You can go.

701
01:20:36,040 --> 01:20:36,999
Go.

702
01:20:39,794 --> 01:20:40,836
I hate you.

703
01:20:41,670 --> 01:20:44,256
You've got to work
tomorrow morning. Go home.

704
01:20:44,965 --> 01:20:46,133
Go home, damn it!

705
01:20:49,512 --> 01:20:51,472
My bank account...

706
01:20:52,014 --> 01:20:54,225
I know that, damn it! Go home!

707
01:20:54,725 --> 01:20:55,768
Go home, I said!

708
01:21:01,857 --> 01:21:03,442
Go home! Get lost!

709
01:21:07,112 --> 01:21:08,531
Scram you idiot.

710
01:21:15,287 --> 01:21:16,622
Let's go somewhere.

711
01:21:17,039 --> 01:21:19,542
I know where we can go.

712
01:22:22,897 --> 01:22:24,315
He's out cold.

713
01:22:27,568 --> 01:22:28,527
Chair.

714
01:22:31,405 --> 01:22:32,406
Chair.

715
01:22:46,337 --> 01:22:47,504
Not for you.

716
01:23:13,364 --> 01:23:16,450
If you don't talk, you die.

717
01:23:18,243 --> 01:23:23,374
Mr Tanuki... there's no money
in his briefcase.

718
01:23:27,169 --> 01:23:28,337
Samehada...

719
01:23:30,965 --> 01:23:32,091
Samehada...

720
01:23:35,302 --> 01:23:36,387
The bat.

721
01:23:51,235 --> 01:23:52,236
Sis...

722
01:23:54,238 --> 01:23:56,407
I'll be in my room.

723
01:24:01,412 --> 01:24:02,371
The bat.

724
01:24:38,741 --> 01:24:40,075
Would you like some coffee?

725
01:24:40,784 --> 01:24:42,119
Yeah, good idea...

726
01:25:47,810 --> 01:25:51,563
This happened before...
when I was young.

727
01:25:51,563 --> 01:25:54,733
A silly woman ran out on me.

728
01:25:55,275 --> 01:25:56,401
Keep still...

729
01:25:58,112 --> 01:25:59,738
We'll be married, soon.

730
01:26:01,490 --> 01:26:02,825
Keep still, I said!

731
01:26:10,999 --> 01:26:12,459
Keep still, you idiot!

732
01:26:26,849 --> 01:26:27,891
Keep still!

733
01:27:18,567 --> 01:27:19,526
Huh?

734
01:28:03,195 --> 01:28:04,196
Shit!

735
01:28:33,809 --> 01:28:36,103
What are those bastards doing
in my hotel?!

736
01:28:36,728 --> 01:28:38,814
Don't move! I'll spank you!

737
01:28:40,357 --> 01:28:41,900
Let me get a flashlight...

738
01:28:42,943 --> 01:28:44,152
Don't move, I said!

739
01:28:46,488 --> 01:28:48,282
Don't touch me, you pervert!

740
01:28:48,282 --> 01:28:50,033
What!

741
01:28:53,620 --> 01:28:55,789
Yeah, like that. Keep still.

742
01:28:57,833 --> 01:28:58,959
Don't move.

743
01:31:06,920 --> 01:31:08,380
An ambulance...

744
01:31:12,551 --> 01:31:14,970
Call an ambulance, please.

745
01:34:56,816 --> 01:34:58,401
This is good-bye, Samehada.

746
01:35:03,239 --> 01:35:08,328
If you'd followed Sorimachi's plan
and took the money together...

747
01:35:10,163 --> 01:35:12,957
...none of this would have happened.

748
01:35:16,044 --> 01:35:18,421
The money was supposed
to come to me.

749
01:35:22,634 --> 01:35:24,010
Where is it?

750
01:35:35,605 --> 01:35:36,815
What's so funny?

751
01:35:39,901 --> 01:35:41,319
Your face.

752
01:35:47,909 --> 01:35:49,077
Drop the gun.

753
01:36:00,255 --> 01:36:01,506
Drop the gun!

754
01:36:06,136 --> 01:36:08,096
Don't try anything stupid, Tanuki.

755
01:36:10,181 --> 01:36:11,391
Don't you either.

756
01:37:00,273 --> 01:37:02,942
Get away from her, Four-eyes!

757
01:37:03,735 --> 01:37:04,736
"Four-eyes"?

758
01:37:05,737 --> 01:37:06,696
Samehada!

759
01:37:44,275 --> 01:37:45,401
Samehada!

760
01:37:46,528 --> 01:37:47,654
Samehada!

761
01:37:49,072 --> 01:37:50,240
Samehada!

762
01:38:21,396 --> 01:38:22,856
I remember now...

763
01:38:24,399 --> 01:38:25,650
Money, please.

764
01:38:27,610 --> 01:38:28,945
Money, please.

765
01:38:31,155 --> 01:38:32,448
Money, please.

766
01:38:38,246 --> 01:38:41,791
Someone call an ambulance, please!

767
01:38:44,794 --> 01:38:46,129
Don't move, please.

768
01:38:48,172 --> 01:38:49,424
Don't move, please.

769
01:38:51,467 --> 01:38:52,468
But...

770
01:38:54,012 --> 01:38:55,471
Don't move, please.

771
01:38:56,431 --> 01:38:57,640
Don't move, please.

772
01:39:07,150 --> 01:39:08,526
A little more, please.

773
01:39:09,485 --> 01:39:10,820
A little more, please.

774
01:39:15,199 --> 01:39:16,868
There should still be more.

775
01:39:51,069 --> 01:39:52,654
Thank you very much.

776
01:39:54,989 --> 01:39:56,616
Thank you very much.

777
01:40:54,215 --> 01:40:55,341
This is it?

778
01:41:01,097 --> 01:41:03,725
Sawada and God

779
01:41:04,809 --> 01:41:06,602
I keep having this dream...

780
01:41:11,816 --> 01:41:16,946
They sit me in this chair.
In front if me is God, talking.

781
01:41:18,906 --> 01:41:20,074
God?

782
01:41:21,159 --> 01:41:22,660
I think that's what it was.

783
01:41:24,454 --> 01:41:25,580
You believe in God?

784
01:41:28,124 --> 01:41:29,083
Yeah.

785
01:41:36,507 --> 01:41:40,470
"Help them both",
he keeps repeating.

786
01:41:42,388 --> 01:41:44,682
"Help them both"?

787
01:41:44,932 --> 01:41:51,898
Yeah. I wonder if that means
you and Samehada...

788
01:42:01,574 --> 01:42:04,118
- Um...
- You can run if you want.

789
01:42:10,583 --> 01:42:11,834
Now's the chance.

790
01:42:13,961 --> 01:42:15,671
I'm not cut out for this job.

791
01:42:20,051 --> 01:42:21,719
It's a good chance to get out.

792
01:42:27,266 --> 01:42:28,559
So get going.

793
01:43:21,946 --> 01:43:22,905
Thanks.

No?

813
01:45:16,644 --> 01:45:18,354
Have we got a place
to get changed?

814
01:45:18,354 --> 01:45:19,397
Yes.

815
01:45:20,022 --> 01:45:22,275
Don't worry.
I'll get rid of everything.

816

I'm hungry.

817
01:45:34,578 --> 01:45:36,831
Want to stop somewhere
after we change?

Yes.

819

If we go in like this,
the old lady'll have a heart attack.

The old lady...

821
01:45:42,169 --> 01:45:44,171

in blood.

822
