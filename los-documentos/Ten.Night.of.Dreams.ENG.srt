1
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:42,790
Your tea, sir.

2
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:46,560
Thank you.

3
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:48,830
Bean-jam wafers, too.

4
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,730
That's wonderful.

5
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:53,160
There are still some left.

6
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:57,910
I'l serve them to
your guests tomorrow.

7
00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:00,100
That would be waste.

8
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:03,610
Candied peanuts will
be more than enough.

9
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,520
I did enjoy
last week's meeting.

10
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:11,820
Everyone had such
interesting opinions.

11
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:18,490
Your riddle,
"Ten Nights of Dreams."

12
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:22,820
When d'you think it'll be solved?

13
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:29,130
A hundred years hence.

14
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:35,500
A hundred years?

15
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:42,110
Il have to be reborn
if I'm to see it.

20
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:45,610
Thank you very much.

21
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,080
Your noodles.

22
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:07,860
Another goldfish has died.

23
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:10,160
May I get another?

24
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:13,170
Of course, if it's dead.

25
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:16,410
But they'll only die on you.

26
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:22,450
Itll die anyway,
so buy another breed.

27
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:25,910
You never even look at them.

28
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,750
Thank you.

29
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:31,720
Are you alright, sir?

30
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,750
I'm so sorry.

31
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:38,060
Notat all. In fact,
it makes me look more dashing.

32
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:41,300
Thank you, sir.

33
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:48,880
Goldfish for sale

34
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:52,170
Tsugumi.

35
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:53,110
Yes?

36
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,480
What time is it?

37
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,450
If's almost noon.

38
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,990
That's strange,
I'm not at all hungry.

39
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:07,490
Hunger is never requir,
it's not clockwork.

40
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:10,660
What did I eat this morning?

41
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:12,160
Chilled Tofu.

42
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:14,870
What about last night?

43
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,370
Grilled Tofu with Miso.

44
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:18,800
What's for dinner?

45
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:20,440
Sesame Tofu.

46
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:24,510
You may complain
Tofu is all I feed you.

47
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,250
But sesame Tofu isn't
made from soy.

48
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:32,180
It's ground sesame
mixed with potato starch.

49
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:49,800
How careless,
I left my wallet here.

50
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:53,770
Here itis, sir.

51
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:55,070
Good.

52
00:04:56,580 --> 00:05:00,850
You're very thin,
you need to put on weight.

53
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:03,580
What are you now,
16 or 17?

54
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:11,250
} Master Hyakken,
is there money in writing novels?

55
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:14,760
I earn well,
without working hard.

56
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:19,900
By the way Madame,
what time is it?

57
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:24,710
It's just past ten.

58
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:26,270
I see.

59
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:31,640
Stop that, you pervert!

60
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:36,010
You're incorrigible.
-A pervert, eh?

61
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:18,230
How much is it, now?

62
00:06:26,170 --> 00:06:29,430
I thought I'd written
over thirty pages...

63
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,040
No, I don't mean that.

64
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:37,580
How many years
have we been together?

65
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:45,350
Dear?

66
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:49,160
Darling.

67
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,290
Has it been fifty years?

68
00:06:56,630 --> 00:06:58,500
A hundred years?

69
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:01,330
A hundred years?

70
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:21,320
Despite the brevity,
I thank you for everything.

71
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:26,460
The time has come for me to
take my leave.

72
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:30,030
You're leaving?

73
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:34,360
Well, as of tomorrow,
there's no more work for me.

74
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:41,480
And being here alone,
with you, frightens me.

75
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:44,940
I mean, after all,
you are a man.

76
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,770
You have always
cherished me.

77
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:27,060
And yes,
I've been happy.

78
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:36,730
Recently, you seem to
have lost weight.

79
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:43,860
Your stomach is weak,
so you must only drink boiled water.

80
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:48,170
I've left you some stomach pills
in the buffet.

81
00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:54,380
Be sure to take one pill
each morning.

82
00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:01,850
Tofu is good for your digestion.

83
00:09:04,090 --> 00:09:07,500
You can have it boiled,
or broiled.

84
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:11,530
It goes well with plain rice, too.

85
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:15,800
Have it boiled,
to go with your sake.

86
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:26,250
Are you going away?

87
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:33,020
You always knew I would,
from the very beginning.

88
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:35,650
No, this is the first time.

89
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:40,230
You've cherished me for
a hundred years.

90
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,660
Can you now wait another
undred for me?

91
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:51,970
As you know, the sun rises.

92
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:56,840
And then it sets.

93
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:05,290
The big red sun travels
from east to west.

94
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:10,220
Every single day
it completes its journey.

95
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:17,100
So can you not wait for me?

96
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:22,100
It matters not to me...

97
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:30,170
...that you may find another
to love when I am gone.

98
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:35,280
And with that...

99
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,680
...my time to die has come.

100
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:47,760
Bury me with the goldfish.

101
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:43,780
Time is going backwards.

102
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:02,070
A hundred Jars must have
already gone by.

A Second Night of Dreams

00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:36,400
Directed by Kon Ichikawa

106
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:44,050
My dream was as this:

107
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:08,860
You are a Samurai.

108
00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:32,550
As such, }
you are open to spiritual awakening.

109
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:43,620
You came to sit in meditation,
didn't you?

110
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:03,230
You're taking too long
to be spiritually awoken.

111
00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:06,250
So you cannot be a Samurai.

112
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:21,830
You are but the dregs
of mankind.

113
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:30,670
Does that make you angry?

114
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:43,880
If you feel chagrin,
show me evidence of your enlightenment.

115
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:16,620
I shall attain spiritual realization.

116
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:25,830
It will come upon me
before the clock strikes yet again.

117
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:34,170
In exchange for enlightenment,
I shall gain a monk's tonsure.

118
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:57,460
But to realize that,
I must attain enlightenment.

119
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:12,640
Should I fail, I shall die.

120
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:32,830
I could not live with
such a burden of shame.

121
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:53,770
Emptiness

122
00:18:55,620 --> 00:19:00,490
Emptiness? Nothing?
Damn monk!

123
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:19,340
Empty nothing,
vacuum nothing.

124
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:48,900
What a hateful wretch!
I shall have his head!

125
00:19:57,010 --> 00:20:01,380
Nothing.
You must awaken to emptiness.

126
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:22,940
Alas, my time is up.

127
00:20:57,610 --> 00:21:00,010
I must die!

128
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:31,230
I cannot do it.

129
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:54,930
I cannot even pierce my flesh...

130
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:15,750
Enlightenment is upon you.

131
00:22:24,330 --> 00:22:29,290

A Third Night of Dreams

134
00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:12,370
I'had a dream...

135
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:15,840
A Third Night of Dreams;
My dream was about...

136
00:23:16,010 --> 00:23:17,500
What was it?

137
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:21,410
Written & Directed by
Takashi Shimizu

138
00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:25,380
The iceman!

139
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,220
Here's the iceman!

140
00:23:27,390 --> 00:23:28,750
Don't run in the house!

141
00:23:30,430 --> 00:23:32,760
Little Junichi will wake.

142
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:37,990
Don't go near the saw.

143
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:43,540
Don't get so irritated.
They're only children.

144
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:51,510
Don't run in the house!

145
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:57,780
Weren't you like that
as a child?

146
00:23:57,950 --> 00:24:00,150
Why do I get so irritated?

147
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:04,320
It's easy to blame
the kids when I can't write.

148
00:24:04,490 --> 00:24:06,360
You had brothers and sisters,
didn't you?

149
00:24:07,330 --> 00:24:11,200
They say I had five brothers
and three sisters.

150
00:24:12,270 --> 00:24:15,570
That's right
I was a child once.

151
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:17,240
But it's so strange.

152
00:24:17,410 --> 00:24:21,070
I have no memories of
my childhood.

153
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,740
I wonder what you were like.

154
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:28,340
A sensitive boy
with a delicate stomach.

155
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:31,980
I was the last. They adopted
me out when I was born.

156
00:24:36,990 --> 00:24:38,890
Not again.

157
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:43,800
Aiko,
play with your Dad.

158
00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:48,500
Children!
I said don't wake the baby.

159
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:51,540
How did I grow up?

160
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:58,100
They're like a different species.

161
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:07,380
I'm not confident fo
have this child.

162
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:14,760
I'm sorry, dear.

163
00:25:16,770 --> 00:25:18,430
1 had that dream again...

164
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:28,000
Junichi finally got off to sleep.

165
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:32,370
Dear?

166
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:38,280
What's wrong?
You look so serious.

167
00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:41,620
No, it's nothing...

168
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:44,220
Are you alright?

169
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:52,530
Don't say that.
Did you have that same nightmare?

170
00:25:56,840 --> 00:26:00,140
You know,
this is my sixth child.

171
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:05,910
Kyoko miscarried their
first baby ten years ago.

172
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:08,570
With the 2nd, she had a breakdown
and attempted suicide.

173
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:16,410
I'm sure this baby
will be fine.

174
00:26:18,630 --> 00:26:20,320
I just feel confident.

175
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:24,300
When I was a girl...

176
00:26:25,370 --> 00:26:30,460
...many stone statues lined
the mountain path near my house.

177
00:26:31,310 --> 00:26:33,900
I used to play there.

178
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:36,440
One day...

179
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:44,880
I broke off one of the
heads by accident.

180
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:49,320
I was so scared.

181
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:54,330
I never played there
after that day.

182
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:56,890
Why tell me that now?

183
00:26:57,470 --> 00:27:00,090
When I lost the first baby,

184
00:27:00,970 --> 00:27:06,410
honest, I kept dreaming about
that headless Jizo statue.

185
00:27:07,910 --> 00:27:09,000
A nightmare?

186
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:10,170
Yes.

187
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:15,740
The other day, I dreamt
it again after a long time.

188
00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:20,020
That's a very strange dream.

189
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:25,490
I broke the head off
the sixth statue.

190
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:29,090
But I putit back in place.

191
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:39,810
really think this one is
our first child reborn.

192
00:27:44,110 --> 00:27:47,050
Sorry, Junichi.
I woke you up.

193
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:49,240
Excuse me, dear.

194
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:52,210
I'l take him.
You get some rest.

195
00:27:58,190 --> 00:28:01,030
The baby I was carrying
stopped crying.

196
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:05,630
I felt so sure that he's
my son.

197
00:28:06,230 --> 00:28:09,000
But it was so mysterious...

198
00:28:12,010 --> 00:28:14,700
When did you lose your sight?

199
00:28:17,850 --> 00:28:20,440
Along time ago.

200
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:26,080
We're near the rice paddy now.

201
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:27,960
How did you know?

202
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:30,550
I hear the herons crying.

203
00:28:31,330 --> 00:28:32,450
Herons?

204
00:28:37,930 --> 00:28:41,330
I can't go on carrying
this monster.

205
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:43,340
I must dump him somewhere.

206
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:46,470
Why are you laughing?

207
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:56,810
Am I heavy, Daddy?

208
00:28:57,750 --> 00:28:58,740
No, you're not.

209
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:00,320
Soon, I'l get heavier.

210
00:29:01,090 --> 00:29:02,610
What do you mean?

211
00:29:02,790 --> 00:29:04,590
You see those statues lined up?

212
00:29:05,230 --> 00:29:06,220
Statues?

213
00:29:19,670 --> 00:29:21,670
No need to count them.

214
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:24,410
There are six of them.

215
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:26,170
You know?

216
00:29:26,610 --> 00:29:29,310
Wait a minute.
There are seven.

217
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:32,280
But one of them will break.

218
00:29:32,690 --> 00:29:34,350
What are you saying?

219
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:41,820
Want to leave?
Let's go.

220
00:29:43,430 --> 00:29:44,660
By all means.

221
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,470
You'll know as we
get further along.

222
00:29:50,570 --> 00:29:52,540
It was a night like this.

223
00:29:53,310 --> 00:29:54,370
What was?

224
00:29:54,810 --> 00:29:57,280
You know what I'm talking about.

225
00:29:59,310 --> 00:30:01,580
Somehow, I felt I knew it

226
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:03,150
Surely, it was a night like this.

227
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:05,840
Yes, if I keep going,
ll find th ih

228
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:09,620
But my instinct tells me
I shouldn't know.

229
00:30:10,430 --> 00:30:15,160
I should never discover it
so I must hurry and dump the child.

230
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:18,200
I must be free from him
as soon as possible.

231
00:30:23,710 --> 00:30:25,400
Yes, here.

232
00:30:25,570 --> 00:30:27,560
You knew it all along.

233
00:30:33,850 --> 00:30:38,340
1 had nowhere fo
run to any more.

234
00:30:44,630 --> 00:30:47,530
It was the summer of 1880.

235
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:49,990
The Year of the Dragon,
wasn't it?

236
00:30:50,430 --> 00:30:53,030
That was when you killed me.

237
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:59,840
Twenty eight years ago,
wasn'tit?

238
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:03,270
Yes, a dark night
Just like this.

239
00:31:04,350 --> 00:31:07,140
I killed a child who was
unable fo resist.

240
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:14,390
Now I remember.

241
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:16,920
I'm a murderer.

242
00:31:25,830 --> 00:31:28,430
Yes,
that summer I was thirteen.

243
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:32,200
That day at that hour,
1 killed myself.

244
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:35,000
...and I was but a child!

245
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:44,580
I knew there were six of them.

246
00:31:44,950 --> 00:31:47,750
One of them will be broken.

247
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:55,790
Soseki's sixth child, Shinroku,
was born December 17, 1908.

248
00:31:55,960 --> 00:32:00,760
But, two years later, his seventh child,
Hinako, died suddenly at age one.

249
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:02,400
The reason why is
unknown to this day.

250
00:32:07,710 --> 00:32:10,440
A Third Night of Dreams,
My dream was as this.

251
00:32:16,850 --> 00:32:18,180
Ill write it anyway.

252
00:32:21,690 --> 00:32:25,220
I am carrying my six year
old son on my back.

253
00:32:25,390 --> 00:32:26,920
He is surely my own son...

254
00:32:28,130 --> 00:32:30,360
The baby finally got off to sleep.

255
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:36,030
Dear?

256
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:40,030
What's wrong?
You look so serious.

257
00:33:03,130 --> 00:33:05,400
Mr Soseki Natsume,

258
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:10,800
thank you very much
for coming for a lecture.

259
00:33:11,770 --> 00:33:16,870
I will meet you at the station.
Haruka Hyuga

260
00:33:22,150 --> 00:33:26,920
A Fourth Night of Dreams
Directed by Atsushi Shimizu

261
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,550
She's not here.

262
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:50,770
I don't suppose you are
Miss Haruka, are you?

263
00:33:51,150 --> 00:33:54,740
I'm a married woman,
Il have you know.

264
00:34:04,530 --> 00:34:07,930
"Mr Soseki,
Urgent business, can't make it.

265
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:13,530
"Please take the bus to the
lecture hall. Haruka"

266
00:34:18,410 --> 00:34:22,710
Fourteen, so far

267
00:34:27,850 --> 00:34:31,790
Excuse me.
What time do you depart?

268
00:34:43,730 --> 00:34:46,000
"4th district, Omokagebashi..."

269
00:34:46,830 --> 00:34:49,100
"From Haruka Hyuga"

270
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:53,400
Hyuga's daughter was
spirited away as a child.

271
00:34:55,810 --> 00:34:58,870
And not just her,
all the children disappeared.

272
00:34:59,050 --> 00:35:02,410
And who was it
who took them away?

273
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:06,310
Strange.
Haven't we seen you before?

274
00:35:06,850 --> 00:35:07,950
No, never.

275
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:16,560
Next stop is public hall.

276
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:19,290
Ifyou wish alight,
please press the buzzer.

277
00:35:29,110 --> 00:35:33,480
Public hall?
I can't see it.

278
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:38,780
"4th district, Omokagebashi..."

279
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:41,350
That can't be right!

280
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:50,530
There are children everywhere.

281
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:55,200
Keep watching.
It will turn into a snake.

282
00:35:55,370 --> 00:35:59,140
"Keep watching.
It will turn into a snake."

283
00:35:59,410 --> 00:36:01,770
A snake?
That's ridiculous.

284
00:36:04,050 --> 00:36:06,880
That's mine.
Give it back.

285
00:36:13,490 --> 00:36:15,750
Hey, wait.

286
00:36:16,190 --> 00:36:17,280
Come back.

287
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:24,030
"Keep walching.
It will turn into a snake."

288
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:31,800
"Keep walching.
It will turn into a snake."

289
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:43,710
This can't be right.

290
00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:46,950
Spiited away?"
Silly superstition.

291
00:36:57,970 --> 00:36:58,960
What?

292
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,230
That's me.

293
00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:08,300
Welcome Soseki

294
00:37:08,610 --> 00:37:10,870
Public alert!

295
00:37:11,050 --> 00:37:14,680
A photo-chemical smog
Is currently upon us.

296
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:27,550
Blood...

297
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:33,860
It's all coming back.
I think this was where...

298
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:38,100
...I came to regain my health.

299
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:45,440
Soseki!

300
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:47,740
You're late.

301
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:11,030
What's going on here?

302
00:38:11,610 --> 00:38:13,870
What's my connection with here?

303
00:38:17,710 --> 00:38:18,940
Soseki.

304
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:21,310
Soseki.

305
00:38:26,150 --> 00:38:29,450
Soseki,
are you feeling better now?

306
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:37,920
Can you come on the
excursion tomorrow?

307
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:42,630
No.
I don't think I can.

308
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:55,980
Right.
You have a fever.

309
00:39:00,350 --> 00:39:03,020
But it's no fun without you.

310
00:39:07,530 --> 00:39:08,960
Now I remember.

311
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:15,500
Soseki, this way.

312
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:33,720
Why?

313
00:39:35,260 --> 00:39:37,620
How did I forget it all?

314
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:00,700
Missing Child
Kiyoko Kurata

315
00:40:01,350 --> 00:40:03,340
Missing child
Shotaro Shiranui

316
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:08,890
Bring back our daughter
Haruka Hyuga

317
00:40:13,430 --> 00:40:16,020
Flight 607
still missing

318
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:17,670
This is bizarre...

319
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:44,890
Hey!

320
00:40:50,130 --> 00:40:53,190
I was waiting for you.

321
00:40:59,670 --> 00:41:01,140
I couldn't make it.

322
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:06,080
I found this seashell for you.

323
00:41:07,510 --> 00:41:09,450
Listen,
it sounds beautiful.

324
00:41:18,390 --> 00:41:19,620
I hear nothing.

325
00:41:20,860 --> 00:41:23,590
Then you can't join us.

326
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:29,030
What a pity.
But I'l give to you.

327
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:36,900
Farewell, Soseki.

328
00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:38,710
You mustn't go!

329
00:41:39,210 --> 00:41:41,150
But I will go.

330
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:51,250
I want to see it
turn into a snake.

331
00:42:19,050 --> 00:42:20,540
Only you, again?

332
00:42:24,630 --> 00:42:27,930
What?
Can't you add it all up?

333
00:42:30,530 --> 00:42:33,500
When you awaken,
you forget your dreams.

334
00:42:36,740 --> 00:42:40,870
But you must iy to remember,
even if you don't want to.

335
00:42:46,180 --> 00:42:49,710
After this,
I'l never forget them.

336
00:42:55,290 --> 00:43:02,290
Fifteen in all

337
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:31,020
This is the dream I had.

Shotaro?

347

Long time no see.

You must be happy.

353
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:45,090
Stop it!

354
00:46:14,420 --> 00:46:17,050
No, Shotaro.
You mustn't look.

355
00:46:17,220 --> 00:46:18,450
Don't look!

356
00:46:28,570 --> 00:46:30,260
It's coming, Masako.

357

Welcome home...

358
00:46:54,430 --> 00:46:55,730

I'll wait till dawn,
when the cocks crow.

374

Shotaro?

375
00:51:25,170 --> 00:51:27,460
Sorry, did I wake you?

376
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:33,610
No, I got woken up
by a nightmare.

377
00:52:25,460 --> 00:52:27,020
You don't mind?

378
00:52:28,630 --> 00:52:30,690
This is also me.

379
00:52:35,170 --> 00:52:36,290

-What bait did you use?
Fish paste.

390
01:16:05,340 --> 01:16:08,340
Just fish paste?
That's unbelievable.

391
01:16:09,010 --> 01:16:10,140
What bait?

392
01:16:10,650 --> 01:16:12,120
It's awesome!
It's huge.

393
01:16:12,650 --> 01:16:14,810
-He used fish paste.
-Really?

394
01:16:14,920 --> 01:16:16,620
You caught this with fish paste?

395
01:16:19,930 --> 01:16:22,450
Just fish paste?
That's awesome!

396
01:16:24,060 --> 01:16:26,460
What were you using?

397
01:16:30,470 --> 01:16:32,630
-He's lying.
-No, he's not.

398
01:16:32,800 --> 01:16:34,640
Mitsu never lies.

399
01:16:34,810 --> 01:16:36,740
If he said he did,
he did.

400
01:16:56,530 --> 01:16:58,220
Listen, Mitsu.

401
01:16:59,700 --> 01:17:02,100
You'll soon tire of it.

402
01:17:04,140 --> 01:17:05,660
What if it dies?

403
01:17:07,770 --> 01:17:09,570
Where can we dump it?

404
01:17:09,740 --> 01:17:11,330
Ill feed it.

405
01:17:11,510 --> 01:17:13,670
Il get stuck looking after it.

406
01:17:19,680 --> 01:17:20,810
Riki, no!

407
01:17:54,020 --> 01:17:55,490
Hello, Grandpa.

408
01:18:10,440 --> 01:18:11,800
Listen to me, Mitsu.

We'll talk to uncle
in the hills.

Riki.

411
01:18:38,330 --> 01:18:39,660
Will it change form?

412
01:18:47,540 --> 01:18:49,130
I know it will!

413
01:21:45,150 --> 01:21:47,080

I've previously written of Unkei,
the sculptor.

417
01:22:49,780 --> 01:22:51,150
This is his place.

418
01:22:51,320 --> 01:22:53,050
But what if it's not?

419
01:22:55,050 --> 01:22:56,420
He's still asleep.

420
01:22:57,160 --> 01:22:59,090
He sleeps in the daytime.

421
01:22:59,260 --> 01:23:00,350
Who'll do it?

422
01:23:01,230 --> 01:23:02,590
You.

423
01:23:02,760 --> 01:23:04,700
No, let's all do it.

424
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:07,060
You started it.

425

Father went away.

I shall perform
my military duties.

435

I have longed for this opportunity.

I am honored to serve.

437
01:24:49,070 --> 01:24:52,870
I ask you to care for my
eloved son,

438
01:24:53,040 --> 01:24:56,600
and my helpless wife,
while I serve my country.

439
01:24:56,770 --> 01:25:02,910
In your stead, I shall fight like
a demon for our sacred land.

440
01:25:03,310 --> 01:25:06,550
I shall pit my life against
the enemy.

441

01:26:03,980 --> 01:26:05,500
You're a good boy.

449
01:26:33,240 --> 01:26:34,470
Don't go!

450

Go!

453
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:14,090
Darling.
Can't you do something?

454
01:29:15,370 --> 01:29:16,930
Like what?

455
01:29:17,100 --> 01:29:20,070
Must you leave us
and to go off to war?

456
01:29:21,410 --> 01:29:23,810
I didn't marry a soldier.

457
01:29:23,980 --> 01:29:28,440
I did it because I wanted
to share my life with you.

458
01:29:28,610 --> 01:29:31,410
So you would be by
my side forever.

Daddy!

460

Heaven can be
wherever you are

461
01:29:59,940 --> 01:30:04,610
Here he comes,
such a slacker is he

462
01:30:06,280 --> 01:30:11,150
It's Onikichi,
the so fast on his feet

463
01:30:13,420 --> 01:30:16,920
Yes, here he comes,
back for more...

Mommy!

466
01:30:52,560 --> 01:30:55,330
You said you hated
the military.

467
01:30:55,630 --> 01:30:57,470
Not so loud.
Walls have ears.

468
01:30:57,640 --> 01:31:01,590
You told me you hated the army,
didn't you?

469
01:31:01,770 --> 01:31:02,830
Let me explain.

470
01:31:03,810 --> 01:31:08,840
Il be very careful and
I promise I'll come back to you.

471
01:31:09,310 --> 01:31:11,610
What does that mean?

472
01:31:11,780 --> 01:31:14,220
What will I do without you?

473
01:31:14,750 --> 01:31:19,160
Without you
my life meaningless.

474
01:31:19,920 --> 01:31:21,650
Calm down, dear.

475
01:32:34,530 --> 01:32:36,130
Not my draft card!

476
01:32:40,870 --> 01:32:43,640
It's not our war.

477
01:32:44,280 --> 01:32:46,570
Just leave it there.

478
01:32:47,010 --> 01:32:48,380
I beg you!

479
01:32:48,750 --> 01:32:50,480
Look what you've done.

480
01:32:50,680 --> 01:32:53,080
I don't care.

481
01:32:53,820 --> 01:32:56,250
My draft card...

482
01:34:24,040 --> 01:34:26,940
The time has come,
I tell you now

483
01:34:27,480 --> 01:34:29,910
Take your time,
no need for haste

some other time, in another place

He went missing, didn't he?

488
01:35:03,050 --> 01:35:05,350
Someone go tell Ken
he's back.

489
01:35:05,580 --> 01:35:07,020
Better tell him.

490
01:35:09,290 --> 01:35:12,810
Good god,

Yes, you're right.
Sorry about that.

497
01:35:47,790 --> 01:35:50,560
How on earth did you
make it back?

498
01:35:50,730 --> 01:35:52,890
-What happened?
-I'd rather not say.

499
01:35:55,200 --> 01:35:58,100
On second thoughts,
I haven't much time.

500
01:35:59,240 --> 01:36:01,230
I'd best tell the story.

501
01:36:03,540 --> 01:36:08,540
There's Shotaro again
with his panama hat and cane.

502
01:36:08,710 --> 01:36:11,740
He only works afternoons.
at a loafer.

503
01:36:12,150 --> 01:36:17,020
He's the best looking kid in town,
and he's got a good heart.

504
01:36:17,320 --> 01:36:22,350
Women come from miles around
to see him.

505
01:36:23,560 --> 01:36:28,500
But all he does all day
is stare out at the street.

506
01:36:28,670 --> 01:36:30,630
What's he's thinking?

507
01:36:56,460 --> 01:36:58,790
Look, here's another one.

508
01:36:59,200 --> 01:37:02,030
I bet she comes
just to look at him, too.

509
01:37:02,600 --> 01:37:06,260
His business does well.
The luck of the handsome.

510
01:37:06,440 --> 01:37:10,030
No matter who itis,
he keeps his cool.

511
01:37:10,210 --> 01:37:13,340
That's what you get for
being upright.

512
01:37:21,420 --> 01:37:23,940
The ugly have no right to live!

513
01:37:24,490 --> 01:37:26,820
Go to hell,
you ugly pig!

514
01:37:36,470 --> 01:37:37,630
Excuse me.

515
01:37:44,480 --> 01:37:45,970
Excuse me?

516
01:37:50,380 --> 01:37:53,080
When the mysterious
Yoshino appeared,

517
01:37:53,320 --> 01:37:56,620
Shotaro left town
as if bewitched.

518
01:37:56,790 --> 01:38:00,280
He had no idea that
this would bring him

519
01:38:00,460 --> 01:38:04,550
aliving hell,
worse than he could ever imagine.

520
01:38:06,200 --> 01:38:07,320
Menu
Pig bowl (Large)

521
01:38:10,400 --> 01:38:11,430
Pig?

522
01:38:18,710 --> 01:38:20,910
I hope you like it.

523
01:38:31,190 --> 01:38:35,420
Does its lusciousness
delight even you?

524
01:38:36,190 --> 01:38:39,560
Go ahead, eat.
No need to hesitate.

525
01:38:44,700 --> 01:38:46,100
Delicious!

526
01:38:49,440 --> 01:38:51,410
Oh, I'm so full.

527
01:38:52,540 --> 01:38:54,980
I've never expected pig
to taste so good.

528
01:38:55,150 --> 01:38:56,270
"Very good!"

529
01:38:57,280 --> 01:39:00,880
In that case,
Il show you how we make it.

530
01:39:05,760 --> 01:39:06,720
Quch!

531
01:39:07,730 --> 01:39:09,690
Are you ready?

532
01:39:29,050 --> 01:39:31,740
Faster, faster.
Go, go!

533
01:39:33,750 --> 01:39:35,310
Why are they so ugly?

534
01:39:35,920 --> 01:39:40,720
~ Asyou can see,
all our ingredients are fresh and pure.

535
01:39:40,890 --> 01:39:43,790
Naturally,
we use no artificial additives.

536
01:39:44,630 --> 01:39:48,620
All of our processes use the
most hygienic materials.

537
01:39:49,370 --> 01:39:52,960
Next, itis heated to 80 degrees
in a large pot.

538
01:39:53,140 --> 01:39:57,130
And special, succulent slices
are added for flavor.

539
01:39:58,710 --> 01:40:01,180
Itis then simmered to perfection.

540
01:40:01,810 --> 01:40:04,650
Next, is our most
secret ingredient.

541
01:40:12,920 --> 01:40:15,950
Special, selected spices
make for a perfect finish.

542
01:40:32,580 --> 01:40:37,040
What a waste.
That was made especially for you.

543
01:40:37,250 --> 01:40:38,370
You can't be serious!

544
01:40:38,520 --> 01:40:40,350
That's not pig,
it's human!

545
01:40:40,520 --> 01:40:41,510
Culinary Armageddon!

546
01:40:41,650 --> 01:40:44,850
A filthy, self-absorbed killer,
like you,

547
01:40:44,990 --> 01:40:47,720
deserves nothing less than that!

548
01:40:48,160 --> 01:40:49,280
Who the hell are you?

549
01:40:53,660 --> 01:40:57,000
At that moment,
he recalled the words of his friend,

550
01:40:57,130 --> 01:40:59,690
Gennai Hiraga, the inventor.

551
01:40:59,840 --> 01:41:03,330
If you're ever in the clutches of
maddened monsters,

552
01:41:03,470 --> 01:41:05,470
just push this button.

553
01:41:06,040 --> 01:41:09,100
No need.
It's highly unlikely to happen.

554
01:41:09,580 --> 01:41:10,670
Now!

555
01:41:15,950 --> 01:41:17,420
Thank you, Gennai.

556
01:41:31,640 --> 01:41:32,500
Fart attack!

557
01:41:44,850 --> 01:41:48,280
Shall I show you my true self?

558
01:42:17,380 --> 01:42:18,440
You stink!

559
01:42:18,720 --> 01:42:19,910
Smells like shit.

560
01:43:30,920 --> 01:43:32,010
Forgive me.

561
01:43:32,520 --> 01:43:35,010
I'l never kill anyone again.

562
01:43:35,160 --> 01:43:37,790
I'am so sorry.
Please forgive me.

563
01:43:37,930 --> 01:43:39,160
I'm sorry.

564
01:43:39,360 --> 01:43:41,760
I beg you.
Please.

565
01:43:42,570 --> 01:43:44,230
I'm really very sorry.

566
01:43:44,600 --> 01:43:45,730
I apologize.

567
01:43:45,840 --> 01:43:48,570
I'm ever so sorry.
Forgive me.

568
01:43:58,320 --> 01:44:00,580
Is that right?

569
01:44:04,190 --> 01:44:05,950
How did you get hurt?

570
01:44:06,260 --> 01:44:08,520
You never mentioned that.

571
01:44:10,090 --> 01:44:11,190
This, you mean?

572
01:44:11,360 --> 01:44:13,460
As I was on my way back...

573
01:44:21,140 --> 01:44:23,540
-That's all.
-Really?

574
01:44:25,210 --> 01:44:27,040
I'd better get some sleep.

575
01:44:27,210 --> 01:44:29,980
It's time to die.

576
01:44:35,990 --> 01:44:42,150
But Shotaro did not die.
He lived on until his 138th year.

577
01:44:42,330 --> 01:44:46,460
And he became the world's
first astronaut.

578
01:44:46,860 --> 01:44:50,820
No way!
That'll never happen to me.

579
01:44:51,270 --> 01:44:52,260
It happened!

580
01:44:53,100 --> 01:44:54,230
Thank you, Gennai.

581
01:44:54,500 --> 01:45:00,470
The End

582
01:45:10,820 --> 01:45:12,760
A hundred years...

583
01:45:16,760 --> 01:45:18,920
Is it here already?

584
01:45:19,530 --> 01:45:22,860
"Ten Nights of Dreams"

585
01:45:23,770 --> 01:45:26,260
Or will it take another
hundred years?
