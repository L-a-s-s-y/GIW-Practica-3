1
00:02:30,302 --> 00:02:33,385
Get back there, please.

2
00:02:37,951 --> 00:02:38,723
Good morning, sir.

3
00:02:38,798 --> 00:02:39,932
Good morning, Sergeant.

4
00:02:40,007 --> 00:02:40,765
Morning, Superintendent.

5
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:41,598
Morning.

6
00:02:41,673 --> 00:02:42,431
Inspector Learoyd's here.

7
00:02:42,506 --> 00:02:43,332
Thank you.

8
00:02:43,407 --> 00:02:44,602
Who is she, Phil?

9
00:02:44,677 --> 00:02:46,250
Hello, Bob, no idea.

10
00:02:46,325 --> 00:02:47,827
Bloodstained handkerchief in her pocket,

11
00:02:47,902 --> 00:02:49,272
letter S in the corner.

12
00:02:49,347 --> 00:02:50,352
You won't like this, Hazard.

13
00:02:50,427 --> 00:02:51,844
She's very young.

14
00:03:00,162 --> 00:03:01,637
Half a dozen knife
wounds, around the heart.

15
00:03:01,712 --> 00:03:03,709
She died instantly.

16
00:03:03,784 --> 00:03:04,893
What sort of knife?

17
00:03:04,968 --> 00:03:07,924
Any sort, as long as
it was sharp, pointed.

18
00:03:07,999 --> 00:03:08,999
No sign.

19
00:03:13,415 --> 00:03:14,246
Who found her?

20
00:03:14,321 --> 00:03:15,604
A couple of kids.

21
00:03:15,679 --> 00:03:17,502
No blood on the ground or
any signs of a struggle.

22
00:03:17,577 --> 00:03:20,030
Must've been killed somewhere
else, and dumped here.

23
00:03:20,105 --> 00:03:21,092
How long's she been dead?

24
00:03:21,167 --> 00:03:22,294
Between five and
eight, yesterday evening,

25
00:03:22,369 --> 00:03:23,844
at the nearest I can put it.

26
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:25,376
Missing persons
have nothing to report, sir.

27
00:03:25,451 --> 00:03:26,784
Oh, thank you.

28
00:03:30,275 --> 00:03:31,297
Ground's pretty hard.

29
00:03:31,372 --> 00:03:35,539
We've searched the area,
sir, but found nothing.

30
00:03:41,769 --> 00:03:43,087
Nothing but the handkerchief, huh?

31
00:03:43,162 --> 00:03:44,794
No, nothing.

32
00:03:44,869 --> 00:03:45,627
Well, send her clothes back

33
00:03:45,702 --> 00:03:46,461
along to the station, will you?

34
00:03:46,536 --> 00:03:49,618
- Yes, sir.
- Come on, Phil.

35
00:03:54,106 --> 00:03:56,434
Nice, simple things.

36
00:03:56,509 --> 00:03:57,509
Are they?

37
00:04:03,754 --> 00:04:06,013
Don't quite go together, do they?

38
00:04:06,088 --> 00:04:07,088
These do.

39
00:04:10,999 --> 00:04:13,870
There'll be some
hysterical, frightened boy.

40
00:04:13,945 --> 00:04:15,663
I don't think so.

41
00:04:15,738 --> 00:04:18,815
In my experience, an hysterical,
frightened boy stabs once,

42
00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:22,197
well, twice maybe, and then runs.

43
00:04:22,272 --> 00:04:26,463
But this monkey went on and
on, 'til he was exhausted.

44
00:04:26,538 --> 00:04:30,121
No, this girl was killed
in hate, not fear.

45
00:04:32,703 --> 00:04:35,470
I should say she was a student.

46
00:04:35,545 --> 00:04:38,114
Now, she's in the habit of
going away for the weekend,

47
00:04:38,189 --> 00:04:41,057
she may not be missed until tomorrow.

48
00:04:41,132 --> 00:04:43,373
Get a list of every college
and academy in London,

49
00:04:43,448 --> 00:04:45,184
see if a girl doesn't
turn up in the morning.

50
00:04:45,259 --> 00:04:49,342
Particularly, any girl,
whose name begins with S.

51
00:04:58,050 --> 00:04:59,229
Patsy?

52
00:04:59,304 --> 00:05:00,304
David!

53
00:05:01,168 --> 00:05:02,451
Where's Sapphire?

54
00:05:02,526 --> 00:05:04,994
Isn't she in Birmingham,
with her brother?

55
00:05:05,069 --> 00:05:05,828
I don't know.

56
00:05:05,903 --> 00:05:08,163
She was going, and then
she changed her mind.

57
00:05:08,238 --> 00:05:09,173
I don't know what she did.

58
00:05:09,248 --> 00:05:13,321
Well, if you're worried,
why don't you phone him?

59
00:05:13,396 --> 00:05:15,393
No, I don't want to
speak to her brother.

60
00:05:15,468 --> 00:05:17,326
She caught the morning train, I expect.

61
00:05:17,401 --> 00:05:19,607
Don't worry, Sapphire will
be in Foscari's for coffee.

62
00:05:19,682 --> 00:05:20,765
See you then.

63
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:43,143
Hi, David.

64
00:05:43,218 --> 00:05:43,977
Hi.

65
00:05:44,052 --> 00:05:45,131
Congratulations on your scholarship.

66
00:05:45,206 --> 00:05:46,193
When are you off to Rome?

67
00:05:46,268 --> 00:05:47,030
Next month.

68
00:05:47,105 --> 00:05:48,271
Lucky devil.

69
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:54,047
David!

70
00:05:54,122 --> 00:05:55,122
David?

71
00:06:02,778 --> 00:06:04,427
Mr. Harris?

72
00:06:04,502 --> 00:06:06,326
We won't keep you very long.

73
00:06:06,401 --> 00:06:11,085
I'm sorry, but we think
you may be able to help us.

74
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,493
Thank you, miss.

75
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:41,301
Hey, what's the matter with you?

76
00:06:41,376 --> 00:06:42,135
Patsy!

77
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:43,792
What is it?

78
00:06:44,825 --> 00:06:48,807
That murdered girl in Hampstead Heath...

79
00:06:48,882 --> 00:06:49,835
It's Sapphire.

80
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:50,669
Sapphire?

81
00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:52,865
Hey, Emma, coffee, quick!

82
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:53,699
Sapphire?

83
00:06:53,774 --> 00:06:55,477
How ghastly.

84
00:06:55,552 --> 00:06:58,737
The police kept asking
me questions about her.

85
00:06:58,812 --> 00:07:01,941
Who her friends were, I said us.

86
00:07:02,016 --> 00:07:02,775
Well, of course!

87
00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:03,944
We were all her friends!

88
00:07:04,019 --> 00:07:05,389
What else did they ask you?

89
00:07:05,464 --> 00:07:06,223
All about David.

90
00:07:06,298 --> 00:07:08,263
The scholarship and everything.

91
00:07:08,338 --> 00:07:11,032
If she'd had any boyfriends before him.

92
00:07:11,107 --> 00:07:12,564
Oh, I couldn't tell them.

93
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:13,398
I've only known her, since I took

94
00:07:13,473 --> 00:07:15,072
her to stay with me, at my digs.

95
00:07:15,147 --> 00:07:16,657
Where was she living before that?

96
00:07:16,732 --> 00:07:18,224
Her dump in Earl's Court.

97
00:07:18,299 --> 00:07:19,704
Landlady turned her out.

98
00:07:19,779 --> 00:07:20,732
But why?

99
00:07:20,807 --> 00:07:23,779
Sapphire was such a sweetie.

100
00:07:23,854 --> 00:07:25,561
Who'd do such a thing to Sapphire?

101
00:07:26,395 --> 00:07:27,395
I don't.

102
00:07:47,914 --> 00:07:50,939
You say her name was Sapphire Robbins?

103
00:07:51,014 --> 00:07:54,387
I'd like you to come down to
my office, ask a few questions.

104
00:07:54,462 --> 00:07:56,007
Do you think you feel up to it?

105
00:07:56,082 --> 00:08:00,657
We'll send you home in
a police car afterwards.

106
00:08:00,732 --> 00:08:03,315
We were going to get married.

107
00:08:04,458 --> 00:08:05,458
I'm sorry.

108
00:08:21,389 --> 00:08:23,853
You say the last time you
saw her was on Friday night?

109
00:08:23,928 --> 00:08:25,177
Yes.

110
00:08:25,252 --> 00:08:27,319
Do you know what she did on Saturday?

111
00:08:27,394 --> 00:08:31,185
Well, she came to my house,
apparently, just after lunch.

112
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:33,484
You weren't in?

113
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:36,395
No, I went to Cambridge to sketch.

114
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:39,753
I'm a student architect
at the Polytechnic.

115
00:08:39,828 --> 00:08:41,773
What train did you catch?

116
00:08:41,848 --> 00:08:43,567
I hitchhiked, both ways.

117
00:08:43,642 --> 00:08:45,761
What time you'd get home?

118
00:08:45,836 --> 00:08:47,207
About 11.

119
00:08:47,282 --> 00:08:49,088
Who gave you a lift from Cambridge?

120
00:08:49,163 --> 00:08:52,170
A chap in a black Consul,
dropped me at the post office.

121
00:08:52,245 --> 00:08:54,103
What time was that?

122
00:08:54,178 --> 00:08:55,845
About quarter to 11.

123
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,952
You wouldn't remember the
number of the car, I suppose?

124
00:08:58,027 --> 00:08:59,027
No.

125
00:09:08,792 --> 00:09:11,225
Somebody ought to tell Sapphire's brother.

126
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:13,750
We contacted Dr. Robbins in Birmingham.

127
00:09:13,825 --> 00:09:14,760
He's on his way to London now.

128
00:09:14,835 --> 00:09:16,362
Oh.

129
00:09:16,437 --> 00:09:19,166
Did you and Sapphire have
a quarrel on Friday night?

130
00:09:19,241 --> 00:09:20,646
No.

131
00:09:20,721 --> 00:09:21,483
Thank you.

132
00:09:21,558 --> 00:09:23,694
Sergeant, drive Mr. Harris home, will you?

133
00:09:23,769 --> 00:09:25,186
Very good, sir.

134
00:09:30,892 --> 00:09:32,784
You'll let me know if you
find out anything, won't you?

135
00:09:32,859 --> 00:09:35,762
You're going to be informed, Mr. Harris.

136
00:09:35,837 --> 00:09:37,539
Oh, Mr. Harris?

137
00:09:37,614 --> 00:09:40,882
What time did you say you
got back from Cambridge?

138
00:09:40,957 --> 00:09:42,101
About 11.

139
00:09:42,176 --> 00:09:43,176
Thank you.

140
00:09:49,177 --> 00:09:51,230
The truth, you think?

141
00:09:51,305 --> 00:09:53,737
Well, not what I'd
describe as the whole truth.

142
00:09:53,812 --> 00:09:56,147
I don't believe he came
in when he said he did,

143
00:09:56,222 --> 00:09:58,515
but his grief seemed genuine enough.

144
00:09:58,590 --> 00:10:00,239
You never know with these monkeys.

145
00:10:00,314 --> 00:10:02,102
Knock their heads off, when it suits them.

146
00:10:02,177 --> 00:10:03,498
Ring up the Yard, and
get them to ask the BBC

147
00:10:03,573 --> 00:10:06,145
to broadcast for the driver
of that black Consul.

148
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:07,121
Fine.

149
00:10:07,196 --> 00:10:08,461
Meanwhile, I'll dig
through that girl's room,

150
00:10:08,536 --> 00:10:11,613
before her brother gets here.

151
00:10:11,688 --> 00:10:12,745
Has she'd been with you long?

152
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:14,646
About six months.

153
00:10:14,721 --> 00:10:15,480
Hmm.

154
00:10:15,555 --> 00:10:17,137
Not really tidy.

155
00:10:17,212 --> 00:10:19,557
Sapphire wasn't
naturally an orderly child.

156
00:10:19,632 --> 00:10:20,811
She did her best.

157
00:10:20,886 --> 00:10:22,082
Did you like her?

158
00:10:22,157 --> 00:10:22,916
Indeed, I did.

159
00:10:22,991 --> 00:10:24,817
I felt sorry for her.

160
00:10:24,892 --> 00:10:26,280
Her parents were dead, and she wanted

161
00:10:26,355 --> 00:10:29,355
so much to be counted in, to belong.

162
00:10:30,308 --> 00:10:31,504
Did you ever meet her brother?

163
00:10:31,579 --> 00:10:33,925
No, but I spoke to him on the telephone.

164
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,500
Sounded very nice.

165
00:10:41,575 --> 00:10:42,510
This one's locked.

166
00:10:42,585 --> 00:10:45,168
I'm sorry, I haven't the key.

167
00:10:47,009 --> 00:10:49,009
Oh, I wish you wouldn't.

168
00:10:58,418 --> 00:11:02,168
I never saw Sapphire
wear anything like that!

169
00:11:20,358 --> 00:11:21,608
Hmm.

170
00:11:26,349 --> 00:11:29,182
I wonder who she was dancing with.

171
00:11:35,858 --> 00:11:37,367
Did she play the gramophone often?

172
00:11:37,442 --> 00:11:39,387
All the time, very softly.

173
00:11:39,462 --> 00:11:41,370
She was a student at the
Royal Academy of Music.

174
00:11:41,445 --> 00:11:44,086
Mm, well, thank you, Mrs. Thompson.

175
00:11:44,161 --> 00:11:46,244
You've been most helpful.

176
00:11:51,928 --> 00:11:52,815
Evidently, there was a side

177
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:56,311
to Sapphire she didn't know about.

178
00:11:56,386 --> 00:11:57,878
Yeah.

179
00:11:57,953 --> 00:12:01,396
Maybe young Harris found the
same thing, and didn't like it.

180
00:12:01,471 --> 00:12:02,471
Could be.

181
00:12:03,648 --> 00:12:05,019
Unless the person she was dancing with,

182
00:12:05,094 --> 00:12:07,770
found out about young Harris.

183
00:12:07,845 --> 00:12:10,262
Jealousy's very near to hate.

184
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:25,549
Oh, Mrs. Farr?

185
00:12:25,624 --> 00:12:27,554
Mrs. Farr, your brother's here.

186
00:12:27,629 --> 00:12:31,298
David, what's the matter?

187
00:12:31,373 --> 00:12:34,290
Millie, I've got to speak to you.

188
00:12:43,894 --> 00:12:45,474
The girl's brother's
here, sir, Dr. Robbins.

189
00:12:45,549 --> 00:12:46,307
Right, send him in.

190
00:12:46,382 --> 00:12:47,382
Sir.

191
00:12:55,862 --> 00:12:59,105
Dr. Robbins, sir.

192
00:13:03,962 --> 00:13:05,297
Why it's very good of you
to come so quickly, sir.

193
00:13:05,372 --> 00:13:06,130
How do you do?

194
00:13:06,205 --> 00:13:06,964
Please sit down.

195
00:13:07,039 --> 00:13:08,293
Thank you.

196
00:13:08,368 --> 00:13:12,281
I suppose there's no
doubt, it is Sapphire?

197
00:13:12,356 --> 00:13:14,980
No doubt at all, I'm afraid.

198
00:13:15,055 --> 00:13:17,366
I know this must be painful for you,

199
00:13:17,441 --> 00:13:19,003
but there are some
questions I have to ask you.

200
00:13:19,078 --> 00:13:20,222
Of course.

201
00:13:20,297 --> 00:13:21,929
No thank you.

202
00:13:22,004 --> 00:13:22,763
I understand you

203
00:13:22,838 --> 00:13:24,680
expected your sister for the weekend.

204
00:13:24,755 --> 00:13:25,838
Yes, I did.

205
00:13:27,681 --> 00:13:29,452
Weren't you worried, when
she didn't turn up on Saturday?

206
00:13:29,527 --> 00:13:30,532
No, no, she rang me, said something

207
00:13:30,607 --> 00:13:32,520
unexpected had stopped her.

208
00:13:32,595 --> 00:13:35,585
With Sapphire, something
unexpected was always happening.

209
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:37,013
How did she sound?

210
00:13:37,088 --> 00:13:38,838
Excited, I thought.

211
00:13:39,787 --> 00:13:41,767
What sort of a girl was your sister?

212
00:13:41,842 --> 00:13:45,092
Happy, lively, exactly as she looked.

213
00:13:45,987 --> 00:13:47,031
No, no.

214
00:13:47,956 --> 00:13:50,774
That's not quite true, is it?

215
00:13:50,849 --> 00:13:54,184
Are you, were you
Sapphire's half brother?

216
00:13:54,259 --> 00:13:55,841
No.

217
00:13:55,916 --> 00:13:58,886
Our father was a doctor, white,

218
00:13:58,961 --> 00:14:01,794
our mother, singer, black as iron.

219
00:14:05,248 --> 00:14:08,498
You never know which way it's gonna go.

220
00:14:09,445 --> 00:14:10,624
Since Sapphire came to London,

221
00:14:10,699 --> 00:14:13,199
she learned to pass for white.

222
00:14:14,147 --> 00:14:18,269
Did David Harris know that
your sister was colored?

223
00:14:18,344 --> 00:14:19,836
I don't know.

224
00:14:19,911 --> 00:14:21,316
I knew little of Sapphire's life up here.

225
00:14:21,391 --> 00:14:24,834
She seemed happy, I didn't pry further.

226
00:14:24,909 --> 00:14:27,159
My sister was 21, you know.

227
00:14:29,037 --> 00:14:31,225
Why did you let her come to London?

228
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:32,132
She wanted to come.

229
00:14:32,207 --> 00:14:33,681
I didn't see why she shouldn't

230
00:14:33,756 --> 00:14:36,171
have the same chance,
as any other youngster.

231
00:14:36,246 --> 00:14:38,627
I'm a bachelor, I could
afford to stake her.

232
00:14:38,702 --> 00:14:39,481
Did she ever talk

233
00:14:39,556 --> 00:14:42,028
about anyone else, besides young Harris?

234
00:14:42,103 --> 00:14:44,223
I can't remember.

235
00:14:44,298 --> 00:14:47,965
I hardly listened,
Sapphire chatted so much.

236
00:14:49,191 --> 00:14:50,691
It's unbelievable.

237
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:54,288
I can see her now.

238
00:14:54,363 --> 00:14:57,353
Sitting on the table
in my consulting room,

239
00:14:57,428 --> 00:15:01,595
swinging her legs, laughing,
twittering like a bird.

240
00:15:03,837 --> 00:15:06,670
Patients waiting, but on she went.

241
00:15:07,947 --> 00:15:10,697
I could've slapped her sometimes.

242
00:15:12,614 --> 00:15:14,781
Who would do such a thing?

243
00:15:18,431 --> 00:15:19,764
Who would do it?

244
00:15:23,951 --> 00:15:25,357
I'd like to see my sister.

245
00:15:25,432 --> 00:15:26,191
I'll take you.

246
00:15:26,266 --> 00:15:28,432
No, I'd rather go alone.

247
00:15:29,806 --> 00:15:31,402
The New End Hospital, Hampstead.

248
00:15:31,477 --> 00:15:34,119
Thank you.

249
00:15:34,194 --> 00:15:35,425
About that girl we --

250
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:38,142
Oh, this is Dr. Robbins.

251
00:15:38,217 --> 00:15:39,796
Detective Inspector Learoyd.

252
00:15:39,871 --> 00:15:41,782
How do you do?

253
00:15:41,857 --> 00:15:42,857
Hello.

254
00:15:45,845 --> 00:15:48,159
You can get me at the Dorsett
Hotel, they take us there.

255
00:15:48,234 --> 00:15:49,234
Thank you.

256
00:15:52,393 --> 00:15:53,393
So...

257
00:15:55,005 --> 00:15:55,817
That's the brother.

258
00:15:55,892 --> 00:15:56,892
Yes.

259
00:15:57,895 --> 00:15:59,753
I think I was right.

260
00:15:59,828 --> 00:16:01,578
Hate killed Sapphire.

261
00:16:02,475 --> 00:16:05,186
I think she died because she was colored.

262
00:16:05,261 --> 00:16:07,261
She was also pregnant.

263
00:16:10,817 --> 00:16:14,521
Three months, the autopsy's just in.

264
00:16:14,596 --> 00:16:16,593
Young Harris, of course.

265
00:16:16,668 --> 00:16:17,427
Well, I don't know.

266
00:16:17,502 --> 00:16:18,875
We can't be sure now, can we?

267
00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:21,033
I mean, might be anybody.

268
00:16:47,510 --> 00:16:49,351
Dad, I've been trailing
everywhere after you.

269
00:16:49,426 --> 00:16:51,615
What's the matter?

270
00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:54,018
Girl on Hampstead Heath.

271
00:16:54,093 --> 00:16:55,899
It was Sapphire.

272
00:16:55,974 --> 00:16:56,979
Sapphire?

273
00:16:57,054 --> 00:16:59,608
Yes, David's
had to go and identify her.

274
00:16:59,683 --> 00:17:00,683
David?

275
00:17:01,738 --> 00:17:03,196
I'm so frightened, Dad.

276
00:17:03,271 --> 00:17:04,050
Don't worry, girl.

277
00:17:04,125 --> 00:17:05,390
Where's David now?

278
00:17:05,465 --> 00:17:06,882
He's gone home.

279
00:17:15,688 --> 00:17:16,461
You didn't tell us you were

280
00:17:16,536 --> 00:17:18,437
the father of Sapphire's child.

281
00:17:18,512 --> 00:17:20,179
You didn't ask me.

282
00:17:22,796 --> 00:17:25,879
Were you on the other side of that?

283
00:17:28,369 --> 00:17:29,369
No.

284
00:17:48,173 --> 00:17:49,282
It's the police, Ted.

285
00:17:49,357 --> 00:17:50,658
They're in there with David now.

286
00:17:50,733 --> 00:17:51,547
Don't worry, dear.

287
00:17:51,622 --> 00:17:53,121
It's only routine.

288
00:17:54,459 --> 00:17:55,830
Where do you think you're going to?

289
00:17:55,905 --> 00:17:57,293
Up to my room, Dad.

290
00:17:57,368 --> 00:17:59,330
I told him he could, and I want him to.

291
00:17:59,405 --> 00:18:00,822
Show him, Millie?

292
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:11,834
I'm David's father.

293
00:18:11,909 --> 00:18:13,471
Superintendent Hazard.

294
00:18:13,546 --> 00:18:14,481
What's been said?

295
00:18:14,556 --> 00:18:15,770
They know about the baby, Dad.

296
00:18:15,845 --> 00:18:16,902
Well, what of it?

297
00:18:16,977 --> 00:18:18,121
We knew.

298
00:18:18,196 --> 00:18:21,482
She came here to tell us
Saturday, just after lunch.

299
00:18:21,557 --> 00:18:23,206
My boy was going to marry her.

300
00:18:23,281 --> 00:18:25,470
I gave her my word he would.

301
00:18:25,545 --> 00:18:26,304
They want to know what time

302
00:18:26,379 --> 00:18:27,647
I got in on Saturday night, dad.

303
00:18:27,722 --> 00:18:29,197
About 11.

304
00:18:29,272 --> 00:18:30,956
Did you talk to anyone in Cambridge?

305
00:18:31,031 --> 00:18:32,628
Anyone might remember you?

306
00:18:32,703 --> 00:18:33,638
Where did you eat?

307
00:18:33,713 --> 00:18:34,596
I took sandwiches.

308
00:18:34,671 --> 00:18:35,467
He always does.

309
00:18:35,542 --> 00:18:38,958
We can't afford meals in cafes, you know?

310
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,804
Finished, Inspector?

311
00:18:53,879 --> 00:18:56,962
Yes, thank you Mrs. Farr.

312
00:19:13,753 --> 00:19:16,255
He went through David's
room with a magnifying glass.

313
00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:17,214
I don't care if they take the

314
00:19:17,289 --> 00:19:20,538
boards up, David's got nothing to hide.

315
00:19:21,398 --> 00:19:22,157
Do you think they'll be gone,

316
00:19:22,232 --> 00:19:23,291
by the time the twins get back?

317
00:19:23,366 --> 00:19:24,788
They'll hear it at school, Millie.

318
00:19:24,863 --> 00:19:26,164
You can't keep it from them.

319
00:19:26,239 --> 00:19:28,515
You've got to make up your mind to that.

320
00:19:28,590 --> 00:19:29,612
Excuse me.

321
00:19:29,687 --> 00:19:30,446
Superintendent Hazard would like

322
00:19:30,521 --> 00:19:33,437
to see you for a moment, Mrs. Farr.

323
00:19:39,997 --> 00:19:41,420
Mrs. Farr, what time did you finish

324
00:19:41,495 --> 00:19:44,206
work at the dairy, on Saturday?

325
00:19:44,281 --> 00:19:45,669
About half six.

326
00:19:45,744 --> 00:19:47,306
A little late, surely.

327
00:19:47,381 --> 00:19:48,873
My assistant was away all last week,

328
00:19:48,948 --> 00:19:50,319
I had the tidying up to do.

329
00:19:50,394 --> 00:19:51,329
I see.

330
00:19:51,404 --> 00:19:52,670
Did you come straight home?

331
00:19:52,745 --> 00:19:54,237
This is your home?

332
00:19:54,312 --> 00:19:55,508
For the moment.

333
00:19:55,583 --> 00:19:58,033
My husband's away at sea.

334
00:19:58,108 --> 00:19:59,879
Who was in the house, when you got here?

335
00:19:59,954 --> 00:20:00,713
Nobody.

336
00:20:00,788 --> 00:20:02,283
I was at the club, my wife was

337
00:20:02,358 --> 00:20:04,372
at her sister's with the twins.

338
00:20:04,447 --> 00:20:05,748
Twins?

339
00:20:05,823 --> 00:20:07,368
My children.

340
00:20:07,443 --> 00:20:08,726
Oh.

341
00:20:08,801 --> 00:20:11,896
The girl, Sapphire, had
gone, when you got in?

342
00:20:11,971 --> 00:20:14,142
Yes, she wasn't here.

343
00:20:14,217 --> 00:20:18,384
How did she seem when you
saw her, earlier in the day?

344
00:20:21,845 --> 00:20:23,773
Same as usual, full of life.

345
00:20:23,848 --> 00:20:26,848
Did you know that she was colored?

346
00:20:28,707 --> 00:20:29,955
We knew.

347
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:31,104
How long?

348
00:20:31,179 --> 00:20:31,938
We knew.

349
00:20:32,013 --> 00:20:34,413
That's enough, isn't it?

350
00:20:34,488 --> 00:20:35,488
I see.

351
00:20:36,874 --> 00:20:38,262
I understand you've just won a scholarship

352
00:20:38,337 --> 00:20:40,003
that takes you abroad.

353
00:20:40,078 --> 00:20:40,837
Of course, you won't leave 'til

354
00:20:40,912 --> 00:20:42,442
all this is settled, will you?

355
00:20:42,517 --> 00:20:44,253
Don't worry, he'll be staying here.

356
00:20:44,328 --> 00:20:46,743
Alright, Dad, I can answer for myself.

357
00:20:46,818 --> 00:20:47,875
Is that all Superintendent?

358
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:49,059
There are the children.

359
00:20:49,134 --> 00:20:49,986
I must get their tea.

360
00:20:50,061 --> 00:20:52,393
Why, of course, Mrs. Farr.

361
00:20:53,598 --> 00:20:55,299
Superintendent?

362
00:20:55,374 --> 00:20:56,814
Hadn't you better advertise for the fella

363
00:20:56,889 --> 00:20:58,939
that drove Davy back from Cambridge?

364
00:20:59,014 --> 00:21:01,290
I don't want any slime
sticking to my son, you know?

365
00:21:01,365 --> 00:21:04,393
We have that in hand, Mr. Harris.

366
00:21:04,468 --> 00:21:06,935
You say this man dropped
you at the post office.

367
00:21:07,010 --> 00:21:09,356
Did anyone see you at that
time of night on Saturday?

368
00:21:09,431 --> 00:21:10,681
I don't know.

369
00:21:11,904 --> 00:21:13,678
Yes, yes, Jack Ferris.

370
00:21:13,753 --> 00:21:15,367
He saw me, Dad.

371
00:21:15,442 --> 00:21:16,917
Local constable.

372
00:21:16,992 --> 00:21:20,325
You wouldn't call him a liar, I suppose?

373
00:21:21,572 --> 00:21:24,179
If Johnny Turnbul trot on
your feet, he didn't mean to.

374
00:21:24,254 --> 00:21:25,798
Little boys are clumsy dancers.

375
00:21:25,873 --> 00:21:27,871
Wasn't your feet he trot on.

376
00:21:27,946 --> 00:21:30,082
Oh, mommy, he's always bumbling.

377
00:21:30,157 --> 00:21:32,281
I hate dancing classes.

378
00:21:33,116 --> 00:21:36,178
Last week, you loved them.

379
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:37,623
Hello.

380
00:21:37,698 --> 00:21:38,668
Good day, Mrs. Farr.

381
00:21:38,743 --> 00:21:40,218
Good day.

382
00:21:40,293 --> 00:21:41,293
Thank you.

383
00:21:43,149 --> 00:21:44,276
There's angel cake for tea.

384
00:21:44,351 --> 00:21:45,913
Ooh, good.

385
00:21:45,988 --> 00:21:47,184
They knew she was colored then?

386
00:21:47,259 --> 00:21:50,353
Yes, but the point is when?

387
00:21:50,428 --> 00:21:52,530
That's a very important point.

388
00:21:52,605 --> 00:21:53,819
Find anything upstairs?

389
00:21:53,894 --> 00:21:54,653
No, nothing.

390
00:21:54,728 --> 00:21:55,961
All his clothes were clean and put away.

391
00:21:56,036 --> 00:21:57,110
Mm.

392
00:21:57,185 --> 00:21:59,792
Pretty rocky alibi, of young Harris's.

393
00:21:59,867 --> 00:22:01,286
Familiar motive, too.

394
00:22:01,361 --> 00:22:03,620
It's all too pat for my liking.

395
00:22:03,695 --> 00:22:05,083
You know, if he'd married that girl,

396
00:22:05,158 --> 00:22:07,782
he probably couldn't have
taken up that scholarship.

397
00:22:07,857 --> 00:22:09,506
He wouldn't carry a grant for a wife.

398
00:22:09,581 --> 00:22:10,638
Hmm.

399
00:22:10,713 --> 00:22:12,641
Well, are we gonna have a word
with this local constable?

400
00:22:12,716 --> 00:22:13,565
What's his name, Ferris?

401
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:15,884
Yes, right away.

402
00:22:23,722 --> 00:22:24,481
Yes, sir.

403
00:22:24,556 --> 00:22:27,113
I did see young Harris walking
home, on Saturday night.

404
00:22:27,188 --> 00:22:28,593
What time was that?

405
00:22:28,668 --> 00:22:30,944
Oh, it's near 11, is
makes no difference.

406
00:22:31,019 --> 00:22:32,651
And he was coming from the post office.

407
00:22:32,726 --> 00:22:35,019
From that direction, sir.

408
00:22:35,094 --> 00:22:36,517
What sort of people are the Harris's?

409
00:22:36,592 --> 00:22:37,858
Oh, very respectable, sir.

410
00:22:37,933 --> 00:22:39,425
Cut above the average.

411
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:42,717
Mrs. Harris was a school teacher.

412
00:22:42,792 --> 00:22:45,242
How long had they known
the girl was colored?

413
00:22:45,317 --> 00:22:46,792
What?

414
00:22:46,867 --> 00:22:48,585
Yes, she was you know?

415
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:51,616
Ooh, I shouldn't have thought
they knew that at all, sir.

416
00:22:51,691 --> 00:22:53,601
He's very bigoted, Ted Harris.

417
00:22:53,676 --> 00:22:55,151
And very ambitious for his son.

418
00:22:55,226 --> 00:22:56,596
Oh, very.

419
00:22:56,671 --> 00:22:59,104
Ted Harris has skimped
himself, to do for Davy.

420
00:22:59,179 --> 00:23:00,584
Mind you, the boy's repaid it all,

421
00:23:00,659 --> 00:23:02,935
with that scholarship he's won.

422
00:23:03,010 --> 00:23:03,945
And the daughter?

423
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:06,592
Oh, Millie's her father, all over again.

424
00:23:06,667 --> 00:23:09,988
Dancing classes for the twins, elocution.

425
00:23:10,063 --> 00:23:12,392
Must have that bit extra.

426
00:23:12,467 --> 00:23:13,994
Her husband's a sailor?

427
00:23:14,069 --> 00:23:16,815
Merchant Navy, bit of a laddo, Sid Farr.

428
00:23:16,890 --> 00:23:21,747
Doesn't seem to get much
leave, or doesn't want it.

429
00:23:21,822 --> 00:23:24,983
Can you find out if Harris
used his van on Saturday night?

430
00:23:25,058 --> 00:23:26,975
I'll do my best, sir.

431
00:23:28,697 --> 00:23:29,705
He only saw him coming from the

432
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:32,123
direction of the post office.

433
00:23:32,198 --> 00:23:34,091
That's no alibi, you know?

434
00:23:34,166 --> 00:23:36,720
The boy looks truthful to me.

435
00:23:36,795 --> 00:23:39,855
What's the track width of
Harris's van, would you say?

436
00:23:39,930 --> 00:23:41,266
I don't know.

437
00:23:41,341 --> 00:23:43,915
Four foot, four foot, six?

438
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:45,239
Hmm.

439
00:23:45,314 --> 00:23:49,481
I think I'll go back to the
Heath, and take a look around.

440
00:23:54,004 --> 00:23:54,853
Four foot, six inches, sir.

441
00:23:54,928 --> 00:23:56,177
Yes.

442
00:23:58,027 --> 00:24:00,407
Yes, it's more than possible.

443
00:24:00,482 --> 00:24:01,482
_ Sir?

444
00:24:07,378 --> 00:24:08,383
You shouldn't have come.

445
00:24:08,458 --> 00:24:11,152
I wanted to see where my sister died.

446
00:24:11,227 --> 00:24:12,803
Not here.

447
00:24:12,878 --> 00:24:13,637
No?

448
00:24:13,712 --> 00:24:17,461
No, she was brought
here somehow, and left.

449
00:24:18,358 --> 00:24:19,937
There is no roadway for a car.

450
00:24:20,012 --> 00:24:20,771
Oh, I don't know.

451
00:24:20,846 --> 00:24:21,870
A small one could've just made it,

452
00:24:21,945 --> 00:24:25,362
but the ground's too hard to show tracks.

453
00:24:31,141 --> 00:24:32,894
Did David Harris kill her?

454
00:24:32,969 --> 00:24:34,096
What makes you say that?

455
00:24:34,171 --> 00:24:35,754
She was pregnant.

456
00:24:36,992 --> 00:24:38,554
I've seen the autopsy.

457
00:24:38,629 --> 00:24:42,472
Yes, but that's no
proof that he killed her.

458
00:24:42,547 --> 00:24:45,590
If he did, we'll get him, rest assured.

459
00:24:45,665 --> 00:24:49,595
There is no assurance for me
and my kind, Superintendent.

460
00:24:49,670 --> 00:24:52,753
I've been black for 38 years, I know.

461
00:24:54,302 --> 00:24:58,512
She may have looked white,
but Sapphire was colored.

462
00:24:58,587 --> 00:25:01,002
Your sister was murdered.

463
00:25:01,077 --> 00:25:03,597
We'll find out who killed her.

464
00:25:03,672 --> 00:25:05,199
I'm sure that is your intention.

465
00:25:05,274 --> 00:25:07,024
It is my intention.

466
00:25:08,147 --> 00:25:09,564
It's also my job.

467
00:25:11,944 --> 00:25:12,944
I'm sorry.

468
00:25:15,079 --> 00:25:16,079
Thank you.

469
00:25:17,604 --> 00:25:21,917
When I was a child,
another boy touched me.

470
00:25:21,992 --> 00:25:24,619
He then held out his hand.

471
00:25:24,694 --> 00:25:26,709
"Look," he said.

472
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:29,034
"Nothing's come off on me."

473
00:25:33,071 --> 00:25:36,154
Trouble is, something came off on me.

474
00:25:39,985 --> 00:25:41,042
How do I get to Bloomsbury?

475
00:25:41,117 --> 00:25:42,018
I'll give you a lift.

476
00:25:42,093 --> 00:25:43,342
It's on my way.

477
00:25:45,504 --> 00:25:47,057
Sorry, sir.

478
00:26:16,876 --> 00:26:17,876
I'm full.

479
00:26:20,133 --> 00:26:22,217
I don't want a room.

480
00:26:22,292 --> 00:26:24,655
I've come to thank you, for
looking after my sister.

481
00:26:24,730 --> 00:26:26,153
You've got the wrong address.

482
00:26:26,228 --> 00:26:28,069
I take only white students.

483
00:26:28,144 --> 00:26:30,611
My name is Robbins.

484
00:26:30,686 --> 00:26:33,415
How much did Sapphire owe you?

485
00:26:33,490 --> 00:26:35,407
Her rent was paid up.

486
00:26:37,025 --> 00:26:40,381
May I come tomorrow, and
pick up Sapphire's things?

487
00:26:40,456 --> 00:26:44,623
The police have sealed
her room, you must ask them.

488
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:51,940
Patsy!

489
00:26:53,047 --> 00:26:54,156
Patsy!

490
00:26:54,231 --> 00:26:55,398
You, in Patsy?

491
00:26:57,854 --> 00:26:59,189
What is it, Mrs. Thompson?

492
00:26:59,264 --> 00:27:01,505
That girl you brought here,
did you know she was colored?

493
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:02,338
What girl?

494
00:27:02,413 --> 00:27:03,413
Sapphire.

495
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:06,220
Yes.

496
00:27:07,327 --> 00:27:08,854
Yes, I did.

497
00:27:08,929 --> 00:27:10,631
When did she tell you?

498
00:27:10,706 --> 00:27:11,815
Well, she didn't.

499
00:27:11,890 --> 00:27:13,307
A friend told me.

500
00:27:14,241 --> 00:27:15,629
This house is my living.

501
00:27:15,704 --> 00:27:17,144
If it got round that I
took colored students,

502
00:27:17,219 --> 00:27:18,412
certain white people wouldn't

503
00:27:18,487 --> 00:27:19,983
allow their children to stay here.

504
00:27:20,058 --> 00:27:22,125
Well, I think it's a
damn silly prejudice!

505
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,084
I'm not saying it isn't,

506
00:27:23,159 --> 00:27:25,521
but I can't afford to have my rooms empty.

507
00:27:25,596 --> 00:27:26,879
To think that she could be so sly.

508
00:27:26,954 --> 00:27:29,543
It's people like you, who made her sly.

509
00:27:29,618 --> 00:27:31,964
Well, you jolly-well got
another room empty now.

510
00:27:32,039 --> 00:27:33,039
Patsy!

511
00:27:35,714 --> 00:27:36,823
Yes?

512
00:27:36,898 --> 00:27:39,644
You took Sapphire home
to Guildford, didn't you?

513
00:27:39,719 --> 00:27:41,055
Yes?

514
00:27:41,130 --> 00:27:45,297
Did you tell your father
and mother she was colored?

515
00:27:46,215 --> 00:27:47,215
No.

516
00:27:49,402 --> 00:27:50,337
Well, then.

517
00:27:50,412 --> 00:27:53,745
Don't be so quick to call me prejudiced.

518
00:27:56,612 --> 00:27:57,612
You sure?

519
00:27:58,423 --> 00:27:59,423
Right.

520
00:28:00,217 --> 00:28:03,781
Well, Harris's van could've made it.

521
00:28:03,856 --> 00:28:05,697
Not on Saturday night, it couldn't.

522
00:28:05,772 --> 00:28:06,829
What?

523
00:28:06,904 --> 00:28:09,406
Van was in the garage,
having a big end fixed.

524
00:28:09,481 --> 00:28:12,036
Harris didn't pick it
up, until Monday morning.

525
00:28:12,111 --> 00:28:15,778
Well, how the blazes
did he get her there?

526
00:28:24,127 --> 00:28:26,525
Ask Sergeant Cook to come in, will you?

527
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:27,600
Thank you.

528
00:28:30,414 --> 00:28:33,265
Red taffeta, under a tweed skirt.

529
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:34,693
Yes.

530
00:28:34,768 --> 00:28:36,887
That's the black end
of the white, alright.

531
00:28:36,962 --> 00:28:38,737
Oh, come off it, Phil.

532
00:28:39,572 --> 00:28:40,827
Yes?

533
00:28:41,838 --> 00:28:44,088
Oh, come in, Sergeant Cook.

534
00:28:45,130 --> 00:28:46,130
Tell me...

535
00:28:47,585 --> 00:28:50,238
What do you make of that?

536
00:28:50,313 --> 00:28:51,892
I wouldn't know what to make of it, sir.

537
00:28:51,967 --> 00:28:54,330
Oh, come, you're a woman.

538
00:28:54,405 --> 00:28:57,483
Where do you suppose a thing
like that could be bought?

539
00:28:57,558 --> 00:28:59,590
I wouldn't know, sir.

540
00:28:59,665 --> 00:29:01,018
No.

541
00:29:01,093 --> 00:29:04,414
Try Babette's, Shaftesbury Avenue.

542
00:29:04,489 --> 00:29:06,173
And how would you know?

543
00:29:06,248 --> 00:29:08,001
Just take my word for it.

544
00:29:08,076 --> 00:29:12,059
They cater for girls, who
like flashy, pretty underwear.

545
00:29:12,134 --> 00:29:13,766
It certainly isn't built for durability.

546
00:29:13,841 --> 00:29:15,228
No.

547
00:29:15,303 --> 00:29:17,269
Well, check on it, first thing
in the morning, will you?

548
00:29:17,344 --> 00:29:18,677
Babette's, you say?

549
00:29:18,752 --> 00:29:19,600
Shaftesbury Avenue.

550
00:29:19,675 --> 00:29:20,434
Shaftesbury Avenue.

551
00:29:20,509 --> 00:29:22,175
There's a good girl.

552
00:29:23,837 --> 00:29:27,504
I bet you her boyfriend
bought it for her.

553
00:29:30,228 --> 00:29:31,633
Going in today, David?

554
00:29:31,708 --> 00:29:32,557
Of course he is.

555
00:29:32,632 --> 00:29:34,576
I'm not going in.

556
00:29:34,651 --> 00:29:35,883
You've gotta face it some time, lad.

557
00:29:35,958 --> 00:29:38,042
Better now than later.

558
00:29:38,117 --> 00:29:39,905
It's in the paper this morning.

559
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:40,739
The autopsy --

560
00:29:40,814 --> 00:29:42,239
They don't mention David.

561
00:29:42,314 --> 00:29:43,841
Won't stop them guessing.

562
00:29:43,916 --> 00:29:47,120
Oh, David, even made you get
mixed up with a colored girl.

563
00:29:49,773 --> 00:29:51,106
I didn't know.

564
00:29:53,378 --> 00:29:55,097
When did you know?

565
00:29:55,172 --> 00:29:56,507
Last week.

566
00:29:56,582 --> 00:29:57,866
By then, I didn't care.

567
00:29:57,941 --> 00:29:59,416
That's what she banked on.

568
00:29:59,491 --> 00:30:01,314
Never say you didn't
know, 'til last week.

569
00:30:01,389 --> 00:30:02,389
Never.

570
00:30:03,757 --> 00:30:05,340
What's it matter?

571
00:30:08,668 --> 00:30:11,188
It gives you a motive,
that's what it matters.

572
00:30:11,263 --> 00:30:13,330
It gives us all a motive.

573
00:30:13,405 --> 00:30:16,781
None of us knew, 'til the weekend, did we?

574
00:30:16,856 --> 00:30:18,209
No.

575
00:30:18,284 --> 00:30:20,630
I'll never forget her,
standing here, Saturday.

576
00:30:20,705 --> 00:30:22,685
When Dad said he'd see
her brother, and tell him

577
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:26,725
that Davy would stand by
her, she laughed and said,

578
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:29,041
"He'll be a shock to you,
he's as black as a pot."

579
00:30:29,116 --> 00:30:30,051
Shut up!

580
00:30:30,126 --> 00:30:30,885
Millie.

581
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,263
Then she laughed some more, and said,

582
00:30:32,338 --> 00:30:35,921
"Don't look like that,
David doesn't care."

583
00:30:37,162 --> 00:30:39,107
Have you done your teeth?

584
00:30:39,182 --> 00:30:40,587
Hands well-scrubbed?

585
00:30:40,662 --> 00:30:41,662
Smell.

586
00:30:42,329 --> 00:30:44,476
Mm, lovely smell.

587
00:30:44,551 --> 00:30:47,785
Oh, Janice, I've got something for you.

588
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:48,619
Here you are.

589
00:30:48,694 --> 00:30:49,823
Now you've both got one.

590
00:30:49,898 --> 00:30:51,425
Ooh, thank you, granddad.

591
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:53,323
Granddad, will you make me another one?

592
00:30:53,398 --> 00:30:54,577
I can't find mine.

593
00:30:54,652 --> 00:30:56,231
Well, you'd better look for it.

594
00:30:56,306 --> 00:30:57,485
Buck up with your breakfast, you two,

595
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:59,331
and grampy will take you
to school, in the van.

596
00:30:59,406 --> 00:31:00,568
Don't bother, Dad.

597
00:31:00,643 --> 00:31:02,726
I'll take them to school.

598
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:08,962
Yes, I remember the girl.

599
00:31:09,037 --> 00:31:10,599
She used to spend quite
a bit of money here.

600
00:31:10,674 --> 00:31:12,793
She was a good customer,
for a little while.

601
00:31:12,868 --> 00:31:13,627
When?

602
00:31:13,702 --> 00:31:14,970
About six, seven months ago.

603
00:31:15,045 --> 00:31:15,803
Did she come alone?

604
00:31:15,878 --> 00:31:16,636
Usually.

605
00:31:16,711 --> 00:31:17,470
Mm.

606
00:31:17,545 --> 00:31:18,528
Except once.

607
00:31:18,603 --> 00:31:19,362
Well?

608
00:31:19,437 --> 00:31:21,193
She had a young fellow with her, then.

609
00:31:21,268 --> 00:31:22,307
Tall, thin boy, fair?

610
00:31:22,382 --> 00:31:24,902
No, I remember being very surprised.

611
00:31:24,977 --> 00:31:27,096
She was such a dainty kid, and he

612
00:31:27,171 --> 00:31:29,447
was a great, big colored chap.

613
00:31:29,522 --> 00:31:30,522
Colored.

614
00:31:31,995 --> 00:31:34,067
A great, big colored chap, she said.

615
00:31:34,902 --> 00:31:36,222
Mm, the other side of the picture.

616
00:31:36,297 --> 00:31:37,056
Hello.

617
00:31:37,131 --> 00:31:38,346
Before she learned she
could pass for white.

618
00:31:38,421 --> 00:31:39,896
Really?

619
00:31:39,971 --> 00:31:41,397
It's a doctor in Bloomsbury, says Sapphire

620
00:31:41,472 --> 00:31:43,870
went to see him on Saturday morning.

621
00:31:43,945 --> 00:31:44,914
Tell him we'll be right over.

622
00:31:44,989 --> 00:31:45,748
Alright.

623
00:31:45,823 --> 00:31:48,189
Sergeant, ring up the
Royal College of Music,

624
00:31:48,264 --> 00:31:49,338
and see if they have any record

625
00:31:49,413 --> 00:31:51,724
of Sapphire's previous addresses.

626
00:31:51,799 --> 00:31:53,187
Very good, sir.

627
00:31:53,262 --> 00:31:55,140
Oh, and then you can go
over to the Harris's place,

628
00:31:55,215 --> 00:31:56,272
and see if any of the neighbors

629
00:31:56,347 --> 00:31:58,930
saw the girl leave on Saturday.

630
00:32:00,721 --> 00:32:01,917
No, she wasn't a regular patient,

631
00:32:01,992 --> 00:32:03,693
I had never seen her before.

632
00:32:03,768 --> 00:32:04,999
She rang for an immediate appointment.

633
00:32:05,074 --> 00:32:06,880
I saw her at 12:30, on Saturday.

634
00:32:06,955 --> 00:32:08,221
Did you tell her at once?

635
00:32:08,296 --> 00:32:09,928
Yes, she was bursting to know.

636
00:32:10,003 --> 00:32:10,990
Was she upset?

637
00:32:11,065 --> 00:32:12,070
No, on the contrary.

638
00:32:12,145 --> 00:32:15,814
Excited, delighted at having
her own suspicions confirmed.

639
00:32:15,889 --> 00:32:17,225
What name did she use?

640
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:18,827
The one on the card.

641
00:32:18,902 --> 00:32:20,069
Mrs. Harris.

642
00:32:21,862 --> 00:32:23,930
Did she tell you she was colored?

643
00:32:24,005 --> 00:32:25,606
No, she didn't mention it.

644
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:27,199
I'll bet she didn't.

645
00:32:27,274 --> 00:32:29,659
But you can always tell, can't you?

646
00:32:29,734 --> 00:32:31,697
No, Inspector, as a
matter of fact, you can't.

647
00:32:31,772 --> 00:32:32,772
What?

648
00:32:33,546 --> 00:32:35,493
I can tell them, a mile away.

649
00:32:35,568 --> 00:32:37,548
Oh, I don't know, Inspector.

650
00:32:37,623 --> 00:32:40,195
Would you say you're a policeman?

651
00:32:40,270 --> 00:32:41,257
What?

652
00:32:41,332 --> 00:32:45,054
Well, you haven't got
very big feet, have you?

653
00:32:45,129 --> 00:32:46,221
Don't they say, you can
always tell a policeman

654
00:32:46,296 --> 00:32:49,930
a mile off, by the size of his feet?

655
00:32:50,005 --> 00:32:52,612
Oh, that's bloody silly!

656
00:32:52,687 --> 00:32:54,020
Yes, isn't it?

657
00:32:55,743 --> 00:32:56,641
Well, I'm afraid
there's nothing we can do

658
00:32:56,716 --> 00:33:00,022
about Learoyd's feet,
but regarding the girl,

659
00:33:00,097 --> 00:33:02,651
was there anything else
about her that struck you?

660
00:33:02,726 --> 00:33:05,403
Yes, I thought she was
a rather nice person.

661
00:33:05,478 --> 00:33:06,378
Well, thank you, Doctor.

662
00:33:06,453 --> 00:33:07,212
Not at all.

663
00:33:07,287 --> 00:33:09,791
You've been most helpful.

664
00:33:09,866 --> 00:33:10,624
Goodbye.

665
00:33:10,699 --> 00:33:11,533
Goodbye.

666
00:33:11,608 --> 00:33:12,608
Goodbye.

667
00:33:19,131 --> 00:33:21,128
She must've been pretty
sure about young Harris.

668
00:33:21,203 --> 00:33:21,962
At any rate, she thought he'd

669
00:33:22,037 --> 00:33:24,280
take the doctor's news happily enough.

670
00:33:24,355 --> 00:33:26,756
Perhaps, she summed the boy up wrongly.

671
00:33:26,831 --> 00:33:28,428
Any of the girl's
addresses come through?

672
00:33:28,503 --> 00:33:30,030
Yes, sir, a house in Bloomsbury,

673
00:33:30,105 --> 00:33:31,510
and before that, a place in Earl's Court,

674
00:33:31,585 --> 00:33:33,791
and another lead,
Chelsea Woman's Hospital.

675
00:33:33,866 --> 00:33:34,993
We'll try Earl's Court first.

676
00:33:35,068 --> 00:33:36,985
Yes, sir.

677
00:33:41,043 --> 00:33:42,936
Yes, I remember Sapphire Robbins.

678
00:33:43,011 --> 00:33:44,277
What sort of a girl was she?

679
00:33:44,352 --> 00:33:47,760
Nice enough girl,
considering she was colored.

680
00:33:47,835 --> 00:33:49,153
Oh, you knew then?

681
00:33:49,228 --> 00:33:49,987
I guessed.

682
00:33:50,062 --> 00:33:51,156
You can always tell.

683
00:33:51,231 --> 00:33:52,149
Too eager to please, laughed too

684
00:33:52,224 --> 00:33:54,383
much, noisy with her gramophone.

685
00:33:54,458 --> 00:33:56,926
But I never mind, so long
as they don't look it.

686
00:33:57,001 --> 00:33:59,120
Still, I had to get rid of her in the end.

687
00:33:59,195 --> 00:34:00,195
Why?

688
00:34:01,076 --> 00:34:02,899
Couldn't risk upsetting
the other tenants.

689
00:34:02,974 --> 00:34:05,267
Some big colored bloke
started calling for her.

690
00:34:05,342 --> 00:34:06,678
Black as your hat, he was.

691
00:34:06,753 --> 00:34:08,263
Well, I run a white house.

692
00:34:08,338 --> 00:34:10,771
You never can tell when
the others are gonna kick.

693
00:34:10,846 --> 00:34:12,181
What was this fella's name?

694
00:34:12,256 --> 00:34:13,905
I don't know.

695
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:15,177
Did she get any phone calls?

696
00:34:15,252 --> 00:34:17,771
One or two, from the International
Club, with her brother.

697
00:34:17,846 --> 00:34:20,593
Were surprised when
Sapphire got herself killed?

698
00:34:20,668 --> 00:34:22,822
All depends upon how
much hate she stirred up.

699
00:34:22,897 --> 00:34:23,897
Hate?

700
00:34:24,594 --> 00:34:26,330
I dare say, she was passing for white.

701
00:34:26,405 --> 00:34:27,619
So?

702
00:34:27,694 --> 00:34:28,453
Would you be pleased with

703
00:34:28,528 --> 00:34:31,642
a brass sovereign, Superintendent?

704
00:34:31,717 --> 00:34:32,739
Is that all?

705
00:34:32,814 --> 00:34:35,064
Yes, thank you very much.

706
00:34:36,523 --> 00:34:38,016
These landladies.

707
00:34:38,091 --> 00:34:39,287
They know it all, don't they?

708
00:34:39,362 --> 00:34:40,628
I wouldn't say that.

709
00:34:40,703 --> 00:34:43,345
After all, they've got a
living to earn, I suppose.

710
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:44,720
Chelsea Women's Hospital, isn't it?

711
00:34:44,795 --> 00:34:45,795
Yeah.

712
00:34:46,662 --> 00:34:48,079
Miss Mary Dawson.

713
00:35:00,532 --> 00:35:01,554
Miss Dawson?

714
00:35:01,629 --> 00:35:02,634
Yes?

715
00:35:02,709 --> 00:35:05,960
My name is Hazard, this
is Inspector Learoyd.

716
00:35:06,035 --> 00:35:08,485
You want to talk to me about Sapphire?

717
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:09,444
Yes.

718
00:35:09,519 --> 00:35:11,167
I saw it in the paper.

719
00:35:11,242 --> 00:35:12,839
It upset me very much.

720
00:35:12,914 --> 00:35:14,215
Did you like Sapphire?

721
00:35:14,290 --> 00:35:15,486
Yes, I did.

722
00:35:15,561 --> 00:35:17,994
Tell me, was she fond of dancing?

723
00:35:18,069 --> 00:35:19,422
Mad about it.

724
00:35:19,497 --> 00:35:21,494
Who were her dancing partners?

725
00:35:21,569 --> 00:35:24,298
Ray Landa, Paul Slade.

726
00:35:24,373 --> 00:35:25,292
Mm-hmm.

727
00:35:25,367 --> 00:35:26,963
How can we get in
touch with these people?

728
00:35:27,038 --> 00:35:29,314
Ray Landa went home to
Nigeria, six months ago,

729
00:35:29,389 --> 00:35:31,891
but I can give you Paul
Slade's telephone number.

730
00:35:31,966 --> 00:35:32,850
And what is that?

731
00:35:32,925 --> 00:35:35,148
Chancery, 2-4-9-6.

732
00:35:35,223 --> 00:35:36,227
Thank you.

733
00:35:36,302 --> 00:35:39,606
Paul Slade was a law student
then, now he's a barista.

734
00:35:39,681 --> 00:35:40,703
Well, thank you, Miss Dawson.

735
00:35:40,778 --> 00:35:42,671
You've been most helpful.

736
00:35:42,746 --> 00:35:46,572
Tell me, why did you stop seeing Sapphire?

737
00:35:46,647 --> 00:35:47,930
She stopped seeing me.

738
00:35:48,005 --> 00:35:50,755
I'm rather distinctive, you know.

739
00:35:54,431 --> 00:35:55,514
Hello, Ted.

740
00:35:57,183 --> 00:35:58,683
He's down there.

741
00:36:07,527 --> 00:36:08,689
He's been back and forth,

742
00:36:08,764 --> 00:36:10,465
along that footpath, all afternoon.

743
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:11,789
What's he looking for?

744
00:36:11,864 --> 00:36:13,095
Search me.

745
00:36:13,170 --> 00:36:15,777
Whatever it is, he hasn't found it.

746
00:36:15,852 --> 00:36:16,852
See you.

747
00:36:23,348 --> 00:36:24,443
None of the neighbors saw Sapphire

748
00:36:24,518 --> 00:36:26,987
leave Harris's house on Saturday, sir.

749
00:36:27,822 --> 00:36:28,794
Yes?

750
00:36:28,869 --> 00:36:29,943
Mr. Paul Slade, sir.

751
00:36:30,018 --> 00:36:31,911
Oh, bring him in.

752
00:36:31,986 --> 00:36:33,357
The dancing lawyer.

753
00:36:33,432 --> 00:36:34,245
I beg your pardon, sir?

754
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:35,078
Huh?

755
00:36:35,153 --> 00:36:36,022
Oh, it doesn't matter.

756
00:36:36,097 --> 00:36:38,429
This way, sir.

757
00:36:39,736 --> 00:36:40,637
Oh, it's very good of you

758
00:36:40,712 --> 00:36:42,015
to come all this way, Mr. Slade.

759
00:36:42,090 --> 00:36:42,849
Not at all.

760
00:36:42,924 --> 00:36:44,000
Thank you, Sergeant.

761
00:36:44,075 --> 00:36:46,717
I'd rather call on you,
than have you call on me.

762
00:36:46,792 --> 00:36:50,060
My father's in London for a
conference at Lambeth Palace.

763
00:36:50,135 --> 00:36:51,666
I don't think there's a Bishop
living, that appreciates

764
00:36:51,741 --> 00:36:54,170
his son being mixed up in a murder

765
00:36:54,245 --> 00:36:56,662
inquiry, however, indirectly.

766
00:36:59,385 --> 00:37:02,201
Here, won't you sit down?

767
00:37:02,276 --> 00:37:04,109
Here let me take that.

768
00:37:07,536 --> 00:37:10,352
I understand you knew Sapphire Robbins.

769
00:37:10,427 --> 00:37:11,538
Very well.

770
00:37:11,613 --> 00:37:12,371
May I?

771
00:37:12,446 --> 00:37:13,446
Please do.

772
00:37:14,905 --> 00:37:16,072
Oh, thank you.

773
00:37:19,085 --> 00:37:20,925
Where'd you first meet her?

774
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,294
At the International Club.

775
00:37:23,369 --> 00:37:26,798
One of those, get together,
let's be brothers, places.

776
00:37:29,499 --> 00:37:32,332
How long since you've last saw her?

777
00:37:32,407 --> 00:37:34,240
Seven, eight months.

778
00:37:36,012 --> 00:37:39,054
Has she any other
friends, besides yourself?

779
00:37:39,129 --> 00:37:40,796
Chap called Ray Landa.

780
00:37:40,871 --> 00:37:42,102
He's gone home, I believe.

781
00:37:42,177 --> 00:37:44,453
Anyone else?

782
00:37:44,528 --> 00:37:46,891
Not that I know of.

783
00:37:46,966 --> 00:37:50,095
You sent for me to ask
where I was on Saturday.

784
00:37:50,170 --> 00:37:53,108
I was meeting my father,
off a boat at Southampton.

785
00:37:53,183 --> 00:37:55,041
We stayed the night, and I drove him

786
00:37:55,116 --> 00:37:57,235
back to town on Sunday morning.

787
00:37:57,310 --> 00:37:58,310
Thank you.

788
00:37:59,731 --> 00:38:03,122
Did you ever have a photograph
taken with Sapphire?

789
00:38:03,197 --> 00:38:04,197
Yes.

790
00:38:05,095 --> 00:38:06,095
In a group.

791
00:38:06,958 --> 00:38:08,799
Did you ever have one taken alone,

792
00:38:08,874 --> 00:38:10,697
dancing at the nightclub?

793
00:38:10,772 --> 00:38:13,272
Never alone, Superintendent.

794
00:38:14,464 --> 00:38:17,297
Do you ever take her
shopping, in Shaftesbury Avenue?

795
00:38:17,372 --> 00:38:18,817
Babette's, for instance.

796
00:38:19,651 --> 00:38:20,410
Good lord, no.

797
00:38:20,485 --> 00:38:21,738
Why?

798
00:38:21,813 --> 00:38:23,669
Well, if you didn't, it doesn't matter.

799
00:38:23,744 --> 00:38:26,361
What sort of a girl was Sapphire?

800
00:38:26,436 --> 00:38:28,971
Oh, neither one thing or
the other, when I knew her.

801
00:38:29,046 --> 00:38:30,176
I imagine she changed after she

802
00:38:30,251 --> 00:38:32,751
got this yearn to marry light.

803
00:38:33,992 --> 00:38:35,606
If you know what I mean.

804
00:38:35,681 --> 00:38:36,964
I do.

805
00:38:37,039 --> 00:38:38,654
That ruled you out, anyway.

806
00:38:38,729 --> 00:38:39,786
The question of
marriage, between Sapphire

807
00:38:39,861 --> 00:38:42,119
and myself, could never have arisen.

808
00:38:42,194 --> 00:38:42,953
How's that?

809
00:38:43,028 --> 00:38:44,801
My father would never have permitted it.

810
00:38:44,876 --> 00:38:46,038
Why not?

811
00:38:46,113 --> 00:38:47,936
Sapphire came from a good home.

812
00:38:48,011 --> 00:38:50,426
Her brother's a doctor.

813
00:38:50,501 --> 00:38:52,251
She was part white.

814
00:38:56,927 --> 00:38:58,019
Is that all?

815
00:38:58,094 --> 00:39:00,427
Well, for the moment, yes.

816
00:39:01,403 --> 00:39:04,933
If we need you, we'll send for you.

817
00:39:05,008 --> 00:39:05,995
Any help I can give.

818
00:39:06,070 --> 00:39:07,070
Thank you.

819
00:39:12,653 --> 00:39:13,653
Hmm.

820
00:39:21,657 --> 00:39:22,714
Did he ask about Johnnie?

821
00:39:22,789 --> 00:39:23,548
No.

822
00:39:23,623 --> 00:39:25,099
Good.

823
00:39:25,174 --> 00:39:27,363
My old man knew I'd been
around places like Tulip's,

824
00:39:27,438 --> 00:39:30,916
he'd cut off my allowance,
and yank me back home.

825
00:39:30,991 --> 00:39:32,988
Is this policeman likely to get onto it?

826
00:39:33,063 --> 00:39:34,538
Shouldn't think so.

827
00:39:34,613 --> 00:39:37,342
Didn't strike me as being
overburdened with brains.

828
00:39:37,417 --> 00:39:38,834
Sanctimonious...

829
00:39:39,803 --> 00:39:42,723
Always so careful to
have his hand out first.

830
00:39:42,798 --> 00:39:44,029
I know.

831
00:39:44,104 --> 00:39:46,851
We're all the children of God.

832
00:39:46,926 --> 00:39:48,213
Forget it.

833
00:39:58,108 --> 00:40:00,768
I see you've been talking to Slade.

834
00:40:00,843 --> 00:40:02,701
I suppose he's got a cast iron alibi?

835
00:40:02,776 --> 00:40:03,833
Yes.

836
00:40:03,908 --> 00:40:04,908
Yeah.

837
00:40:06,938 --> 00:40:09,493
But there's something
he didn't want me to know.

838
00:40:09,568 --> 00:40:10,781
What's that?

839
00:40:10,856 --> 00:40:12,106
I don't know.

840
00:40:13,872 --> 00:40:17,994
He said he met Sapphire
at the International Club.

841
00:40:18,069 --> 00:40:20,171
Get on to him, find out
what time all the kids

842
00:40:20,246 --> 00:40:21,892
are likely to be there together.

843
00:40:21,967 --> 00:40:22,967
Okay.

844
00:40:23,633 --> 00:40:24,391
Yes?

845
00:40:24,466 --> 00:40:25,225
What is it, Sergeant?

846
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:26,305
It's about young Harris, sir.

847
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:27,139
What about him?

848
00:40:27,214 --> 00:40:28,203
He's up on the Heath.

849
00:40:28,278 --> 00:40:31,938
He's been there all afternoon,
looking for something.

850
00:41:27,432 --> 00:41:29,307
He pushed it down the drain, sir.

851
00:41:29,382 --> 00:41:30,787
It was quite deliberate, so I thought

852
00:41:30,862 --> 00:41:33,435
I'd best find out what it was.

853
00:41:33,510 --> 00:41:35,681
Well, it's a piece of wood.

854
00:41:35,756 --> 00:41:37,266
Must've been painted at some time.

855
00:41:37,341 --> 00:41:39,707
Look, you can see the red and blue marks.

856
00:41:39,782 --> 00:41:40,782
Yeah.

857
00:41:41,837 --> 00:41:44,252
Been jointed at both ends.

858
00:41:44,327 --> 00:41:46,882
Must've come off something.

859
00:41:46,957 --> 00:41:49,236
Off what, I wonder.

860
00:41:49,311 --> 00:41:50,957
Take this to the lab, and
see what they make of it.

861
00:41:51,032 --> 00:41:53,029
Very good, sir.

862
00:41:53,104 --> 00:41:54,213
Now, why on earth should that boy

863
00:41:54,288 --> 00:41:58,606
be so anxious to find that,
and then get rid of it?

864
00:42:38,279 --> 00:42:40,362
You didn't go in today?

865
00:42:42,824 --> 00:42:45,187
Davy, this is a terrible
thing that's happened,

866
00:42:45,262 --> 00:42:47,451
but you've got to pull yourself together.

867
00:42:47,526 --> 00:42:49,814
In three weeks, you'll be going away.

868
00:42:49,889 --> 00:42:51,806
Rome, it's a new world.

869
00:42:52,945 --> 00:42:56,423
New people, new places, you'll forget.

870
00:42:56,498 --> 00:42:57,498
I shan't.

871
00:42:58,953 --> 00:42:59,953
I can't.

872
00:43:01,652 --> 00:43:05,569
Davy, you did speak
the truth about Saturday?

873
00:43:06,755 --> 00:43:09,588
You didn't meet Sapphire, did you?

874
00:43:12,972 --> 00:43:16,139
Davy, what happened on Saturday night?

875
00:43:19,137 --> 00:43:22,824
Mum, never ask
what happened on Saturday.

876
00:43:22,899 --> 00:43:23,899
Never.

877
00:43:24,919 --> 00:43:25,919
Davy.

878
00:43:28,767 --> 00:43:31,131
You didn't meet Sapphire
on Saturday, did you?

879
00:43:31,206 --> 00:43:32,263
Answer me, Davy, did you?

880
00:43:32,338 --> 00:43:33,395
Granny?

881
00:43:33,470 --> 00:43:34,229
There are the twins.

882
00:43:34,304 --> 00:43:36,236
Answer me, Davy!

883
00:43:36,311 --> 00:43:37,647
Granny?

884
00:43:37,722 --> 00:43:39,336
Alright, kids, Granny's here.

885
00:43:39,411 --> 00:43:42,087
Granny, Granny.

886
00:43:42,162 --> 00:43:43,237
What's the matter?

887
00:43:43,312 --> 00:43:45,083
I thought you'd gone to
tea with Molly Turnbul.

888
00:43:45,158 --> 00:43:47,347
Her mother didn't want us.

889
00:43:47,422 --> 00:43:48,181
Why?

890
00:43:48,256 --> 00:43:52,422
She said we were a funny
family, and she doesn't want us.

891
00:43:55,015 --> 00:43:56,515
What's happened?

892
00:43:58,776 --> 00:44:00,359
What is it, Mother?

893
00:44:01,563 --> 00:44:04,980
Go and take your hats and coats off, hmm?

894
00:44:07,013 --> 00:44:08,013
What is it?

895
00:44:09,243 --> 00:44:12,912
Mrs. Turnbul wouldn't
have the twins for tea.

896
00:44:12,987 --> 00:44:16,084
I think they ought to go and
stay with Katie in Richmond.

897
00:44:16,159 --> 00:44:17,651
Oh, I don't know what Sid would say.

898
00:44:17,726 --> 00:44:20,020
Oh, stop pretending about Sid.

899
00:44:20,095 --> 00:44:22,719
He doesn't care whether
they're here, or in Timbuktu.

900
00:44:22,794 --> 00:44:26,376
He's a bad husband and a bad father.

901
00:44:26,451 --> 00:44:27,210
Right, Mom.

902
00:44:27,285 --> 00:44:30,225
I'll get Dad to drive them down, tomorrow.

903
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:32,332
Ring Katie now.

904
00:44:32,407 --> 00:44:33,516
Alright.

905
00:44:33,591 --> 00:44:34,591
Mildred?

906
00:44:36,012 --> 00:44:39,072
What time did you leave
Sapphire on Saturday?

907
00:44:39,147 --> 00:44:41,005
Half one, mum.

908
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:44,314
Then, I went back to the
shop, left her here with Dad.

909
00:44:44,389 --> 00:44:46,560
Then only Dad was at home.

910
00:44:46,635 --> 00:44:47,394
That's right.

911
00:44:47,469 --> 00:44:48,789
Davy wasn't?

912
00:44:48,864 --> 00:44:50,409
No, he didn't get in 'til 11.

913
00:44:50,484 --> 00:44:52,394
Did you see him?

914
00:44:52,469 --> 00:44:55,076
No, I was in bed, but Dad was up.

915
00:44:55,151 --> 00:44:56,330
Then we've only got Dad's word that

916
00:44:56,405 --> 00:44:59,624
he came in, when he said he did.

917
00:44:59,699 --> 00:45:00,699
Mum.

918
00:45:03,705 --> 00:45:05,998
What are you thinking?

919
00:45:06,073 --> 00:45:07,073
Nothing.

920
00:45:08,947 --> 00:45:12,864
I'll ring Katie, you see
to the children's tea.

921
00:45:22,419 --> 00:45:24,869
Oh, dear, we'll never live it down.

922
00:45:24,944 --> 00:45:25,914
Who says?

923
00:45:25,989 --> 00:45:27,865
Molly Turnbul's mother.

924
00:45:27,940 --> 00:45:29,310
What won't we live down?

925
00:45:29,385 --> 00:45:31,034
I don't know, but it's something

926
00:45:31,109 --> 00:45:32,445
to do with Auntie Sapphire.

927
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:34,034
She's dead!

928
00:45:37,272 --> 00:45:39,170
Time to settle down now, children.

929
00:45:39,245 --> 00:45:42,822
Mommy, why are we going
to stay with Auntie Katie?

930
00:45:42,897 --> 00:45:45,285
Ask no questions, and
you'll be told no lies.

931
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:47,636
It's because of
Auntie Sapphire, isn't it?

932
00:45:47,711 --> 00:45:49,726
No, and don't call her Auntie.

933
00:45:49,801 --> 00:45:51,955
She's nothing to us, and she never was.

934
00:45:52,030 --> 00:45:53,030
Night, my darling.

935
00:45:53,705 --> 00:45:55,371
Good night, Mommy.

936
00:46:00,743 --> 00:46:02,531
Good night, my love.

937
00:46:02,606 --> 00:46:04,273
Good night, Mommy.

938
00:46:11,627 --> 00:46:13,032
Straight off to sleep, no talking.

939
00:46:13,107 --> 00:46:17,230
- Yes, mommy.
- Good night.

940
00:46:17,305 --> 00:46:19,618
I've told you a
dozen, if I've told you once,

941
00:46:19,693 --> 00:46:22,021
so why go on arguing about it?

942
00:46:22,096 --> 00:46:24,756
David came in at 11 o'clock!

943
00:46:24,831 --> 00:46:27,298
That's what I told the
police, and it's the truth.

944
00:46:27,373 --> 00:46:28,132
What you told the police,

945
00:46:28,207 --> 00:46:29,649
Ted, but is it the truth?

946
00:46:29,724 --> 00:46:30,868
Stop accusing, David.

947
00:46:30,943 --> 00:46:32,087
Please, Mum!

948
00:46:32,162 --> 00:46:34,560
Millie, if we're to help him,
we've got to know the truth.

949
00:46:34,635 --> 00:46:36,249
Lies are never any good.

950
00:46:36,324 --> 00:46:38,991
Who says David's telling lies?

951
00:46:40,315 --> 00:46:41,895
I don't want any supper, Mom.

952
00:46:41,970 --> 00:46:43,137
I'm going out.

953
00:46:43,990 --> 00:46:46,388
Where are you going, son?

954
00:46:46,463 --> 00:46:48,796
I'm going for a walk, mum.

955
00:46:49,928 --> 00:46:52,428
Don't be too late, will you?

956
00:47:53,988 --> 00:47:54,803
I don't think you'll find who

957
00:47:54,878 --> 00:47:56,595
you're looking for here, Superintendent.

958
00:47:56,670 --> 00:47:58,615
We haven't seen Sapphire
for six, seven months.

959
00:47:58,690 --> 00:48:00,792
We're merely trying to fill
in her background, Mr. Young.

960
00:48:00,867 --> 00:48:01,977
As you wish.

961
00:48:02,052 --> 00:48:02,810
This way.

962
00:48:02,885 --> 00:48:03,885
Thank you.

963
00:48:10,463 --> 00:48:12,296
I'll get some quiet.

964
00:48:13,615 --> 00:48:15,006
Quiet, everybody, please!

965
00:48:15,081 --> 00:48:17,267
Quiet, please, everybody!

966
00:48:17,342 --> 00:48:19,740
Just gather around me, will you?

967
00:48:19,815 --> 00:48:21,029
Won't keep you a moment, but these

968
00:48:21,104 --> 00:48:23,558
gentlemen are police officers.

969
00:48:24,393 --> 00:48:28,134
They want to ask you a few
questions about Sapphire Robbins.

970
00:48:28,209 --> 00:48:31,338
Was anyone here a particular
friend of Sapphire's?

971
00:48:31,413 --> 00:48:33,167
We all were, weren't we?

972
00:48:33,242 --> 00:48:34,242
Once.

973
00:48:35,349 --> 00:48:36,667
What do you mean, once?

974
00:48:36,742 --> 00:48:39,784
I mean, she stopped coming here.

975
00:48:39,859 --> 00:48:40,795
Why?

976
00:48:40,870 --> 00:48:42,417
They drift away, Superintendent.

977
00:48:42,492 --> 00:48:43,810
Grow out of us.

978
00:48:43,885 --> 00:48:45,447
Sapphire didn't drift away.

979
00:48:45,522 --> 00:48:46,927
She used to come here regularly,

980
00:48:47,002 --> 00:48:49,734
then suddenly, she never came again.

981
00:48:49,809 --> 00:48:50,950
Why was that?

982
00:48:51,025 --> 00:48:53,737
Sapphire found she could pass for white.

983
00:48:53,812 --> 00:48:56,331
I was there when it happened.

984
00:48:56,406 --> 00:48:57,406
Tell me.

985
00:48:58,099 --> 00:49:01,225
We've just finished coffee,
I went to pay the bill.

986
00:49:01,300 --> 00:49:04,952
A white lady came in, took
one look at my black mug,

987
00:49:05,027 --> 00:49:08,944
and said, "Oh, I see
you've let the jungle in."

988
00:49:09,816 --> 00:49:13,241
She said this to Sapphire, you
see, like they were the same.

989
00:49:13,316 --> 00:49:15,418
Sapphire left before I got my change.

990
00:49:15,493 --> 00:49:18,036
When I went outside, she had gone.

991
00:49:18,111 --> 00:49:19,861
Silly little peasant.

992
00:49:21,751 --> 00:49:23,539
Did you ever dance with Sapphire?

993
00:49:23,614 --> 00:49:25,193
No, not me.

994
00:49:25,268 --> 00:49:27,109
Slade, Ray Landa, they were her

995
00:49:27,184 --> 00:49:29,851
partners, and wishy-washy there.

996
00:49:30,702 --> 00:49:32,473
Where did you dance with her?

997
00:49:32,548 --> 00:49:33,548
Here, sir.

998
00:49:34,394 --> 00:49:36,078
Did she mention anyone else?

999
00:49:36,153 --> 00:49:37,575
Outside the club, I mean.

1000
00:49:37,650 --> 00:49:39,300
No.

1001
00:49:39,375 --> 00:49:41,947
Well, if you do remember
anything, speak to Mr. Young.

1002
00:49:42,022 --> 00:49:45,272
He'll know how to get in touch with us.

1003
00:49:46,219 --> 00:49:46,978
Well, I think you're right.

1004
00:49:47,053 --> 00:49:48,529
I didn't actually find anything here.

1005
00:49:48,604 --> 00:49:49,363
Thank you so much.

1006
00:49:49,438 --> 00:49:52,437
Everybody's been most kind of you.

1007
00:49:53,489 --> 00:49:54,248
I'll see you out.

1008
00:49:54,323 --> 00:49:56,653
Please don't bother,
you'll miss the performance.

1009
00:49:56,728 --> 00:49:58,395
Right.

1010
00:49:59,288 --> 00:50:00,676
He's a good pianist.

1011
00:50:00,751 --> 00:50:03,027
Yes, and he's lucky.

1012
00:50:03,102 --> 00:50:05,152
He'll be accepted for what he is.

1013
00:50:05,227 --> 00:50:06,284
What's that?

1014
00:50:06,359 --> 00:50:07,776
A good pianist.

1015
00:50:20,987 --> 00:50:22,706
There's a
young lady in the car, sir.

1016
00:50:22,781 --> 00:50:24,186
I thought as much.

1017
00:50:24,261 --> 00:50:25,196
Drive around the block.

1018
00:50:25,271 --> 00:50:26,607
Phil, get in the front.

1019
00:50:26,682 --> 00:50:29,099
Very good, sir.

1020
00:50:30,583 --> 00:50:32,737
Yes, I know a lot about
Sapphire they don't know.

1021
00:50:32,812 --> 00:50:33,812
Go on.

1022
00:50:34,815 --> 00:50:37,004
The rhythm of the club, it
wasn't hot enough for her,

1023
00:50:37,079 --> 00:50:37,921
so Paul Slade used to take her

1024
00:50:37,996 --> 00:50:40,681
to Tulip's, a dive in Shepherd's Bush.

1025
00:50:40,756 --> 00:50:42,022
Oh, dear.

1026
00:50:42,097 --> 00:50:43,136
His father, the bishop, huh?

1027
00:50:43,211 --> 00:50:44,808
Yes, I know his reverence.

1028
00:50:44,883 --> 00:50:46,132
He'd as soon see his precious son

1029
00:50:46,207 --> 00:50:47,911
in hell fire, as at Tulip's.

1030
00:50:47,986 --> 00:50:51,011
Paul got into a fight
there, over Sapphire.

1031
00:50:51,086 --> 00:50:53,188
Well, who did he fight with?

1032
00:50:53,263 --> 00:50:54,633
Oh, Johnnie someone.

1033
00:50:54,708 --> 00:50:56,691
Big, ugly fellow, he said.

1034
00:50:56,766 --> 00:51:00,539
Sapphire danced crazy
with him, real crazy.

1035
00:51:00,614 --> 00:51:02,472
Paul dropped her after that.

1036
00:51:02,547 --> 00:51:03,866
Poor Sapphire.

1037
00:51:03,941 --> 00:51:05,259
Oh, she couldn't care less.

1038
00:51:05,334 --> 00:51:06,948
She'd got Johnnie then.

1039
00:51:07,023 --> 00:51:08,289
Of course, he didn't last very long,

1040
00:51:08,364 --> 00:51:10,814
when his color went out of fashion.

1041
00:51:10,889 --> 00:51:12,416
How did you know that?

1042
00:51:12,491 --> 00:51:14,506
He rang up, left a message for her.

1043
00:51:14,581 --> 00:51:16,492
"Ring Johnnie at Tulip's."

1044
00:51:16,567 --> 00:51:19,374
Sapphire had gone white
then, so we never saw her.

1045
00:51:19,449 --> 00:51:21,669
I told him, he was mad.

1046
00:51:21,744 --> 00:51:22,576
They'd entered for some dancing

1047
00:51:22,651 --> 00:51:25,400
competition, cash prize, he said.

1048
00:51:26,313 --> 00:51:28,780
You didn't like Sapphire?

1049
00:51:28,855 --> 00:51:32,698
No, I was Paul Slade's
girlfriend, 'til she cut me out.

1050
00:51:32,773 --> 00:51:35,356
I hated that high yellow doll.

1051
00:51:37,632 --> 00:51:41,597
You can drop me anywhere
here, I'll walk back.

1052
00:51:41,672 --> 00:51:42,938
What are you studying?

1053
00:51:43,013 --> 00:51:45,028
Montessori, child welfare.

1054
00:51:45,103 --> 00:51:46,421
I shan't bother with it though.

1055
00:51:46,496 --> 00:51:47,675
Why not?

1056
00:51:47,750 --> 00:51:49,591
I want to get married, stay here.

1057
00:51:49,666 --> 00:51:51,249
I like the English.

1058
00:51:58,130 --> 00:51:59,605
Well, thank you.

1059
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:00,439
Bye bye.

1060
00:52:00,514 --> 00:52:02,168
By the way, did you give this

1061
00:52:02,243 --> 00:52:04,220
Johnnie, Sapphire's new address?

1062
00:52:04,295 --> 00:52:05,839
Oh, no, I wouldn't do that.

1063
00:52:05,914 --> 00:52:07,546
Perhaps he got it from
someone else though, huh?

1064
00:52:07,621 --> 00:52:08,379
Mm-hmm.

1065
00:52:08,454 --> 00:52:09,213
Try Tulip's Club, Shepherd's Bush.

1066
00:52:09,288 --> 00:52:10,294
I will.

1067
00:52:10,369 --> 00:52:11,128
Good night.

1068
00:52:11,203 --> 00:52:12,285
Good night.

1069
00:52:54,045 --> 00:52:55,346
Two beers.

1070
00:52:55,421 --> 00:52:56,179
No beer, sir.

1071
00:52:56,254 --> 00:52:57,013
Two beers.

1072
00:52:57,088 --> 00:52:58,916
Scotch, Irish, and Bourbon, sir.

1073
00:52:58,991 --> 00:52:59,979
Buy me a drink, copper.

1074
00:53:00,054 --> 00:53:01,755
Three beers.

1075
00:53:01,830 --> 00:53:03,200
Ever heard of Sapphire?

1076
00:53:03,275 --> 00:53:04,090
Double, sir?

1077
00:53:04,165 --> 00:53:05,331
Three beers.

1078
00:53:07,403 --> 00:53:09,121
The chick that was
dead on Hampstead Heath?

1079
00:53:09,196 --> 00:53:10,480
That's the chick.

1080
00:53:10,555 --> 00:53:12,305
10 schillings, sir.

1081
00:53:13,724 --> 00:53:16,474
Sorry I've got nothing smaller.

1082
00:53:17,329 --> 00:53:18,473
10 schillings, sir.

1083
00:53:18,548 --> 00:53:20,048
Keep the change.

1084
00:53:21,544 --> 00:53:24,294
Now then, ever heard of Sapphire?

1085
00:53:27,134 --> 00:53:29,027
Down the hatch, copper.

1086
00:53:29,102 --> 00:53:31,102
Is Johnnie in tonight?

1087
00:53:33,421 --> 00:53:35,418
Johnnie, is he in tonight?

1088
00:53:35,493 --> 00:53:36,811
Talking to me, sir?

1089
00:53:36,886 --> 00:53:37,874
Yes.

1090
00:53:37,949 --> 00:53:40,521
Lots of Johnnie here tonight, sir.

1091
00:53:40,596 --> 00:53:42,096
Johnnie Fingers...

1092
00:53:43,904 --> 00:53:45,571
Johnnie Heartbeat...

1093
00:53:52,264 --> 00:53:53,514
Johnnie Rags...

1094
00:53:56,443 --> 00:53:58,943
And Johnnie Tiger, over there.

1095
00:54:02,521 --> 00:54:05,267
Sure, all the Johnnies in the
world are here tonight, sir.

1096
00:54:05,342 --> 00:54:09,509
We want the Johnnie, who
danced with this chick.

1097
00:54:15,635 --> 00:54:18,968
This chick was never here at all, sir.

1098
00:54:19,842 --> 00:54:22,592
Can I help you, Superintendent?

1099
00:54:25,340 --> 00:54:26,099
Mr. Tulip?

1100
00:54:26,174 --> 00:54:27,407
That's what they call me.

1101
00:54:27,482 --> 00:54:28,452
We're looking for the Johnnie,

1102
00:54:28,527 --> 00:54:30,664
who used to dance with Sapphire.

1103
00:54:30,739 --> 00:54:31,906
This Sapphire.

1104
00:54:34,500 --> 00:54:35,280
You mean the chick that was cut

1105
00:54:35,355 --> 00:54:36,951
up on Hampstead Heath, Saturday night?

1106
00:54:37,026 --> 00:54:37,785
Mm-hmm.

1107
00:54:37,860 --> 00:54:41,192
She's new to me, I never saw her here.

1108
00:54:44,601 --> 00:54:46,184
That's a lily skin.

1109
00:54:51,637 --> 00:54:53,744
Your chick was a lily skin, wasn't she?

1110
00:54:53,819 --> 00:54:54,578
Hmm?

1111
00:54:54,653 --> 00:54:56,496
It's in the evening papers.

1112
00:54:56,571 --> 00:54:59,561
I think I would've remembered,
if she'd ever been in here.

1113
00:54:59,636 --> 00:55:01,912
Oh, you can always tell.

1114
00:55:01,987 --> 00:55:05,654
'Cause once they hear
the beat of the bongo.

1115
00:56:00,536 --> 00:56:03,178
Yes, no matter how fair the skin,

1116
00:56:03,253 --> 00:56:05,790
they can't hide that swing.

1117
00:56:05,865 --> 00:56:08,089
Your chick was never here, Superintendent.

1118
00:56:08,164 --> 00:56:11,831
Somewhere else, she
danced with her Johnnie.

1119
00:56:15,757 --> 00:56:17,757
Let's get out of here.

1120
00:56:31,993 --> 00:56:35,140
Blow, Johnnie,
and don't come back.

1121
00:56:35,215 --> 00:56:37,882
You're wearing too much trouble.

1122
00:56:46,440 --> 00:56:47,440
Johnnie!

1123
00:56:49,505 --> 00:56:52,704
Where was you on Saturday night, Johnnie?

1124
00:56:52,779 --> 00:56:54,696
You wasn't in the club.

1125
00:56:56,317 --> 00:56:58,150
Was you with Sapphire?

1126
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:00,817
Was you, Johnnie?

1127
00:57:02,064 --> 00:57:04,480
You blow, Johnnie, blow!

1128
00:57:04,555 --> 00:57:07,144
Can't blow without loot.

1129
00:57:07,219 --> 00:57:09,052
I'll bring you loot.

1130
00:57:29,417 --> 00:57:30,500
That's him.

1131
00:57:58,901 --> 00:57:59,844
I'm in trouble.

1132
00:57:59,919 --> 00:58:02,247
The police, I got to hideout.

1133
00:58:02,322 --> 00:58:03,081
We have never been in trouble

1134
00:58:03,156 --> 00:58:05,260
with the law, and don't care to be.

1135
00:58:05,335 --> 00:58:06,496
Gone away with you, boy.

1136
00:58:06,571 --> 00:58:07,330
It's you and your kind, that gets

1137
00:58:07,405 --> 00:58:09,287
us respectable folk a bad name.

1138
00:58:12,666 --> 00:58:13,666
Trash.

1139
00:58:20,224 --> 00:58:22,243
The police, on my tail.

1140
00:58:23,464 --> 00:58:24,695
Get out, nigger.

1141
00:58:24,770 --> 00:58:26,036
We got copper trouble, too, but we ain't

1142
00:58:26,111 --> 00:58:28,056
got your sort of woman trouble.

1143
00:58:28,131 --> 00:58:29,715
Now, get out and stay out.

1144
00:58:39,102 --> 00:58:40,519
Dirty black pest.

1145
00:58:54,916 --> 00:58:57,157
What's the hurry, nigger?

1146
00:58:57,232 --> 00:58:58,550
Out of the way, nig.

1147
00:58:58,625 --> 00:59:00,988
On your way then, sonny boy.

1148
00:59:01,063 --> 00:59:02,804
And hurry!

1149
00:59:24,628 --> 00:59:26,016
They're after me, please.

1150
00:59:26,091 --> 00:59:26,849
Who's after you?

1151
00:59:26,924 --> 00:59:27,682
The teds?

1152
00:59:27,757 --> 00:59:28,576
Please help.

1153
00:59:28,651 --> 00:59:29,410
I daren't.

1154
00:59:29,485 --> 00:59:30,509
They'd break the place to pieces,

1155
00:59:30,584 --> 00:59:31,623
tear the shop down.

1156
00:59:31,698 --> 00:59:32,860
It's my livin', boy.

1157
00:59:32,935 --> 00:59:33,870
Please, mister.

1158
00:59:33,945 --> 00:59:35,350
I tell you, I daren't.

1159
00:59:35,425 --> 00:59:36,309
Dad, you've got to.

1160
00:59:36,384 --> 00:59:37,701
He's in trouble.

1161
00:59:37,776 --> 00:59:38,677
I tell you, I daren't.

1162
00:59:38,752 --> 00:59:40,122
You've got to, dad.

1163
00:59:40,197 --> 00:59:41,289
Come in.

1164
00:59:41,364 --> 00:59:42,364
This way.

1165
01:00:07,032 --> 01:00:08,855
Where were you on
Saturday night, Johnnie?

1166
01:00:08,930 --> 01:00:09,688
On the streets.

1167
01:00:09,763 --> 01:00:10,521
With Sapphire?

1168
01:00:10,596 --> 01:00:11,354
No boss, no!

1169
01:00:11,429 --> 01:00:12,187
Which street, Johnnie?

1170
01:00:12,262 --> 01:00:13,020
Down the West End.

1171
01:00:13,095 --> 01:00:13,853
Who was with you?

1172
01:00:13,928 --> 01:00:14,686
No one, I was on my pat.

1173
01:00:14,761 --> 01:00:15,519
Johnnie All Alone, eh?

1174
01:00:15,594 --> 01:00:16,352
The truth, Johnnie.

1175
01:00:16,427 --> 01:00:17,185
Come on, let's have the truth.

1176
01:00:17,260 --> 01:00:18,018
Where were you Saturday night?

1177
01:00:18,093 --> 01:00:18,851
Where were you Saturday night?

1178
01:00:18,926 --> 01:00:19,926
Answer!

1179
01:00:44,522 --> 01:00:46,855
Davy, where have you been?

1180
01:00:47,939 --> 01:00:49,483
Walking.

1181
01:00:49,558 --> 01:00:50,558
Davy...

1182
01:00:53,929 --> 01:00:56,327
Where were you on Saturday night?

1183
01:00:56,402 --> 01:00:59,845
In a car, on my way back from Cambridge.

1184
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:01,848
Where were you on Saturday night?

1185
01:01:01,923 --> 01:01:02,788
I told you.

1186
01:01:02,863 --> 01:01:03,863
Davy...

1187
01:01:05,388 --> 01:01:06,567
Ever since you were a little boy,

1188
01:01:06,642 --> 01:01:09,725
I've known when you were lying to me.

1189
01:01:11,693 --> 01:01:13,481
Now, where were you, sonny?

1190
01:01:13,556 --> 01:01:17,723
Mom, I told you never to ask
about Saturday night, please.

1191
01:01:25,398 --> 01:01:27,448
Saturday night, Johnnie, where were you?

1192
01:01:27,523 --> 01:01:28,562
Out!

1193
01:01:28,637 --> 01:01:29,625
Out!

1194
01:01:29,700 --> 01:01:30,458
Where?

1195
01:01:30,533 --> 01:01:31,291
On the street.

1196
01:01:31,366 --> 01:01:32,125
Who with?

1197
01:01:32,200 --> 01:01:33,160
On my pat.

1198
01:01:33,235 --> 01:01:33,997
Who with?

1199
01:01:34,072 --> 01:01:35,093
On my pat.

1200
01:01:35,168 --> 01:01:36,521
When did you see Sapphire last?

1201
01:01:36,596 --> 01:01:38,750
I don't know Sapphire!

1202
01:01:38,825 --> 01:01:40,526
You phoned the International Club,

1203
01:01:40,601 --> 01:01:42,547
and left a message for her.

1204
01:01:42,622 --> 01:01:44,549
Now, where were you Saturday night?

1205
01:01:44,624 --> 01:01:45,624
Out, out!

1206
01:01:48,125 --> 01:01:49,641
Someone's gonna look
at you in the morning,

1207
01:01:49,716 --> 01:01:52,682
someone who saw you with Sapphire.

1208
01:01:52,757 --> 01:01:54,546
Want to change your story, Johnnie?

1209
01:01:54,621 --> 01:01:55,621
No, no!

1210
01:01:56,414 --> 01:01:57,541
Right, book him.

1211
01:01:57,616 --> 01:01:59,616
Come on, on your feet.

1212
01:02:00,559 --> 01:02:02,330
Why do you say you didn't know Sapphire?

1213
01:02:02,405 --> 01:02:04,106
You had a fight over her, at Tulip's.

1214
01:02:04,181 --> 01:02:06,060
Didn't kill her.

1215
01:02:06,135 --> 01:02:08,950
Alright, knew Sapphire,
but didn't kill her!

1216
01:02:09,025 --> 01:02:10,082
You were crazy
about her, weren't you?

1217
01:02:10,157 --> 01:02:11,406
No, we just danced!

1218
01:02:11,481 --> 01:02:12,240
No!

1219
01:02:12,315 --> 01:02:13,548
She went white and
dropped you, didn't she?

1220
01:02:13,623 --> 01:02:14,732
Then, you ran into her on Saturday night,

1221
01:02:14,807 --> 01:02:15,829
followed her, and knifed her.

1222
01:02:15,904 --> 01:02:16,909
No, we used to dance.

1223
01:02:16,984 --> 01:02:18,999
That's all, just dance!

1224
01:02:19,074 --> 01:02:21,838
Where is your knife, Johnnie?

1225
01:02:21,913 --> 01:02:23,614
Your knife, Johnnie.

1226
01:02:23,689 --> 01:02:24,689
Where is it?

1227
01:02:25,657 --> 01:02:27,240
Where's your knife?

1228
01:02:29,140 --> 01:02:31,223
Alright, take him away.

1229
01:02:37,098 --> 01:02:40,098
Find the knife, and we're got him.

1230
01:02:53,416 --> 01:02:54,174
Yes?

1231
01:02:54,249 --> 01:02:55,007
Johnnie Fiddle?

1232
01:02:55,082 --> 01:02:56,082
Out.

1233
01:02:57,561 --> 01:02:59,372
Upstairs, far as you can go, left.

1234
01:02:59,447 --> 01:03:01,197
Thank you.

1235
01:03:33,076 --> 01:03:35,665
There you are, the two of them.

1236
01:03:35,740 --> 01:03:37,424
In congress, aren't they?

1237
01:03:37,499 --> 01:03:39,287
No, I wouldn't say that.

1238
01:03:39,362 --> 01:03:41,813
She wasn't any delicate flower, you know?

1239
01:03:41,888 --> 01:03:43,902
Just the same as him, underneath.

1240
01:03:43,977 --> 01:03:46,724
Besides, he didn't look
so black to her then.

1241
01:03:46,799 --> 01:03:47,799
No.

1242
01:03:49,010 --> 01:03:51,093
Let's take a look around.

1243
01:04:11,162 --> 01:04:12,245
Look at this.

1244
01:04:13,165 --> 01:04:14,165
And this.

1245
01:04:19,939 --> 01:04:23,272
Looks like young Harris is in the clear.

1246
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:25,577
Looks that way.

1247
01:04:27,399 --> 01:04:30,982
Let's see what the lab
has to say about it.

1248
01:04:41,898 --> 01:04:43,147
It's quite a long trip.

1249
01:04:43,222 --> 01:04:44,209
What?

1250
01:04:44,284 --> 01:04:46,525
From here to Hampstead Heath.

1251
01:04:46,600 --> 01:04:48,772
It's the other side of London.

1252
01:04:48,847 --> 01:04:50,444
How the devil did he get there?

1253
01:04:50,519 --> 01:04:51,403
Oh, there'll be a simple answer.

1254
01:04:51,478 --> 01:04:52,644
The transport.

1255
01:04:53,688 --> 01:04:57,497
You'd really like it to be
this colored boy, wouldn't you?

1256
01:04:57,572 --> 01:04:58,942
Message over the car radio, sir.

1257
01:04:59,017 --> 01:05:00,248
There's a gentleman at
the station, says he drove

1258
01:05:00,323 --> 01:05:04,240
Mr. David Harris from
Cambridge, last Saturday.

1259
01:05:05,498 --> 01:05:06,498
Hey.

1260
01:05:10,288 --> 01:05:12,871
There's your transport for you.

1261
01:05:23,418 --> 01:05:24,725
These spades are a load of trouble.

1262
01:05:24,800 --> 01:05:27,337
I reckon we should send them
back where they came from.

1263
01:05:27,412 --> 01:05:30,332
We wouldn't have half this
bother, if they weren't here.

1264
01:05:30,407 --> 01:05:32,161
I suppose you're right.

1265
01:05:32,236 --> 01:05:33,432
Just the same as you
wouldn't have old ladies

1266
01:05:33,507 --> 01:05:34,627
being clobbered by hooligans,

1267
01:05:34,702 --> 01:05:37,327
if there weren't any old ladies.

1268
01:05:37,402 --> 01:05:38,406
So what do you do?

1269
01:05:38,481 --> 01:05:41,820
Get rid of the hooligans,
or the people they bash?

1270
01:05:41,895 --> 01:05:43,683
Look, Phil, given the right atmosphere,

1271
01:05:43,758 --> 01:05:45,738
you can organize riots against anyone.

1272
01:05:45,813 --> 01:05:48,657
Jews, Catholics, Negroes, Irish,

1273
01:05:48,732 --> 01:05:51,149
even policemen with big feet.

1274
01:06:03,559 --> 01:06:05,020
Is this the boy you gave a lift to,

1275
01:06:05,095 --> 01:06:07,420
just outside of Cambridge on Saturday?

1276
01:06:07,495 --> 01:06:08,743
Yes.

1277
01:06:08,818 --> 01:06:10,572
What time did you put him down?

1278
01:06:10,647 --> 01:06:14,508
I dropped him at the post
office, around 6 o'clock.

1279
01:06:14,583 --> 01:06:15,345
He said it was only 10 minute's

1280
01:06:15,420 --> 01:06:17,851
walk away from where he lived.

1281
01:06:17,926 --> 01:06:19,388
Are you sure?

1282
01:06:20,223 --> 01:06:23,633
I wouldn't be here if I wasn't.

1283
01:06:23,708 --> 01:06:26,332
Do you deny this?

1284
01:06:26,407 --> 01:06:27,824
What's the use?

1285
01:06:29,542 --> 01:06:31,459
Well, thank you, sir.

1286
01:06:32,752 --> 01:06:34,453
I hope we haven't wasted
too much of your time.

1287
01:06:34,528 --> 01:06:36,778
Oh, that's quite alright.

1288
01:06:37,750 --> 01:06:39,083
Sorry, old chap.

1289
01:06:43,201 --> 01:06:45,618
Well, sit down, Mr. Harris.

1290
01:06:50,637 --> 01:06:53,279
What time did you get home on Saturday?

1291
01:06:53,354 --> 01:06:54,446
11 o'clock.

1292
01:06:54,521 --> 01:06:57,021
You heard what the man said.

1293
01:06:59,191 --> 01:07:02,039
I got back to town at six,
I didn't get home until 11.

1294
01:07:02,114 --> 01:07:04,424
Then what did you do, in between?

1295
01:07:04,499 --> 01:07:07,838
Walked about, then I
went to the pictures.

1296
01:07:07,913 --> 01:07:10,154
Why didn't you say this before?

1297
01:07:10,229 --> 01:07:12,070
I didn't want my father to know.

1298
01:07:12,145 --> 01:07:13,445
He worries if I go to
the pictures too often,

1299
01:07:13,520 --> 01:07:17,453
in turn time, thinks it strains my eyes.

1300
01:07:17,528 --> 01:07:19,445
Give me your glasses.

1301
01:07:26,761 --> 01:07:28,219
Which cinema did you go to?

1302
01:07:28,294 --> 01:07:29,294
The Ritz.

1303
01:07:30,732 --> 01:07:35,202
What were you doing on
Hampstead Heath yesterday?

1304
01:07:35,277 --> 01:07:36,839
If I told you, you wouldn't believe me.

1305
01:07:36,914 --> 01:07:39,164
Well, just try, will you?

1306
01:07:43,267 --> 01:07:46,626
I wanted to see where it happened.

1307
01:07:46,701 --> 01:07:49,239
I had some idea I might
stumble upon something.

1308
01:07:49,314 --> 01:07:52,791
Something I'd recognize, and you wouldn't.

1309
01:07:52,866 --> 01:07:54,783
And did you?

1310
01:07:55,809 --> 01:07:56,809
No.

1311
01:08:04,865 --> 01:08:06,282
How about this?

1312
01:08:09,637 --> 01:08:13,220
Why were you so anxious
to get rid of this?

1313
01:08:14,391 --> 01:08:15,391
I didn't.

1314
01:08:18,322 --> 01:08:20,155
I never saw it before.

1315
01:08:21,116 --> 01:08:24,280
I'm told it's part of a
child's doll, a wooden doll.

1316
01:08:24,355 --> 01:08:25,795
A leg, possibly.

1317
01:08:25,870 --> 01:08:27,293
Is that what you think it is?

1318
01:08:27,368 --> 01:08:30,431
Why, I don't think it's anything.

1319
01:08:30,506 --> 01:08:32,413
Just a piece of wood I was doodling with.

1320
01:08:32,488 --> 01:08:35,025
You admit picking it up then?

1321
01:08:35,100 --> 01:08:35,859
Yes.

1322
01:08:35,934 --> 01:08:38,240
You just said you didn't.

1323
01:08:38,315 --> 01:08:39,367
I had forgotten.

1324
01:08:39,442 --> 01:08:41,109
Stop lying, Harris!

1325
01:08:41,184 --> 01:08:42,867
You were seen, pushing this down a drain.

1326
01:08:42,942 --> 01:08:43,756
Why?

1327
01:08:43,831 --> 01:08:44,592
I don't know.

1328
01:08:44,667 --> 01:08:45,425
I don't know!

1329
01:08:45,500 --> 01:08:46,259
You mean, you won't say?

1330
01:08:46,334 --> 01:08:47,308
Now, on your way home from the post office

1331
01:08:47,383 --> 01:08:49,311
on Saturday night, was
it then you met Sapphire?

1332
01:08:49,386 --> 01:08:50,144
No, I never saw her!

1333
01:08:50,219 --> 01:08:50,978
Was it then she told you about the baby?

1334
01:08:51,053 --> 01:08:52,254
Look, I tell you, I never saw her!

1335
01:08:52,329 --> 01:08:53,491
How long had you known she was colored?

1336
01:08:53,566 --> 01:08:55,511
I didn't care, I didn't care!

1337
01:08:55,586 --> 01:08:57,705
But you did care about your scholarship.

1338
01:08:57,780 --> 01:08:59,551
It didn't carry a grant
for a wife, did it?

1339
01:08:59,626 --> 01:09:01,362
If you married Sapphire,
the scholarship was off!

1340
01:09:01,437 --> 01:09:02,604
I loved her!

1341
01:09:04,885 --> 01:09:06,935
I tell you, I loved Sapphire.

1342
01:09:07,010 --> 01:09:08,489
Where were you when she was killed?

1343
01:09:09,323 --> 01:09:10,323
Yes?

1344
01:09:11,018 --> 01:09:11,953
Excuse me, sir.

1345
01:09:12,028 --> 01:09:16,586
Mr. David Harris's father
is here, with a solicitor.

1346
01:09:16,661 --> 01:09:17,661
Right.

1347
01:09:19,151 --> 01:09:20,484
Alright, Harris.

1348
01:09:21,328 --> 01:09:23,745
You better go with him, Phil.

1349
01:09:35,457 --> 01:09:39,057
Ralph Pigot, Pigot North,
and Pigot Sentry Payment.

1350
01:09:39,132 --> 01:09:41,878
Mr. Harris asked me to come
and look after his son.

1351
01:09:41,953 --> 01:09:44,142
Can I see my client, please?

1352
01:09:44,217 --> 01:09:45,634
He's all yours.

1353
01:09:59,316 --> 01:10:00,686
Tough monkey, that father.

1354
01:10:00,761 --> 01:10:03,002
Must've moved like the wind
to get a lawyer around here.

1355
01:10:03,077 --> 01:10:05,110
Yeah, there they go.

1356
01:10:05,185 --> 01:10:06,185
Hmm.

1357
01:10:07,817 --> 01:10:10,561
I wonder where he was on Saturday night.

1358
01:10:10,636 --> 01:10:12,511
They're getting into a taxi now.

1359
01:10:12,586 --> 01:10:14,535
To The Ritz to find a witness, I'll bet.

1360
01:10:15,581 --> 01:10:17,230
That was a very human lie.

1361
01:10:17,305 --> 01:10:18,449
Boy didn't want to upset his father,

1362
01:10:18,524 --> 01:10:20,609
couldn't own up later, he was in too deep.

1363
01:10:20,684 --> 01:10:23,241
Where was he on Saturday night?

1364
01:10:23,316 --> 01:10:24,074
Who?

1365
01:10:24,149 --> 01:10:24,908
Old Harris.

1366
01:10:24,983 --> 01:10:27,073
The local social club.

1367
01:10:27,148 --> 01:10:28,570
Did we check it?

1368
01:10:28,645 --> 01:10:30,033
Alright, don't look so horrified.

1369
01:10:30,108 --> 01:10:32,245
We can't think of everything, not even us.

1370
01:10:32,320 --> 01:10:36,487
Constable Ferris is also
member of that social club.

1371
01:10:39,234 --> 01:10:40,013
No, sir.

1372
01:10:40,088 --> 01:10:41,440
Ted Harris didn't come into the club,

1373
01:10:41,515 --> 01:10:43,704
'til late, on Saturday night.

1374
01:10:43,779 --> 01:10:45,946
About 10, that's definite.

1375
01:10:48,342 --> 01:10:49,294
Alright, Ferris.

1376
01:10:49,369 --> 01:10:51,245
Sir.

1377
01:10:51,320 --> 01:10:53,056
Not until 10, eh?

1378
01:10:53,131 --> 01:10:55,250
Well, he gave us the impression
he'd been there all evening.

1379
01:10:55,325 --> 01:10:56,174
No, he didn't.

1380
01:10:56,249 --> 01:10:57,862
No, his daughter took it for granted,

1381
01:10:57,937 --> 01:11:00,353
and we naturally followed.

1382
01:11:00,428 --> 01:11:01,833
I'll go 'round and see her, try

1383
01:11:01,908 --> 01:11:04,463
and bounce her into giving something away.

1384
01:11:04,538 --> 01:11:05,317
We still haven't heard the report

1385
01:11:05,392 --> 01:11:07,057
on Johnnie Fiddle's knife.

1386
01:11:07,132 --> 01:11:09,008
No, we've got that to come.

1387
01:11:09,083 --> 01:11:12,083
Drive 'round to the dairy, will you?

1388
01:11:15,596 --> 01:11:17,907
Of course Dad spent
the evening at the club.

1389
01:11:17,982 --> 01:11:19,387
He always does Saturdays.

1390
01:11:19,462 --> 01:11:21,947
My information is,
he didn't get there until 10.

1391
01:11:22,022 --> 01:11:22,781
You're not trying to suggest

1392
01:11:22,856 --> 01:11:24,246
that he had anything to do with it?

1393
01:11:24,321 --> 01:11:25,153
I'm not saying he did,

1394
01:11:25,228 --> 01:11:27,677
I merely want to know where he was.

1395
01:11:27,752 --> 01:11:30,335
Then ask him, Superintendent.

1396
01:11:31,600 --> 01:11:34,103
Did Sapphire
often go to your house?

1397
01:11:34,178 --> 01:11:35,252
Yes.

1398
01:11:35,327 --> 01:11:36,086
Then I suppose really,

1399
01:11:36,161 --> 01:11:39,591
you were all as much to blame as David.

1400
01:11:39,666 --> 01:11:40,446
What do you mean?

1401
01:11:40,521 --> 01:11:42,012
Well, you shouldn't
have made her so welcome,

1402
01:11:42,087 --> 01:11:44,642
if you didn't want him
involved with a colored girl.

1403
01:11:44,717 --> 01:11:46,226
We didn't know she was colored.

1404
01:11:46,301 --> 01:11:47,301
Not until --

1405
01:11:48,356 --> 01:11:50,650
Not until when, Mrs. Farr?

1406
01:11:50,725 --> 01:11:52,391
Not until Saturday, was it?

1407
01:11:52,466 --> 01:11:54,383
The day she was killed.

1408
01:11:56,106 --> 01:12:00,420
My father didn't do it,
I swear, Superintendent.

1409
01:12:00,495 --> 01:12:01,900
You can search the house
from top to bottom,

1410
01:12:01,975 --> 01:12:06,142
you'll not find a speck of
blood, or a trace of Sapphire.

1411
01:12:07,234 --> 01:12:09,151
Thank you, Mrs. Farr.

1412
01:12:32,883 --> 01:12:33,957
I'm peckish, Lilly.

1413
01:12:34,032 --> 01:12:38,572
Slip across the Max and get
me a ham sandwich, will you?

1414
01:12:38,647 --> 01:12:39,647
Well, go on.

1415
01:13:00,682 --> 01:13:01,652
No, old Harris can't be back

1416
01:13:01,727 --> 01:13:03,341
yet, or he'd answer that phone.

1417
01:13:03,416 --> 01:13:05,166
Now, wait a minute.

1418
01:13:09,476 --> 01:13:10,638
She'll ring again.

1419
01:13:10,713 --> 01:13:11,472
Who?

1420
01:13:11,547 --> 01:13:12,623
Mildred.

1421
01:13:12,698 --> 01:13:14,609
Oh, there's no one in.

1422
01:13:14,684 --> 01:13:15,915
Mrs. Harris has gone down to Richmond,

1423
01:13:15,990 --> 01:13:17,273
and Millie's at the dairy.

1424
01:13:17,348 --> 01:13:18,614
Oh, thank you.

1425
01:13:18,689 --> 01:13:20,634
You might find Mr. Harris
in the paint shed, but, sir,

1426
01:13:20,709 --> 01:13:22,532
you'll have to go around the
yard at the back, for that.

1427
01:13:22,607 --> 01:13:23,607
Thanks.

1428
01:13:41,425 --> 01:13:42,925
No, he's not here.

1429
01:13:53,546 --> 01:13:54,305
I'd like to know what's

1430
01:13:54,380 --> 01:13:56,591
underneath that dust sheet.

1431
01:13:56,666 --> 01:13:57,550
We haven't got enough evidence to get

1432
01:13:57,625 --> 01:13:59,604
a search warrant for this place.

1433
01:13:59,679 --> 01:14:00,679
No.

1434
01:14:02,903 --> 01:14:04,764
It was expecting too much.

1435
01:14:04,839 --> 01:14:06,401
Saturday night, packed house?

1436
01:14:06,476 --> 01:14:08,386
How could she remember?

1437
01:14:08,461 --> 01:14:10,668
You didn't make this up in the
spur of the moment, did you?

1438
01:14:10,743 --> 01:14:11,939
If the boy says he went to the pictures,

1439
01:14:12,014 --> 01:14:13,681
he went to the pictures.

1440
01:14:13,756 --> 01:14:15,161
You sound like the police.

1441
01:14:15,236 --> 01:14:17,582
If I'm gonna help you, I
gotta think like the police.

1442
01:14:17,657 --> 01:14:18,783
It's no use boggling.

1443
01:14:18,858 --> 01:14:20,542
They've got a very good,
circumstantial case.

1444
01:14:20,617 --> 01:14:22,040
They've got no case at all!

1445
01:14:22,115 --> 01:14:24,635
The boy didn't do it, and if
you can't clear him, I will.

1446
01:14:24,710 --> 01:14:25,523
You hope you can, that's what --

1447
01:14:25,598 --> 01:14:26,496
I know, I can --

1448
01:14:26,571 --> 01:14:28,987
Shut up, talking across me.

1449
01:14:32,494 --> 01:14:35,571
He's never talked to
me like that in his life.

1450
01:14:35,646 --> 01:14:36,668
Perhaps, there's a side to the boy

1451
01:14:36,743 --> 01:14:39,089
you've never seen, Mr. Harris.

1452
01:14:39,164 --> 01:14:40,831
I know my own son.

1453
01:14:41,950 --> 01:14:43,950
He didn't kill Sapphire.

1454
01:14:44,981 --> 01:14:46,398
I know he didn't.

1455
01:14:50,031 --> 01:14:51,576
Tell Sergeant Newton
I want him right away.

1456
01:14:51,651 --> 01:14:53,659
Very good, sir.

1457
01:14:53,734 --> 01:14:55,317
Right, thank you.

1458
01:14:57,363 --> 01:14:59,134
Report from the lab, Bob.

1459
01:14:59,209 --> 01:15:00,058
The blood on Johnnie Fiddle's shirt

1460
01:15:00,133 --> 01:15:01,801
is the same group as the girl's.

1461
01:15:01,876 --> 01:15:03,975
His knife could've inflicted the wounds.

1462
01:15:04,050 --> 01:15:04,985
Alright, let's hit him up.

1463
01:15:05,060 --> 01:15:06,060
Okay.

1464
01:15:08,752 --> 01:15:09,653
You wanted me, sir?

1465
01:15:09,728 --> 01:15:10,837
Oh, Newton.

1466
01:15:10,912 --> 01:15:12,558
Get a warrant to search
all the sheds at the back

1467
01:15:12,633 --> 01:15:15,573
of Oakland Road, say we're
looking for stolen lead.

1468
01:15:15,648 --> 01:15:17,419
I want to see inside Harris's paint shop.

1469
01:15:17,494 --> 01:15:18,494
Gotcha.

1470
01:15:21,552 --> 01:15:23,635
Is this yours, Johnnie?

1471
01:15:25,436 --> 01:15:26,197
No, boss!

1472
01:15:26,272 --> 01:15:27,031
No!

1473
01:15:27,106 --> 01:15:30,187
Then what was it doing in
your mattress, on your bed?

1474
01:15:30,262 --> 01:15:31,650
Someone put it there!

1475
01:15:31,725 --> 01:15:33,113
He, he put it there!

1476
01:15:33,188 --> 01:15:34,175
What?

1477
01:15:34,250 --> 01:15:35,250
Alright.

1478
01:15:36,793 --> 01:15:38,696
The blood found on this knife,

1479
01:15:38,771 --> 01:15:42,104
on your shirt, matches Sapphire's blood.

1480
01:15:43,744 --> 01:15:45,077
What about this?

1481
01:15:47,732 --> 01:15:49,982
You and Sapphire, isn't it?

1482
01:15:51,355 --> 01:15:53,439
Did you kill her, Johnnie?

1483
01:15:53,514 --> 01:15:54,310
Did you?

1484
01:15:54,385 --> 01:15:55,268
No, boss!

1485
01:15:55,343 --> 01:15:56,101
No!

1486
01:15:56,176 --> 01:15:56,935
The blood matches.

1487
01:15:57,010 --> 01:15:58,368
Not Sapphire's blood!

1488
01:15:58,443 --> 01:16:00,610
Then whose, you big lug?

1489
01:16:01,629 --> 01:16:03,212
Horace Big Cigar.

1490
01:16:04,102 --> 01:16:06,102
We fight Saturday night.

1491
01:16:08,891 --> 01:16:11,202
Why the hell
didn't you say this before?

1492
01:16:11,277 --> 01:16:12,439
They say I kill him boss.

1493
01:16:12,514 --> 01:16:13,902
They say?

1494
01:16:13,977 --> 01:16:14,912
Who saw this fight?

1495
01:16:14,987 --> 01:16:15,957
Them.

1496
01:16:16,032 --> 01:16:17,507
Them, who's them?

1497
01:16:17,582 --> 01:16:20,171
Alexander, Gin Rickey, Big Sam.

1498
01:16:20,246 --> 01:16:21,320
Where do we find these people?

1499
01:16:21,395 --> 01:16:25,274
Number 16, down the
street from my place.

1500
01:16:25,349 --> 01:16:26,876
It was self-defense, boss.

1501
01:16:26,951 --> 01:16:28,565
Horace Big Cigar attacked me.

1502
01:16:28,640 --> 01:16:30,080
I not mean to kill him.

1503
01:16:30,155 --> 01:16:31,155
I'll bet.

1504
01:16:47,908 --> 01:16:48,666
No, no, no, I cover.

1505
01:16:48,741 --> 01:16:49,741
I cover.

1506
01:17:05,775 --> 01:17:07,720
What's your name?

1507
01:17:07,795 --> 01:17:10,962
Horace Big Cigar, what's yours, man?

1508
01:17:14,674 --> 01:17:16,027
This man's the law.

1509
01:17:16,102 --> 01:17:18,102
Now no ignorant, foolish talk, men.

1510
01:17:18,177 --> 01:17:21,080
- Alright, boss.
- Yes.

1511
01:17:21,155 --> 01:17:24,076
According to our information,
Horace, you're dead.

1512
01:17:24,151 --> 01:17:25,904
Incorrect.

1513
01:17:25,979 --> 01:17:28,260
Not ready for my coffin yet.

1514
01:17:35,035 --> 01:17:36,649
Where were you Saturday night, Horace?

1515
01:17:36,724 --> 01:17:38,948
Right here, boss.

1516
01:17:39,023 --> 01:17:40,167
Why you in bed?

1517
01:17:40,242 --> 01:17:41,665
Sick man, boss.

1518
01:17:41,740 --> 01:17:42,740
Very sick.

1519
01:17:43,621 --> 01:17:44,621
How come?

1520
01:17:47,365 --> 01:17:48,962
How'd you get that?

1521
01:17:49,037 --> 01:17:50,999
Oh, hit by a jumble car.

1522
01:17:51,074 --> 01:17:52,166
What car?

1523
01:17:52,241 --> 01:17:56,942
Knocked out, had no
opportunity to see the vehicle.

1524
01:17:59,224 --> 01:18:01,013
Johnnie Fiddle one big lie then, huh?

1525
01:18:01,088 --> 01:18:02,058
What'd you say, boss?

1526
01:18:02,133 --> 01:18:04,182
What'd you say Johnnie Fiddle done?

1527
01:18:04,257 --> 01:18:05,019
We're booking for the killing

1528
01:18:05,094 --> 01:18:08,729
on Hampstead Heath, Saturday night.

1529
01:18:08,804 --> 01:18:11,079
That's what Johnnie Fiddle done.

1530
01:18:11,154 --> 01:18:11,913
Sapphire?

1531
01:18:11,988 --> 01:18:13,604
That chick that got cut up?

1532
01:18:13,679 --> 01:18:15,403
The same.

1533
01:18:16,450 --> 01:18:18,465
That sure is one big pity.

1534
01:18:18,540 --> 01:18:20,855
Johnnie Fiddle's in big trouble, eh?

1535
01:18:22,757 --> 01:18:24,531
You hear that, men?

1536
01:18:24,606 --> 01:18:25,667
Saturday night.

1537
01:18:34,916 --> 01:18:36,739
Really booking Johnnie Fiddle, boss?

1538
01:18:36,814 --> 01:18:38,637
Unless you can give him an out.

1539
01:18:38,712 --> 01:18:40,712
He says he was with you.

1540
01:18:41,621 --> 01:18:44,371
You sure are wastin' your time.

1541
01:18:45,417 --> 01:18:47,832
I got no out with Johnnie Fiddle.

1542
01:18:47,907 --> 01:18:49,324
You go, hang him.

1543
01:19:26,885 --> 01:19:31,042
Is that where the jumble
car knocked you down, Horace?

1544
01:19:31,117 --> 01:19:33,567
You sure a wise man, boss.

1545
01:19:33,642 --> 01:19:34,400
Alexander?

1546
01:19:34,475 --> 01:19:35,233
Yes, boss?

1547
01:19:35,308 --> 01:19:36,067
Gin Rickey?

1548
01:19:36,142 --> 01:19:37,456
Yes, boss?

1549
01:19:37,531 --> 01:19:38,290
Big Sam?

1550
01:19:38,365 --> 01:19:39,493
Yes, boss?

1551
01:19:39,568 --> 01:19:40,573
Why did you tell Johnnie Fiddle

1552
01:19:40,648 --> 01:19:42,280
he'd killed Horace Big Cigar?

1553
01:19:42,355 --> 01:19:44,352
Johnnie Fiddle wears
too much of a high hat.

1554
01:19:44,427 --> 01:19:45,920
We seek a way to knock it off.

1555
01:19:45,995 --> 01:19:48,723
Make that big bush run sweat, boss.

1556
01:19:48,798 --> 01:19:50,221
Were they all here Saturday night?

1557
01:19:50,296 --> 01:19:51,713
All here, boss.

1558
01:19:53,013 --> 01:19:53,791
Right, names.

1559
01:19:53,866 --> 01:19:54,624
You.

1560
01:19:54,699 --> 01:19:55,699
Alexander.

1561
01:21:47,281 --> 01:21:48,531
I'll go, Ted.

1562
01:22:03,910 --> 01:22:05,077
We're in here.

1563
01:22:20,176 --> 01:22:23,201
Did you find what you wanted?

1564
01:22:23,276 --> 01:22:24,359
I think so.

1565
01:22:25,243 --> 01:22:26,243
Well?

1566
01:22:29,022 --> 01:22:31,298
I've just seen Sapphire's brother.

1567
01:22:31,373 --> 01:22:33,493
I've asked him to call 'round here.

1568
01:22:33,568 --> 01:22:35,095
Not her brother.

1569
01:22:35,170 --> 01:22:37,253
We don't want him here.

1570
01:22:38,130 --> 01:22:41,312
You had better
tell him that yourself.

1571
01:22:41,387 --> 01:22:43,554
He'll be here in a minute.

1572
01:22:44,417 --> 01:22:46,867
I said, we don't want him here.

1573
01:22:46,942 --> 01:22:48,025
I want him.

1574
01:22:51,888 --> 01:22:55,721
I wonder if Sapphire
would've been happy here.

1575
01:22:59,551 --> 01:23:02,436
What do you think, Mr. Harris?

1576
01:23:02,511 --> 01:23:03,743
Why shouldn't she be?

1577
01:23:03,818 --> 01:23:06,307
I don't know, I'm asking you.

1578
01:23:13,640 --> 01:23:14,973
Answer the door.

1579
01:23:32,117 --> 01:23:33,450
How do you do?

1580
01:23:37,132 --> 01:23:40,697
I'm Mrs. Harris, will you sit down?

1581
01:23:40,772 --> 01:23:41,772
Thank you.

1582
01:23:45,596 --> 01:23:47,210
Dr. Robbins.

1583
01:23:47,285 --> 01:23:48,412
I've asked you to come here, because I

1584
01:23:48,487 --> 01:23:50,589
think you may be able to help us.

1585
01:23:50,664 --> 01:23:51,860
If I can.

1586
01:23:51,935 --> 01:23:54,385
Did Sapphire want to marry this boy?

1587
01:23:54,460 --> 01:23:56,377
Yes, I think she did.

1588
01:23:57,908 --> 01:24:00,240
Well, David's father here,
has been insisting all along,

1589
01:24:00,315 --> 01:24:02,344
that he was willing to let them marry.

1590
01:24:02,419 --> 01:24:04,173
That's right.

1591
01:24:04,248 --> 01:24:05,374
Assuming he's telling the truth,

1592
01:24:05,449 --> 01:24:08,004
that would've left the
decision with David.

1593
01:24:08,079 --> 01:24:08,869
Did your sister give you the

1594
01:24:08,944 --> 01:24:11,753
impression that he would've married her?

1595
01:24:11,828 --> 01:24:13,896
I don't know that I can answer that.

1596
01:24:13,971 --> 01:24:16,971
I mean, we never really discussed --

1597
01:24:17,837 --> 01:24:21,854
I've told you over, and over again, yes.

1598
01:24:21,929 --> 01:24:23,474
But, supposing your father were lying,

1599
01:24:23,549 --> 01:24:25,006
and didn't want you to marry her?

1600
01:24:25,081 --> 01:24:26,173
I didn't care.

1601
01:24:26,248 --> 01:24:28,350
But you cared about your
scholarship, didn't you?

1602
01:24:28,425 --> 01:24:30,109
You cared about your career.

1603
01:24:30,184 --> 01:24:31,467
Marriage would've stopped all that.

1604
01:24:31,542 --> 01:24:33,470
It wasn't me that was
mad about the career.

1605
01:24:33,545 --> 01:24:35,194
So you say.

1606
01:24:35,269 --> 01:24:37,266
I wouldn't know.

1607
01:24:37,341 --> 01:24:39,043
You may have thought that
a bit of fun was one thing,

1608
01:24:39,118 --> 01:24:41,707
but that marriage was too
high a price to pay for it.

1609
01:24:41,782 --> 01:24:43,222
This boy couldn't do anything like --

1610
01:24:43,297 --> 01:24:45,260
Don't need you, to defend our David.

1611
01:24:45,335 --> 01:24:46,335
Mildred.

1612
01:24:55,244 --> 01:24:57,575
How about you, Mr. Harris?

1613
01:24:57,650 --> 01:25:00,411
You had your reasons, too, didn't you?

1614
01:25:00,486 --> 01:25:01,752
I didn't wish her any harm.

1615
01:25:01,827 --> 01:25:02,971
Of course not.

1616
01:25:03,046 --> 01:25:04,486
She was gonna marry David.

1617
01:25:04,561 --> 01:25:05,653
That's what you said, wasn't it?

1618
01:25:05,728 --> 01:25:06,629
That's right.

1619
01:25:06,704 --> 01:25:08,161
I gave her my word he would.

1620
01:25:08,236 --> 01:25:09,989
But she didn't marry him, did she?

1621
01:25:10,064 --> 01:25:11,208
She would have done.

1622
01:25:11,283 --> 01:25:12,236
Would have done?

1623
01:25:12,311 --> 01:25:13,786
If you hadn't stopped her,
is that what you mean?

1624
01:25:13,861 --> 01:25:15,039
That's not true.

1625
01:25:15,114 --> 01:25:16,903
I didn't wish her any
harm, none of us did.

1626
01:25:16,978 --> 01:25:18,873
We liked her, we liked her!

1627
01:25:18,948 --> 01:25:21,468
David wanted her, that was the end.

1628
01:25:21,543 --> 01:25:22,462
That was good enough.

1629
01:25:22,537 --> 01:25:23,872
Shut up!

1630
01:25:23,947 --> 01:25:24,813
Why don't you tell them the truth?

1631
01:25:24,888 --> 01:25:26,693
You hated her.

1632
01:25:26,768 --> 01:25:28,417
All you ever wanted, was
for me to be an architect.

1633
01:25:28,492 --> 01:25:30,158
My boy, an architect!

1634
01:25:30,233 --> 01:25:31,290
You were gonna send me away, but you

1635
01:25:31,365 --> 01:25:34,425
hated her so much that you finally --

1636
01:25:34,500 --> 01:25:35,667
Get him out!

1637
01:25:36,921 --> 01:25:38,570
Don't want his hands on my kid's toys,

1638
01:25:38,645 --> 01:25:39,702
don't want him near my kids.

1639
01:25:39,777 --> 01:25:42,122
Don't want his dirty hands on my children.

1640
01:25:42,197 --> 01:25:45,114
Tearing up my family, they're mine.

1641
01:26:01,859 --> 01:26:04,919
You really hate colored
people, don't you?

1642
01:26:04,994 --> 01:26:07,304
You really hate them.

1643
01:26:07,379 --> 01:26:11,118
With Sapphire, you
couldn't control yourself,

1644
01:26:11,193 --> 01:26:13,693
and that's why you killed her.

1645
01:26:19,361 --> 01:26:21,194
It wasn't like that.

1646
01:26:22,635 --> 01:26:27,332
It wouldn't have happened, if
she hadn't come to the dairy.

1647
01:26:27,407 --> 01:26:29,389
I'd locked up, drawn the blinds.

1648
01:26:29,464 --> 01:26:31,984
She banged on the door and called to me.

1649
01:26:32,059 --> 01:26:33,726
I had to let her in.

1650
01:26:35,396 --> 01:26:39,563
Said she was fed up, waiting
for David, wanted my company.

1651
01:26:42,267 --> 01:26:45,745
She sat on the counter, all
the time I was tidying up,

1652
01:26:45,820 --> 01:26:48,131
sweeping, doing Lilly's work,

1653
01:26:48,206 --> 01:26:50,789
swinging her legs and laughing.

1654
01:26:52,619 --> 01:26:56,392
She couldn't see what she
had done, she didn't care.

1655
01:26:57,227 --> 01:27:00,726
Ruining David's life, ruining dad's dream.

1656
01:27:02,750 --> 01:27:04,451
When I said she'd better watch out,

1657
01:27:04,526 --> 01:27:06,489
David might refer to
give her 10 bob a week,

1658
01:27:06,564 --> 01:27:11,069
for the yellow brat, and
keep his scholarship,

1659
01:27:11,144 --> 01:27:13,942
she laughed in my face,
and said David didn't care

1660
01:27:14,017 --> 01:27:15,562
what color the baby was, or what

1661
01:27:15,637 --> 01:27:17,547
color she was, he wanted her.

1662
01:27:17,622 --> 01:27:19,327
I had forgotten what that was like.

1663
01:27:19,402 --> 01:27:23,834
I had forgotten what it
was like to be wanted.

1664
01:27:23,909 --> 01:27:27,909
She was taunting me, with
Sid never coming home.

1665
01:27:28,820 --> 01:27:30,591
Then she jumped down from
the counter, put her hand

1666
01:27:30,666 --> 01:27:32,611
on my shoulder and said,

1667
01:27:32,686 --> 01:27:34,405
"Give the twins Auntie Sapphire's love.

1668
01:27:34,480 --> 01:27:38,647
"Tell them they'll have a
new little cousin soon."

1669
01:27:40,001 --> 01:27:41,334
New little girl.

1670
01:27:44,668 --> 01:27:47,418
There was a knife on the counter.

1671
01:27:50,014 --> 01:27:51,764
Then there was blood.

1672
01:29:00,450 --> 01:29:01,867
I'm sorry, dad.

1673
01:29:04,368 --> 01:29:06,279
I know, son.

1674
01:29:06,354 --> 01:29:09,152
You thought I killed her.

1675
01:29:09,227 --> 01:29:11,347
I don't blame you.

1676
01:29:11,422 --> 01:29:13,922
We all had hate in our hearts.

1677
01:29:19,032 --> 01:29:20,615
I loved Sapphire.

1678
01:29:29,376 --> 01:29:30,376
I loved her.

1679
01:29:32,633 --> 01:29:34,716
Yes, I believe you did.

1680
01:29:56,196 --> 01:29:57,479
Are you going back
to Birmingham tonight?

1681
01:29:57,554 --> 01:29:58,768
Yes.

1682
01:29:58,843 --> 01:30:00,074
Can we give you a lift to the station?

1683
01:30:00,149 --> 01:30:02,338
Thank you, I'd like to walk.

1684
01:30:02,413 --> 01:30:03,413
Well.

1685
01:30:08,404 --> 01:30:09,163
We haven't given you very much

1686
01:30:09,238 --> 01:30:11,115
to take back, have we, Doctor?

1687
01:30:11,190 --> 01:30:13,745
No, but then I see all kinds

1688
01:30:13,820 --> 01:30:16,601
of sickness in my
practice, Superintendent.

1689
01:30:16,676 --> 01:30:20,843
I've never yet seen the
kind you can cure in a day.

1690
01:30:38,183 --> 01:30:41,313
Cases don't get solved,
without somebody getting hurt.

1691
01:30:41,388 --> 01:30:42,555
You know that.

1692
01:30:43,408 --> 01:30:45,301
We didn't solve anything, Phil.

1693
01:30:45,376 --> 01:30:47,793
We just picked up the pieces.
