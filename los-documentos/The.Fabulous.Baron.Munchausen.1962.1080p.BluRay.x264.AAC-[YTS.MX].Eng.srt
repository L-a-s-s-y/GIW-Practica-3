'FROM THE EARTH TO THE MOON'

20
00:05:42,667 --> 00:05:44,417
<i>Allow us to introduce ourselves.</i>

21
00:05:45,542 --> 00:05:49,209
<i>Mr. Barbicane,
President of the Gun Club.</i>

22
00:05:49,459 --> 00:05:51,209
Captain Nicholl.

23
00:05:51,959 --> 00:05:53,584
Michel Ardan.

24
00:05:58,459 --> 00:06:00,459
And who am I?

25
00:06:01,584 --> 00:06:07,417
I am Cyrano.
Cyrano de Bergerac, the poet.

26
00:06:08,417 --> 00:06:12,834
What remains a puzzle to me,
however, is your name.

27
00:06:13,292 --> 00:06:18,292
And where you come from...
From Venus? From Mars?

28
00:06:19,334 --> 00:06:20,959
From Jupiter, perhaps?

29
00:06:21,334 --> 00:06:24,459
Going by his attire,
his home is the moon!

30
00:06:25,084 --> 00:06:28,834
Gentlemen, an authentic,
actual Moonman!

31
00:06:30,459 --> 00:06:33,292
Come, join us!

32
00:06:34,209 --> 00:06:38,709
With glasses charged, let us
celebrate this rarest of moments!

33
00:06:39,834 --> 00:06:44,084
In this enchanted landscape,
cursed by cold and silent as dust,

34
00:06:45,792 --> 00:06:50,209
where one can wait centuries
to meet a soul!

35
00:07:00,084 --> 00:07:01,084
The Baron!

36
00:07:02,209 --> 00:07:03,667
The famed Baron Munchausen!

37
00:07:05,167 --> 00:07:08,209
A man after my own heart!
A fellow adventurer!

38
00:07:09,334 --> 00:07:13,209
The impulse that draws him
to the stars is pure imagination.

39
00:07:13,542 --> 00:07:14,584
How I love it!

40
00:07:24,084 --> 00:07:28,459
Baron Munchausen,
dear friends, is flattered

41
00:07:28,709 --> 00:07:30,917
that he may be the first
to raise a toast

42
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:33,959
to the health of the first Moonman!

43
00:07:36,834 --> 00:07:38,792
- Let the goblets ring!
- To friendships new!

44
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:42,209
- Let the stars all sing!
- To friendships new!

45
00:07:45,084 --> 00:07:47,459
Our new friend
is not enjoying himself.

46
00:07:48,084 --> 00:07:49,709
His lips have not touched the wine!

47
00:07:50,834 --> 00:07:52,292
Tell him take off his helmet!

48
00:07:53,459 --> 00:07:54,459
What if he cannot?

49
00:07:55,417 --> 00:07:56,667
Worse still,

50
00:07:57,709 --> 00:08:00,209
what if he does not
know what wine is?

51
00:08:01,084 --> 00:08:04,334
That very fear, my friends,
gives me a notion.

52
00:08:04,334 --> 00:08:08,084
Look! The old, good Earth!

53
00:08:08,334 --> 00:08:12,084
Does he not deserve to taste
our great discovery?

54
00:08:13,084 --> 00:08:17,042
I will go there, now, at once!

55
00:08:17,459 --> 00:08:20,084
And happily take our Moonman with me!

56
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:22,459
Show him how humans live!

57
00:08:22,917 --> 00:08:25,084
Let him see how we dress!

58
00:08:25,792 --> 00:08:29,709
Let him experience what love is,
and how we love!

59
00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:33,334
Let him know the taste
and smell of adventure!

60
00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:38,334
Let the Moonman know
what it is to live on Earth!

61
00:08:52,251 --> 00:08:53,459
<i>So, my friends,</i>

62
00:08:54,042 --> 00:08:56,167
<i>on to adventures new!</i>

63
00:08:56,709 --> 00:09:01,542
<i>My wondrous travels with this
Moonman were about to begin!</i>

64
00:09:19,626 --> 00:09:21,501
<i>Once my new friend put on clothes,</i>

65
00:09:21,584 --> 00:09:24,084
<i>the creature looked quite human.</i>

66
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:28,126
<i>Nearly a man. Almost.</i>

67
00:09:32,584 --> 00:09:34,709
<i>He had a strange name:</i>

68
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:37,167
<i>“Tony” or some such.</i>

69
00:09:38,042 --> 00:09:40,459
<i>Quite a likeable fellow,
but unfortunately</i>

70
00:09:40,459 --> 00:09:44,459
<i>had something
of the schoolmaster about him.</i>

71
00:09:45,959 --> 00:09:47,917
<i>So my entire manner,</i>

72
00:09:48,209 --> 00:09:50,334
<i>and our unusual
mode of transport,</i>

73
00:09:50,792 --> 00:09:55,501
<i>seemed totally irrational to him...
in short, bizarre.</i>

74
00:09:55,959 --> 00:10:00,417
<i>He insisted on talking about
science and technology...</i>

75
00:10:02,459 --> 00:10:05,709
I must stress once and for all

76
00:10:06,417 --> 00:10:09,584
that I am not interested in
such trifles, my moonfriend!

77
00:10:09,959 --> 00:10:12,334
But I am not from the moon!
I'm from Earth.

78
00:10:13,834 --> 00:10:15,417
Out of the question!

79
00:10:15,501 --> 00:10:16,667
Why out of the question?

80
00:10:16,834 --> 00:10:18,959
<i>I</i> never saw you there!

81
00:10:25,917 --> 00:10:30,459
Behold, the first postilions
of approaching Gaia!

82
00:10:30,542 --> 00:10:32,251
So that's your world?!

83
00:10:32,542 --> 00:10:34,126
Witchcraft!

84
00:10:34,501 --> 00:10:37,209
Yes, and are they
not wonderful?

85
00:10:37,709 --> 00:10:40,709
I don't put much
store in magic.

86
00:10:41,959 --> 00:10:44,917
That one doesn't put
much faith in it either.

87
00:10:45,209 --> 00:10:48,542
She's using your science
as backup!

88
00:10:52,417 --> 00:10:53,584
And down there!

89
00:10:54,042 --> 00:10:56,084
That's your style 100%!

90
00:10:56,834 --> 00:11:00,042
Following the laws of science
to the letter!

91
00:11:01,792 --> 00:11:04,292
The Bosporus, the Golden Horn!

92
00:11:05,084 --> 00:11:08,834
We'll land directly in front
of the Sultan's palace!

93
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:20,792
Thus shall I address the Great Sultan.

94
00:11:21,709 --> 00:11:24,209
Musical... but quite difficult to follow.

95
00:11:25,667 --> 00:11:28,126
The language of high diplomacy!

96
00:11:29,542 --> 00:11:32,667
<i>Why did I decide to land
in Turkey of all places?</i>

97
00:11:33,917 --> 00:11:35,959
<i>Why? 'Tis the Land
of the Crescent Moon!</i>

98
00:11:37,084 --> 00:11:39,709
<i>I had little doubt that my Moonman</i>

99
00:11:39,751 --> 00:11:42,542
<i>would appreciate this small,
diplomatic gesture.</i>

100
00:12:07,584 --> 00:12:10,334
<i>Few would believe this modest chamber</i>

101
00:12:10,376 --> 00:12:12,751
<i>was the heart and brains
of a great Empire.</i>

102
00:12:13,834 --> 00:12:14,959
<i>But so it was.</i>

103
00:12:16,084 --> 00:12:19,667
<i>Here is where the Great Sultan
tirelessly entertained</i>

104
00:12:19,959 --> 00:12:21,876
<i>the obligations of his rule.</i>

105
00:12:22,084 --> 00:12:26,292
<i>I was convinced amazement
would lighten his noble brow</i>

106
00:12:26,584 --> 00:12:29,584
<i>when I presented a living Moonman!</i>

107
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:40,251
<i>I felt at home in all this splendour.</i>

108
00:13:40,334 --> 00:13:44,834
<i>Let the Moonboy see
how finely Earthlings live!</i>

109
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:50,334
I just introduced you.

110
00:14:56,084 --> 00:14:57,626
He fears for his throne.

111
00:15:07,459 --> 00:15:09,667
I apologised. Of course, you have
no idea what a throne is!

112
00:15:10,292 --> 00:15:11,709
A throne is... well...

113
00:15:13,834 --> 00:15:16,334
simply a throne!

114
00:15:24,709 --> 00:15:26,126
It needs oiling.

115
00:15:27,209 --> 00:15:29,292
- Look!
- You're playing with fire.

116
00:15:48,917 --> 00:15:53,167
I gather today's audience is over.

117
00:17:27,584 --> 00:17:31,459
"Our ship was lost in a storm
and captured by pirates,

118
00:17:31,459 --> 00:17:34,584
"who sold me to the Sultan.

119
00:17:34,834 --> 00:17:39,959
"I saw you yesterday...
a true knight.

120
00:17:40,334 --> 00:17:43,084
"You are unafraid,
even of the terrible Sultan!

121
00:17:43,584 --> 00:17:46,584
"So it occurred to me
that I might turn to you

122
00:17:46,584 --> 00:17:49,376
"with a plea to rescue me.

123
00:17:49,792 --> 00:17:50,876
"You are my only hope

124
00:17:51,209 --> 00:17:55,667
"and I remain, yours truly,
Princess Bianca Di Castello Nero."

125
00:17:57,542 --> 00:18:03,084
She turns to you?
Congratulations!

126
00:18:03,501 --> 00:18:05,667
He holds her against her will.

127
00:18:05,959 --> 00:18:09,417
It's a violation!
I shall challenge the Sultan!

128
00:18:09,626 --> 00:18:12,417
The Sultan?
You really are from the moon!

129
00:18:12,876 --> 00:18:14,167
It must be a kidnapping

130
00:18:14,376 --> 00:18:15,542
...a perfect kidnapping!

131
00:18:15,709 --> 00:18:16,876
That too is an act of violence!

132
00:18:17,084 --> 00:18:19,584
Nonsense!
It is a work of art!

133
00:18:21,584 --> 00:18:23,417
The art of winning the lady
of one's dreams.

134
00:18:25,459 --> 00:18:28,959
A true knight never uses
means more peaceful

135
00:18:28,959 --> 00:18:32,209
than sword, dagger
and a length of rope!

136
00:18:32,667 --> 00:18:35,834
Tonight we turn the palace
upside down!

137
00:18:37,209 --> 00:18:38,834
The ducks die too!

138
00:18:40,417 --> 00:18:43,917
Blood will flow, oaths made,
fires started...

139
00:18:44,084 --> 00:18:46,417
The scene is set
for the drama of love!

140
00:19:07,084 --> 00:19:11,209
<i>But the path to our first adventure
was not easy.</i>

141
00:19:12,126 --> 00:19:13,501
<i>It did not bother me,</i>

142
00:19:13,792 --> 00:19:17,042
<i>but the Moonman fared worse
than a sleepwalker.</i>

143
00:19:17,584 --> 00:19:22,084
<i>And this oaf wanted
to save a princess!</i>

144
00:19:47,917 --> 00:19:49,667
You whistle like a little boy.

145
00:19:50,209 --> 00:19:52,251
- What should I do?
- Act like a man!

146
00:19:52,251 --> 00:19:54,667
- Will that help?
- No, but it's more appropriate!

147
00:19:55,001 --> 00:19:59,001
We don't whistle when we're in love,
we fight! In love we...

148
00:20:06,459 --> 00:20:09,167
...in love we float on air.

149
00:22:32,959 --> 00:22:34,084
Check!

150
00:22:35,459 --> 00:22:36,667
Mate!

151
00:25:53,459 --> 00:25:56,584
Well, well. The Moonman
shows his true colours!

152
00:25:57,334 --> 00:25:59,792
To be fair, he hasn't done badly,

153
00:26:00,459 --> 00:26:03,959
but why should I fight my way
through ten thousand bashibazouks

154
00:26:03,959 --> 00:26:08,959
so he can snatch the spoils of victory
from under my very nose?!

155
00:26:24,334 --> 00:26:26,209
Well, no matter, beardless boy!

156
00:26:27,167 --> 00:26:30,959
When Baron Munchausen
enters the arena of love,

157
00:26:32,209 --> 00:26:35,501
he'll cut you down to size!

158
00:30:30,417 --> 00:30:32,584
The wild Turks screamed
like devils.

159
00:30:32,626 --> 00:30:36,584
Doubtless this frightened
the Princess and the Moonboy.

160
00:30:37,709 --> 00:30:41,417
This game of catch
did not affect me, however.

161
00:30:41,959 --> 00:30:45,626
My concerns for the Princess
were of a different order...

162
00:30:47,584 --> 00:30:51,876
I'd seen how the charms of a Venetian
rose could fatally attract even the moon.

163
00:30:52,209 --> 00:30:55,459
And worse, how she was
entirely enamoured of him.

164
00:30:55,792 --> 00:31:00,751
No! The pale seducer shall
not steal her from my world.

165
00:31:00,959 --> 00:31:05,709
For as long as I am Baron Munchausen,
he shall not take her!

166
00:31:19,042 --> 00:31:22,292
For three days and three nights
that infernal chase persisted,

167
00:31:22,459 --> 00:31:26,126
our path strewn with
the bones of exhausted steeds

168
00:31:26,667 --> 00:31:30,709
while dark scavengers rejoiced
in the foul feast!

169
00:32:54,751 --> 00:32:57,334
My friend, Oceanus!

170
00:33:00,167 --> 00:33:03,209
What a fantastic sight it is!

171
00:33:04,292 --> 00:33:07,292
And that ship... Is it Turkish?

172
00:33:11,667 --> 00:33:15,042
The ship is Dutch,
carrying Turkish tobacco.

173
00:33:16,876 --> 00:33:19,251
- A merchant ship.
- Excellent!

174
00:33:19,251 --> 00:33:21,667
He can take us
back to Venice!

175
00:33:21,709 --> 00:33:25,292
Ahoy! Ahoy there!

176
00:33:38,792 --> 00:33:42,834
- It's no good, they can't hear us.
- They're too far out.

177
00:33:43,209 --> 00:33:44,834
Then we must catch them!

178
00:33:45,917 --> 00:33:46,959
Beg pardon!

179
00:34:03,042 --> 00:34:07,334
Horse and man overboard!

180
00:34:08,709 --> 00:34:12,084
Of course, who else but
the Baron Munchausen!

181
00:34:41,834 --> 00:34:44,584
Two horses and three men overboard!

182
00:34:45,792 --> 00:34:49,292
Two horses and two men.
The third man is a woman!

183
00:34:55,584 --> 00:34:58,792
A skiff in the water,
a cabin for the lady,

184
00:34:58,959 --> 00:35:01,084
hay for horses...

185
00:35:02,667 --> 00:35:04,751
and burgundy for the men!

186
00:35:04,917 --> 00:35:07,542
Now for a happy trip to Venice!

187
00:35:10,459 --> 00:35:12,334
And now, friends,

188
00:35:13,917 --> 00:35:16,959
let me offer you the most precious
thing I have.

189
00:35:29,709 --> 00:35:31,167
Karsiyaka?

190
00:35:33,417 --> 00:35:34,959
Tramapasmatan?

191
00:35:35,834 --> 00:35:37,292
- Javan. .?
- Ladokeyech!

192
00:35:37,459 --> 00:35:39,209
- What?
- La-do-key-ech.

193
00:35:40,917 --> 00:35:42,042
Heavenly!

194
00:35:56,834 --> 00:36:01,292
<i>The Turkish navy!
AH hands on deck!</i>

195
00:36:02,584 --> 00:36:05,209
Damn! Well, that's torn it!

196
00:36:10,459 --> 00:36:12,292
What does this mean, Baron?

197
00:36:12,542 --> 00:36:15,001
You stole the Sultan's
treasure, didn't you?

198
00:36:15,917 --> 00:36:20,959
A single pearl!
But quite the finest!

199
00:36:21,292 --> 00:36:23,667
One, two, three, four, five...

200
00:36:26,959 --> 00:36:31,417
One thousand, four hundred and
twenty-seven guns aimed at us!

201
00:36:31,667 --> 00:36:33,709
Prepare to fire!
I might have known!

202
00:36:34,584 --> 00:36:36,584
Now the sharks will smoke my tobacco!

203
00:36:39,834 --> 00:36:41,917
<i>But the Captain had forgotten
that on board</i>

204
00:36:41,917 --> 00:36:44,167
<i>was a man who always had a plan!</i>

205
00:37:16,876 --> 00:37:19,751
<i>As a veil of tobacco smoke
slowly engulfed our ship,</i>

206
00:37:20,167 --> 00:37:23,667
<i>the lines of the Turkish fleet
tightened their deadly grip.</i>

207
00:37:24,167 --> 00:37:27,001
<i>Five hundred cannon to our left,</i>

208
00:37:27,542 --> 00:37:29,042
<i>five hundred cannon to our right.</i>

209
00:37:29,876 --> 00:37:31,792
<i>A famous admiral to the left,</i>

210
00:37:32,126 --> 00:37:33,959
<i>Another to the right.</i>

211
00:37:34,709 --> 00:37:38,417
<i>No sooner had Turkish tobacco
rendered us invisible to Turkish eyes,</i>

212
00:37:39,209 --> 00:37:43,167
<i>than the impetuous Admiral
Hassan gave the order to fire!</i>

213
00:37:47,459 --> 00:37:49,792
<i>The Great Eunuch couldn't
be seen to hesitate.</i>

214
00:37:49,959 --> 00:37:51,917
<i>To prove himself a man,</i>

215
00:37:52,167 --> 00:37:54,417
<i>he unhesitatingly threw
himself into the fight.</i>

216
00:37:54,584 --> 00:37:56,126
<i>As you may judge,
I was the only one</i>

217
00:37:56,834 --> 00:37:59,334
<i>in control of this battle
of the colossi!</i>

218
00:38:50,959 --> 00:38:56,084
<i>To cut a long story short, the Turks
blew each other to splinters</i>

219
00:38:56,542 --> 00:39:00,709
<i>and my fabulous wit celebrated
another triumphant victory!</i>

220
00:39:01,334 --> 00:39:06,334
<i>True, a few stray shots did sink
our ship, but that was to be expected.</i>

221
00:39:07,459 --> 00:39:11,084
<i>After all, what are lifeboats for?</i>

222
00:39:12,667 --> 00:39:15,167
<i>When the pungent curtain
of smoke finally lifted,</i>

223
00:39:15,542 --> 00:39:18,459
<i>we beheld a theatre of destruction,</i>

224
00:39:18,834 --> 00:39:24,167
<i>a stage littered with the pitiful
relics of the magnificent fleet.</i>

225
00:39:25,459 --> 00:39:30,334
<i>The final act of this tragedy
was a pas-de-deux.</i>

226
00:39:30,459 --> 00:39:35,209
<i>Both Admirals, as soloists, played
their parts with admirable feeling.</i>

227
00:39:37,709 --> 00:39:39,834
<i>Bravo! Heroes!</i>

228
00:40:11,542 --> 00:40:13,417
<i>I could do nothing about the fact</i>

229
00:40:13,417 --> 00:40:15,459
<i>that we escaped on two boats.</i>

230
00:40:16,459 --> 00:40:18,959
<i>In one of which sat the Captain
and Tony,</i>

231
00:40:19,126 --> 00:40:21,917
<i>in the second, my humble self
and the Princess.</i>

232
00:40:23,126 --> 00:40:25,417
<i>Night overtook us, the moon
rose over the salt waters</i>

233
00:40:25,417 --> 00:40:29,042
<i>and I had the Princess all to myself.</i>

234
00:40:29,792 --> 00:40:31,959
<i>Tony's boat disappeared.</i>

235
00:40:34,334 --> 00:40:38,292
Baron, are there lovers on the moon?

236
00:40:39,834 --> 00:40:41,709
The moon, my dear,

237
00:40:44,334 --> 00:40:48,084
is by nature a curious place.

238
00:40:48,667 --> 00:40:52,959
- It is completely covered...
- In silver lilies...

239
00:40:54,084 --> 00:40:56,126
forever sweetly chiming!

240
00:41:09,834 --> 00:41:14,584
<i>She made it sound so beautiful.
Damn that Moonman...</i>

241
00:41:15,084 --> 00:41:16,667
<i>still on her mind!</i>

242
00:41:17,042 --> 00:41:19,334
<i>If only she knew that
the true face of the moon</i>

243
00:41:19,501 --> 00:41:22,042
<i>was just as uninspiring
as its residents.</i>

244
00:41:22,917 --> 00:41:26,834
<i>Such a pity she did not
understand my fabulous world.</i>

245
00:42:12,959 --> 00:42:14,917
<i>The monster swallowed us whole.</i>

246
00:42:15,751 --> 00:42:19,376
<i>In its belly was a lagoon
larger than Lake Geneva.</i>

247
00:42:20,626 --> 00:42:22,834
<i>Our only light came from
the lanterns of a shipwreck</i>

248
00:42:22,834 --> 00:42:25,834
<i>that the beast
swallowed long ago.</i>

249
00:42:27,501 --> 00:42:28,667
<i>What a beautiful sight!</i>

250
00:42:29,209 --> 00:42:31,084
<i>Still, the air not being the best,</i>

251
00:42:31,084 --> 00:42:34,459
<i>I decided to let
the Princess sleep on.</i>

252
00:43:14,459 --> 00:43:15,709
I am Baron Munchausen.

253
00:43:17,584 --> 00:43:19,959
You are very welcome to stay.

254
00:43:20,834 --> 00:43:22,584
Kindly enter, distinguished guests.

255
00:44:16,959 --> 00:44:20,792
<i>My presence on board, was
a compelling reason to celebrate!</i>

256
00:44:21,334 --> 00:44:23,584
<i>The sorry castaways willingly opened</i>

257
00:44:23,584 --> 00:44:26,584
<i>the last remnants of their
liquid reserves.</i>

258
00:44:27,209 --> 00:44:31,084
<i>I could see that under their
bony chests lay hearts of gold.</i>

259
00:45:55,667 --> 00:46:00,209
<i>It was a burden to explain
to this noble and gentle creature</i>

260
00:46:00,417 --> 00:46:03,959
<i>how we were trapped
in the stomach of a fish.</i>

261
00:46:04,334 --> 00:46:09,042
<i>But I admit that to travel
twenty thousand leagues under the sea</i>

262
00:46:09,417 --> 00:46:12,917
<i>alongside my beauty,
was a welcome adventure to me!</i>

263
00:46:18,167 --> 00:46:21,167
<i>The monster sailed a goodly
piece of the world with us.</i>

264
00:46:22,126 --> 00:46:24,417
<i>First it went to the North Sea.</i>

265
00:46:25,084 --> 00:46:27,334
<i>During its sojourn
in the realm of eternal ice,</i>

266
00:46:27,917 --> 00:46:31,084
<i>it ventured right under the North Pole.</i>

267
00:46:32,376 --> 00:46:37,917
<i>We could tell as conditions in
the fishy darkness chilled appreciably.</i>

268
00:46:58,209 --> 00:47:03,626
<i>Our fish was quite the traveller,
scouring the seven seas with us aboard!</i>

269
00:47:03,959 --> 00:47:04,959
The Red Sea!

270
00:47:25,834 --> 00:47:27,209
The Yellow Sea!

271
00:47:37,376 --> 00:47:38,667
The Black Sea!

272
00:47:39,542 --> 00:47:43,876
<i>What insightful deductions!
Such deep geographical knowledge!</i>

273
00:47:44,417 --> 00:47:47,084
<i>What would we do without our Admiral?</i>

274
00:47:51,292 --> 00:47:55,834
<i>Just once, when we sailed into
muddy waters, his wit failed.</i>

275
00:47:56,042 --> 00:47:57,751
<i>But mine never waned!</i>

276
00:47:59,042 --> 00:48:01,251
This journey will never end!

277
00:48:05,834 --> 00:48:11,417
A storm! Luckily we are protected
by tons of blubber.

278
00:48:11,667 --> 00:48:15,709
Storm on, Oceanus!
Do thy worst!

279
00:48:24,584 --> 00:48:30,792
Well, I'll be, my Princess, that's
no storm! Those are sixteen-pounders!

280
00:48:31,542 --> 00:48:32,876
Do you know what that means?

281
00:48:33,084 --> 00:48:34,501
You hear the cannons?

282
00:48:34,542 --> 00:48:39,667
We are approaching the civilized
shores of our dear Europa!

283
00:48:48,834 --> 00:48:51,667
<i>The shy beast foolishly
turned its back</i>

284
00:48:51,667 --> 00:48:54,376
<i>on the monuments
of our civilization.</i>

285
00:48:54,542 --> 00:48:55,959
<i>So much the better!</i>

286
00:48:56,751 --> 00:48:58,084
<i>At least I could use the time</i>

287
00:48:58,209 --> 00:49:02,209
<i>to wrangle the Moonman
from the heart of my Princess.</i>

288
00:49:22,459 --> 00:49:24,709
How do you like me, Captain?

289
00:50:57,376 --> 00:50:58,501
A harpoon!

290
00:51:01,084 --> 00:51:05,917
I think it time one changed
into one's travelling attire!

291
00:52:21,376 --> 00:52:23,209
You dance like the wind!

292
00:52:23,417 --> 00:52:25,876
- The floor is dancing with me.
- And me?

293
00:52:26,501 --> 00:52:27,584
You too!

294
00:52:31,042 --> 00:52:34,292
My arms will hold you steady forever!

295
00:52:39,084 --> 00:52:41,209
We are saved! We've landed!

296
00:52:41,792 --> 00:52:43,251
The fish has dropped anchor!

297
00:53:37,084 --> 00:53:39,417
Hey, you there on the rock!

298
00:53:40,209 --> 00:53:42,834
- Hey, hey!
- You there!

299
00:53:46,959 --> 00:53:48,542
What are you doing there?

300
00:53:49,459 --> 00:53:52,417
Dry land at last,
and I end up here!

301
00:53:52,459 --> 00:53:55,167
Down on the island there's
nothing but madness!

302
00:53:55,584 --> 00:53:56,917
Do you hear that?

303
00:53:58,876 --> 00:54:01,626
He's lit an infernal cauldron
inside the ship!

304
00:54:02,667 --> 00:54:04,917
The sorcerer!
That Moonman!

305
00:54:06,292 --> 00:54:07,292
Tony?!

306
00:54:07,792 --> 00:54:12,834
Go down to the bay and see! He's
trying to power a ship with steam!

307
00:54:16,376 --> 00:54:19,042
<i>How fickle is the heart of a woman!</i>

308
00:54:19,709 --> 00:54:22,084
<i>She just has to hear
that ridiculous name 'Tony'</i>

309
00:54:22,792 --> 00:54:26,584
<i>and instantly she forgets the
time spent at my side.</i>

310
00:54:27,792 --> 00:54:31,084
<i>I saw that all my efforts of the past
weeks were in vain.</i>

311
00:55:30,959 --> 00:55:32,167
Where am I?

312
00:55:32,417 --> 00:55:33,959
You're with me.

313
00:55:42,709 --> 00:55:44,334
My steam engine.

314
00:55:47,959 --> 00:55:49,959
But for a single component

315
00:55:50,292 --> 00:55:52,876
the steamship could have been
born a hundred years earlier.

316
00:55:53,459 --> 00:55:57,626
I needed a screw.
A single screw, can you believe it?

317
00:56:00,501 --> 00:56:05,167
<i>I understood that boy. He wanted
to be another Munchausen.</i>

318
00:56:06,917 --> 00:56:10,709
<i>To travel in a boat driven
by steam... Mon Dieu!</i>

319
00:56:10,876 --> 00:56:13,542
<i>Such nonsense required
a hefty imagination!</i>

320
00:56:14,709 --> 00:56:18,667
<i>But when two people do the same thing,
it's never quite the same thing.</i>

321
00:56:20,417 --> 00:56:22,876
<i>No-one loves a wild ride
more than I...</i>

322
00:56:23,126 --> 00:56:26,084
<i>But generally, I prefer
to stay on terra firma.</i>

323
00:56:26,959 --> 00:56:29,167
<i>I loathe to go flapping
about in the clouds...</i>

324
00:56:50,584 --> 00:56:52,584
<i>I was quite enjoying my air-trip,</i>

325
00:56:53,626 --> 00:56:56,292
<i>when a terrible thought flashed
through my mind:</i>

326
00:56:57,042 --> 00:57:01,042
<i>I had left my Princess to the mercy
of that lunatic fantasist!</i>

327
00:57:01,709 --> 00:57:04,459
<i>I must get back at once!
And the quickest way possible!</i>

328
00:57:15,209 --> 00:57:16,542
<i>Heavens above!</i>

329
00:57:16,667 --> 00:57:19,959
<i>I barely wet my lips, but
I wish you could have tasted it!</i>

330
00:57:20,834 --> 00:57:21,959
<i>It was pure wine!</i>

331
00:57:22,584 --> 00:57:26,667
<i>A whole sea of Melnik
white - and perfectly chilled!</i>

332
00:58:35,251 --> 00:58:37,126
<i>What a pity Bianca was not there!</i>

333
00:58:37,584 --> 00:58:40,167
<i>She would be bound to get
a little jealous!</i>

334
00:58:40,584 --> 00:58:42,417
<i>The mermaids swam right past me,</i>

335
00:58:42,667 --> 00:58:44,709
<i>practically caressing me
with their scales!</i>

336
00:58:47,334 --> 00:58:49,417
<i>But their aquatic charms
tempted me not!</i>

337
00:58:50,876 --> 00:58:55,126
<i>For, as with all womankind, as soon as
a man pays no attention to them...</i>

338
00:58:55,709 --> 00:58:57,251
<i>they show their fangs!</i>

339
00:59:05,501 --> 00:59:07,042
<i>This did not disturb me,</i>

340
00:59:07,459 --> 00:59:12,084
<i>I had often seen an innocent fish
turn predator!</i>

341
00:59:13,459 --> 00:59:15,709
<i>No monster has yet
grown big enough teeth</i>

342
00:59:15,959 --> 00:59:18,084
<i>to eat Baron Munchausen!</i>

343
00:59:31,334 --> 00:59:34,542
<i>Suddenly, my heart started pounding.</i>

344
00:59:35,084 --> 00:59:38,167
<i>This had to mean
my beloved was near.</i>

345
00:59:39,834 --> 00:59:44,292
<i>I listened to the beating of my heart
bringing me ever closer to the ship</i>

346
00:59:44,292 --> 00:59:45,792
<i>and the Princess Bianca...</i>

347
00:59:46,459 --> 00:59:49,084
<i>I must not arrive too late!</i>

348
00:59:58,834 --> 01:00:03,084
<i>Long into the night I told
of my undersea adventure.</i>

349
01:00:04,042 --> 01:00:06,292
<i>Everyone listened electrified.</i>

350
01:00:06,292 --> 01:00:10,167
<i>All but these two.
They were not interested.</i>

351
01:00:12,292 --> 01:00:16,459
<i>I fail to see how a princess could
be so interested in such trivia</i>

352
01:00:16,459 --> 01:00:18,709
<i>about machinery and the like!</i>

353
01:00:20,667 --> 01:00:24,584
- Can you read the stars?
- A little.

354
01:00:25,584 --> 01:00:28,542
<i>I wonder what he will say now!</i>

355
01:00:29,209 --> 01:00:34,084
The stars say your eyes are
deeper than the heavens!

356
01:00:34,834 --> 01:00:38,209
<i>Really, my dear inventor,
that isn't even original!</i>

357
01:00:38,751 --> 01:00:41,709
<i>Young men always say that
to a girl under a starlit sky.</i>

358
01:00:42,459 --> 01:00:44,709
<i>For a thousand years,
the same old thing!</i>

359
01:00:46,292 --> 01:00:49,584
The stars will no longer be
a mystery to us.

360
01:00:50,042 --> 01:00:55,209
There will be no mysteries anymore,
except the mystery of love.

361
01:01:03,084 --> 01:01:08,292
<i>...The horse I rode
swam rather than galloped</i>

362
01:01:08,334 --> 01:01:12,459
<i>while perhaps a million
varieties of fish coursed</i>

363
01:01:13,959 --> 01:01:17,584
<i>along the seabed ahead of me,
at unbelievable velocities!</i>

364
01:01:19,042 --> 01:01:22,584
Perhaps a million...

365
01:01:24,084 --> 01:01:26,834
Is it a million or not?

366
01:01:27,209 --> 01:01:29,959
This is supposed to be
a ship's log, Baron!

367
01:01:32,292 --> 01:01:39,084
Indeed! One million, two hundred
and fifty-six fish, exactly.

368
01:01:42,334 --> 01:01:43,417
Fifty-seven!

369
01:01:47,417 --> 01:01:51,042
And gentlemen, I'm not just pulling
that out of my sleeve!

370
01:01:58,459 --> 01:02:01,709
<i>As we sailed on,
I could see with my own eyes</i>

371
01:02:02,334 --> 01:02:07,042
<i>the Princess preferred to listen to
that teller of tales from another world!</i>

372
01:02:07,709 --> 01:02:10,417
<i>Why did the romance
of my adventures not affect her?</i>

373
01:02:10,667 --> 01:02:13,501
<i>The romance of war,
duels and chivalry?</i>

374
01:02:24,792 --> 01:02:26,542
<i>Fortune then smiled on me.</i>

375
01:02:26,542 --> 01:02:29,834
<i>The commander of this fort was
my old friend, General Ellemerle,</i>

376
01:02:30,584 --> 01:02:32,209
<i>a soldier to the core!</i>

377
01:02:33,167 --> 01:02:37,292
<i>Volleys of champagne were
loosed at once to mark our meeting!</i>

378
01:02:52,167 --> 01:02:54,792
<i>Unfortunately, the enemy did
not spare the volleys either,</i>

379
01:02:54,917 --> 01:02:59,834
<i>so our host was forced to return
to more quotidian pursuits.</i>

380
01:03:35,292 --> 01:03:38,292
Splendid! Your strategy
is admirable!

381
01:03:38,334 --> 01:03:42,709
If only I knew where
the enemy was!

382
01:03:43,084 --> 01:03:44,667
Would you allow me to find out?

383
01:03:45,459 --> 01:03:47,667
If it's not an inconvenience...

384
01:03:48,417 --> 01:03:49,834
A trifle!

385
01:04:04,167 --> 01:04:05,584
Look!

386
01:04:12,126 --> 01:04:13,376
Bravo! Bravissimo!

387
01:04:17,376 --> 01:04:19,376
How fast! How brave!

388
01:04:20,959 --> 01:04:22,376
How uncomfortable!

389
01:04:39,042 --> 01:04:42,501
<i>When I had plotted the position
of the enemy in the greatest of detail,</i>

390
01:04:42,584 --> 01:04:45,209
<i>I said to myself I really had
no more business there.</i>

391
01:04:48,542 --> 01:04:52,709
<i>And since enemy shot was
whistling past me thick and fast,</i>

392
01:04:53,459 --> 01:04:56,584
<i>it was but child's play to catch
one back to our citadel!</i>

393
01:06:14,459 --> 01:06:18,917
As a boy,
I used to love fairy tales.

394
01:06:20,292 --> 01:06:22,751
And I know you love them still.

395
01:06:23,626 --> 01:06:26,167
Here, I have drawn one
for you. Take a look!

396
01:06:27,542 --> 01:06:30,209
This is as old a castle
as anywhere on Earth.

397
01:06:31,834 --> 01:06:35,376
In the middle of the castle
yard is a dry well,

398
01:06:36,459 --> 01:06:39,001
<i>above the well a large gilded tower.</i>

399
01:06:40,126 --> 01:06:42,834
<i>A beautiful Princess
is held prisoner within.</i>

400
01:06:43,959 --> 01:06:46,917
<i>A young wanderer falls in love
with the Princess</i>

401
01:06:46,917 --> 01:06:49,709
<i>and wants to rescue
her from the old castle.</i>

402
01:06:50,292 --> 01:06:55,084
<i>So he gets rid of the guard,
enters the armoury</i>

403
01:06:55,667 --> 01:06:58,917
<i>and throws all the gunpowder
down the well.</i>

404
01:07:04,334 --> 01:07:07,667
<i>He waits until the moon
is directly above the castle,</i>

405
01:07:07,709 --> 01:07:10,292
<i>then strikes a light...</i>

406
01:07:10,334 --> 01:07:13,542
<i>and the well turns
into a fiery missile</i>

407
01:07:13,959 --> 01:07:16,209
<i>that flies up to the moon!</i>

408
01:07:18,917 --> 01:07:24,001
You tell a beautiful story.
What a pity it's just a fairy tale!

409
01:07:24,334 --> 01:07:27,459
Why should love and beauty
be just in fairy tales?

410
01:07:28,459 --> 01:07:32,709
Travelling to the moon, throwing
gunpowder into a well,

411
01:07:32,834 --> 01:07:35,626
need not be a dream either!

412
01:07:38,501 --> 01:07:41,542
- To future battles!
- To future adventures!

413
01:07:48,709 --> 01:07:51,834
- May you never see defeat!
- May you never be beaten!

414
01:07:52,292 --> 01:07:56,709
I, Baron Munchausen,
shall never be beaten.

415
01:07:57,459 --> 01:08:01,167
The very name Baron
Munchausen is unbeatable!

416
01:08:01,584 --> 01:08:05,042
It is immortal! Nothing
I can do about it!

417
01:08:05,709 --> 01:08:07,917
Such is my fate...

418
01:08:08,584 --> 01:08:12,209
What fate is that,
if it fails in love?

419
01:08:12,584 --> 01:08:15,334
The Princess Bianca and you...

420
01:08:15,834 --> 01:08:20,042
That naïve girl cannot interest
a chevalier like me,

421
01:08:20,292 --> 01:08:21,959
who has known the rare lace

422
01:08:21,959 --> 01:08:25,209
of the most renowned beauties
in the world.

423
01:08:26,084 --> 01:08:28,584
Lace with royal monograms.

424
01:08:30,584 --> 01:08:33,792
Queen Margareta of Estremadura,

425
01:08:34,334 --> 01:08:37,501
her sister Maria-Luisa of Austria,

426
01:08:38,042 --> 01:08:39,667
and the other one!

427
01:08:40,376 --> 01:08:44,376
Why, they all offered me their
hand - and bed - from their high thrones!

428
01:08:45,084 --> 01:08:48,126
And of course, a considerable
number of court ladies,

429
01:08:48,751 --> 01:08:51,251
to whom it was enough just
to signal with my little finger

430
01:08:51,792 --> 01:08:53,334
and they would fall into my arms!

431
01:08:55,959 --> 01:08:58,709
But they have not always found
their way into my heart so easily.

432
01:08:59,709 --> 01:09:03,042
The Marquise Di Rimini, for example,
employed much more subtle means

433
01:09:03,126 --> 01:09:04,834
to win my affections.

434
01:09:06,334 --> 01:09:12,334
I was insatiable,
busy by day and night...

435
01:09:13,542 --> 01:09:16,709
One beauty after another
fell passionately

436
01:09:16,709 --> 01:09:19,917
under the spell of my
manly eloquence!

437
01:09:19,959 --> 01:09:23,084
Then there was the most beautiful
woman in the world,

438
01:09:23,959 --> 01:09:27,084
once celebrated by
a little-known artist.

439
01:09:27,959 --> 01:09:33,084
Secretly, I also painted her,
and, certainly to much greater effect!

440
01:09:34,209 --> 01:09:37,334
But which of all was
the most passionate?

441
01:09:38,334 --> 01:09:42,584
Excuse me, the discretion
of a chevalier of refined manners

442
01:09:43,292 --> 01:09:45,834
prevents me from
recounting further.

443
01:09:57,459 --> 01:09:59,542
<i>I indulged in recalling these women,</i>

444
01:09:59,542 --> 01:10:03,042
<i>so as not to think more
of the Princess Bianca...</i>

445
01:10:03,209 --> 01:10:05,292
<i>The one beauty in this fortress,</i>

446
01:10:05,292 --> 01:10:07,959
<i>surrounded by so many
dashing chevaliers.</i>

447
01:10:09,042 --> 01:10:14,126
<i>And at that very moment, the enemy
again began his infernal concert.</i>

448
01:11:21,542 --> 01:11:25,209
General, there isn't a speck
of gunpowder left in the whole fortress.

449
01:11:31,209 --> 01:11:37,334
<i>The deadly machinery of war had been
turned overnight into harmless toys.</i>

450
01:11:39,959 --> 01:11:41,751
<i>I had as yet no idea</i>

451
01:11:41,959 --> 01:11:45,459
<i>that this cunning action was
the work of our very own Moonman,</i>

452
01:11:45,917 --> 01:11:49,542
<i>who looked on as if
butter wouldn't melt in his mouth.</i>

453
01:12:10,542 --> 01:12:13,042
Certified Turkish tobacco!

454
01:12:54,959 --> 01:12:57,209
<i>Yet again my interventiveness
proved decisive.</i>

455
01:12:57,251 --> 01:12:58,959
<i>The generals disappeared</i>

456
01:12:59,584 --> 01:13:03,334
<i>and the soldiers without their generals
simply went home.</i>

457
01:13:04,292 --> 01:13:07,834
<i>A strange victory,
but a victory nonetheless.</i>

458
01:13:08,209 --> 01:13:11,167
<i>And therefore worthy of
a formal celebration!</i>

459
01:13:21,959 --> 01:13:26,209
<i>The festivity was, alas,
disturbed by harsher tones...</i>

460
01:13:28,459 --> 01:13:31,876
<i>The General informed the Princess
that Tony had been arrested.</i>

461
01:13:32,376 --> 01:13:35,167
<i>It was thanks to him that
the gunpowder had vanished.</i>

462
01:13:35,292 --> 01:13:39,667
<i>A court martial awaited him,
and then the firing squad!</i>

463
01:13:54,167 --> 01:13:56,417
Mesdames, Messieurs,
s'il vous plaît!

464
01:14:10,292 --> 01:14:14,834
Excuse me, Baron, but you
brought him here!

465
01:14:15,792 --> 01:14:18,167
Excuse me, General,
but we won the battle!

466
01:14:19,667 --> 01:14:22,126
Excuse me, Baron,
what do you mean by battle?

467
01:14:22,542 --> 01:14:27,251
No artillery, no cannon fire?
With that battle we cheated history!

468
01:14:28,334 --> 01:14:33,626
All due to him! That man will be
tried and sentenced!

469
01:14:34,459 --> 01:14:37,917
He's a dangerous fantasist.

470
01:14:38,792 --> 01:14:43,667
You said a dangerous fantasist?
Now I've heard that somewhere before!

471
01:14:43,751 --> 01:14:45,251
A dangerous fantasist!

472
01:14:45,417 --> 01:14:47,251
That reminds me of...

473
01:14:51,292 --> 01:14:52,834
Tony!

474
01:14:56,251 --> 01:14:58,501
<i>Tony!</i>

475
01:15:52,584 --> 01:15:54,584
The young man is from the moon,
from another world...

476
01:15:54,709 --> 01:15:58,376
He fell from the Heavens?
Good, we'll send him back.

477
01:15:59,084 --> 01:16:02,792
A point, General,
where is your evidence?

478
01:16:14,751 --> 01:16:17,834
Remember, like in the fairytale,
there's a full moon!

479
01:16:18,751 --> 01:16:22,709
When the moon is directly overhead
the fortress, we can start...

480
01:16:25,334 --> 01:16:28,709
Interesting instructions on how
to blow a fortress into the air!

481
01:16:34,334 --> 01:16:36,501
The well is full of gunpowder.

482
01:16:38,001 --> 01:16:40,209
All it would take is one spark and...

483
01:16:50,292 --> 01:16:53,584
The Baron is an excellent shot,
he'll help us for sure.

484
01:17:32,334 --> 01:17:35,417
She thinks I cannot
see her, the Princess.

485
01:17:42,501 --> 01:17:46,042
Fair Princess, the Officer
of the Fortress Guard,

486
01:17:48,292 --> 01:17:52,876
at your service, to take you
safely to the General!

487
01:18:08,459 --> 01:18:11,709
Fortress regulations are clear.
Duty before emotion!

488
01:18:17,792 --> 01:18:19,084
Stop it now, young man!

489
01:18:20,376 --> 01:18:21,667
Stop!

490
01:18:23,292 --> 01:18:24,751
Don't you understand an order?

491
01:18:26,126 --> 01:18:28,167
You won't play games with me!

492
01:18:53,959 --> 01:18:55,084
Tony!

493
01:19:19,959 --> 01:19:22,459
Be grateful that
I've rid you of this rogue.

494
01:19:23,334 --> 01:19:24,917
He wants to beat you
at everything.

495
01:19:25,167 --> 01:19:29,001
He boasts that he sailed
not one, but all the seas.

496
01:19:29,209 --> 01:19:33,292
Maybe he comes from a world where
that is nothing unusual.

497
01:20:17,792 --> 01:20:21,042
And he says that he flew
faster than a cannonball.

498
01:20:21,459 --> 01:20:23,709
Why not?
Doubtless he was in a hurry!

499
01:20:42,251 --> 01:20:44,876
The boy is, as you say, a fantasist.

500
01:20:44,959 --> 01:20:51,042
If he has indeed any fantasy,
then let us see it now!

501
01:21:51,209 --> 01:21:53,417
Greetings, friends!

502
01:21:54,292 --> 01:22:01,334
Old Cyrano welcomes you!
Hither! To me!

503
01:22:10,876 --> 01:22:15,459
You've come just in time.
The hour is about to strike!

504
01:22:16,667 --> 01:22:21,292
Luna till now belonged
to the poets, to the dreamers,

505
01:22:22,584 --> 01:22:27,209
to daring fantasists and
adventurers in powdered wigs.

506
01:22:29,834 --> 01:22:32,917
To fantasists in frock coats,

507
01:22:33,834 --> 01:22:39,084
and those in bizarre helmets from
the pages of our latest novels.

508
01:22:40,292 --> 01:22:46,209
And of course to lovers, to
them Luna was always most dear!

509
01:22:47,334 --> 01:22:52,709
Thus gaily I doff my hat

510
01:22:55,459 --> 01:22:57,959
and let it fly unto the stars!

511
01:22:58,459 --> 01:23:03,042
Let it welcome, on our behalf,
all such brave fellows

512
01:23:03,209 --> 01:23:06,042
already on their way into
the welcoming arms

513
01:23:06,834 --> 01:23:09,834
of the Universe!

514
01:23:18,709 --> 01:23:23,292
THE END
