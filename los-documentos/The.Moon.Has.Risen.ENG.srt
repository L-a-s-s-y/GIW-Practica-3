<i>How time has passed by,</i>

23
00:03:07,646 --> 00:03:15,654
<i>since we parted.</i>

24
00:03:15,946 --> 00:03:23,578
<i>The years have fled.</i>

25
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:31,878
<i>I grew up a great deal.</i>

26
00:03:32,087 --> 00:03:35,424
<i>And then she said:</i>

27
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:42,931
<i>"Time is far away</i>

28
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:48,311
<i>When my hair was
short like yours.</i>

29
00:03:48,603 --> 00:03:55,235
<i>Today they are beautiful</i>

30
00:03:55,402 --> 00:03:58,739
<i>and fall in the middle
of my back."</i>

31
00:03:59,156 --> 00:04:03,076
<i>She said:</i>

32
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:11,418
<i>"Time is far away</i>

33
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:17,549
<i>when my hair was
short like yours.</i>

34
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:25,056
<i>Today they are beautiful</i>

35
00:04:25,223 --> 00:04:28,059
<i>and fall in the middle
of my back.</i>

36
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:37,694
<i>You are the only pure being</i>

37
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:46,870
<i>allowed to gently
caress my hair."</i>

38
00:04:47,037 --> 00:04:57,547
<i>They sang with melancholy.</i>

39
00:04:59,758 --> 00:05:12,145
<i>The time when their hearts
had softened.</i>

40
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:20,070
<i>The father of a young lady...</i>

41

<i>Wataru Amamiya</i>

42
00:05:40,582 --> 00:05:42,049
It's been a long time.

43
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:43,629
- How are you?
- You're early.

44
00:05:43,651 --> 00:05:46,222
- Did my postcard come?
- Yes. Come on in.

45
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:50,924
I just went to see Mr. Asai.

46
00:05:50,925 --> 00:05:53,264
So? I'm renting a room here.

47
00:06:06,374 --> 00:06:08,850
It has been a long time.

48
00:06:13,181 --> 00:06:15,258
Why did you go to Osaka?

49
00:06:16,217 --> 00:06:18,522
You know what
microwaves are?

50
00:06:18,686 --> 00:06:20,331
What?

51
00:06:21,589 --> 00:06:23,598
The highest frequency waves.

52
00:06:23,658 --> 00:06:27,704
Used for telephones.
I'm doing data on them.

53
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:30,465
Sit down.

54
00:06:41,509 --> 00:06:45,853
Using them, Tokyo and
Osaka are like local calls.

55
00:06:45,914 --> 00:06:48,255
Sounds convenient,
from when?

56
00:06:48,316 --> 00:06:50,325
Almost done now, from April.

57
00:06:50,752 --> 00:06:53,332
The Tokyo-Nagoya-Osaka
TV circuit too.

58
00:06:53,388 --> 00:06:55,431
So? You've finished
your work then?

59
00:06:55,623 --> 00:06:57,325
Just about.

60
00:06:57,825 --> 00:07:00,164
You can take it easy then.

61
00:07:01,596 --> 00:07:04,142
Here's some fried seaweed.

62
00:07:04,165 --> 00:07:06,003
Thanks.

63
00:07:08,269 --> 00:07:11,043
- What are you doing everyday?
- Just loafing around.

64
00:07:11,072 --> 00:07:13,309
Why did you quit
your last job?

65
00:07:13,408 --> 00:07:15,451
Got in a fight and got tired.

66
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:17,719
There are bad people in Kobe.

67
00:07:17,779 --> 00:07:21,720
So, you've been out of
a job since then?

68
00:07:21,749 --> 00:07:25,394
Mr. Asahi's worried too,
but there's no work.

69
00:07:25,753 --> 00:07:27,964
I could make something
translating.

70
00:07:28,022 --> 00:07:30,259
You lead a good life.

71
00:07:31,092 --> 00:07:34,466
Things are not what they seem.
Same with me.

72
00:07:35,997 --> 00:07:38,040
It's quiet here.

73
00:07:38,433 --> 00:07:41,113
Let's have a nap.

74
00:07:47,242 --> 00:07:48,944
Hello.

75
00:07:50,311 --> 00:07:52,081
All done?

76
00:07:52,614 --> 00:07:55,322
This is Setsuko Asai.
This is Mr. Amamiya.

77
00:07:55,383 --> 00:07:58,587
He's with Dai-Nihon Electricity.

78
00:08:00,989 --> 00:08:03,760
How do you do?
I'm Setsuko.

79
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,631
- She's the youngest daughter?
- Yes.

80
00:08:08,296 --> 00:08:11,636
Really? She's grown up.

81
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,638
He's going to stay here.

82
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,779
He'll eat with us tonight.

83
00:08:17,872 --> 00:08:20,118
What do you want to eat?

84
00:08:20,408 --> 00:08:23,618
Sukiyaki. I've got some eggs.

85
00:08:23,745 --> 00:08:25,991
Tell Fumiya to buy some meat.

86
00:08:27,949 --> 00:08:29,549
Thanks for everything.

87
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:31,718
- You're welcome.
- And to buy soy sauce too.

88
00:08:31,719 --> 00:08:34,988
- How about sugar?
- Sure, and charcoal too!

89
00:08:34,989 --> 00:08:37,624
- Are we buying everything?
- No, I already have some onions.

90
00:08:37,625 --> 00:08:41,328
- I see. Anything else?
- You can also buy me a pan.

91
00:08:42,163 --> 00:08:44,604
This is from Amamiya.

92
00:08:45,667 --> 00:08:47,212
Thank you.

93
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:51,214
And get that washed.

94
00:08:54,275 --> 00:08:55,954
It smells.

95
00:08:56,844 --> 00:08:59,551
No, it doesn't... Sorry!

96
00:09:06,187 --> 00:09:09,890
- She's gotten big. How old is she?
- Twenty-one.

97
00:09:09,891 --> 00:09:11,798
That old?

98
00:09:12,794 --> 00:09:14,837
How are the Asais?

99
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:16,667
They're well.

100
00:09:16,698 --> 00:09:21,769
He's on some board in Osaka.

101
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:25,908
The eldest girl was
your brother's wife.

102
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,641
Ayako is the second one.

103
00:09:27,642 --> 00:09:30,544
Ayako? She married yet?

104
00:09:30,545 --> 00:09:31,885
Not yet.

105
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:34,849
So? I remember her still.

106
00:10:00,375 --> 00:10:03,481
<i>Mokichi Asai</i>

107
00:10:47,455 --> 00:10:49,025
Do you know Mr. Amamiya?

108
00:10:49,323 --> 00:10:50,631
No.

109
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:55,332
You met him at the
Kugenuma villa.

110
00:10:56,931 --> 00:10:58,205
When?

111
00:10:58,866 --> 00:11:00,903
Shouji was still a student.

112
00:11:01,169 --> 00:11:05,515
When he brought all his
friends. Remember?

113
00:11:06,507 --> 00:11:08,384
I remember now.

114
00:11:09,477 --> 00:11:12,822
All those rough boys
around, and...

115
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:15,987
Mother escaped back
to Kojimachi.

116
00:11:16,484 --> 00:11:18,430
Was he one of them?

117
00:11:18,719 --> 00:11:20,130
Yes, don't you remember?

118
00:11:21,856 --> 00:11:23,426
I wonder which one.

119
00:11:24,859 --> 00:11:29,035
He lived in Takanawa and
was the only one wearing a shirt.

120
00:11:30,164 --> 00:11:32,337
Oh, him.

121
00:11:37,939 --> 00:11:40,943
Mr. Takasu is here.

122
00:11:41,742 --> 00:11:44,484
He came to offer
some incense.

123
00:11:44,679 --> 00:11:46,022
Really?

124
00:12:06,133 --> 00:12:09,945
- Welcome to the home.
- Haven't seen you for a longtime.

125
00:12:10,171 --> 00:12:12,481
It's been my fault.

126
00:12:13,307 --> 00:12:17,756
I couldn't come to your
husband's death-anniversary.

127
00:12:18,379 --> 00:12:19,858
I was in Tokyo.

128
00:12:20,014 --> 00:12:24,622
Not at all.
We received your nice present.

129
00:12:25,419 --> 00:12:27,729
It was nothing.

130
00:12:28,689 --> 00:12:32,762
Today I came to Nara so
I brought some incense.

131
00:12:32,894 --> 00:12:35,636
That was very kind of you.

132
00:12:45,173 --> 00:12:48,279
- Can you stay a while?
- Not really.

133
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:51,553
Do you know Mr. Amamiya?

134
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:53,849
Shouji's friend.

135
00:12:54,115 --> 00:12:55,924
I remember him.

136
00:13:00,254 --> 00:13:02,928
- Anyway, he's here.
- I see.

137
00:13:24,145 --> 00:13:25,818
When did he come?

138
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,889
This morning, from Osaka.

139
00:13:28,282 --> 00:13:31,161
Haven't seen him for
a long time.

140
00:13:39,026 --> 00:13:40,505
Time really flies.

141
00:13:42,396 --> 00:13:44,467
Been two years already.

142
00:13:51,405 --> 00:13:53,646
That was a long hot
summer.

143
00:13:54,241 --> 00:13:57,085
It seems like yesterday.

144
00:14:42,289 --> 00:14:46,567
We ate here
during our school trip.

145
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:50,640
Someone got sick on
the eggs.

146
00:14:50,831 --> 00:14:52,902
I got sick too.

147
00:14:53,301 --> 00:14:54,939
I didn't.

148
00:14:55,936 --> 00:14:57,813
That was May, wasn't it?

149
00:14:58,973 --> 00:15:00,884
The Wisteria was very
beautiful.

150
00:16:08,709 --> 00:16:11,349
My sister's asked you over.

151
00:16:11,579 --> 00:16:14,958
With Mr. Takasu,
the teacher.

152
00:16:47,181 --> 00:16:50,390
I made a mistake about
that Mr. Amamiya.

153
00:16:52,887 --> 00:16:56,357
- Isn't he the one that played the piano?
- That's right.

154
00:16:57,324 --> 00:17:00,396
- <i>Nocturnes</i> by Chopin.
- Is that what it was?

155
00:17:00,995 --> 00:17:03,566
I thought he was that
good swimmer.

156
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:06,735
That was Shigeno.
The one with the tan.

157
00:17:18,345 --> 00:17:20,347
They decided on tea.

158
00:17:20,648 --> 00:17:22,594
Serve it them.

159
00:17:24,819 --> 00:17:26,628
Is the water hot?

160
00:17:36,864 --> 00:17:39,743
Let me see. You ought
to come once in a while.

161
00:17:39,867 --> 00:17:42,313
If you loaf around,
everyplace is boring.

162
00:17:42,570 --> 00:17:44,880
But that's not
Nara's fault.

163
00:17:44,939 --> 00:17:49,547
But Nara's as slow as
a Noh drama...

164
00:17:50,277 --> 00:17:51,312
Really?

165
00:17:51,545 --> 00:17:56,119
Father, I always remember
Tokyo.

166
00:17:56,317 --> 00:18:00,060
Where we were born,
there in Kojimachi.

167
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:03,966
That was long ago.
It's all changed now.

168
00:18:04,325 --> 00:18:06,635
The Tokyo you remember
isn't there.

169
00:18:07,828 --> 00:18:11,173
I'd like to see what
our house is like now.

170
00:18:11,332 --> 00:18:13,005
All covered with weeds.

171
00:18:13,134 --> 00:18:14,579
I wonder.

172
00:18:14,768 --> 00:18:16,941
When did you move here?

173
00:18:17,972 --> 00:18:20,452
At the end of 1943.

174
00:18:21,108 --> 00:18:23,418
And you never returned
to Tokyo?

175
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:25,954
Two or three times.

176
00:18:26,113 --> 00:18:27,751
And I had to take care
of the house.

177
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:42,302
- What are you doing tomorrow?
- Nothing.

178
00:18:42,596 --> 00:18:46,066
- He's going to sleep late.
- Don't, let's go to Horyu-ji.

179
00:18:46,267 --> 00:18:49,339
- Are you going?
- With my students, but let's all go.

180
00:18:49,737 --> 00:18:52,946
- Shall we?
- You come too. - Shall I?

181
00:18:53,174 --> 00:18:55,450
- How about it?
- I want to go too.

182
00:18:56,343 --> 00:18:57,947
Go along then.

183
00:18:58,179 --> 00:19:02,423
There's no Horyu-ji
in Tokyo.

184
00:19:02,816 --> 00:19:03,988
How about you?

185
00:19:05,085 --> 00:19:08,828
I have to go to Osaka.
How about you?

186
00:19:09,723 --> 00:19:11,669
Well, I...

187
00:19:12,726 --> 00:19:14,399
How about Ayako?

188
00:19:19,567 --> 00:19:22,241
Everyone's going to
Horyu-ji tomorrow.

189
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:24,105
Well...

190
00:19:24,238 --> 00:19:25,615
Let's go.

191
00:19:27,241 --> 00:19:28,345
Yes, go.

192
00:19:28,642 --> 00:19:30,588
Let's go.

193
00:19:30,678 --> 00:19:32,954
I wonder if I should go.

194
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:36,118
Let's go.

195
00:21:17,051 --> 00:21:18,394
All right?

196
00:21:29,163 --> 00:21:32,201
No, that's like a horse.

197
00:21:40,974 --> 00:21:43,511
Why didn't Ayako come?

198
00:21:46,246 --> 00:21:47,657
Why didn't she?

199
00:21:48,782 --> 00:21:50,819
Our aunt from Tokyo came.

200
00:21:51,051 --> 00:21:53,531
She called us from Kyoto.

201
00:21:55,656 --> 00:21:57,067
I see.

202
00:21:57,758 --> 00:22:00,739
- Why did she come so suddenly?
- I wonder.

203
00:22:32,626 --> 00:22:34,537
Does Ayako still hate
watermelon?

204
00:22:35,729 --> 00:22:38,209
How did you know that?

205
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,846
I was at the Kugenuma villa.

206
00:22:43,871 --> 00:22:45,350
Really?

207
00:22:48,108 --> 00:22:50,679
We always ate it
after we'd swam.

208
00:22:50,978 --> 00:22:53,390
She'd always go look at
the sea.

209
00:22:56,683 --> 00:23:00,130
She wore a morning-glow
patterned kimono.

210
00:23:00,654 --> 00:23:02,531
When was this?

211
00:23:03,290 --> 00:23:05,964
You were picking your
nose in primary school.

212
00:23:06,126 --> 00:23:07,833
That's a lie.

213
00:23:10,631 --> 00:23:13,635
Was mother still alive then?

214
00:23:15,569 --> 00:23:18,209
You were always with her
back then.

215
00:23:19,306 --> 00:23:21,081
You remember that?

216
00:23:21,241 --> 00:23:22,686
No.

217
00:23:23,076 --> 00:23:28,082
But I remember how the
evening primroses bloomed.

218
00:23:29,116 --> 00:23:30,493
That's right.

219
00:23:31,652 --> 00:23:33,563
Let's do something.

220
00:23:33,654 --> 00:23:34,758
Like what?

221
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:37,492
Something interesting.

222
00:23:40,027 --> 00:23:43,907
If she'd come we'd have
played mah-jong.

223
00:23:44,064 --> 00:23:47,534
Sorry if I kept you waiting.

224
00:24:21,001 --> 00:24:23,607
- Welcome home.
- I'm here.

225
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:28,749
- Welcome home.
- I'm here.

226
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:30,887
Was she well?

227
00:24:31,111 --> 00:24:32,886
She's coming tomorrow.

228
00:24:33,213 --> 00:24:34,749
This is from her.

229
00:24:35,849 --> 00:24:37,658
What did she want?

230
00:24:37,951 --> 00:24:39,589
Always the same thing.

231
00:24:43,290 --> 00:24:49,541
She wanted to take me to
the Minami-za Theatre.

232
00:24:50,397 --> 00:24:54,937
I went, and
there was this man.

233
00:24:56,203 --> 00:24:58,240
A marriage meeting?

234
00:24:58,539 --> 00:25:01,679
Yes. I was surprised.

235
00:25:02,242 --> 00:25:03,482
What kind of man?

236
00:25:04,578 --> 00:25:07,354
I didn't really look at him.

237
00:25:07,748 --> 00:25:12,663
It's not nice, so sudden.
I just looked at the actors.

238
00:25:13,787 --> 00:25:16,063
She did this all by herself.

239
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:21,429
Is he the son of the
Miyazu Bank's president?

240
00:25:21,662 --> 00:25:24,802
Seems so. Always bragging
about Amanohashidate.

241
00:25:25,299 --> 00:25:27,404
She brags about it too.

242
00:25:27,567 --> 00:25:31,572
No matter how nice the scenery.
I'm not going to get married for it.

243
00:25:32,139 --> 00:25:33,812
That's true.

244
00:25:36,043 --> 00:25:37,351
I'm here!

245
00:25:43,851 --> 00:25:45,831
- I'm here.
- Welcome home.

246
00:25:46,353 --> 00:25:48,890
- Is Ayako back?
- Yes, just now.

247
00:25:52,192 --> 00:25:54,433
- I'm here.
- Welcome.

248
00:25:56,263 --> 00:26:00,803
You should have come.
It was so nice, Horyu-ji.

249
00:26:06,707 --> 00:26:10,382
Amamiya said he was at
the Kugenuma villa.

250
00:26:11,612 --> 00:26:12,647
Really?

251
00:26:16,717 --> 00:26:18,719
He remembered all
about you.

252
00:26:23,891 --> 00:26:28,601
You used to go down on
the beach and sing at night.

253
00:26:31,064 --> 00:26:32,407
I don't remember that.

254
00:26:35,469 --> 00:26:39,144
And that morning-glow kimono.

255
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:41,385
Really?

256
00:26:41,541 --> 00:26:44,021
Even remembered you
hated watermelon.

257
00:26:44,211 --> 00:26:46,122
He remembered that?

258
00:26:47,014 --> 00:26:50,393
And when you were sick
he went for ice.

259
00:26:50,917 --> 00:26:53,056
It was at the lantern
festival.

260
00:26:53,186 --> 00:26:54,597
I remember that.

261
00:26:58,659 --> 00:27:04,439
I had a fever, but I saw
the fireworks.

262
00:27:05,332 --> 00:27:09,280
You should have come today.
He's so nice.

263
00:27:10,370 --> 00:27:12,782
He's very, very nice.

264
00:27:18,845 --> 00:27:21,519
Why does he remember
such stupid things?

265
00:27:22,849 --> 00:27:24,795
Stupid?

266
00:27:55,816 --> 00:27:57,489
So? Amamiya's well?

267
00:27:57,684 --> 00:27:58,924
He's well.

268
00:27:59,186 --> 00:28:02,258
I haven't seen him.
Is he here for long?

269
00:28:02,589 --> 00:28:05,968
Four or five days,
He's going to Mt. Hiei tomorrow.

270
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:08,005
Why? Hiei.

271
00:28:08,261 --> 00:28:10,867
There's a microwave station
up there.

272
00:28:11,331 --> 00:28:15,973
Really? I can see him then.
Guess I'll go now.

273
00:28:16,169 --> 00:28:17,944
Take your time.

274
00:28:18,371 --> 00:28:21,944
I can't. I've got to go
and make supper.

275
00:28:22,742 --> 00:28:24,312
My mother's eyes aren't good.

276
00:28:25,178 --> 00:28:27,658
That's too bad. Take care.

277
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:48,179
Here, take these.

278
00:28:48,668 --> 00:28:50,511
Is it all right?

279
00:28:51,037 --> 00:28:53,517
Translating them won't
make you much though.

280
00:28:54,174 --> 00:28:56,051
You always do this for me.

281
00:28:57,043 --> 00:28:59,182
I'm tired of doing nothing.

282
00:28:59,579 --> 00:29:02,116
We'll find something soon.

283
00:29:03,016 --> 00:29:07,055
Can't even make enough
to buy cigarettes.

284
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:10,301
- Say hello to Amamiya.
- My best to your mother.

285
00:29:10,590 --> 00:29:11,830
Thanks.

286
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,496
Good afternoon!

287
00:29:17,931 --> 00:29:19,239
Are you going?

288
00:29:19,566 --> 00:29:21,705
Going back to make supper.

289
00:29:36,183 --> 00:29:38,094
He's gotten thinner.

290
00:29:38,385 --> 00:29:41,989
- He hasn't got a job yet?
- He brought me more onions.

291
00:29:42,055 --> 00:29:44,523
- Want sukiyaki again?
- Good idea.

292
00:29:44,524 --> 00:29:46,625
- You have any meat?
- No.

293
00:29:46,626 --> 00:29:50,663
- Soy sauce? Sugar? Pans?
- I've got a bowl and chopsticks.

294
00:29:50,664 --> 00:29:52,901
That's not enough.

295
00:29:52,933 --> 00:29:56,171
- Where's Mr. Amamiya?
- He went to Osaka.

296
00:29:59,239 --> 00:30:02,047
Sister had a marriage
meeting in Kyoto.

297
00:30:02,075 --> 00:30:03,645
Who with?

298
00:30:03,810 --> 00:30:06,689
A bank president's son.

299
00:30:07,581 --> 00:30:10,391
- I feel sorry for her.
- Why?

300
00:30:10,717 --> 00:30:15,996
I saw his picture, fat,
comes out to here.

301
00:30:16,590 --> 00:30:18,467
What's wrong with that?

302
00:30:19,159 --> 00:30:24,837
But he's so fat...
he's half bald too.

303
00:30:25,465 --> 00:30:27,342
Just enough
to cover the front.

304
00:30:28,502 --> 00:30:30,982
- Is he old?
- No, he's young.

305
00:30:32,739 --> 00:30:35,618
- I feel sorry for her.
- She should refuse.

306
00:30:35,742 --> 00:30:40,555
Yes. Aunt decided
all by herself about this.

307
00:30:40,714 --> 00:30:44,491
I wouldn't want him for a
brother-in-law. Not at all.

308
00:30:44,651 --> 00:30:47,097
- Really?
- Naturally.

309
00:30:48,421 --> 00:30:51,197
How would Mr. Amamiya
be for her?

310
00:30:52,425 --> 00:30:55,463
They'd make a wonderful
couple.

311
00:30:55,895 --> 00:30:57,636
I think he likes her.

312
00:30:57,998 --> 00:31:00,069
Why? How would you know?

313
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:03,376
I just know.

314
00:31:03,637 --> 00:31:07,779
He remembers just
everything about her.

315
00:31:08,341 --> 00:31:09,445
Really?

316
00:31:09,576 --> 00:31:14,047
Yes. Why else would he
know she hates watermelon?

317
00:31:15,448 --> 00:31:17,325
Just ask Mr. Amamiya.

318
00:31:17,851 --> 00:31:20,388
- How?
- Ask what he thinks of her.

319
00:31:21,021 --> 00:31:25,436
Oh, they'll just make
the most handsome couple.

320
00:31:26,526 --> 00:31:28,096
Go ask him.

321
00:31:28,295 --> 00:31:30,332
Me? Mr. Amamiya?

322
00:31:31,531 --> 00:31:33,374
It would be wonderful.

323
00:31:41,041 --> 00:31:44,989
<i>Hiei Microwave Station</i>

324
00:31:53,119 --> 00:32:00,503
There are eight of these stations
between Tokyo and Osaka.

325
00:32:01,194 --> 00:32:03,570
They send from
one to the other.

326
00:32:03,663 --> 00:32:04,933
Really?

327
00:32:05,165 --> 00:32:08,278
This station carries
486 relays at one time.

328
00:32:15,675 --> 00:32:17,616
You can really see Lake Biwa.

329
00:32:22,415 --> 00:32:25,061
When are you going
to get married?

330
00:32:25,251 --> 00:32:27,019
Already decided?

331
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:28,528
Not yet.

332
00:32:28,755 --> 00:32:31,765
I have someone in mind
for you.

333
00:32:32,359 --> 00:32:34,800
- Who?
- Ayako Asai.

334
00:32:35,628 --> 00:32:37,171
Ms. Ayako.

335
00:32:37,597 --> 00:32:39,367
You like her.

336
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:43,371
- You said you liked her.
- Me?

337
00:32:44,738 --> 00:32:48,249
Whoever said that?

338
00:32:48,975 --> 00:32:50,620
Really?

339
00:32:53,913 --> 00:32:55,922
It's too early yet.

340
00:32:56,349 --> 00:32:59,996
That's all right.
Though you liked her.

341
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:01,590
Why?

342
00:33:01,855 --> 00:33:04,592
She's had this proposal.

343
00:33:31,584 --> 00:33:33,821
Then what did he say?

344
00:33:33,853 --> 00:33:36,158
Said he never once
thought of her.

345
00:33:36,222 --> 00:33:40,837
That's not true.
He remembers just everything.

346
00:33:40,994 --> 00:33:43,140
I told him that.

347
00:33:43,863 --> 00:33:45,164
And then?

348
00:33:45,165 --> 00:33:48,346
Says he's practicing
memory training.

349
00:33:49,669 --> 00:33:53,510
Said it was too early
for talk like this.

350
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:58,755
That's a lie. He's just
talking. He likes her.

351
00:33:59,746 --> 00:34:02,420
Didn't you see how
he looked at her?

352
00:34:02,515 --> 00:34:03,585
No.

353
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:07,197
You have to pay attention
to things like that.

354
00:34:08,221 --> 00:34:09,859
His eyes changed color.

355
00:34:10,423 --> 00:34:13,063
That's because he was
wearing sun-glasses.

356
00:34:13,726 --> 00:34:18,539
And then his saying that he's
never once thought of her.

357
00:34:19,332 --> 00:34:22,176
She has to hurry to escape
from our aunt.

358
00:34:22,969 --> 00:34:24,505
Where is she?

359
00:34:24,604 --> 00:34:26,743
She had her say and then left.

360
00:34:27,173 --> 00:34:28,675
Ask him again.

361
00:34:28,808 --> 00:34:30,719
- Why?
- Just once more.

362
00:34:31,077 --> 00:34:32,454
Again?

363
00:34:32,579 --> 00:34:34,388
I don't want to. You do it.

364
00:34:34,514 --> 00:34:38,326
Me? Let's do it this way.

365
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:42,391
- How's that?
- Interesting.

366
00:34:42,555 --> 00:34:44,501
Let's call Fumiya.

367
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:47,900
- Where shall it be?
- Where?

368
00:34:48,061 --> 00:34:49,904
- Nigatsudo?
- Yes.

369
00:34:56,503 --> 00:34:58,449
- Did you call me?
- Where's Fumiya?

370
00:34:58,605 --> 00:35:01,245
She went out with Ms. Ayako.

371
00:35:01,774 --> 00:35:03,481
Wait. You'll do.

372
00:35:04,744 --> 00:35:07,623
- I have something to ask you.
- What, please?

373
00:35:07,914 --> 00:35:11,384
Now this is a secret.

374
00:35:12,352 --> 00:35:14,457
You'll call Amamiya tomorrow.

375
00:35:15,188 --> 00:35:16,963
This is Ayako Asai...

376
00:35:27,367 --> 00:35:28,675
It's a secret.

377
00:35:29,702 --> 00:35:33,411
"I would like to have
a talk with you."

378
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:36,878
"And could you please
come alone..."

379
00:35:37,811 --> 00:35:41,156
"At 3 to the Nigatsudo."

380
00:35:43,583 --> 00:35:47,121
You ask him. You're Ayako.

381
00:35:47,453 --> 00:35:49,262
That's too hard.

382
00:35:49,422 --> 00:35:52,460
It's all right. It's for her sake.

383
00:35:52,792 --> 00:35:54,999
You understand?

384
00:35:57,430 --> 00:36:00,468
Just try it now.
Go over there.

385
00:36:06,873 --> 00:36:08,352
No, further.

386
00:36:13,213 --> 00:36:14,988
There, there.

387
00:36:18,051 --> 00:36:22,090
Now you do it...
Hold the receiver.

388
00:36:24,924 --> 00:36:27,734
- "Hello..."
- "Hello..."

389
00:36:28,061 --> 00:36:29,734
He's on the line.

390
00:36:30,196 --> 00:36:32,107
He's there.

391
00:36:32,665 --> 00:36:35,874
- "Hello..."
- Stop saying hello.

392
00:36:36,536 --> 00:36:39,415
"Is this Mr. Amamiya?"

393
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:42,647
"Yes, I'm him."

394
00:36:43,142 --> 00:36:45,247
"I'm Yoneya Asai."

395
00:36:45,745 --> 00:36:47,952
No. Ayako.

396
00:36:50,149 --> 00:36:53,028
"I'm Ayako Asai"

397
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:56,193
"Not Ayako. Ayako."

398
00:37:08,668 --> 00:37:15,517
"I'm Ayako and I have something
to talk to you about."

399
00:37:15,708 --> 00:37:18,382
Sound more embarrassed
and younger.

400
00:37:21,147 --> 00:37:25,186
- "I'm truly troubling you..."
- Don't say "truly"...

401
00:37:25,385 --> 00:37:30,334
"Could you come alone at
3 to the Sangatsudo?"

402
00:37:30,523 --> 00:37:32,469
Nigatsudo.

403
00:37:32,826 --> 00:37:36,000
"Could you come at 3
to the Nigatsudo?"

404
00:37:38,398 --> 00:37:39,706
How's that?

405
00:37:39,933 --> 00:37:42,573
She's quite good.

406
00:37:43,102 --> 00:37:46,242
Very good. You'll call then.

407
00:37:46,739 --> 00:37:49,151
Don't forget. Nigatsudo at 3.

408
00:37:50,910 --> 00:37:53,117
You practice tonight.

409
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:55,791
Ayako...

410
00:38:29,582 --> 00:38:31,289
He won't come.

411
00:38:33,686 --> 00:38:35,029
I wonder.

412
00:38:35,722 --> 00:38:38,703
- What time is it?
- It's ten past three.

413
00:38:39,992 --> 00:38:42,666
He should come.
Your watch is fast.

414
00:38:42,829 --> 00:38:45,070
It's on time. He won't come.

415
00:38:46,599 --> 00:38:48,545
He ought to have come.

416
00:38:51,504 --> 00:38:53,643
He's come.

417
00:39:16,262 --> 00:39:17,468
That's him.

418
00:39:18,731 --> 00:39:20,711
He's come.

419
00:39:23,803 --> 00:39:25,282
Just look.

420
00:39:58,671 --> 00:40:00,776
His eyes are different.

421
00:40:01,007 --> 00:40:02,680
Looks like it.

422
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:07,648
Too bad she isn't here.

423
00:40:09,082 --> 00:40:11,653
How long will he wait?

424
00:40:11,884 --> 00:40:13,329
A long time.

425
00:40:13,519 --> 00:40:15,465
It's cruel.
What will we do?

426
00:40:15,588 --> 00:40:18,762
- Let him wait.
- I'll go ask Yoneya.

427
00:41:13,079 --> 00:41:15,889
Mr. Amamiya really came.

428
00:41:16,682 --> 00:41:18,457
What will we do?

429
00:41:18,718 --> 00:41:21,062
I'm sorry but you go...

430
00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:24,793
And say Ayako can't come.

431
00:41:25,691 --> 00:41:27,728
Do it politely.

432
00:41:28,394 --> 00:41:31,068
Hurry up now. Hurry.

433
00:41:42,508 --> 00:41:44,419
Where's Yoneya?

434
00:42:12,104 --> 00:42:15,847
If she hadn't gone how long
would he have waited?

435
00:42:16,776 --> 00:42:20,519
He really likes her.
He came.

436
00:42:21,414 --> 00:42:25,692
They'll make such a nice couple.

437
00:42:26,686 --> 00:42:29,462
- You talk to him now.
- Talk to him?

438
00:42:29,789 --> 00:42:32,998
- Then he'll propose to her.
- Propose?

439
00:42:33,159 --> 00:42:35,002
- That's right.
- You think so?

440
00:42:35,194 --> 00:42:39,233
- Of course he will.
- But does she like him?

441
00:42:39,665 --> 00:42:42,703
- I'm sure she likes him.
- Why?

442
00:42:42,902 --> 00:42:46,509
- She's strange since he's come.
- How?

443
00:42:46,906 --> 00:42:51,787
That new blouse. She put
the sleeves on backwards.

444
00:42:52,678 --> 00:42:56,421
She hard-boiled Father's
soft-boiled egg too.

445
00:42:57,783 --> 00:43:02,027
And the other night,
when Mr. Takasu was here.

446
00:43:04,190 --> 00:43:07,637
She sat next to Mr. Amamiya.

447
00:43:08,728 --> 00:43:13,700
She loves sukiyaki
and she hardly ate at all.

448
00:43:14,267 --> 00:43:16,406
She usually has three helpings.

449
00:43:17,336 --> 00:43:20,283
I asked her if she was
sick or something.

450
00:43:20,473 --> 00:43:24,649
She glanced at him and said...
"no", but...

451
00:43:24,944 --> 00:43:28,915
- Think how she felt.
- You see a lot.

452
00:43:30,683 --> 00:43:35,029
And after that she ate
two apples.

453
00:43:35,755 --> 00:43:38,292
Usually she only eats half of one.

454
00:43:40,059 --> 00:43:42,437
- You can see how she felt.
- I can see that.

455
00:43:42,562 --> 00:43:45,236
It's true she loves him.

456
00:43:51,971 --> 00:43:53,951
I went to Saidai-ji and
saw Tanaka.

457
00:43:54,173 --> 00:43:56,244
No job. His mother's
worried about him.

458
00:43:56,442 --> 00:43:59,719
- I wonder how his mother's eyes are.
- It doesn't seem too serious.

459
00:44:00,012 --> 00:44:03,516
I'm going back to Tokyo
day after tomorrow.

460
00:44:03,949 --> 00:44:04,984
Really?

461
00:44:05,885 --> 00:44:08,161
You're going back?

462
00:44:08,621 --> 00:44:11,761
Yes. You've been
very good to me.

463
00:44:13,592 --> 00:44:17,301
No... but can't you stay longer?

464
00:44:17,630 --> 00:44:19,473
No. I have to go back.

465
00:44:20,166 --> 00:44:21,770
I'll come again.

466
00:44:23,302 --> 00:44:25,248
When can you come?

467
00:44:25,504 --> 00:44:27,609
Autumn next year maybe.

468
00:44:27,740 --> 00:44:29,686
Next year?

469
00:44:30,242 --> 00:44:32,153
Thanks for everything.

470
00:44:43,422 --> 00:44:45,902
What'll we do?

471
00:44:46,058 --> 00:44:49,039
It's just tonight and tomorrow.

472
00:45:03,876 --> 00:45:05,947
How awful. His going back.

473
00:45:06,312 --> 00:45:09,316
- How about having them meet?
- Him and Ayako?

474
00:45:09,482 --> 00:45:12,793
Then we'll see if they
like each other.

475
00:45:13,886 --> 00:45:15,832
That's the best idea.

476
00:45:16,055 --> 00:45:20,401
Yes. And tomorrow's a full moon.

477
00:45:20,860 --> 00:45:25,434
Just the two of them, and
the moon. How wonderful.

478
00:46:05,905 --> 00:46:08,943
- What's Ayako doing?
- She's reading a book.

479
00:46:10,242 --> 00:46:12,188
Not going out?

480
00:46:18,117 --> 00:46:22,088
She should be.
What did you say?

481
00:46:23,489 --> 00:46:29,997
Amamiya called. He had
something to talk about.

482
00:46:30,296 --> 00:46:35,245
Please come to the park.
He wanted to see her.

483
00:46:36,402 --> 00:46:37,847
What did she say?

484
00:46:38,304 --> 00:46:40,113
"Really?"

485
00:46:40,272 --> 00:46:41,546
Did she smile?

486
00:46:42,241 --> 00:46:43,311
Not especially.

487
00:46:43,976 --> 00:46:45,319
It's funny.

488
00:46:45,711 --> 00:46:47,315
Has she forgotten?

489
00:46:48,380 --> 00:46:50,917
Go tell her again.

490
00:46:51,350 --> 00:46:55,230
"Time to go out.
What will you wear?"

491
00:46:55,488 --> 00:46:57,126
Say it like that.

492
00:47:00,192 --> 00:47:01,762
Is the moon out yet?

493
00:47:08,434 --> 00:47:11,005
But the mountain's so bright.

494
00:47:12,571 --> 00:47:15,916
But what if she doesn't go?

495
00:47:16,742 --> 00:47:18,380
Can't be helped.

496
00:47:18,644 --> 00:47:21,488
But that's no fun after
we tried so.

497
00:47:22,715 --> 00:47:25,889
She'll have to go look at
Amanohashidate.

498
00:47:26,418 --> 00:47:28,295
No, not that.

499
00:47:30,556 --> 00:47:33,230
- How was it?
- I asked her. - Going out?

500
00:47:33,325 --> 00:47:35,464
She just read her book.

501
00:47:37,596 --> 00:47:39,837
The moon's out.

502
00:47:41,534 --> 00:47:45,346
It's up. Make it go down!

503
00:47:45,504 --> 00:47:47,780
That's one thing
you can't do.

504
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:50,545
I'll go see.

505
00:47:58,417 --> 00:47:59,828
Sister...

506
00:48:00,186 --> 00:48:01,358
What?

507
00:48:01,687 --> 00:48:04,827
Mr. Amamiya's going back
tomorrow.

508
00:48:12,298 --> 00:48:15,711
Nice if he could have
stayed longer.

509
00:48:15,968 --> 00:48:17,276
Yes.

510
00:48:20,039 --> 00:48:21,950
Wonder why he's going.

511
00:48:25,611 --> 00:48:27,090
It's no fun.

512
00:48:36,655 --> 00:48:40,933
He won't come back
for a long time.

513
00:48:42,861 --> 00:48:46,240
Not till autumn next year.

514
00:48:51,237 --> 00:48:55,583
Maybe he's going back
to get married.

515
00:48:59,745 --> 00:49:03,215
I think so.
Are you getting married?

516
00:49:04,583 --> 00:49:06,028
Mr. Amamiya, he...

517
00:49:06,251 --> 00:49:10,165
- Be quiet. What're you talking about?
- Go downstairs.

518
00:49:34,079 --> 00:49:35,649
How was it?

519
00:49:36,515 --> 00:49:37,994
She got mad at me.

520
00:49:40,686 --> 00:49:43,599
- It won't work.
- Why not?

521
00:49:43,722 --> 00:49:45,963
She doesn't seem to like him.

522
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:50,431
But she should.

523
00:49:53,632 --> 00:49:55,942
Look how high it is.

524
00:49:58,170 --> 00:49:59,774
It's beautiful.

525
00:50:00,439 --> 00:50:04,114
And I thought they'd make
such a nice couple.

526
00:50:05,678 --> 00:50:06,884
What?

527
00:50:07,079 --> 00:50:10,322
Ms. Ayako just left
by the back door.

528
00:50:12,251 --> 00:50:13,286
Gone out?

529
00:50:13,485 --> 00:50:15,465
Yes, in a hurry.

530
00:50:15,921 --> 00:50:18,697
Really? That's good.

531
00:51:56,655 --> 00:51:58,293
It's a beautiful moon.

532
00:52:01,293 --> 00:52:03,000
Yes, it's very beautiful.

533
00:52:09,368 --> 00:52:12,178
What was it you wanted
to see me about?

534
00:52:17,109 --> 00:52:20,113
You said you had something
to talk about.

535
00:52:21,613 --> 00:52:25,459
Me? But I came because
you telephoned me.

536
00:52:28,187 --> 00:52:32,067
But it was you
who telephoned me.

537
00:52:33,692 --> 00:52:35,137
But I didn't.

538
00:52:36,995 --> 00:52:38,872
Neither did I.

539
00:52:39,898 --> 00:52:42,105
Really? I'm very sorry.

540
00:52:44,603 --> 00:52:47,243
No, it's my fault.

541
00:53:25,978 --> 00:53:27,616
It's a beautiful moon.

542
00:53:29,882 --> 00:53:31,418
Yes, it truly is.

543
00:54:00,512 --> 00:54:03,391
You're leaving tomorrow?

544
00:54:10,422 --> 00:54:13,164
We've done this before.

545
00:54:14,326 --> 00:54:18,331
At the villa, remember?
After Enoshima.

546
00:54:19,331 --> 00:54:24,644
And the moon came up.

547
00:54:28,474 --> 00:54:33,389
That too was just before
I went back to Tokyo.

548
00:54:33,745 --> 00:54:36,316
Was it?

549
00:54:48,460 --> 00:54:52,306
"Is this the same moon
I once saw rise..."

550
00:54:52,898 --> 00:54:55,970
"Over Mount Mikasa in
the land of Kasuga?"

551
00:55:09,214 --> 00:55:10,784
What a nice moon.

552
00:55:13,885 --> 00:55:15,922
Wonder what they're doing.

553
00:55:16,288 --> 00:55:19,462
Don't worry about it.

554
00:55:20,225 --> 00:55:22,501
I wonder.
What are they saying?

555
00:55:23,162 --> 00:55:25,039
They're holding hands.

556
00:55:26,865 --> 00:55:28,105
I wonder.

557
00:55:28,233 --> 00:55:30,645
Maupassant has a story
called "Moonlight".

558
00:55:31,370 --> 00:55:34,214
In the moonlight
these two fell in love.

559
00:55:35,373 --> 00:55:38,582
If one likes the other
it will be all right.

560
00:55:41,013 --> 00:55:42,185
I wonder.

561
00:55:43,415 --> 00:55:46,328
More, maybe.
Maybe they're doing it?

562
00:55:46,418 --> 00:55:48,227
- What?
- Kissing.

563
00:55:49,187 --> 00:55:50,996
That's wonderful.

564
00:55:51,290 --> 00:55:54,100
But would she?

565
00:55:54,926 --> 00:55:58,499
Sure she would.
Like in Somerset Maugham.

566
00:55:58,897 --> 00:56:01,434
Loving each other
under the moon.

567
00:56:01,833 --> 00:56:04,439
- What happened?
- They did it under the coconut palm.

568
00:56:04,669 --> 00:56:06,478
- Did what?
- Kissed.

569
00:56:13,345 --> 00:56:17,020
- Why don't they settle it?
- What?

570
00:56:17,249 --> 00:56:20,162
That they love each other.

571
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:26,669
What if they didn't say
anything and then parted?

572
00:56:27,993 --> 00:56:29,995
But lots of people
are like that.

573
00:56:30,195 --> 00:56:31,697
Yes, there are.

574
00:56:31,963 --> 00:56:35,877
I feel sorry for them,
throwing away their happiness.

575
00:56:36,368 --> 00:56:39,008
If it hadn't been for us
they'd never have known.

576
00:56:39,338 --> 00:56:41,648
They ought to give us
a big meal.

577
00:56:42,407 --> 00:56:44,216
I'm going to tell them.

578
00:56:44,409 --> 00:56:45,979
So am I.

579
00:56:50,749 --> 00:56:54,219
Look how high
the moon is.

580
00:57:07,432 --> 00:57:10,413
So, Mr. Amamiya's going?

581
00:57:10,635 --> 00:57:12,740
Yes, he's very busy.

582
00:57:13,071 --> 00:57:17,781
Wonder if he has
any work for Shouji.

583
00:57:22,347 --> 00:57:24,224
- I'm here.
- Welcome.

584
00:57:24,783 --> 00:57:26,524
Come and look at the moon.

585
00:57:26,685 --> 00:57:29,427
- I've just been looking at it.
- Really?

586
00:57:47,606 --> 00:57:49,415
Did you call?

587
00:57:50,075 --> 00:57:51,679
You come here.

588
00:57:53,278 --> 00:57:54,780
Come here.

589
00:58:02,054 --> 00:58:03,692
Did Mr. Amamiya call?

590
00:58:06,224 --> 00:58:08,670
Fumiya, who made you do that?

591
00:58:11,530 --> 00:58:13,009
Tell me.

592
00:58:14,933 --> 00:58:17,174
Who was it?

593
00:58:20,138 --> 00:58:21,515
Well...

594
00:58:23,542 --> 00:58:25,852
It was Ms. Setsuko who did it.

595
00:58:25,978 --> 00:58:29,790
Did she tell you to?

596
00:58:30,315 --> 00:58:32,192
I'm sorry.

597
00:58:33,485 --> 00:58:34,964
All right.

598
00:58:37,456 --> 00:58:38,992
You may go.

599
00:58:52,070 --> 00:58:55,074
- Is she back?
- Just now.

600
00:58:57,442 --> 00:58:58,819
Is she happy?

601
00:58:58,977 --> 00:59:00,957
She's very angry...

602
00:59:02,848 --> 00:59:05,055
About that telephone call...

603
00:59:05,217 --> 00:59:07,527
She got angry?

604
00:59:09,287 --> 00:59:11,392
She shouldn't have gotten angry.

605
00:59:12,657 --> 00:59:14,330
I'll go see.

606
01:00:31,336 --> 01:00:34,783
No, she's seems very happy.

607
01:00:35,874 --> 01:00:37,353
Really?

608
01:00:37,542 --> 01:00:39,544
She's happy-

609
01:00:40,045 --> 01:00:41,956
But just now...

610
01:00:42,113 --> 01:00:45,651
She was just saying that...
You must notice her eyes.

611
01:00:45,784 --> 01:00:47,991
- Is it like that?
- Yes.

612
01:00:50,355 --> 01:00:55,202
But it's too bad.
He's leaving tomorrow.

613
01:00:55,493 --> 01:00:57,097
Really?

614
01:02:25,784 --> 01:02:28,230
Hello. Yes, it is.

615
01:02:28,453 --> 01:02:31,957
A telegram? Just a moment.

616
01:02:34,392 --> 01:02:37,635
What, it's in numbers?

617
01:02:38,062 --> 01:02:41,566
3...7...5...5...

618
01:02:42,367 --> 01:02:44,677
3755? Is that all?

619
01:02:44,836 --> 01:02:46,645
I see, thank you.

620
01:02:57,315 --> 01:03:01,058
What could it be
this telegram?

621
01:03:01,453 --> 01:03:02,761
What?

622
01:03:04,989 --> 01:03:08,198
3755. What's that?

623
01:03:08,660 --> 01:03:10,731
I don't know.
Where's it from?

624
01:03:10,929 --> 01:03:13,170
I don't know. Tokyo.

625
01:03:13,331 --> 01:03:16,039
3755. What could it be?

626
01:03:16,901 --> 01:03:19,074
Three thousand, seven hundred...

627
01:03:19,671 --> 01:03:22,652
- Maybe it's a mistake.
- Doesn't seem to be.

628
01:03:23,474 --> 01:03:25,476
What is it? 3755.

629
01:03:25,710 --> 01:03:27,712
I'm hungry...

630
01:03:28,113 --> 01:03:30,389
What could this mean?

631
01:03:30,582 --> 01:03:32,653
A telegram?

632
01:03:33,251 --> 01:03:35,925
3755. What is it?

633
01:03:38,590 --> 01:03:42,504
Maybe it's some kind of
number code.

634
01:03:46,664 --> 01:03:48,007
I see...

635
01:03:50,869 --> 01:03:52,177
Do you understand?

636
01:04:01,512 --> 01:04:04,152
- What is it?
- I wonder.

637
01:04:04,315 --> 01:04:06,625
If we used the kana syllabary...

638
01:04:06,851 --> 01:04:08,228
Yes, we could do that.

639
01:04:08,319 --> 01:04:10,526
3755 would be "all are well."

640
01:04:10,922 --> 01:04:15,894
The bookshop's number
comes out "all can read."

641
01:04:20,365 --> 01:04:26,145
Dr. Ohara's telephone
number is "ears-nose."

642
01:04:28,106 --> 01:04:29,414
Really?

643
01:04:29,641 --> 01:04:31,746
- Ms. Setsuko...
- What?

644
01:04:42,720 --> 01:04:45,098
That telegram's from Mr. Amamiya.

645
01:04:45,723 --> 01:04:49,398
Now Ayako's sending
one to him.

646
01:04:49,694 --> 01:04:52,971
But she could send it
by telephone too.

647
01:04:53,231 --> 01:04:55,404
- It's a secret.
- What was it?

648
01:04:55,533 --> 01:04:57,706
Numbers again. 666.

649
01:04:57,936 --> 01:04:59,813
Six hundred, sixty-six.

650
01:05:00,004 --> 01:05:02,348
That's "mu-mu-mu."

651
01:05:04,442 --> 01:05:06,285
Six hundred sixty-six.

652
01:05:09,614 --> 01:05:13,426
He sent her 3755.

653
01:05:13,585 --> 01:05:14,393
That's right.

654
01:05:14,552 --> 01:05:18,329
She sent him 666.

655
01:05:18,957 --> 01:05:21,460
666.

656
01:05:24,529 --> 01:05:28,978
Send it to the quiz
program on the radio?

657
01:05:29,701 --> 01:05:31,374
Would they know?

658
01:05:32,203 --> 01:05:34,979
Wedding bells?

659
01:05:39,477 --> 01:05:41,787
You're thinking hard, Fumiya?

660
01:05:42,347 --> 01:05:45,089
Think then. You took it.

661
01:05:45,850 --> 01:05:47,523
Are you thinking, Yoneya?

662
01:05:51,823 --> 01:05:54,064
You understand it?

663
01:05:55,894 --> 01:05:57,931
- Won't Ayako tell you?
- No.

664
01:05:58,062 --> 01:06:00,099
Just laughs and won't answer.

665
01:06:03,067 --> 01:06:06,480
The telegraph office
has its own codes...

666
01:06:06,637 --> 01:06:10,050
- But these numbers aren't listed.
- Show me.

667
01:06:11,976 --> 01:06:15,185
Yonihi means
"Congratulations."

668
01:06:16,914 --> 01:06:19,451
Nino. "Baby and
Mother Well."

669
01:06:20,018 --> 01:06:23,022
Too early for that kind
of telegram!

670
01:06:33,598 --> 01:06:35,976
Why are you all laughing?

671
01:06:36,167 --> 01:06:37,805
Nothing.

672
01:06:40,371 --> 01:06:44,581
- I wanted to ask you something.
- What?

673
01:06:45,009 --> 01:06:47,114
I want to visit Tokyo.

674
01:06:47,912 --> 01:06:49,220
May I?

675
01:06:50,048 --> 01:06:51,493
What for?

676
01:06:52,016 --> 01:06:56,123
I wanted to refuse
my aunt's wedding offer.

677
01:06:57,088 --> 01:07:00,069
Well now,
can't you do it by mail?

678
01:07:00,424 --> 01:07:05,601
And to meet Mme. St-Raphael
to test my French.

679
01:07:06,731 --> 01:07:09,678
- May I?
- Well... are you going alone?

680
01:07:09,968 --> 01:07:11,538
- Yes.
- When?

681
01:07:11,769 --> 01:07:13,612
The day after tomorrow.

682
01:07:13,771 --> 01:07:15,978
I see. It's sudden.

683
01:07:17,909 --> 01:07:20,014
May I go?

684
01:07:20,812 --> 01:07:22,314
Of course.

685
01:07:24,082 --> 01:07:26,289
With your permission I'll go.

686
01:07:26,684 --> 01:07:27,890
You do that.

687
01:07:28,920 --> 01:07:30,593
Thank you very much.

688
01:07:36,894 --> 01:07:39,238
You really held your tongue.

689
01:07:40,031 --> 01:07:41,738
You didn't ask to go too.

690
01:07:41,866 --> 01:07:44,506
But I really wanted to go
to Tokyo.

691
01:07:44,702 --> 01:07:48,013
But Tokyo,
there's that mu-mu-mu.

692
01:07:48,272 --> 01:07:50,752
She wants to go alone.

693
01:07:50,908 --> 01:07:53,582
- I'd be a bother.
- Really?

694
01:07:53,845 --> 01:07:57,258
- Do you know about things like that?
- Somehow or other.

695
01:07:57,448 --> 01:07:58,859
That's really something.

696
01:07:58,983 --> 01:08:02,192
But I'm an adult, father.
I'm 21.

697
01:08:02,453 --> 01:08:04,865
I see. Then it's
your turn next.

698
01:08:04,956 --> 01:08:06,435
What?

699
01:08:07,091 --> 01:08:08,798
What did you mean?

700
01:08:10,228 --> 01:08:11,639
I mean mu-mu-mu.

701
01:08:11,762 --> 01:08:14,572
What a thing to say.

702
01:08:42,360 --> 01:08:44,237
Do you understand it?

703
01:08:45,029 --> 01:08:47,441
3755, right?

704
01:08:48,399 --> 01:08:52,541
And the other is 666.

705
01:08:53,004 --> 01:08:54,540
Well?

706
01:08:54,672 --> 01:08:57,516
I don't know. What is it?

707
01:08:58,309 --> 01:09:01,222
I'm going to call Tokyo
on the microwave.

708
01:09:01,278 --> 01:09:03,417
Just dial 103.

709
01:09:03,981 --> 01:09:06,552
- You talk too.
- To Ayako?

710
01:09:17,495 --> 01:09:20,271
103? Tokyo, please.

711
01:09:21,299 --> 01:09:26,009
Tokyo 40-2560.

712
01:09:27,105 --> 01:09:30,643
This is 35-672.

713
01:09:31,709 --> 01:09:33,655
Should I wait?

714
01:09:35,580 --> 01:09:37,651
Hello.

715
01:09:37,949 --> 01:09:41,897
Yes. I'm calling from Osaka.

716
01:09:42,787 --> 01:09:45,927
Is Ayako there?

717
01:09:46,824 --> 01:09:48,497
It's really fast.

718
01:09:49,827 --> 01:09:54,833
Ayako, this is Setsuko.
I've understood.

719
01:09:55,233 --> 01:09:57,736
3755-666.

720
01:10:00,237 --> 01:10:01,910
It's wonderful.

721
01:10:01,973 --> 01:10:04,476
You talked Aunt out of it?

722
01:10:04,942 --> 01:10:06,478
That's good.

723
01:10:06,677 --> 01:10:08,554
Here's our sister.

724
01:10:09,313 --> 01:10:11,418
She seems very happy.

725
01:10:11,949 --> 01:10:15,158
Hello. Ayako? It's me.

726
01:10:17,922 --> 01:10:21,870
Shall I tell you?
3755.

727
01:10:22,893 --> 01:10:24,395
What is it?

728
01:10:25,930 --> 01:10:29,241
The Manyoshu poetry
collection.

729
01:10:30,401 --> 01:10:36,079
"Beloved wife, so far away,
I think of you the more."

730
01:10:37,475 --> 01:10:39,648
Means he's worried,
she's so far away.

731
01:10:41,979 --> 01:10:43,890
As for mu-mu-mu...

732
01:10:44,348 --> 01:10:51,732
"Though we met but for a moment,
how now I miss you more."

733
01:10:52,390 --> 01:10:54,165
That's Sakanoe no
Iratsume's.

734
01:10:54,492 --> 01:10:55,493
That's right.

735
01:10:55,593 --> 01:10:58,267
Just paned and
dying to see him again.

736
01:10:58,496 --> 01:11:02,876
Yes, a really passionate
telegram.

737
01:11:03,067 --> 01:11:06,810
She really thought about it.
You caught on fast though.

738
01:11:07,038 --> 01:11:08,779
Yes, I did.

739
01:11:10,842 --> 01:11:15,882
She left her Manyoshu
on her desk.

740
01:11:16,447 --> 01:11:19,758
She'd marked these
two in red pencil.

741
01:11:21,652 --> 01:11:25,361
I have to go.
I'm leaving now.

742
01:11:25,423 --> 01:11:27,425
Why so soon?

743
01:11:27,658 --> 01:11:29,569
Shouji is waiting.

744
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:31,603
- Is he in Osaka?
- Yes.

745
01:11:31,729 --> 01:11:34,369
- He's meeting his new boss.
- Really?

746
01:11:34,832 --> 01:11:37,278
That's why you're so happy.

747
01:11:37,535 --> 01:11:39,446
- Then it's decided.
- What?

748
01:11:39,770 --> 01:11:42,751
But isn't it true?

749
01:11:44,041 --> 01:11:47,488
I'm going.

750
01:11:54,285 --> 01:11:57,858
It's their happiest time now.

751
01:11:58,723 --> 01:12:00,225
That's true.

752
01:12:08,766 --> 01:12:11,906
To send each other the
Manyoshu poem numbers...

753
01:12:12,436 --> 01:12:18,580
Is it really old fashioned
or really modern?

754
01:12:18,910 --> 01:12:20,446
It's both.

755
01:12:22,213 --> 01:12:28,391
"Though we met but for a moment,
how now I miss you more"?

756
01:13:07,358 --> 01:13:09,099
You're back?

757
01:13:10,961 --> 01:13:13,999
I thought we might
see a movie. I waited.

758
01:13:14,999 --> 01:13:17,605
Shall I peel you an
apple, or a persimmon?

759
01:13:19,270 --> 01:13:21,250
How was it?

760
01:13:22,673 --> 01:13:23,947
What kind of work?

761
01:13:24,075 --> 01:13:25,952
Tokyo branch office.

762
01:13:27,812 --> 01:13:29,314
Tokyo?

763
01:13:31,816 --> 01:13:35,457
I gave it to Tanaka,
he went with me.

764
01:13:36,854 --> 01:13:38,663
Didn't you like it?

765
01:13:39,123 --> 01:13:41,296
No, it was good.

766
01:13:42,460 --> 01:13:44,098
Why did you give it away?

767
01:13:44,662 --> 01:13:48,166
Tanaka needed it.
I'll get something.

768
01:14:00,244 --> 01:14:05,023
But can you find something
you like in Tokyo?

769
01:14:05,850 --> 01:14:07,693
Why did you have
to do that?

770
01:14:16,160 --> 01:14:19,607
I know perfectly well
he needs work...

771
01:14:20,932 --> 01:14:23,378
I was wishing he would
find something.

772
01:14:23,501 --> 01:14:26,482
But you really looked
for that job.

773
01:14:28,005 --> 01:14:30,952
I worried about you,
loafing around.

774
01:14:31,242 --> 01:14:33,415
Then you found this.

775
01:14:35,379 --> 01:14:40,351
But, between us, I don't
need work like he does.

776
01:14:41,318 --> 01:14:45,323
He's got his old mother
to take care of.

777
01:14:46,657 --> 01:14:50,503
He had a hard time in the war
and only just got back.

778
01:14:51,128 --> 01:14:53,802
Seeing all that, and his mother,

779
01:14:54,799 --> 01:14:57,143
I had to do it.

780
01:14:57,635 --> 01:14:59,080
I wonder.

781
01:14:59,837 --> 01:15:05,219
I know why you felt that,
why you've been so good to him...

782
01:15:06,677 --> 01:15:10,989
You gave him translation work,
you gave him clothes...

783
01:15:12,883 --> 01:15:18,390
I thought what good friends
men can be together.

784
01:15:19,256 --> 01:15:22,499
But I never thought
you'd gave him your job.

785
01:15:22,693 --> 01:15:26,106
It's so only after you
yourself had a job.

786
01:15:27,164 --> 01:15:29,371
I never thought
you'd do this.

787
01:15:30,835 --> 01:15:32,405
That's so, but...

788
01:15:32,603 --> 01:15:37,177
It's all over.
And Tanaka is very happy.

789
01:15:37,341 --> 01:15:38,945
Of course he is.
It's only natural.

790
01:15:40,344 --> 01:15:41,823
Only natural? What?

791
01:15:45,382 --> 01:15:49,125
He has a nerve.
He knows you need work.

792
01:15:49,720 --> 01:15:53,258
He didn't ask. I gave it him.

793
01:15:54,925 --> 01:15:56,734
So what will you do?

794
01:15:57,061 --> 01:16:03,273
I know how impatient you
were with your life.

795
01:16:05,236 --> 01:16:08,809
Living like this everyday,

796
01:16:09,239 --> 01:16:11,412
I felt sorry for you.

797
01:16:11,909 --> 01:16:14,446
You needn't have been.

798
01:16:14,845 --> 01:16:17,826
- Just mind your own business.
- But...

799
01:16:18,249 --> 01:16:23,426
I feel good about it.
I did the right thing.

800
01:16:24,488 --> 01:16:27,469
And after you'd gotten
a Tokyo job.

801
01:16:29,226 --> 01:16:32,105
Then we could have
gone to Tokyo.

802
01:16:33,564 --> 01:16:37,273
Is that what you
were thinking?

803
01:16:44,208 --> 01:16:47,883
I wasn't hunting for a job
to take you to Tokyo.

804
01:16:48,779 --> 01:16:51,191
If you want, go by yourself.

805
01:16:51,315 --> 01:16:53,454
You've no rights on my job.

806
01:16:55,987 --> 01:16:58,399
You're only thinking
of yourself.

807
01:16:58,689 --> 01:17:02,330
I hate people who
think like that.

808
01:17:03,727 --> 01:17:07,937
You go do what you like.

809
01:17:08,599 --> 01:17:10,408
I'll go my own way.

810
01:17:14,838 --> 01:17:20,447
I won't even talk to anyone who
thinks only of herself.

811
01:17:28,085 --> 01:17:30,463
Go home.

812
01:19:05,983 --> 01:19:07,360
Where's Ms. Setsuko?

813
01:19:17,995 --> 01:19:20,999
You're back early.

814
01:19:30,240 --> 01:19:33,153
How did Shouji do
with his job?

815
01:19:37,548 --> 01:19:39,687
What's the matter?

816
01:19:44,488 --> 01:19:47,662
Are you crying? Why?

817
01:19:50,727 --> 01:19:52,866
You had a fight with him.

818
01:20:02,339 --> 01:20:04,341
Why did you fight?

819
01:20:05,275 --> 01:20:07,186
That's not nice.

820
01:20:09,580 --> 01:20:11,651
If you just cry
I won't understand.

821
01:20:12,916 --> 01:20:15,658
What happened?
Did he say something?

822
01:20:19,123 --> 01:20:20,864
Why did you fight?

823
01:20:25,362 --> 01:20:26,705
I don't know.

824
01:20:29,166 --> 01:20:31,077
Don't worry about it.

825
01:20:32,202 --> 01:20:35,342
Young people get over
their quarrels.

826
01:20:36,907 --> 01:20:38,580
Silly.

827
01:20:39,743 --> 01:20:42,314
You're getting your
dress all wet.

828
01:20:43,680 --> 01:20:45,956
What a child.

829
01:20:47,051 --> 01:20:50,624
Don't. Leave me alone.

830
01:23:01,051 --> 01:23:04,032
You weren't at the Noh practice.

831
01:23:15,833 --> 01:23:18,541
Haven't you two made up yet?

832
01:23:20,637 --> 01:23:23,584
It's all right to fight sometimes.

833
01:23:23,740 --> 01:23:28,519
You've got to learn.

834
01:23:30,447 --> 01:23:36,762
But what are you going to do,
just stay around here?

835
01:23:37,054 --> 01:23:38,727
I guess so.

836
01:23:39,623 --> 01:23:47,166
But that was good,
giving your job to your friend.

837
01:23:47,998 --> 01:23:51,878
Nowadays you don't
see things like that.

838
01:23:55,139 --> 01:23:59,610
It's not much good,
but I heard of something.

839
01:24:00,711 --> 01:24:02,315
What kind of work?

840
01:24:04,281 --> 01:24:07,592
Teaching in a Tokyo
priests' school.

841
01:24:07,884 --> 01:24:11,730
An old friend's the principal.

842
01:24:12,155 --> 01:24:14,635
English teaching.

843
01:24:14,791 --> 01:24:16,202
I see.

844
01:24:16,894 --> 01:24:19,568
Things don't come to
he who waits.

845
01:24:19,763 --> 01:24:25,770
Try what you can,
then you'll find what you like.

846
01:24:26,136 --> 01:24:30,482
Yes, but could I teach priests?

847
01:24:30,607 --> 01:24:31,608
Why not?

848
01:24:31,708 --> 01:24:33,984
I don't know anything about
Buddhism.

849
01:24:34,077 --> 01:24:37,388
Someone else teaches that.

850
01:24:37,948 --> 01:24:40,087
You'll just teach English.

851
01:24:40,584 --> 01:24:46,296
But I like to eat raw fish.
I like pork cutlets too.

852
01:24:46,423 --> 01:24:50,098
Yes, and you can even
have some sake.

853
01:24:50,293 --> 01:24:53,297
Really? Well, I'll try it.

854
01:24:54,298 --> 01:24:56,972
Really? You'll try it?

855
01:24:57,134 --> 01:24:58,977
<i>Yes, I will.</i>

856
01:25:01,338 --> 01:25:03,716
- Teaching at a priests' school.
- Yes.

857
01:25:04,441 --> 01:25:06,250
When will you go?

858
01:25:06,443 --> 01:25:08,787
The priest said
I should go soon.

859
01:25:08,979 --> 01:25:12,290
Nothing to pack.
Thought I'd go tomorrow.

860
01:25:12,683 --> 01:25:16,096
Really. That's sudden.

861
01:25:17,754 --> 01:25:20,166
It will be different.

862
01:25:20,924 --> 01:25:23,461
I'll just leave
the stuff I borrowed.

863
01:25:23,593 --> 01:25:25,197
Yes, do.

864
01:25:25,362 --> 01:25:31,313
It'd be nice to have a farewell
meal, but you've no time.

865
01:25:43,513 --> 01:25:48,019
You hurry up.
He's about to leave.

866
01:25:48,819 --> 01:25:52,995
He's going to Tokyo.
You make up with him now.

867
01:25:57,294 --> 01:26:00,173
Setsuko, you like Shouji,
don't you?

868
01:26:00,764 --> 01:26:03,745
You tell him how you feel.

869
01:26:04,601 --> 01:26:07,104
You can't just
pan like this.

870
01:26:07,971 --> 01:26:12,920
If he goes off when could
you make up with him?

871
01:26:14,144 --> 01:26:16,784
Hurry up now.

872
01:26:18,515 --> 01:26:20,552
He's leaving. Hurry.

873
01:26:29,893 --> 01:26:32,669
- You've been good to me.
- Take care now.

874
01:26:32,796 --> 01:26:34,366
Take care.

875
01:26:56,353 --> 01:26:58,060
That was really sudden.

876
01:26:58,188 --> 01:27:00,361
So I thought I'd try it.

877
01:27:00,757 --> 01:27:02,668
Better than loafing.

878
01:27:03,793 --> 01:27:05,602
You can get something
better later.

879
01:27:06,396 --> 01:27:08,672
That's what the priest said.

880
01:27:09,332 --> 01:27:10,868
When do you leave?

881
01:27:11,201 --> 01:27:12,703
Tonight's express.

882
01:27:13,203 --> 01:27:14,739
Alone?

883
01:27:15,672 --> 01:27:18,278
Not with Setsuko?

884
01:27:18,908 --> 01:27:19,886
Why not?

885
01:27:21,611 --> 01:27:24,990
Take her, she so wanted to go.

886
01:27:26,416 --> 01:27:29,522
Have a fight or something?

887
01:27:30,420 --> 01:27:33,867
- Take her along.
- No, she'll do as she likes.

888
01:27:34,057 --> 01:27:37,368
She wanted to go with you.

889
01:27:37,594 --> 01:27:39,471
No, it's all right.

890
01:27:39,663 --> 01:27:41,939
It'll be hard for you all alone.

891
01:27:42,099 --> 01:27:44,010
I'm used to it.

892
01:27:44,601 --> 01:27:46,774
You ought to take her.

893
01:27:47,270 --> 01:27:48,578
Thanks.

894
01:27:52,075 --> 01:27:53,816
Sorry I'm late.

895
01:27:54,745 --> 01:27:56,122
Thank you.

896
01:28:06,256 --> 01:28:09,237
- Got your ticket?
- I've already bought it.

897
01:28:09,392 --> 01:28:12,032
- What time?
- Nine-thirty.

898
01:28:12,329 --> 01:28:15,538
So you leave tonight.

899
01:28:16,933 --> 01:28:18,435
I see.

900
01:29:07,617 --> 01:29:09,221
Hello...

901
01:29:10,353 --> 01:29:12,026
From Osaka?

902
01:29:13,623 --> 01:29:16,968
Oh, Mr. Takasu...
Hello.

903
01:29:17,427 --> 01:29:21,000
Now what's this
about a fight?

904
01:29:22,099 --> 01:29:24,375
Why not go to Tokyo
with him?

905
01:29:25,702 --> 01:29:27,978
But he won't if you
fight with him.

906
01:29:28,204 --> 01:29:30,912
But he's gone to
Tokyo by now.

907
01:29:32,108 --> 01:29:34,213
Call your elder sister,
would you?

908
01:29:34,878 --> 01:29:36,516
My sister? OK.

909
01:29:36,746 --> 01:29:38,020
Just a moment.

910
01:29:43,453 --> 01:29:45,592
It's a call from
Mr. Takasu.

911
01:29:54,497 --> 01:29:57,307
Sorry to have kept
you waiting.

912
01:30:06,676 --> 01:30:09,179
We were a nuisance
the other day.

913
01:30:34,905 --> 01:30:38,978
You still moping?
Forget about it.

914
01:30:39,642 --> 01:30:42,020
Then you shouldn't
have fought.

915
01:30:46,950 --> 01:30:49,863
Would you go to
the temple and...

916
01:30:50,553 --> 01:30:54,831
Bring the calligraphy book,
Shouji borrowed?

917
01:31:03,833 --> 01:31:07,645
Stupid thing. You just
forget all about that now.

918
01:31:08,138 --> 01:31:12,553
Girls who haven't married
have to smile all the time.

919
01:31:15,979 --> 01:31:17,390
Wait...

920
01:32:33,423 --> 01:32:35,403
Come here.

921
01:32:43,366 --> 01:32:44,868
You still mad?

922
01:32:47,036 --> 01:32:49,676
I came for you.
Won't you come?

923
01:32:50,874 --> 01:32:52,785
How about it?

924
01:32:53,776 --> 01:32:55,221
You'll go?

925
01:32:56,212 --> 01:32:58,158
I can't tell by your eyes.

926
01:33:05,121 --> 01:33:06,964
You're going with me
to Tokyo.

927
01:33:07,290 --> 01:33:08,997
We haven't much money.

928
01:33:09,459 --> 01:33:12,065
You'll cook for us...
You'll do the laundry...

929
01:33:13,496 --> 01:33:16,306
You'll do it all yourself.

930
01:33:18,935 --> 01:33:20,778
You'll get all dirty
with work.

931
01:33:21,371 --> 01:33:23,248
And I'll be as good
as I can to you.

932
01:33:26,643 --> 01:33:29,487
It won't be a life like
you've had here.

933
01:33:30,346 --> 01:33:33,122
We won't have money,
we'll get hungry.

934
01:33:33,616 --> 01:33:35,994
But you'll have
to laugh at it.

935
01:33:36,653 --> 01:33:38,690
But I'll be really
good to you.

936
01:33:40,890 --> 01:33:44,531
We'll build our new
lives together.

937
01:33:45,762 --> 01:33:48,038
You're grown-up now.

938
01:33:54,671 --> 01:33:55,911
You understand?

939
01:33:58,975 --> 01:34:00,477
You've understood?

940
01:34:07,650 --> 01:34:11,996
You can't cry. I just
said you had to laugh.

941
01:34:15,525 --> 01:34:18,734
But, you're bad.
You're making me cry.

942
01:34:19,963 --> 01:34:21,738
Don't cry any more...

943
01:34:24,868 --> 01:34:26,575
Let's not fight too.

944
01:34:28,471 --> 01:34:29,916
I'm sorry.

945
01:34:33,043 --> 01:34:35,717
But that was very close.

946
01:34:39,349 --> 01:34:44,291
If you had gone we wouldn't ever
have seen each other again.

947
01:34:47,190 --> 01:34:50,501
We talked a lot about
Ayako's problems, but...

948
01:34:52,095 --> 01:34:55,099
We never talked
about ours.

949
01:34:59,402 --> 01:35:04,442
I never told you
how l really felt.

950
01:35:05,308 --> 01:35:07,185
And I didn't tell you.

951
01:35:09,012 --> 01:35:13,222
I'll tell you everything
from now on.

952
01:35:15,018 --> 01:35:17,294
You don't need to now.

953
01:35:18,621 --> 01:35:19,929
Why not?

954
01:35:20,356 --> 01:35:22,495
To say it once is enough.

955
01:35:29,499 --> 01:35:31,001
Thank you.

956
01:35:52,622 --> 01:35:54,067
Sit down.

957
01:36:04,033 --> 01:36:05,637
Do you like me?

958
01:36:10,840 --> 01:36:11,978
Yes.

959
01:36:13,810 --> 01:36:15,255
Do you love me?

960
01:36:18,314 --> 01:36:19,258
I love you.

961
01:37:12,902 --> 01:37:14,540
What a beautiful moon.

962
01:37:18,975 --> 01:37:22,479
It's a month since
we saw this moon.

963
01:37:26,382 --> 01:37:28,760
The moon's strange...

964
01:37:29,852 --> 01:37:33,095
I wonder how many couples
have looked at it.

965
01:37:40,196 --> 01:37:45,737
I'm going to remember this,
the moon over Nara.

966
01:37:46,402 --> 01:37:48,177
The moon over Mikasa.

967
01:37:49,138 --> 01:37:51,482
The moon on the
hanafuda cards.

968
01:37:52,141 --> 01:37:54,052
What?

969
01:37:54,277 --> 01:37:57,383
I'll teach you - more fun
than ordinary cards.

970
01:37:59,782 --> 01:38:01,386
It's a nice moon.

971
01:38:02,085 --> 01:38:03,894
Yes, it really is.

972
01:39:02,678 --> 01:39:05,488
I suppose they're
in Tokyo now.

973
01:39:06,082 --> 01:39:11,191
Probably at Ayako's.

974
01:39:12,922 --> 01:39:16,665
They're all gone.
Aren't you lonely?

975
01:39:17,427 --> 01:39:20,897
It can't be helped.
They all grew up.

976
01:39:23,299 --> 01:39:29,215
I guess young people like
that dirty, dusty Tokyo.

977
01:39:29,705 --> 01:39:32,618
It has it charms for
young people.

978
01:39:33,009 --> 01:39:34,352
Guess so.

979
01:39:34,610 --> 01:39:37,318
Nara's almost too
peaceful.

980
01:39:37,847 --> 01:39:41,226
Do you dislike Nara?

981
01:39:43,586 --> 01:39:47,534
You're young,
you shouldn't stay here.

982
01:39:49,859 --> 01:39:52,066
Would you get
married again?

983
01:39:53,596 --> 01:39:54,700
Father...

984
01:39:54,897 --> 01:39:58,970
Widows can get
married again.

985
01:40:00,069 --> 01:40:03,278
You've got happiness
coming to you.

986
01:40:03,973 --> 01:40:07,978
It's your turn to be happy.
Go get married.

987
01:40:08,477 --> 01:40:11,083
No, I don't think so.

988
01:40:11,847 --> 01:40:13,520
No, I bet you are.

989
01:40:18,354 --> 01:40:21,733
Next time someone
who won't die.

990
01:40:23,626 --> 01:40:25,196
How about Takasu?

991
01:40:30,433 --> 01:40:33,004
He's strong. He'll last.

992
01:40:34,537 --> 01:40:36,517
You like him.

993
01:40:39,675 --> 01:40:42,815
You help others
but won't help yourself.

994
01:40:45,481 --> 01:40:47,586
Bashful?

995
01:40:55,491 --> 01:41:00,099
Think about it,
make up your mind, soon.

996
01:41:04,667 --> 01:41:07,011
What nice weather.

997
01:41:08,804 --> 01:41:11,808
This good fall weather will last.

998
01:41:12,041 --> 01:41:14,385
Nara's nice then.

999
01:41:20,149 --> 01:41:21,719
Father...

1000
01:42:47,453 --> 01:42:54,078
THE END
