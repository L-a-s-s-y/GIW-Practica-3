1
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,957
OEDIPUS REX

2
00:01:35,166 --> 00:01:37,457
THEBES

3
00:06:00,416 --> 00:06:02,415
How beautiful the lady is.

4
00:06:03,875 --> 00:06:05,082
- Good morning.
- Hello.

5
00:06:05,208 --> 00:06:07,290
- How are you? Hello.
- Fine.

6
00:06:26,041 --> 00:06:28,624
You're here to take
my place in the world,

7
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:31,374
send me back into the void,

8
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:34,124
and rob me of all I have.

9
00:06:47,833 --> 00:06:50,040
Come along, ma'am.

10
00:07:02,791 --> 00:07:04,790
She'll be the first
thing you steal from me,

11
00:07:04,916 --> 00:07:06,915
she, the woman I love...

12
00:07:07,041 --> 00:07:08,999
You already steal her love!

13
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,374
He's asleep.

14
00:07:46,708 --> 00:07:48,207
Let's go.

15
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:55,665
Stop it.

16
00:08:07,833 --> 00:08:09,249
Mama!

17
00:14:07,208 --> 00:14:10,540
What swollen little
feet! Tied up so tight.

18
00:14:12,791 --> 00:14:14,915
Don't cry, don't cry.

19
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:42,707
- What have you brought me?
- He was alone on Mount Cithaeron.

20
00:14:42,833 --> 00:14:45,499
- Son of Fortune.
- I found him there.

21
00:14:45,625 --> 00:14:48,540
He was crying, so I brought
him here, thinking you...

22
00:14:48,666 --> 00:14:50,290
Give him to me, idiot!

23
00:14:53,291 --> 00:14:55,415
Son of Fortune.

24
00:14:56,708 --> 00:14:59,707
See him? He squeals like a goat.

25
00:14:59,833 --> 00:15:03,582
This Son of Fortune shall
be King of Corinth one day.

26
00:16:25,041 --> 00:16:27,040
Queen!

27
00:16:28,083 --> 00:16:30,499
Queen, look!

28
00:16:30,625 --> 00:16:32,249
The king! The king!

29
00:16:32,375 --> 00:16:34,749
- Queen!
- The king!

30
00:16:35,958 --> 00:16:37,749
The king! The king!

31
00:16:46,291 --> 00:16:49,957
Queen, look what I have!

32
00:16:50,541 --> 00:16:52,290
A gift from the gods!

33
00:16:52,416 --> 00:16:55,415
He's cute, his eyes look like stars.

34
00:16:57,333 --> 00:16:59,165
A gift from the gods!

35
00:17:02,458 --> 00:17:06,790
Why this look, so sad
and grave? Laugh, instead!

36
00:17:08,208 --> 00:17:11,207
Give thanks to the gods.
We have found a son today.

37
00:17:11,333 --> 00:17:14,832
Give him to me. How you hold
him! Do you want to kill him?

38
00:17:14,958 --> 00:17:17,499
Without the slightest delicacy.

39
00:17:19,583 --> 00:17:22,290
Come, Little Swollen Feet.

40
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:25,665
Little Oedipus, my son.

41
00:18:08,416 --> 00:18:09,832
I won!

42
00:18:12,166 --> 00:18:15,165
I won! Crown me!

43
00:18:20,416 --> 00:18:22,665
I won!

44
00:18:22,791 --> 00:18:25,290
Oedipus kicked the disc ahead.

45
00:18:25,416 --> 00:18:27,249
You can see the mark in the dust!

46
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:32,582
Foundling!

47
00:18:33,125 --> 00:18:37,290
Son of Fortune! False son
of your father and mother!

48
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:13,165
Mother...

49
00:19:15,208 --> 00:19:18,165
I had a bad dream, but
I don't remember it.

50
00:19:18,291 --> 00:19:23,249
I woke up crying and trembling in
the dark, like when I was a child.

51
00:19:24,041 --> 00:19:26,790
The gods meant to tell me something.

52
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:30,790
But what if I don't remember,
if I can't remember it?

53
00:19:30,916 --> 00:19:34,165
I lay awake with chills till dawn came,

54
00:19:34,291 --> 00:19:37,207
afraid of the silence and the darkness.

55
00:19:37,791 --> 00:19:41,082
Mother, Father, I'd like to go to Delphi

56
00:19:41,208 --> 00:19:44,415
to ask the Oracle of
Apollo about my dream,

57
00:19:44,541 --> 00:19:47,040
about what I can't remember.

58
00:19:47,166 --> 00:19:48,582
Of course, my son.

59
00:19:48,708 --> 00:19:52,124
All make a pilgrimage at least once
in their life to Apollo's shrine,

60
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:55,707
rich and poor to ask about their dreams,

61
00:19:55,833 --> 00:19:57,790
and you haven't gone yet.

62
00:19:57,916 --> 00:19:58,915
It's beautiful there.

63
00:19:59,041 --> 00:20:01,624
I went there with your
father when I was young.

64
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:04,082
Didn't I? Do you remember?

65
00:20:04,208 --> 00:20:06,999
It's a real feast, better than ours.

66
00:20:07,125 --> 00:20:08,915
Very well.

67
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:11,707
If you want to go, then go.

68
00:20:11,833 --> 00:20:14,999
You'll have an incomparable escort.

69
00:20:15,125 --> 00:20:18,457
- No, Father. I want to go alone.
- But...

70
00:20:18,583 --> 00:20:20,999
Yes, of course. Our son is right.

71
00:20:22,083 --> 00:20:25,415
The gods don't care for
display, they want sincerity.

72
00:20:26,208 --> 00:20:28,249
When will you leave?

73
00:20:28,958 --> 00:20:32,957
- Tomorrow at dawn.
- So soon? At once?

74
00:20:33,083 --> 00:20:35,165
Why should I wait?

75
00:20:35,291 --> 00:20:39,540
I don't want that dream to
come and torment me again.

76
00:21:12,416 --> 00:21:15,749
Don't cry. I'll be back in a few days.

77
00:21:23,375 --> 00:21:25,540
Goodbye, son.

78
00:21:26,625 --> 00:21:28,624
Goodbye, Little Swollen Feet.

79
00:21:30,916 --> 00:21:33,415
Goodbye, Father. Goodbye, Mother.

80
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:44,582
CORINTH

81
00:25:07,291 --> 00:25:11,290
In your fate it's written
you shall kill your father

82
00:25:11,416 --> 00:25:13,332
and make love with your mother.

83
00:25:26,041 --> 00:25:29,040
You understand? It's
written in your fate.

84
00:25:29,166 --> 00:25:32,290
You shall kill your father
and make love with your mother.

85
00:25:33,375 --> 00:25:36,665
This says the god, and it
will surely come to pass.

86
00:25:38,666 --> 00:25:40,249
Now go away.

87
00:25:41,125 --> 00:25:43,582
Don't taint these people
with your presence.

88
00:29:46,708 --> 00:29:50,540
Where are you going, my youth?
Where are you going, my life?

89
00:34:55,250 --> 00:34:57,124
Out of the way!

90
00:34:57,250 --> 00:34:58,999
Out of my way, beggar!

91
00:35:03,458 --> 00:35:05,999
Get out of the way!

92
00:35:08,833 --> 00:35:12,790
Off the road! Watch out!

93
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,165
Boy, what happened?

94
00:45:08,291 --> 00:45:12,040
Why are all these people
leaving the city...

95
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,915
...and camping here
like a tribe of gypsies?

96
00:45:16,833 --> 00:45:17,874
Do you know?

97
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:22,165
Of course I know. I'm the
messenger, I bring the news.

98
00:45:22,291 --> 00:45:23,790
I have to know.

99
00:45:23,916 --> 00:45:25,124
And?

100
00:45:26,875 --> 00:45:28,290
Come with me.

101
00:46:36,708 --> 00:46:38,915
That's Tiresias, the prophet.

102
00:46:42,791 --> 00:46:45,124
Your brothers and fellows suffer, weep,

103
00:46:45,250 --> 00:46:47,124
searching for salvation...

104
00:46:47,250 --> 00:46:50,124
And you're here alone,
blind and singing...

105
00:46:50,250 --> 00:46:56,207
I wish I were you! You
sing what's beyond destiny.

106
00:47:54,250 --> 00:47:57,124
Our city's misfortune is up there.

107
00:47:58,416 --> 00:48:02,915
It came up from a deep
abyss to frighten us.

108
00:48:03,041 --> 00:48:04,915
We were all doing fine before.

109
00:48:05,750 --> 00:48:07,124
Who could have imagined that?

110
00:48:07,958 --> 00:48:11,040
Nobody dares drive it back to the abyss,

111
00:48:11,166 --> 00:48:14,290
even though the man who
does will marry Jocasta,

112
00:48:14,416 --> 00:48:16,124
the queen of Thebes.

113
00:48:16,250 --> 00:48:18,082
And so our city's lost.

114
00:48:18,791 --> 00:48:22,332
Everyone's leaving.
There's no point in staying.

115
00:48:51,500 --> 00:48:52,999
Where are you going?

116
00:48:53,125 --> 00:48:55,957
Don't go! It's no use!

117
00:48:56,083 --> 00:48:57,499
You'll die.

118
00:48:59,916 --> 00:49:01,707
Come back! What are you doing?

119
00:49:01,833 --> 00:49:02,999
Come back!

120
00:49:25,291 --> 00:49:28,707
There's an enigma in
your life. What is it?

121
00:49:28,833 --> 00:49:31,415
I don't know. I don't want to know.

122
00:49:34,208 --> 00:49:35,374
It's useless.

123
00:49:36,875 --> 00:49:38,457
I don't want to see you.

124
00:49:38,583 --> 00:49:41,207
I don't want to see you.
I don't want to hear you!

125
00:49:41,333 --> 00:49:45,540
It's useless. The abyss where
you're thrusting me is inside you.

126
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:16,374
The sphinx is dead!

127
00:50:23,333 --> 00:50:25,582
Come! Come!

128
00:50:25,708 --> 00:50:57,082
The sphinx is dead!

129
00:50:59,083 --> 00:51:00,915
The sphinx is gone!

130
00:52:09,166 --> 00:52:12,082
Come to Creon! Come to the queen!

131
00:52:12,208 --> 00:52:15,832
Whoever kills the sphinx becomes
the queen's husband! I told you!

132
00:52:16,625 --> 00:52:18,249
You'll be king!

133
00:52:18,750 --> 00:52:19,957
Come!

134
00:52:29,416 --> 00:52:30,415
There she is.

135
00:55:14,916 --> 00:55:16,249
My love.

136
00:57:50,791 --> 00:57:54,999
These boys and I are
here to beseech you,

137
00:57:55,500 --> 00:57:57,999
not because we look upon you as a god.

138
00:57:58,708 --> 00:58:01,249
When you came here,

139
00:58:01,375 --> 00:58:03,499
didn't you rid us of the sphinx?

140
00:58:04,250 --> 00:58:08,082
You didn't perform this act
because you were wiser than us,

141
00:58:08,208 --> 00:58:10,165
but rather with the help of a god.

142
00:58:10,291 --> 00:58:13,915
Therefore Oedipus, our king,
we beg you on our knees,

143
00:58:14,416 --> 00:58:16,290
find a solution, it doesn't matter what,

144
00:58:16,416 --> 00:58:19,457
whether prompted by a god or a man.

145
00:58:20,291 --> 00:58:22,582
You who are the best among us,

146
00:58:22,708 --> 00:58:24,332
give life back to us.

147
00:58:25,083 --> 00:58:28,415
Don't let your reign be remembered

148
00:58:28,541 --> 00:58:30,790
because you raised us up

149
00:58:30,916 --> 00:58:32,749
and then let us fall again.

150
00:58:45,500 --> 00:58:48,874
I am aware of the wishes you bring,

151
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:50,957
oh, unfortunate citizens.

152
00:58:51,083 --> 00:58:53,290
I know how you suffer,

153
00:58:53,416 --> 00:58:55,624
but no one suffers more than I.

154
00:58:55,750 --> 00:58:59,290
Because your sorrow
touches one of you alone,

155
00:58:59,416 --> 00:59:02,749
while mine is the sorrow
of all, mine and yours.

156
00:59:03,958 --> 00:59:06,457
You haven't awakened me.

157
00:59:06,583 --> 00:59:09,457
I was not sleeping, I was crying,

158
00:59:10,041 --> 00:59:12,832
seeking ways to escape my thoughts.

159
00:59:13,750 --> 00:59:15,832
There is only one course.

160
00:59:15,958 --> 00:59:17,790
I have taken it.

161
00:59:18,541 --> 00:59:21,915
I have sent my brother-in-law
Creon to Apollo's shrine

162
00:59:22,041 --> 00:59:24,207
to learn what to do.

163
00:59:27,083 --> 00:59:30,540
And having counted the
time since Creon left,

164
00:59:30,666 --> 00:59:32,082
I am anxious.

165
00:59:33,041 --> 00:59:34,582
What's he doing?

166
00:59:34,708 --> 00:59:38,749
Why is he so late? Why
hasn't he returned yet?

167
00:59:57,958 --> 01:00:00,082
Creon is here. He's at the city gates.

168
01:00:11,500 --> 01:00:14,915
God, may he bring us
a fate of salvation!

169
01:00:21,333 --> 01:00:24,290
Creon, my
brother-in-law, my friend!

170
01:00:24,416 --> 01:00:26,374
What is the answer?

171
01:00:26,500 --> 01:00:28,332
Good news!

172
01:00:29,291 --> 01:00:31,832
Even the most horrid
things can end well.

173
01:00:31,958 --> 01:00:34,540
But the answer. We want the answer.

174
01:00:36,208 --> 01:00:39,957
Shall I tell it before all
or alone inside the house?

175
01:00:40,083 --> 01:00:41,749
Before all.

176
01:00:41,875 --> 01:00:44,124
I suffer for them.

177
01:00:44,250 --> 01:00:45,457
This is what I heard from the god.

178
01:00:45,583 --> 01:00:47,540
"To defeat the disease
which plagues Thebes,

179
01:00:47,666 --> 01:00:50,249
"the man who spread it
must leave the town."

180
01:00:50,708 --> 01:00:53,665
What is he charged with?
What can his sentence be?

181
01:00:54,416 --> 01:00:56,832
Death or exile.

182
01:00:56,958 --> 01:01:00,374
A murder is the cause
of what’s happening here.

183
01:01:01,125 --> 01:01:03,165
Who might the victim be?

184
01:01:04,208 --> 01:01:06,582
Before you, the king was Laius.

185
01:01:06,708 --> 01:01:08,540
So I was told.

186
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:10,124
I never met him.

187
01:01:10,250 --> 01:01:13,499
He is the victim. The gods want
his murderer to be punished.

188
01:01:13,625 --> 01:01:16,082
How can we find him?

189
01:01:16,750 --> 01:01:20,082
Where can we find the traces of a
crime which took place so long ago?

190
01:01:20,666 --> 01:01:23,457
Here, the god said.

191
01:01:26,208 --> 01:01:27,332
Here.

192
01:01:27,458 --> 01:01:28,832
And he added,

193
01:01:29,458 --> 01:01:31,915
"What we don't want
to know does not exist,

194
01:01:32,583 --> 01:01:34,249
"but what we want to know...

195
01:01:36,500 --> 01:01:37,874
"...exists."

196
01:01:40,583 --> 01:01:43,457
Was Laius killed in the palace?

197
01:01:43,583 --> 01:01:45,749
In the country? Abroad?

198
01:01:46,250 --> 01:01:48,374
He was going to Apollo's shrine...

199
01:01:50,500 --> 01:01:51,832
...and he never returned.

200
01:01:51,958 --> 01:01:57,290
No guard or travelling
companion witnessed the murder?

201
01:01:57,416 --> 01:01:59,874
Only one escaped.

202
01:02:00,500 --> 01:02:02,415
And he reported one thing.

203
01:02:02,541 --> 01:02:05,915
What? From one thing
others can be deduced.

204
01:02:06,041 --> 01:02:07,582
Yes, there were rumours.

205
01:02:08,666 --> 01:02:10,207
What rumours? I want to know everything.

206
01:02:10,875 --> 01:02:14,957
That he wasn't killed by
bandits but by a wayfarer.

207
01:02:15,083 --> 01:02:16,749
Who could prove it?

208
01:02:16,875 --> 01:02:18,540
The only living witness.

209
01:02:19,541 --> 01:02:21,999
Frighten him, and he'll speak.

210
01:02:24,375 --> 01:02:26,249
These are my decisions.

211
01:02:26,375 --> 01:02:28,707
As your king I command

212
01:02:28,833 --> 01:02:32,874
that whoever knows
who killed Laius speak,

213
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,999
even if he knows he'd accuse himself.

214
01:02:36,125 --> 01:02:38,457
If those who know don't speak,

215
01:02:38,583 --> 01:02:42,624
I forbid the men of this
nation which now is mine

216
01:02:42,750 --> 01:02:46,207
to welcome him and pray with him.

217
01:02:46,333 --> 01:02:51,290
I shall avenge the slain
king as if he were my father.

218
01:02:52,083 --> 01:02:54,665
Now that his power has passed to me,

219
01:02:54,791 --> 01:02:57,832
and his possessions
and his wife are mine.

220
01:03:44,041 --> 01:03:45,540
My love.

221
01:07:34,625 --> 01:07:36,290
Tiresias! You're here!

222
01:07:36,416 --> 01:07:38,040
I have sent for you, and from you

223
01:07:38,166 --> 01:07:39,874
I'LL KNOW ALL!

224
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,665
How terrible knowledge is,

225
01:07:43,791 --> 01:07:47,374
when to know is useless
to him who knows.

226
01:07:49,750 --> 01:07:54,040
I knew, but I preferred to forget.

227
01:07:55,083 --> 01:07:58,290
Otherwise I wouldn't have come here.

228
01:07:58,416 --> 01:08:00,790
What's wrong? What frightens you?

229
01:08:00,916 --> 01:08:03,040
Let me go home.

230
01:08:03,708 --> 01:08:06,082
I beg you, listen to me.

231
01:08:06,750 --> 01:08:09,165
The burden will be lighter for us both.

232
01:08:09,291 --> 01:08:12,332
No. To speak to the city is your duty.

233
01:08:12,458 --> 01:08:15,082
Your words are of no
use even to yourself.

234
01:08:15,916 --> 01:08:18,249
Stay, in God's name! You know!

235
01:08:18,833 --> 01:08:21,624
We all beseech you, my citizens and I.

236
01:08:21,750 --> 01:08:23,957
You're mad.

237
01:08:25,083 --> 01:08:28,457
I won't speak. I won't
reveal your crime.

238
01:08:28,583 --> 01:08:30,040
You know and you keep silent!

239
01:08:30,166 --> 01:08:32,582
Do you want to betray us?
You want to ruin our town?

240
01:08:32,708 --> 01:08:34,290
You have a heart of stone!

241
01:08:34,416 --> 01:08:36,624
You reproach me,

242
01:08:36,750 --> 01:08:39,124
you blame my nature...

243
01:08:42,166 --> 01:08:45,707
...and don't want to
judge your own nature.

244
01:08:46,208 --> 01:08:47,457
Who wouldn't be offended?

245
01:08:47,583 --> 01:08:50,415
Your words are insulting,
to the king and this town.

246
01:08:52,833 --> 01:08:54,665
Facts will speak...

247
01:08:55,958 --> 01:08:58,290
...even if I say nothing.

248
01:08:58,416 --> 01:09:00,207
Therefore speak!

249
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:03,415
I've said too much.

250
01:09:05,416 --> 01:09:08,832
- Be as angry as you wish.
- Yes?

251
01:09:09,416 --> 01:09:11,874
Then you should know what I think.

252
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,957
I think that you plotted the crime!

253
01:09:15,083 --> 01:09:19,249
Were you not blind, you would
have done it with your hands.

254
01:09:20,166 --> 01:09:22,040
This is what you think?

255
01:09:22,750 --> 01:09:24,165
Then I say...

256
01:09:25,416 --> 01:09:28,665
obey your own judgement,

257
01:09:28,791 --> 01:09:31,957
and beware of remaining here
among us from this moment on.

258
01:09:32,083 --> 01:09:35,999
You're the guilty one
who infects our land.

259
01:09:36,125 --> 01:09:38,415
I'll tell you again.

260
01:09:39,250 --> 01:09:42,124
You're the murderer you're seeking.

261
01:09:42,250 --> 01:09:44,832
And you do not know of your wicked bond

262
01:09:44,958 --> 01:09:47,415
with the people dearest to you.

263
01:09:49,083 --> 01:09:51,582
And you refuse to see
the evil in yourself.

264
01:09:51,708 --> 01:09:54,457
You will not escape your words unharmed!

265
01:09:54,958 --> 01:09:56,915
I'm already safe.

266
01:09:57,916 --> 01:10:00,082
I have the truth on my side.

267
01:10:00,541 --> 01:10:03,624
The truth for everyone but you,

268
01:10:03,750 --> 01:10:06,499
with blind eyes, ears, and mind!

269
01:10:06,625 --> 01:10:08,124
Unhappy man!

270
01:10:08,916 --> 01:10:10,999
You insult me

271
01:10:11,125 --> 01:10:14,457
as everybody will insult
you in a short time.

272
01:10:14,583 --> 01:10:18,290
Who's responsible for
these lies, you or Creon?

273
01:10:18,416 --> 01:10:19,832
Oh, wealth! Oh, power!

274
01:10:19,958 --> 01:10:24,207
What envy you arouse in this human
life that is nothing but a struggle!

275
01:10:24,333 --> 01:10:27,124
Thanks to the power
I received as a gift,

276
01:10:27,250 --> 01:10:28,665
power that was unasked for.

277
01:10:28,791 --> 01:10:32,999
Even the faithful Creon
wants to overthrow me.

278
01:10:33,125 --> 01:10:36,624
Creon, yes, wants to take my place

279
01:10:36,750 --> 01:10:38,999
sending this charlatan,

280
01:10:39,125 --> 01:10:42,832
this beggar who can see only
when he can earn something,

281
01:10:42,958 --> 01:10:44,665
and is blind in his art.

282
01:10:45,500 --> 01:10:47,624
Even if you are the king,

283
01:10:47,750 --> 01:10:50,749
I can reply as frankly as you...

284
01:10:51,583 --> 01:10:52,915
...if I wish to.

285
01:10:53,916 --> 01:10:57,290
I am subject only to God.

286
01:10:58,500 --> 01:11:03,582
And since, before all
and in God's presence

287
01:11:03,708 --> 01:11:07,415
you have mocked my
blindness and my old age,

288
01:11:07,541 --> 01:11:09,207
I say this to you.

289
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:11,707
You look

290
01:11:11,833 --> 01:11:15,499
and do not see the shame
and evil in which you are.

291
01:11:16,916 --> 01:11:18,624
Do you know who gave you life?

292
01:11:18,750 --> 01:11:21,874
Do you know that your kind,
living and dead, curse you?

293
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,957
One day you will see only darkness.

294
01:11:25,083 --> 01:11:27,374
How you'll cry out then,

295
01:11:27,500 --> 01:11:30,415
the day when you finally understand

296
01:11:30,541 --> 01:11:33,665
how, and with whom you were married.

297
01:11:33,791 --> 01:11:35,832
Son of Fortune!

298
01:11:42,041 --> 01:11:45,374
And I have to put up with you
addressing me like this? I would leave.

299
01:11:45,500 --> 01:11:47,374
Leave at once!

300
01:11:51,791 --> 01:11:53,499
What are you waiting for?

301
01:11:53,625 --> 01:11:56,665
Leave! Out of my sight!

302
01:11:56,791 --> 01:11:58,540
I don't want to hear you!

303
01:11:58,666 --> 01:12:02,124
If I'm here it's because you called me.

304
01:12:02,250 --> 01:12:04,332
I'd never have done it

305
01:12:04,458 --> 01:12:07,749
if I thought I'd hear such nonsense.

306
01:12:17,833 --> 01:12:20,624
This, you see, is our fate.

307
01:12:20,750 --> 01:12:22,665
We are mad in your eyes.

308
01:12:22,791 --> 01:12:25,957
We are wise for those who begot you.

309
01:12:27,083 --> 01:12:29,457
What do you mean? Who begot me?

310
01:12:30,333 --> 01:12:31,707
Let us go.

311
01:12:32,625 --> 01:12:34,332
Lead me.

312
01:12:34,458 --> 01:12:36,165
Yes, go away and disappear.

313
01:12:36,291 --> 01:12:38,915
And with you goes my torment.

314
01:12:40,291 --> 01:12:41,707
I shall leave.

315
01:12:42,291 --> 01:12:46,874
But only when I've
said all I have to say.

316
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:50,457
Listen.

317
01:12:51,208 --> 01:12:53,832
The man you are seeking...

318
01:12:55,083 --> 01:12:57,540
...with threats and orders,

319
01:12:57,666 --> 01:13:00,290
is here, a foreigner as all believe...

320
01:13:01,416 --> 01:13:03,624
...yet he is from Thebes.

321
01:13:03,750 --> 01:13:06,790
But he'll not rejoice in this discovery,

322
01:13:06,916 --> 01:13:09,582
because, having become a blind beggar,

323
01:13:09,708 --> 01:13:12,874
he'll wander through foreign lands...

324
01:13:14,041 --> 01:13:16,874
...like me, wretched flute-player.

325
01:13:17,583 --> 01:13:19,707
It will be known

326
01:13:19,833 --> 01:13:23,874
that he is at once brother
and father of his children,

327
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,874
son and husband of his mother.

328
01:13:27,958 --> 01:13:32,457
That he has slept with the
woman who was his father's.

329
01:13:33,166 --> 01:13:38,082
And that he, he alone,
is his father's murderer.

330
01:17:21,791 --> 01:17:23,874
Oedipus refuses to recognise his crime,

331
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,040
and he puts the blame
on me and his people.

332
01:18:51,791 --> 01:18:54,707
Oh, look! Why have you come here?

333
01:18:54,833 --> 01:18:57,082
How dare you turn up at my house?

334
01:18:58,583 --> 01:19:02,832
You, who want to get rid
of me and seize my kingdom?

335
01:19:04,083 --> 01:19:07,957
You've come because you think
I'm a coward and a madman?

336
01:19:08,083 --> 01:19:11,415
I've got power and
the people on my side.

337
01:19:11,541 --> 01:19:13,165
You have nothing.

338
01:19:14,416 --> 01:19:19,040
Don't say you're innocent,
without evil intentions towards me.

339
01:19:21,541 --> 01:19:24,207
You suggested that I question Tiresias.

340
01:19:26,541 --> 01:19:29,540
- How long ago was Laius...
- Laius...

341
01:19:30,250 --> 01:19:34,124
Was Laius killed without a trace?

342
01:19:34,250 --> 01:19:36,165
A long time ago.

343
01:19:36,291 --> 01:19:39,707
And Tiresias? Did he
utter no prophecies?

344
01:19:41,916 --> 01:19:44,040
Yes, winning the respect of everyone.

345
01:19:44,916 --> 01:19:48,957
He didn't mention me, by
chance, in his prophecies?

346
01:19:49,458 --> 01:19:51,040
In my presence, never.

347
01:19:51,500 --> 01:19:53,332
Then...

348
01:19:53,458 --> 01:19:58,332
into the death of Laius, your
king, you made no inquiries?

349
01:19:58,875 --> 01:20:00,749
Surely, but in vain.

350
01:20:01,250 --> 01:20:04,582
In this case, why did
Tiresias not say anything?

351
01:20:05,208 --> 01:20:07,249
- I don't know.
- Really?

352
01:20:08,791 --> 01:20:11,957
And you don't know that you two agree

353
01:20:12,083 --> 01:20:15,832
when he says I'm the
murderer we are seeking?

354
01:20:15,958 --> 01:20:18,290
You tell me. Isn't your wife my sister?

355
01:20:18,416 --> 01:20:20,832
Your sister? Of course she is!

356
01:20:21,416 --> 01:20:23,582
Don't you share power with her?

357
01:20:23,708 --> 01:20:26,290
Of course I do.

358
01:20:27,500 --> 01:20:29,374
And with me, too.

359
01:20:30,208 --> 01:20:32,165
What do I lack? No, no.

360
01:20:32,875 --> 01:20:35,624
No. I've no desire to be the sovereign.

361
01:20:36,166 --> 01:20:39,874
I'm content to live like a
sovereign. It is much wiser.

362
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:44,915
I have what I want without
effort or worries of any kind.

363
01:20:45,041 --> 01:20:47,249
But if I were king,

364
01:20:47,375 --> 01:20:49,374
how many trials I'd have!

365
01:20:49,958 --> 01:20:52,165
Too much anxiety and responsibility!

366
01:20:52,291 --> 01:20:54,790
No, madness and evil are one.

367
01:20:54,916 --> 01:20:58,582
I am not mad to want a better
state than the one I live in.

368
01:20:59,583 --> 01:21:03,665
Go to Apollo's shrine and
make sure of the Oracle,

369
01:21:03,791 --> 01:21:06,665
see if I invented it
in league with Tiresias.

370
01:21:06,791 --> 01:21:10,790
If I did, condemn me rightly.

371
01:21:10,916 --> 01:21:14,207
And your sentence will
be death, not exile!

372
01:21:14,750 --> 01:21:16,082
Death!

373
01:21:17,166 --> 01:21:19,832
This problem comes from the
heart, for valid reasons.

374
01:21:19,958 --> 01:21:21,665
You can't accept your victory.

375
01:21:21,791 --> 01:21:23,624
- That's not true.
- You're lying!

376
01:21:23,750 --> 01:21:25,540
If you don't want to understand...

377
01:21:37,291 --> 01:21:39,415
In that case, go.

378
01:21:40,125 --> 01:21:43,624
It's not for him, but
for you that I'll do it.

379
01:21:45,583 --> 01:21:48,582
This way I also condemn myself.

380
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,374
You give in, but with rancour. Why?

381
01:21:53,166 --> 01:21:55,374
Go! Go!

382
01:21:55,500 --> 01:21:59,249
Go! What are you waiting for?

383
01:22:13,083 --> 01:22:14,415
Why?

384
01:22:14,541 --> 01:22:15,999
Why you and Creon?

385
01:22:17,041 --> 01:22:21,165
Because your brother
accuses me of Laius' murder.

386
01:22:22,500 --> 01:22:26,749
Did he make this charge on
his own or was he prompted?

387
01:22:26,875 --> 01:22:31,249
No, he brought me Tiresias.
Tiresias accuses me.

388
01:22:31,375 --> 01:22:32,915
He is innocent.

389
01:22:33,041 --> 01:22:35,832
If that’s what you want
to tell me, be calm.

390
01:22:35,958 --> 01:22:38,832
No man can be a prophet.

391
01:22:39,666 --> 01:22:42,457
Listen and tell me if I'm wrong.

392
01:22:43,958 --> 01:22:48,499
Once a prophecy came to
my husband, King Laius.

393
01:22:49,416 --> 01:22:53,124
It said that one day he
would be murdered by a son

394
01:22:53,250 --> 01:22:54,624
that I gave to him.

395
01:22:55,375 --> 01:22:59,499
But he was killed by a gang
of bandits at a crossroads.

396
01:23:00,791 --> 01:23:02,249
I must tell you...

397
01:23:03,541 --> 01:23:07,290
...that Laius had had
the child, our son, taken,

398
01:23:07,416 --> 01:23:09,124
and had his feet tied up.

399
01:23:10,166 --> 01:23:15,207
Then he had him thrown off
a mountain where he died.

400
01:23:16,458 --> 01:23:20,624
Judge, then, if prophecies
predict the future.

401
01:23:20,750 --> 01:23:23,082
Don't worry, believe me.

402
01:23:24,250 --> 01:23:27,457
God reveals to us his intentions

403
01:23:27,583 --> 01:23:29,790
without ambiguity or intermediaries.

404
01:23:29,916 --> 01:23:33,749
If you knew how much those
words of yours scare me!

405
01:23:50,916 --> 01:23:52,790
What do you fear?

406
01:23:52,916 --> 01:23:55,290
Laius was killed at a crossroads.

407
01:23:56,250 --> 01:23:58,249
Yes, so they said.

408
01:23:58,958 --> 01:24:00,665
Where is it?

409
01:24:01,916 --> 01:24:04,874
On the road between
Apollo's shrine and here.

410
01:24:08,083 --> 01:24:10,415
How long ago?

411
01:24:10,541 --> 01:24:13,499
The news of his murder
reached us shortly before...

412
01:24:15,375 --> 01:24:17,124
...your arrival in Thebes.

413
01:24:21,166 --> 01:24:23,582
God, what do you want to do with me!

414
01:24:24,500 --> 01:24:29,457
I don't understand why you're
so interested in these things.

415
01:24:29,583 --> 01:24:31,415
Ask me nothing.

416
01:24:33,208 --> 01:24:36,290
What did Laius look like? How old?

417
01:24:36,750 --> 01:24:39,040
Tall, with a big, long beard.

418
01:24:39,958 --> 01:24:42,040
He resembled you.

419
01:24:42,166 --> 01:24:45,665
Then maybe I was cursing myself before.

420
01:24:51,166 --> 01:24:55,665
Why does it frighten you so
to be your mother's lover? Why?

421
01:24:55,791 --> 01:24:58,707
Many men dream of that.

422
01:24:59,333 --> 01:25:01,374
Maybe they live in fear?

423
01:25:01,916 --> 01:25:04,082
The truth must be sought.

424
01:25:05,166 --> 01:25:07,582
And I fear Tiresias sees into the truth.

425
01:25:08,625 --> 01:25:11,082
But was he travelling alone,

426
01:25:11,208 --> 01:25:13,915
your husband Laius,
or with a great escort?

427
01:25:14,625 --> 01:25:16,957
He was with five men,

428
01:25:17,083 --> 01:25:20,332
four soldiers and a servant, on a cart.

429
01:25:20,458 --> 01:25:22,165
And who said that?

430
01:25:22,916 --> 01:25:25,332
The servant who escaped.

431
01:25:25,458 --> 01:25:28,749
- Is he still here, this servant?
- No.

432
01:25:29,250 --> 01:25:31,832
When he returned and
saw you in Laius' place,

433
01:25:31,958 --> 01:25:35,707
he begged me to send him with our flock

434
01:25:35,833 --> 01:25:37,915
as far from Thebes as possible.

435
01:25:38,041 --> 01:25:41,749
I granted his wish. That
faithful servant deserved it.

436
01:25:43,083 --> 01:25:44,624
Why do you ask me of him?

437
01:25:45,208 --> 01:25:47,665
Ask me no questions, I've said too much.

438
01:25:48,708 --> 01:25:52,040
I fear I've said even this unwillingly.

439
01:25:55,583 --> 01:25:57,082
Unwillingly.

440
01:25:58,375 --> 01:26:01,624
My father is Polybus, King of Corinth!

441
01:26:01,750 --> 01:26:03,665
My mother is Merope!

442
01:26:03,791 --> 01:26:08,499
But a boy I offended
once called me false son!

443
01:26:08,625 --> 01:26:10,499
I couldn't be silent.

444
01:26:10,625 --> 01:26:12,915
I questioned my parents.

445
01:26:13,041 --> 01:26:17,124
And they ridiculed the
person that insulted me.

446
01:26:17,250 --> 01:26:20,874
And I knew they were telling the truth.

447
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:24,457
But the doubt remained,
I couldn't dispel it.

448
01:26:24,583 --> 01:26:27,832
Then I went to the shrine of Apollo...

449
01:26:29,166 --> 01:26:32,999
...but the god not only
did not answer my questions,

450
01:26:33,125 --> 01:26:36,790
he actually revealed other
frightful things to me.

451
01:26:36,916 --> 01:26:40,415
It was destined that I would
make love with my mother...

452
01:26:40,541 --> 01:26:41,707
Shut up! No.

453
01:26:41,833 --> 01:26:45,165
And that I would beget
monstrous children!

454
01:26:46,166 --> 01:26:51,707
It was destined, too, that
I should murder my father.

455
01:26:51,833 --> 01:26:53,790
After such prophecies,

456
01:26:53,916 --> 01:26:58,082
with what heart could I
return home, to my parents...

457
01:26:58,208 --> 01:26:59,874
- I don't want to hear you!
- ...in Corinth.

458
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,624
I will not, will not hear!

459
01:27:02,750 --> 01:27:05,415
We must talk!

460
01:27:05,541 --> 01:27:07,249
Poor Oedipus!

461
01:27:07,375 --> 01:27:09,665
May you never know who you are!

462
01:27:09,791 --> 01:27:13,457
Then I went off from Corinth, at random.

463
01:27:13,583 --> 01:27:16,124
I met a man at a crossroads.

464
01:27:16,250 --> 01:27:20,290
He was on a cart with
four guards and a servant.

465
01:27:20,416 --> 01:27:23,332
A quarrel sprang up and
I killed the guards...

466
01:27:23,458 --> 01:27:27,415
- What's the use of talking?
- ...and the man who had insulted me...

467
01:27:28,416 --> 01:27:32,624
...who insulted me with his arrogance,

468
01:27:32,750 --> 01:27:37,707
his wish to master me, his authority.

469
01:27:37,833 --> 01:27:41,957
If there were some kinship
between that man and Laius,

470
01:27:42,083 --> 01:27:43,874
then I...

471
01:28:00,208 --> 01:28:01,540
Mother!

472
01:28:20,708 --> 01:28:21,832
I'll go pray.

473
01:28:22,916 --> 01:28:25,249
I'll go pray to the
gods in their temples.

474
01:28:26,250 --> 01:28:28,165
Oedipus has a heart
swollen with too much agony.

475
01:28:28,291 --> 01:28:30,707
He doesn't explain the new with
the old according to reason...

476
01:28:31,916 --> 01:28:35,624
...but believing whatever is said,
provided that it brings anguish.

477
01:28:36,291 --> 01:28:38,874
I'll go to pray for us

478
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:43,957
because we're all terrified
seeing this good helmsman of ours

479
01:28:44,083 --> 01:28:45,665
mad with terror.

480
01:28:56,291 --> 01:29:00,040
I've come to your town to
speak with Oedipus, the king.

481
01:29:00,166 --> 01:29:01,624
I am his wife.

482
01:29:01,750 --> 01:29:04,415
What do you want? Speak about what?

483
01:29:08,791 --> 01:29:11,124
Good news for your house.

484
01:29:12,875 --> 01:29:14,874
What? From whom?

485
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:16,415
From Corinth.

486
01:29:16,541 --> 01:29:20,665
I have news that will give you
joy and perhaps also sorrow.

487
01:29:21,625 --> 01:29:23,082
Speak!

488
01:29:23,208 --> 01:29:24,582
In Corinth,

489
01:29:24,708 --> 01:29:27,999
the inhabitants mean to
elect Oedipus their king.

490
01:29:28,583 --> 01:29:31,999
Isn't his father, old
Polybus, King of Corinth?

491
01:29:32,125 --> 01:29:33,124
He was.

492
01:29:33,750 --> 01:29:37,582
He died and was taken to his tomb.

493
01:30:23,166 --> 01:30:26,082
- Is this the man you spoke about?
- Yes.

494
01:30:28,583 --> 01:30:32,124
It's your turn, old man.
Look at me and answer.

495
01:30:32,250 --> 01:30:35,374
- Were you Laius' servant?
- Yes.

496
01:30:36,208 --> 01:30:38,332
- What were you?
- Shepherd.

497
01:30:38,958 --> 01:30:40,707
Where did you graze?

498
01:30:40,833 --> 01:30:44,124
On Cithaeron, or thereabouts.

499
01:30:44,250 --> 01:30:48,165
- Have you ever met this man?
- What do you mean?

500
01:30:48,291 --> 01:30:51,165
This man, do you know him?

501
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:54,040
I'm trying to remember him.

502
01:30:54,166 --> 01:30:57,540
But I've never seen him... ever.

503
01:30:58,583 --> 01:31:00,457
That's natural.

504
01:31:00,583 --> 01:31:02,665
It was long ago.

505
01:31:02,791 --> 01:31:05,207
But together,

506
01:31:05,333 --> 01:31:08,082
we spent three seasons, three seasons!

507
01:31:08,208 --> 01:31:11,915
That may be true, but it
was years and years ago.

508
01:31:12,041 --> 01:31:15,582
I found a baby on the
mountain, and you were there.

509
01:31:15,708 --> 01:31:18,957
What? Why do you ask me?

510
01:31:19,083 --> 01:31:22,874
Oedipus, your king, is
the baby of that day.

511
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:26,207
Stop it. That's nonsense!

512
01:31:26,916 --> 01:31:30,582
Not his words, but yours are nonsense!

513
01:31:31,416 --> 01:31:33,415
Be careful what you do!

514
01:31:33,541 --> 01:31:36,332
What, O King, do you reproach me for?

515
01:31:36,458 --> 01:31:37,790
For your silence!

516
01:31:37,916 --> 01:31:40,915
For not speaking of the
baby you're asked about!

517
01:31:41,041 --> 01:31:44,207
I know nothing. What
would you want me to say?

518
01:31:44,333 --> 01:31:48,249
You'll be forced to speak. Watch out!

519
01:31:49,083 --> 01:31:51,499
I'm an old man. A poor old man.

520
01:31:52,583 --> 01:31:55,624
Take him! Tie him up!
Put an end to this!

521
01:31:56,125 --> 01:31:58,624
But what? What do you want to know?

522
01:32:03,208 --> 01:32:08,790
So, did you take this baby
to the mountain or not?

523
01:32:08,916 --> 01:32:10,915
I did.

524
01:32:11,916 --> 01:32:14,165
I wish I had died on that day.

525
01:32:16,166 --> 01:32:18,415
And who gave him to you?

526
01:32:19,250 --> 01:32:21,540
Was he your son or not?

527
01:32:23,625 --> 01:32:27,707
He wasn't mine, he was
given to me by others.

528
01:32:29,291 --> 01:32:31,540
- Others.
- Who were these others?

529
01:32:32,041 --> 01:32:36,415
- In the name of God, don't ask me!
- Speak, or you're done for!

530
01:32:37,583 --> 01:32:38,915
He was Laius'.

531
01:32:39,458 --> 01:32:42,124
His slave or his son?

532
01:32:42,250 --> 01:32:45,415
This is a thing that cannot be said.

533
01:32:47,833 --> 01:32:49,707
And I can't listen to it.

534
01:32:50,750 --> 01:32:52,249
But I must.

535
01:32:54,166 --> 01:32:56,040
It was his son.

536
01:32:58,166 --> 01:33:02,499
But nobody better than
Jocasta, your wife, knows it.

537
01:33:04,333 --> 01:33:08,040
- Did she give you the baby?
- Yes, she gave him to me.

538
01:33:08,750 --> 01:33:10,207
With what orders?

539
01:33:10,916 --> 01:33:12,457
To kill him.

540
01:33:12,583 --> 01:33:14,415
Why this atrocity?

541
01:33:15,916 --> 01:33:18,665
Because she feared bad prophecies.

542
01:33:19,541 --> 01:33:20,707
Which ones?

543
01:33:20,833 --> 01:33:23,499
That he would kill his parents.

544
01:33:24,500 --> 01:33:27,040
Why did you allow him to be saved?

545
01:33:29,875 --> 01:33:31,874
Out of pity.

546
01:34:52,833 --> 01:34:55,290
All is clear now, and wanted,

547
01:34:55,416 --> 01:34:57,582
not imposed by destiny.

548
01:36:08,583 --> 01:36:12,915
Thus I will no longer see the
evil I have suffered and committed.

549
01:36:13,041 --> 01:36:16,707
In the dark I will not see
what should not be seen.

550
01:36:17,541 --> 01:36:21,915
I will not recognise those
I wanted to recognise.

551
01:36:23,250 --> 01:36:26,749
I should have also severed my ears

552
01:36:26,875 --> 01:36:30,957
to seal myself up in my unhappy body.

553
01:36:31,083 --> 01:36:34,582
To see and hear nothing ever again.

554
01:36:36,083 --> 01:36:39,165
It's sweet to have the mind rid of evil.

555
01:36:39,291 --> 01:36:41,749
Quick, send me away.

556
01:36:41,875 --> 01:36:44,790
Send this terrible man far away.

557
01:36:44,916 --> 01:36:47,540
Impure things must be kept silent.

558
01:36:47,666 --> 01:36:51,915
Not spoken of, not witnessed. Silent!

559
01:36:52,041 --> 01:36:55,665
Hide me, take me outside
this land of ours!

560
01:36:55,791 --> 01:37:00,415
Take me to someplace where
I cannot be seen anymore.

561
01:40:03,375 --> 01:40:04,749
Angelo.

562
01:40:09,375 --> 01:41:41,665
Angelo. Angelo!

563
01:43:14,541 --> 01:43:16,082
Where are we?

564
01:43:16,666 --> 01:43:19,165
In a place with many trees in a row

565
01:43:19,291 --> 01:43:23,124
and many little streams
and a green, green field.

566
01:43:25,083 --> 01:43:27,665
May the light that I
couldn't see anymore,

567
01:43:27,791 --> 01:43:30,290
and which once was mine,

568
01:43:30,416 --> 01:43:32,707
illuminate me now for the last time.

569
01:43:35,875 --> 01:43:37,582
I have arrived.

570
01:43:39,375 --> 01:43:41,915
Life ends where it begins.
