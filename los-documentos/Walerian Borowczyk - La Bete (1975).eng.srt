1
00:00:41,709 --> 00:00:46,047
THE BEAST

2
00:01:37,056 --> 00:01:41,352
THE BEAST

3
00:01:47,441 --> 00:01:56,534
Troubled dreams are in fact
a passing moment of madness.

4
00:04:02,326 --> 00:04:06,538
Your misogamy is beyond a joke,
my dear Rammondelo.

5
00:04:06,664 --> 00:04:11,961
Not at all. I simply want a long life
for my nephew.

6
00:04:12,461 --> 00:04:17,633
You yourself were married
and you're still very much alive.

7
00:04:17,758 --> 00:04:20,386
Yes, thank God.

8
00:04:20,511 --> 00:04:24,598
My marriage to the Duchess Florence
was extremely short lived.

9
00:04:26,225 --> 00:04:28,269
Barely two months.

10
00:04:30,521 --> 00:04:33,816
Mathurin will not last that long,
he will die immediately,

11
00:04:33,941 --> 00:04:36,235
and the boy wants to live.

12
00:04:41,573 --> 00:04:46,704
If not for his father or his uncle,
at least for his horses.

13
00:04:46,829 --> 00:04:48,664
Enough!

14
00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:53,419
Your morbid hatred of womanhood
has nothing to do with my son's shyness.

15
00:04:53,544 --> 00:04:58,173
Let me carry out my plans.

16
00:05:01,677 --> 00:05:03,762
Lucy Broadhurst will marry Mathurin.

17
00:05:16,233 --> 00:05:19,320
Listen to what
Mrs. Virginia Broadhurst wrote,

18
00:05:19,445 --> 00:05:22,031
and what my son replied.

19
00:05:27,119 --> 00:05:29,955
"My niece Lucy is anxious
to meet Mathurin,"

20
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:35,627
"and this wish is not prompted by
reason only, although the two fortunes..."

21
00:05:35,753 --> 00:05:37,671
Love by correspondence!

22
00:05:37,796 --> 00:05:41,759
Perhaps.
History tells us of many similar cases.

23
00:05:43,969 --> 00:05:46,513
Mathurin answered yes.

24
00:05:46,638 --> 00:05:48,599
What? Answered?

25
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:51,894
He writes letters now?

26
00:05:52,019 --> 00:05:54,146
Mathurin the scribbler!

27
00:05:55,314 --> 00:05:57,274
With his left hand?

28
00:05:57,399 --> 00:05:59,360
Don't make fun of the poor boy.

29
00:05:59,485 --> 00:06:05,324
You don't want to admit
that Mathurin has become an adult.

30
00:06:05,449 --> 00:06:11,497
You don't realise that for some time
he has been lying to you.

31
00:06:11,622 --> 00:06:13,916
He was writing to Lucy.

32
00:06:15,167 --> 00:06:18,962
He realised
that you wanted to ruin this house,

33
00:06:19,088 --> 00:06:23,842
that your warnings betray your desire
to destroy our family.

34
00:06:25,052 --> 00:06:28,889
- My family.
- It's you who are preparing his death.

35
00:06:29,014 --> 00:06:31,850
There will be no execution.

36
00:06:31,975 --> 00:06:33,560
You've not read everything.

37
00:06:38,107 --> 00:06:39,858
Thank you.

38
00:06:39,983 --> 00:06:42,611
Lucy's father wrote in his will,

39
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:45,739
"I leave my daughter,
my only heir, quite free,"

40
00:06:45,864 --> 00:06:49,368
"but these conditions
must be respected in all events:"

41
00:06:49,493 --> 00:06:53,956
"Firstly, she will marry Mathurin,
only son of the Earl de l'Esperance."

42
00:06:54,081 --> 00:07:00,629
"Secondly, the marriage will be blessed
personally by Cardinal Joseph de Balo,"

43
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:04,216
"brother of Duke Rammondelo de Balo."

44
00:07:04,341 --> 00:07:07,803
I hope the Cardinal
will not refuse his brother

45
00:07:07,928 --> 00:07:10,681
to say his grand-nephew's nuptial mass.

46
00:07:12,057 --> 00:07:14,560
- Try asking him.
- Oh, no!

47
00:07:14,685 --> 00:07:21,275
Since my son's birth
I haven't spoken to your Cardinal.

48
00:07:23,735 --> 00:07:26,238
It's you who must ask him now.

49
00:07:27,239 --> 00:07:28,574
No!

50
00:07:28,699 --> 00:07:31,827
Yes you will, Uncle.

51
00:07:31,952 --> 00:07:38,292
If not, the secret you've hidden
for 45 years will be revealed.

52
00:07:41,587 --> 00:07:46,133
You poisoned your wife,
Duchess Florence de Balo.

53
00:07:48,427 --> 00:07:50,387
You're joking!

54
00:07:51,263 --> 00:07:52,890
I have proof.

55
00:07:53,015 --> 00:07:55,225
Show me.

56
00:08:07,905 --> 00:08:10,866
You recognise this bottle?

57
00:08:11,867 --> 00:08:14,661
Your fingerprints are still on it.

58
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:24,713
All right, I'll call Joseph.
But you're making a mistake.

59
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:28,133
- I'm never wrong.
- Your son was never baptised.

60
00:08:28,258 --> 00:08:31,053
Joseph will see the priest.

61
00:08:31,178 --> 00:08:33,096
He's coming in half an hour.

62
00:08:33,764 --> 00:08:37,059
I couldn't have him baptised
when he was small.

63
00:08:38,352 --> 00:08:39,770
Now it can be done!

64
00:08:39,895 --> 00:08:42,981
But nothing will change
the nature of your son!

65
00:09:09,508 --> 00:09:12,261
- Mathurin?
- No, my Lord.

66
00:09:12,386 --> 00:09:14,096
He wants to be alone.

67
00:09:14,221 --> 00:09:16,807
- Call him now!
- Very well, my Lord.

68
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:24,064
...four hours to get his agreement.

69
00:09:24,189 --> 00:09:27,109
Impossible,
he's not in the Vatican, but in Africa.

70
00:09:27,234 --> 00:09:31,071
Don't complicate things.
I won't hesitate to call the police.

71
00:09:34,825 --> 00:09:36,702
It's impossible.

72
00:09:39,037 --> 00:09:40,247
Don't complicate things.

73
00:09:40,372 --> 00:09:43,500
Quiet, Father,
you're upsetting my horses.

74
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:46,336
- Mathurin?
- Yes, it's me, Mathurin.

75
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,047
The priest will be here soon.

76
00:10:20,329 --> 00:10:21,705
Come in!

77
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,419
Good morning, gentlemen.

78
00:10:27,544 --> 00:10:29,504
What's happened?

79
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:34,301
Loosen his collar.

80
00:10:34,426 --> 00:10:39,431
And open this window.
Theodore, Modeste, please.

81
00:10:51,943 --> 00:10:56,073
Ifany, go with the Duke.
Some sleep will do him good.

82
00:11:07,334 --> 00:11:12,172
Father, don't hurt Mathurin, I beg you.

83
00:11:12,297 --> 00:11:16,343
But we are here to bring joy, your Grace.

84
00:11:21,515 --> 00:11:24,017
My uncle is needlessly excited.

85
00:11:26,978 --> 00:11:28,939
- Excuse me.
- Thank you.

86
00:11:31,692 --> 00:11:35,487
Spring is the cause of our excitement.

87
00:11:39,741 --> 00:11:46,665
We, frail humans, we are like animals,
we suffer the laws of nature.

88
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:48,875
Alas!

89
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,088
Happily, we have this intelligence,

90
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:58,677
this heavenly gift,
which enables us to fight our instincts.

91
00:11:58,802 --> 00:12:02,013
- Good morning, Father.
- Good morning, Sir.

92
00:12:06,351 --> 00:12:08,687
Wash your hands and wait for us.

93
00:12:22,325 --> 00:12:26,663
- Coffee? Brandy?
- No, a drop of white wine. Theodore...

94
00:12:27,414 --> 00:12:32,544
Oh, forgive me, my Lord,
I haven't introduced them.

95
00:12:34,504 --> 00:12:37,883
Theodore, an excellent singer,

96
00:12:38,008 --> 00:12:40,802
and Modeste, a promising organist.

97
00:12:40,927 --> 00:12:45,682
- Beautiful boys! You prefer sweets?
- Thank you, my Lord.

98
00:12:45,807 --> 00:12:47,225
Excuse me.

99
00:12:52,731 --> 00:12:54,900
No, thank you, I have a toothache.

100
00:12:58,653 --> 00:12:59,654
Ifany!

101
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:06,328
Give the Father some port.

102
00:13:29,643 --> 00:13:31,228
Ifany!

103
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:42,614
Pick up that snail.

104
00:13:43,824 --> 00:13:45,867
Horrid little beast!

105
00:13:45,992 --> 00:13:47,661
Throw it away.

106
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:56,378
- Then come back.
- Yes, Sir.

107
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:27,659
A real dump, this place!

108
00:14:27,784 --> 00:14:30,495
- Not happy?
- Yes, I'm very happy.

109
00:15:17,325 --> 00:15:18,394
It's more than 10 miles.

110
00:15:18,685 --> 00:15:20,277
How many kilometers?

111
00:15:20,565 --> 00:15:22,601
Sixteen kilometers.

112
00:15:28,205 --> 00:15:30,082
Wonderful France...

113
00:15:31,125 --> 00:15:34,561
Beautiful France, and always so desirable.

114
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:05,340
Rome? The Vatican?

115
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:09,928
Cardinal Joseph de Balo's secretariat?

116
00:16:10,053 --> 00:16:11,429
Yes, that's right.

117
00:16:11,554 --> 00:16:15,600
His Excellency the Cardinal,
if you please.

118
00:16:15,725 --> 00:16:19,646
This is Roberto Capia,
the Cardinal's secretary.

119
00:16:19,771 --> 00:16:25,485
His Excellency the Cardinal has not yet
returned from his mission in Africa.

120
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:27,237
When will he be back?

121
00:16:27,362 --> 00:16:31,408
We expect him at any moment.
Who is speaking?

122
00:16:31,533 --> 00:16:35,161
The Duke de Balo, the Cardinal's brother.

123
00:17:00,687 --> 00:17:04,149
His Lordship and Mr. Mathurin
are in the bathroom.

124
00:17:04,274 --> 00:17:06,484
Oh. Wait.

125
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:20,999
- Take this to his Lordship.
- Yes, your Grace.

126
00:17:48,651 --> 00:17:50,487
I baptise you...

127
00:18:32,485 --> 00:18:34,441
This is a beautiful park for the French.

128
00:18:35,528 --> 00:18:39,203
Today in France,
they are sold for building houses in.

129
00:18:39,654 --> 00:18:41,485
It should be in the corner of the park

130
00:18:42,113 --> 00:18:44,308
that Mathurin experiences his romantic disorder.

131
00:18:44,947 --> 00:18:46,938
I understand, that that lake

132
00:18:47,323 --> 00:18:51,635
harbours thousands of mosquitos all year round.

133
00:18:52,824 --> 00:18:54,018
Aunt Virginia,

134
00:18:54,366 --> 00:18:57,164
you speak as if you don't want
Mathurin for my husband.

135
00:18:57,575 --> 00:18:59,167
I didn't say that.

136
00:19:03,661 --> 00:19:05,891
Shit! Trees blocking the road.

137
00:19:27,251 --> 00:19:30,687
Lucy! Come back! It's a jungle!

138
00:19:31,127 --> 00:19:32,685
I am coming aunt Virginia.

139
00:20:54,484 --> 00:20:55,678
Go back!

140
00:20:57,860 --> 00:20:59,737
Look, aunt Virginia!

141
00:21:01,736 --> 00:21:03,613
This is a sad picture.

142
00:21:04,445 --> 00:21:05,560
Sad?

143
00:21:06,779 --> 00:21:10,010
Nature is mysterious, but never sad.

144
00:21:10,655 --> 00:21:12,327
I'll have the column restored.

145
00:21:12,697 --> 00:21:14,608
And painted white.

146
00:21:17,407 --> 00:21:18,123
There is the chateau !?

147
00:21:52,209 --> 00:21:54,120
Don't do that.

148
00:21:54,668 --> 00:21:56,465
Aunt Virginia!

149
00:21:58,586 --> 00:22:01,464
Leave me alone! I am no child anymore!

150
00:22:02,170 --> 00:22:03,603
Turn down.

151
00:22:04,212 --> 00:22:06,442
Turn around and go back to the park!

152
00:22:08,130 --> 00:22:11,839
Later you can do what you like.

153
00:22:12,798 --> 00:22:14,231
But not now...

154
00:22:14,882 --> 00:22:16,440
and not when I'm with you.

155
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:18,596
I'm sorry, aunt Virginia.

156
00:22:20,550 --> 00:22:23,269
This is the last time, you'll lose your way.

157
00:22:23,676 --> 00:22:26,713
I'm sorry ma'am.
But I don't know France that well.

158
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:04,550
Come in, ladies.

159
00:23:15,353 --> 00:23:16,896
Thank you, miss.

160
00:23:19,774 --> 00:23:21,526
Come in.

161
00:23:27,073 --> 00:23:29,200
Come in, ladies!

162
00:23:32,662 --> 00:23:35,415
I am the Duke de Balo.

163
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:36,874
Virginia Broadhurst.

164
00:23:36,999 --> 00:23:38,584
Lucy Broadhurst.

165
00:23:38,709 --> 00:23:41,504
- Maybe you are the Cardinal's brother?
- That's right.

166
00:23:41,629 --> 00:23:46,217
But it is not I
who is the master of the house here.

167
00:23:46,342 --> 00:23:48,469
Is Mr. de l'Esperance away?

168
00:23:48,594 --> 00:23:52,348
No, not at all.
He's washing his son.

169
00:23:52,473 --> 00:23:54,809
He's "washing" Mathurin?

170
00:23:54,934 --> 00:24:00,273
I assure you they are in the bathroom.
They will be out very shortly.

171
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:05,528
Would you rather wait in your rooms?
They are ready for you.

172
00:24:05,653 --> 00:24:09,740
We'll wait for Mr. de l'Esperance
and his son here.

173
00:24:09,866 --> 00:24:14,245
Well then, sit down
and I'll keep you company.

174
00:24:32,847 --> 00:24:37,768
Does his Excellency Cardinal de Balo
know about the will?

175
00:24:37,894 --> 00:24:41,939
Madame, for any queries about the will,

176
00:24:42,064 --> 00:24:47,236
and the marriage of your niece,
Lucy Broadhurst, here beside us,

177
00:24:47,361 --> 00:24:50,448
with Mathurin, my nephew's son,

178
00:24:51,324 --> 00:24:54,410
please speak to his father.

179
00:24:56,037 --> 00:24:58,748
Is it true ghosts haunt this house?

180
00:24:59,749 --> 00:25:02,627
Who... Who said that?

181
00:25:02,752 --> 00:25:07,798
Our cook, a Frenchwoman,
the old Juliette.

182
00:25:08,716 --> 00:25:12,094
I've never seen a single ghost here.

183
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:15,181
But the Countess
Romilda de l'Esperance

184
00:25:15,306 --> 00:25:20,394
did describe ghosts in her book,
two hundred years ago.

185
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:24,941
That's her! Romilda de l'Esperance.

186
00:25:25,066 --> 00:25:30,613
She never wrote anything,
she only left... a drawing in her herbal.

187
00:25:31,447 --> 00:25:32,782
Herbal?

188
00:25:33,533 --> 00:25:36,744
Here it is! The famous album.

189
00:25:43,417 --> 00:25:49,257
Be careful turning the pages, my child.
The dead leaves are very fragile.

190
00:25:49,382 --> 00:25:50,633
Dead leaves?

191
00:25:50,758 --> 00:25:55,805
Yes, Romilda's little hands
stuck in these leaves

192
00:25:55,930 --> 00:26:00,643
gathered in the park two centuries ago.

193
00:26:00,768 --> 00:26:06,107
Look at page 115B very carefully.

194
00:26:06,232 --> 00:26:08,651
No, that's 115A.

195
00:26:10,361 --> 00:26:12,154
115B.

196
00:26:15,116 --> 00:26:21,956
"The scale... 6,600 yards..."

197
00:26:22,081 --> 00:26:25,334
It's easier with a magnifying glass.

198
00:26:27,461 --> 00:26:31,924
"I met him and overcame him..."

199
00:26:33,342 --> 00:26:36,137
"Romilda de l'Esperance."

200
00:26:44,437 --> 00:26:47,607
It's Romilda's corset.

201
00:26:47,732 --> 00:26:50,526
It was found at the bottom of a pond.

202
00:26:50,651 --> 00:26:55,615
Traces of claw marks...
Can you see them, ladies?

203
00:26:56,005 --> 00:26:57,800
Yes, indeed.

204
00:26:57,867 --> 00:26:59,410
Ifany!

205
00:27:05,333 --> 00:27:06,959
Goodbye, ladies!

206
00:27:20,965 --> 00:27:24,674
So hilarious, Rammondelo of Balo

207
00:27:26,221 --> 00:27:30,260
The Marques of  L'Esperance is washing his son.

208
00:27:31,519 --> 00:27:33,635
The man, you are going to marry, tomorrow.

209
00:27:34,690 --> 00:27:38,205
Very touching, that a father should
love his son that much.

210
00:27:38,862 --> 00:27:41,535
We ought to clean ourselves too, aunt Virginia.

211
00:27:41,949 --> 00:27:42,779
We?

212
00:27:43,117 --> 00:27:44,516
Mathurin and I.

213
00:27:44,869 --> 00:27:47,702
How dare you tell this to your aunt?

214
00:27:48,123 --> 00:27:49,841
I'm sorry, aunt Virginia.

215
00:27:54,090 --> 00:27:56,550
What beautiful handwriting!

216
00:27:57,259 --> 00:27:58,408
Look aunt Virginia.

217
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:02,306
An autograph from...

218
00:28:22,284 --> 00:28:23,994
Good morning, ladies.

219
00:28:38,092 --> 00:28:41,554
Silly stories, don't believe a word.

220
00:28:42,096 --> 00:28:45,057
"Since time immemorial, every 200 years,"

221
00:28:45,182 --> 00:28:48,894
"the same day, same time,
when Mercury moves away from the sun,"

222
00:28:49,019 --> 00:28:53,065
"a beast arrives at our house..."
blah, blah, blah...

223
00:28:57,653 --> 00:28:59,071
Pierre de l'Esperance.

224
00:29:00,322 --> 00:29:02,199
Virginia Broadhurst.

225
00:29:03,576 --> 00:29:05,578
Lucy Broadhurst.

226
00:29:06,328 --> 00:29:09,582
The jewel of our families and our pride.

227
00:29:09,707 --> 00:29:12,626
I am happy to welcome you to my house.

228
00:29:12,752 --> 00:29:16,505
Please forgive the lack of comfort.

229
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:18,132
My niece loves the country.

230
00:29:18,257 --> 00:29:22,219
I like forests and animals.

231
00:29:22,344 --> 00:29:25,973
You'll find a brotherly soul here.

232
00:29:26,098 --> 00:29:31,812
I'm sure the date will be memorable
in the lives of our children.

233
00:29:35,608 --> 00:29:36,734
Ifany!

234
00:29:54,043 --> 00:29:55,878
Ifany!

235
00:30:21,237 --> 00:30:22,988
My boot...

236
00:30:49,473 --> 00:30:50,724
Oh, Ifany...

237
00:30:55,104 --> 00:30:58,482
I'll get my son, he's dressing.

238
00:30:58,607 --> 00:31:00,693
Oh, the men of today!

239
00:31:00,818 --> 00:31:02,528
I suggest...

240
00:31:05,281 --> 00:31:08,450
The Father of our parish...

241
00:31:09,994 --> 00:31:14,206
I suggest you go to your rooms
and rest for a while.

242
00:31:14,331 --> 00:31:16,208
Your luggage will be brought up.

243
00:31:27,261 --> 00:31:31,056
"The Cardinal's secretary hung up
when I said my name."

244
00:31:32,516 --> 00:31:34,727
- Take up the ladies' luggage.
- Yes, my Lord.

245
00:31:34,852 --> 00:31:35,853
Thank you.

246
00:31:36,770 --> 00:31:40,733
Cardinal Joseph de Balo
will be arriving soon?

247
00:31:40,858 --> 00:31:42,693
We expect him any moment.

248
00:31:42,818 --> 00:31:44,778
I spoke to him again this morning.

249
00:31:44,904 --> 00:31:48,657
He said what a joy it would be
to say the nuptial mass

250
00:31:48,782 --> 00:31:51,035
and bless our children.

251
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:53,078
This way, please.

252
00:32:02,254 --> 00:32:04,100
I've come to help with the bags.

253
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:05,280
What?

254
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:06,380
Luggage.

255
00:32:07,225 --> 00:32:09,295
This luxury, Dadio...

256
00:32:10,658 --> 00:32:13,092
one Rolls Royce and a black chaffeur.

257
00:32:13,471 --> 00:32:16,383
And you? One chateau and a black slave.

258
00:32:17,359 --> 00:32:19,031
No slaves here.

259
00:32:19,510 --> 00:32:21,785
I am cheap, it's true, but I am no slave.

260
00:32:22,158 --> 00:32:23,955
You work here for nothing, I'm sure.

261
00:32:24,309 --> 00:32:27,062
As of tomorrow, you are going to be rich.

262
00:32:28,321 --> 00:32:32,633
There are other pleasures
beyond money in this world, Dadio.

263
00:34:12,225 --> 00:34:16,013
"I appoint my sister in law,
Virginia Broadhurst,"

264
00:34:16,305 --> 00:34:19,536
"executrix of my will."

265
00:34:19,945 --> 00:34:21,663
Philip Andrew.

266
00:34:50,089 --> 00:34:52,382
"Sermons Chosen
from the Mysteries of the True Religion."

267
00:35:22,538 --> 00:35:25,415
"The Maid of Orleans"

268
00:35:25,541 --> 00:35:30,129
"mock-heroic poem in 18 verses"

269
00:35:33,132 --> 00:35:34,258
"by Voltaire."

270
00:37:04,765 --> 00:37:06,808
She's a serious girl,

271
00:37:07,893 --> 00:37:09,436
well-brought up,

272
00:37:12,231 --> 00:37:13,899
very pious, and...

273
00:37:17,486 --> 00:37:19,404
of a rare beauty.

274
00:37:20,364 --> 00:37:22,407
I'm afraid, Father.

275
00:37:22,532 --> 00:37:24,201
But of what?

276
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:29,164
You're baptised now, like everyone else.

277
00:37:32,501 --> 00:37:34,378
The original sin has been washed away.

278
00:37:34,503 --> 00:37:39,299
I don't know anymore.
When she was far away, I felt brave.

279
00:37:39,424 --> 00:37:42,135
Now I'm losing my memory.

280
00:37:43,136 --> 00:37:45,639
I've forgotten everything you taught me.

281
00:37:46,390 --> 00:37:48,600
All your advice seems useless.

282
00:37:49,601 --> 00:37:53,146
You can't change me,
I'll always be Mathurin, Papa.

283
00:37:53,272 --> 00:37:54,356
I'm ugly.

284
00:37:54,481 --> 00:37:58,110
What are you talking about?
Look...

285
00:37:59,152 --> 00:38:00,988
You look like me.

286
00:38:01,113 --> 00:38:04,741
Look! You are handsome.

287
00:38:05,325 --> 00:38:08,287
No, I'm afraid, I'm afraid!

288
00:38:12,833 --> 00:38:17,838
Your uncle, the Cardinal de Balo,
will celebrate the mass,

289
00:38:17,963 --> 00:38:20,590
and you will feel like a newborn baby.

290
00:38:20,716 --> 00:38:23,593
You'll see. Don't cry.

291
00:38:23,719 --> 00:38:26,471
Lucy is resting in her room,
her aunt too.

292
00:38:26,596 --> 00:38:30,225
You, wait for them with the priest
in the drawing room.

293
00:38:30,350 --> 00:38:36,273
I'm with you,
Uncle Rammondelo too, everyone...

294
00:38:59,046 --> 00:39:01,048
You're lying, Rammondelo...

295
00:39:01,173 --> 00:39:05,302
No, it's the truth,
they won't speak to pagans.

296
00:39:05,427 --> 00:39:09,890
You must tell Joseph of this capital event,
Mathurin's baptism.

297
00:39:10,015 --> 00:39:13,769
They hang up as soon as I say my name,

298
00:39:13,894 --> 00:39:16,813
as if I was Mathurin's father.

299
00:39:16,938 --> 00:39:19,274
Your brother thinks you're an angel.

300
00:39:19,399 --> 00:39:24,988
It'll be worse when he learns
the truth about the Duchess.

301
00:39:25,113 --> 00:39:28,200
Pierre, think a moment,
it's not too late.

302
00:39:28,325 --> 00:39:32,204
You're losing your son for a sum of gold.

303
00:39:32,329 --> 00:39:33,830
He's innocent.

304
00:39:33,955 --> 00:39:35,749
The house is crumbling,

305
00:39:35,874 --> 00:39:38,210
the ground is barren.

306
00:39:38,335 --> 00:39:41,088
It's the beginning of the end.

307
00:39:41,213 --> 00:39:44,049
Fate has sent Lucy to save us.

308
00:39:44,966 --> 00:39:49,304
If you oppose this,
you'll be responsible for the disaster,

309
00:39:51,306 --> 00:39:53,100
and you'll be punished.

310
00:39:54,976 --> 00:39:58,397
Hello! Hello!

311
00:39:58,522 --> 00:40:01,650
This is the Cardinal de Balo's secretariat.

312
00:40:01,775 --> 00:40:08,156
Rammondelo de Balo,
the Cardinal's brother.

313
00:40:09,366 --> 00:40:11,701
You see, I wasn't lying.

314
00:40:18,917 --> 00:40:20,335
Hello, telegrams.

315
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:24,548
Hello, this is 228-2845.

316
00:40:24,673 --> 00:40:26,425
- A telegram, please.
- Who to?

317
00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:32,889
To Cardinal Joseph de Balo.

318
00:40:33,974 --> 00:40:35,100
Vatican.

319
00:40:35,225 --> 00:40:37,853
- The text?
- The text...

320
00:40:39,229 --> 00:40:44,609
"Mathurin baptised today. Stop."

321
00:40:44,734 --> 00:40:48,989
"Great joy to invite you"

322
00:40:49,114 --> 00:40:53,118
"to be with us for this happy event."

323
00:40:54,202 --> 00:40:59,040
Signed Rammondelo de Balo.

324
00:41:52,135 --> 00:41:55,805
Who's this?
Some very grown-up people.

325
00:41:55,931 --> 00:41:57,432
I borrowed them from a friend.

326
00:41:57,557 --> 00:41:58,850
Ifany!

327
00:41:59,893 --> 00:42:02,312
Show Clarisse the dresses.

328
00:42:02,437 --> 00:42:06,024
- Where did you put them?
- Yes, they're up there.

329
00:42:07,317 --> 00:42:12,197
Father, may I go out for a moment?
I must get a dress for the mass.

330
00:42:12,322 --> 00:42:15,492
- Yes, but the children first.
- Yes, of course.

331
00:42:36,888 --> 00:42:38,598
Please, Father...

332
00:42:38,723 --> 00:42:41,643
leave the ladies in peace, they're resting.

333
00:42:41,768 --> 00:42:45,397
Forgive us, my Lord.

334
00:42:45,522 --> 00:42:49,192
Whenever Modeste sees a keyboard,
he can't help touching it.

335
00:42:49,317 --> 00:42:51,194
I understand, it's stronger than him.

336
00:42:51,319 --> 00:42:54,614
That's it. You know... music...

337
00:42:54,739 --> 00:42:56,283
Father...

338
00:42:59,452 --> 00:43:03,456
Cardinal de Balo is coming any minute.

339
00:43:04,708 --> 00:43:09,629
I need you and your testimony.

340
00:43:09,754 --> 00:43:14,467
Mathurin's baptism followed church rules.

341
00:43:14,593 --> 00:43:18,388
You alone can prove it?
Is that right?

342
00:43:18,513 --> 00:43:20,890
Yes, indeed, yes...

343
00:43:21,016 --> 00:43:25,645
Our friendly relations with the parish

344
00:43:25,770 --> 00:43:28,565
go back a long time,

345
00:43:30,066 --> 00:43:31,401
don't they?

346
00:43:31,526 --> 00:43:35,614
Yes, we've never been enemies.

347
00:43:35,739 --> 00:43:38,825
I was always convinced
that Mr. Mathurin

348
00:43:38,950 --> 00:43:40,619
would, one day, become a Christian.

349
00:43:40,744 --> 00:43:43,121
And a Christian donator.

350
00:43:43,997 --> 00:43:47,917
Mathurin, what will be your first act
after the wedding?

351
00:43:48,043 --> 00:43:49,544
Tell the Father.

352
00:43:49,669 --> 00:43:52,464
I will repair the church roof
and order a bell

353
00:43:52,589 --> 00:43:54,716
whose tone will be chosen by Lucy.

354
00:43:54,841 --> 00:43:57,385
It will be like the Vatican's bells.

355
00:43:57,510 --> 00:43:59,095
God will reward you.

356
00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:01,890
Lucy Broadhurst
is known for her kindness,

357
00:44:02,015 --> 00:44:05,101
and her piety is unequalled.

358
00:44:12,233 --> 00:44:15,362
- Smoking again?
- Yes.

359
00:44:38,051 --> 00:44:39,594
Ifany!

360
00:44:41,721 --> 00:44:43,431
Ifany!

361
00:45:51,666 --> 00:45:56,337
- Stéphane's afraid, he's trembling.
- I wasn't afraid! Not true!

362
00:45:56,463 --> 00:45:59,466
You smell so good,
and your clothes too...

363
00:46:01,092 --> 00:46:04,637
"Your Mathurin..."

364
00:46:31,039 --> 00:46:34,209
- The grey room.
- Yes, my Lord.

365
00:46:35,794 --> 00:46:38,463
- No telephone call?
- No.

366
00:46:38,588 --> 00:46:43,384
Pierre, if there's a meal, let me come.

367
00:46:43,510 --> 00:46:46,262
I want to be near him
maybe for the last time.

368
00:46:46,387 --> 00:46:49,057
There will be no meal
until the Cardinal comes.

369
00:46:49,182 --> 00:46:53,478
If you're hungry you'll eat here.
You will not leave the telephone.

370
00:46:53,603 --> 00:46:55,688
If Rome calls,

371
00:46:56,856 --> 00:47:00,568
knock on the door with this stick.

372
00:48:44,881 --> 00:48:46,674
Mathurin...

373
00:48:55,141 --> 00:48:57,185
"Dear Lucy..."

374
00:48:57,810 --> 00:49:01,564
"Allow me to disturb your rest."

375
00:49:02,774 --> 00:49:06,945
"I would be happy
if you could come down"

376
00:49:07,487 --> 00:49:13,242
"and we could meet
with your aunt and my father."

377
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:19,374
"You cannot imagine the joy I feel"

378
00:49:19,499 --> 00:49:22,251
"at the thought
of what is about to happen."

379
00:49:23,628 --> 00:49:25,505
"My heart is beating."

380
00:49:25,630 --> 00:49:27,715
"Your Mathurin."

381
00:49:38,142 --> 00:49:42,313
- Six people today.
- My Lord, I've already set six places.

382
00:49:44,983 --> 00:49:48,528
Well, tidy up here!
Make some space!

383
00:49:52,699 --> 00:49:55,368
The Cardinal appreciates good food.

384
00:49:56,452 --> 00:49:59,831
As a child, it was his favourite place.

385
00:50:01,332 --> 00:50:05,920
It is a pity that his duties
leave him so little time for his family.

386
00:50:06,045 --> 00:50:09,549
But aunt, a vocation is everything.

387
00:50:09,674 --> 00:50:13,469
His Excellency
certainly has more important duties

388
00:50:13,594 --> 00:50:14,929
than blessing a marriage.

389
00:50:15,054 --> 00:50:16,514
There is no doubt in my mind.

390
00:50:16,639 --> 00:50:20,893
Yesterday,
the Cardinal had to make a decision.

391
00:50:21,019 --> 00:50:23,813
He certainly...
Just a little.

392
00:50:23,938 --> 00:50:25,982
...made the right one.

393
00:50:26,107 --> 00:50:28,651
From his point of view?

394
00:50:28,776 --> 00:50:31,029
From... his point of view, yes.

395
00:50:31,154 --> 00:50:35,116
Do you think the Cardinal's absence

396
00:50:36,367 --> 00:50:40,621
could be due to personal reasons?

397
00:50:41,622 --> 00:50:45,793
A feeling of hostility towards us
or towards you?

398
00:50:45,918 --> 00:50:49,672
I don't think so.
We've always been on good terms,

399
00:50:49,797 --> 00:50:53,760
as we are with the church here.

400
00:50:53,885 --> 00:50:56,345
Father can confirm this.

401
00:50:56,471 --> 00:50:59,390
The promise of a donation

402
00:50:59,515 --> 00:51:04,604
by Mr. Mathurin and Miss. Lucy
to our church assures us of this.

403
00:51:04,705 --> 00:51:06,184
What donation?

404
00:51:06,397 --> 00:51:10,026
We agreed with Mathurin by a letter

405
00:51:10,151 --> 00:51:13,446
to give the village church a bronze bell.

406
00:51:13,571 --> 00:51:18,326
Bronze, the symbol of the everlasting.

407
00:51:18,451 --> 00:51:21,996
Its tone will be chosen by Lucy.

408
00:51:22,121 --> 00:51:23,539
Tone?

409
00:51:23,664 --> 00:51:26,334
The tone will be like a Roman bell.

410
00:51:27,752 --> 00:51:32,215
If I'm not mistaken,
the will stipulates no deadline

411
00:51:32,340 --> 00:51:35,134
for the date of the marriage.

412
00:51:53,185 --> 00:51:54,857
"...as soon as possible,"

413
00:51:55,217 --> 00:51:58,532
"but no later than 6 months after my death."

414
00:51:58,616 --> 00:52:03,079
It is the first of May,
we have another forty-eight hours.

415
00:52:03,204 --> 00:52:04,247
May I see it?

416
00:52:05,957 --> 00:52:07,708
Just a moment.

417
00:52:14,169 --> 00:52:17,286
"...the nephew of Rammondelo of Balo,"

418
00:52:17,694 --> 00:52:20,447
"a pleasant and healthy young man,"

419
00:52:20,846 --> 00:52:23,679
"with no unsavoury habits."

420
00:52:23,808 --> 00:52:27,228
It's quite true he smoked,

421
00:52:27,353 --> 00:52:30,648
but he soon learned
that tobacco was a poison.

422
00:52:30,773 --> 00:52:34,443
He fell from his horse
and broke his hand.

423
00:52:34,569 --> 00:52:37,822
It's true that I broke my hand
and that I smoked a great deal.

424
00:52:37,947 --> 00:52:40,032
Then I stopped.

425
00:52:40,158 --> 00:52:42,910
At first my hands trembled,
and my whole body.

426
00:52:43,035 --> 00:52:48,332
But I met a doctor, a vet to be precise,
who visits our horses.

427
00:52:48,457 --> 00:52:52,378
He gave me a wonderful cure.

428
00:52:52,503 --> 00:52:55,298
I chew... I chew,

429
00:52:55,423 --> 00:52:58,301
I don't smoke anymore.
I chew all day like a squirrel.

430
00:52:58,426 --> 00:53:01,721
Be quiet, Mathurin!
You'll wake your uncle.

431
00:53:04,765 --> 00:53:08,201
I fear that your father
may have made a mistake.

432
00:53:09,609 --> 00:53:13,045
Why do you always have such
a tragic way to see things?

433
00:53:13,493 --> 00:53:17,486
You must understand that champagne
does not change the cosmos!

434
00:53:18,154 --> 00:53:19,530
Ifany!

435
00:53:30,499 --> 00:53:32,543
Look after Mrs. Broadhurst.

436
00:53:46,474 --> 00:53:48,851
The case, quickly!

437
00:53:57,735 --> 00:54:01,405
No, thank you,
I've got some pills in my room.

438
00:54:01,530 --> 00:54:06,285
My aunt is so nervous.
We should take her to her room.

439
00:54:07,697 --> 00:54:09,050
And you too Lucy...

440
00:54:09,410 --> 00:54:11,878
you too must go and have a rest.

441
00:54:12,291 --> 00:54:13,643
Of course, aunt Virginia.

442
00:54:13,709 --> 00:54:17,713
Modeste, light the way
for the ladies on the stairs.

443
00:54:53,165 --> 00:54:54,709
Hello.

444
00:54:57,378 --> 00:55:01,507
- Anyone there?
- His Lordship will be down soon.

445
00:55:01,632 --> 00:55:05,428
What beautiful children of honour!

446
00:55:06,012 --> 00:55:08,472
- What is your name?
- Stéphane.

447
00:55:08,597 --> 00:55:10,016
My name is Marie.

448
00:55:10,141 --> 00:55:11,642
Such pretty names.

449
00:55:11,767 --> 00:55:13,978
- What parish do you come from?
- I don't know.

450
00:55:14,103 --> 00:55:15,896
They're the children
of my Parisian friend.

451
00:55:16,022 --> 00:55:17,106
Clarisse!

452
00:55:17,773 --> 00:55:20,318
This is really not the time
to be playing with dolls.

453
00:55:20,443 --> 00:55:22,028
Take them upstairs.

454
00:55:26,198 --> 00:55:27,825
What about the Cardinal?

455
00:55:27,950 --> 00:55:31,704
- Don't undress them, they can wait.
- Very well, Daddy.

456
00:55:38,711 --> 00:55:41,172
Fate is not being kind to us.

457
00:55:41,964 --> 00:55:45,468
One must hope, one must have faith.

458
00:55:45,593 --> 00:55:49,764
Only the Cardinal's arrival
can make any radical change.

459
00:55:49,889 --> 00:55:54,060
- Still no news?
- No, no news.

460
00:55:54,185 --> 00:55:57,772
The telephone is silent,
my uncle won't leave it.

461
00:55:57,897 --> 00:56:02,193
The Cardinal may knock without warning.

462
00:56:03,152 --> 00:56:04,945
Let's believe in miracles.

463
00:56:05,738 --> 00:56:09,116
Father, I'll call you when necessary.
Go home.

464
00:56:09,241 --> 00:56:16,040
No, if I may, I will try
to find a corner here to wait for him.

465
00:56:16,165 --> 00:56:20,836
He is having a tiring journey,
let us be travellers too.

466
01:04:04,299 --> 01:04:08,470
Joseph, I beg you, stay in Rome!

467
01:04:08,595 --> 01:04:11,014
If you come, Mathurin will die.

468
01:04:11,139 --> 01:04:15,352
This boy is my only joy.
Without him I'll be the next to die.

469
01:04:18,981 --> 01:04:25,696
Joseph, listen,
I'll tell you the truth about his baptism.

470
01:04:25,821 --> 01:04:28,490
Pierre baptised him because...

471
01:04:34,079 --> 01:04:37,666
Hello? What's going on?

472
01:04:37,791 --> 01:04:41,086
Rammondelo! Rammondelo!

473
01:04:41,211 --> 01:04:43,171
Why aren't you responding?

474
01:04:45,048 --> 01:04:46,425
Hello?

475
01:04:49,928 --> 01:04:51,889
Answer...

476
01:05:18,290 --> 01:05:20,292
Someone shouted?

477
01:05:20,876 --> 01:05:22,544
No, it was an illusion.

478
01:05:22,669 --> 01:05:25,923
Oh, but you're awake too?

479
01:05:26,715 --> 01:05:31,303
It's the noisy spring in your chair
which must have woken me.

480
01:05:34,389 --> 01:05:37,809
I suggest, Father,
you go to a room upstairs.

481
01:05:37,935 --> 01:05:41,688
My Lord, we're very comfortable here.

482
01:05:41,813 --> 01:05:45,567
Besides,
his Excellency will be arriving soon.

483
01:05:45,692 --> 01:05:49,237
Certainly. I'm going to call again.

484
01:05:51,365 --> 01:05:56,036
Sleep peacefully.
I will come and wake you.

485
01:27:08,325 --> 01:27:11,761
He's dead and fell out of his bed!

486
01:27:12,045 --> 01:27:15,242
Who fell? Who? Tell me!

487
01:27:15,525 --> 01:27:17,004
Mathurin...

488
01:27:17,565 --> 01:27:21,114
I didn't do anything!
He had too much to drink!

489
01:27:44,343 --> 01:27:45,844
Take him.

490
01:27:45,970 --> 01:27:48,597
Come and help me.

491
01:27:49,848 --> 01:27:51,141
Now pick him up.

492
01:28:15,040 --> 01:28:17,084
Carefully, carefully...

493
01:28:19,336 --> 01:28:20,838
Put him there.

494
01:28:28,762 --> 01:28:30,723
Don't touch him!

495
01:28:32,057 --> 01:28:35,978
I'll call the doctor.
Take him to the drawing room.

496
01:28:40,441 --> 01:28:43,068
Poor boy, he drank too much.

497
01:28:43,193 --> 01:28:45,404
Careful of the plaster...

498
01:28:51,125 --> 01:28:54,083
In the name of the father,
the son and the holy spirit.

499
01:28:54,965 --> 01:28:58,958
In the name of the father,
the son and the holy spirit.

500
01:28:59,710 --> 01:29:01,211
Ifany!

501
01:29:05,841 --> 01:29:07,551
Ifany!

502
01:29:22,649 --> 01:29:24,735
Put him in the armchair.

503
01:29:45,005 --> 01:29:46,673
On my desk.

504
01:29:55,766 --> 01:30:00,312
Father, watch over his body and his soul.

505
01:30:00,437 --> 01:30:02,481
I'll call the doctor.

506
01:30:11,645 --> 01:30:13,795
I didn't do anything!

507
01:31:01,748 --> 01:31:03,144
The beast!

508
01:31:56,512 --> 01:31:58,055
Mrs. Broadhurst!

509
01:32:36,889 --> 01:32:39,929
Hanany, get us out of here! Quick!

510
01:32:59,658 --> 01:33:03,495
Mrs. Broadhurst!
Don't go! Don't go!

511
01:33:39,906 --> 01:33:44,286
Bestiality, that is to say,
copulating with an animal,

512
01:33:44,411 --> 01:33:46,705
is the most odious crime

513
01:33:46,830 --> 01:33:49,875
because it debases man,

514
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:52,502
created in the image of God.

515
01:33:52,628 --> 01:33:55,631
It is most contrary
to the laws of nature.

516
01:34:02,554 --> 01:34:04,848
That is why Leviticus...

517
01:34:06,933 --> 01:34:12,648
punished by death
not only the guilty man or woman,

518
01:34:12,773 --> 01:34:15,400
but also the beast itself.

519
01:34:15,525 --> 01:34:17,736
Should simple caressing of a beast

520
01:34:17,861 --> 01:34:20,864
be considered a sin of bestiality?

521
01:34:20,989 --> 01:34:27,162
Unchaste caressing of a beast
should not be forgotten at confession.

522
01:34:27,287 --> 01:34:30,749
For example, as if to defile herself,

523
01:34:30,874 --> 01:34:35,128
a woman has a dog or cat
lick her vulva,

524
01:34:35,253 --> 01:34:38,298
or if she touches
the sexual part of the animal

525
01:34:38,423 --> 01:34:40,759
until it ejaculates.

526
01:34:41,802 --> 01:34:45,597
That's why Vernier advises confessors

527
01:34:45,722 --> 01:34:51,645
to ask women,
particularly those of a lustful nature,

528
01:34:51,770 --> 01:34:55,691
if they have acted shamefully
with an animal.

529
01:34:57,609 --> 01:35:02,698
Often in this way,
shameful secrets are revealed.
