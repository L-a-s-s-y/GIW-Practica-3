1
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,208
Sita, go and tell Sister Clodagh
I wish to speak to her.

2
00:02:44,459 --> 00:02:46,333
..therefore...

3
00:02:46,417 --> 00:02:48,416
x is equal to five...

4
00:02:51,459 --> 00:02:52,958
..or...

5
00:02:53,042 --> 00:02:56,333
Reverend Mother wishes to speak to you,
Sister Clodagh.

6
00:02:56,417 --> 00:02:57,958
Joyah!

7
00:03:05,959 --> 00:03:08,041
Continue the lesson.

8
00:03:24,834 --> 00:03:26,874
Sister Clodagh,

9
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:30,499
we may proceed with our plans at Mopu.

10
00:03:30,584 --> 00:03:32,624
It will be called St Faith.

11
00:03:32,709 --> 00:03:34,208
St Faith.

12
00:03:34,292 --> 00:03:37,458
And you have been appointed
to take charge of St Faith.

13
00:03:37,542 --> 00:03:39,291
I, Reverend Mother?

14
00:03:39,375 --> 00:03:40,833
You.

15
00:03:41,875 --> 00:03:45,249
You will be the youngest Sister Superior
in our Order.

16
00:03:48,917 --> 00:03:50,999
Thank you, Reverend Mother.

17
00:03:54,292 --> 00:03:56,583
The agent at Mopu is an Englishman.

18
00:03:58,125 --> 00:04:00,166
He seems a difficult man.

19
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:03,166
You won't get much help from him.

20
00:04:05,334 --> 00:04:06,416
Dear Madam,

21
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:07,583
My name is Dean.

22
00:04:07,667 --> 00:04:12,624
I am the agent of General Toda Rai at Mopu
and I am writing to you in that capacity.

23
00:04:12,709 --> 00:04:16,541
I understand the GeneraI has offered you
the oId PaIace of Mopu

24
00:04:16,625 --> 00:04:19,499
to make a school
and a dispensary for the natives.

25
00:04:19,584 --> 00:04:22,374
lt is not the first time he has had such ideas.

26
00:04:22,459 --> 00:04:25,791
He has asked me to tell you
about the place and the people.

27
00:04:27,209 --> 00:04:30,249
It's not a comfortable spot
and it's at the back of beyond.

28
00:04:30,334 --> 00:04:32,124
First, you have to get to DarjeeIing

29
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:35,958
and then I have to find you ponies and porters
to take you into the hills.

30
00:04:36,042 --> 00:04:38,083
Mopu is eight thousand feet up.

31
00:04:38,167 --> 00:04:42,124
The peaks on the range opposite
are nearly as high as Everest.

32
00:04:42,209 --> 00:04:45,083
The peopIe caII the highest peak Nanda Devi.

33
00:04:45,167 --> 00:04:47,249
It means, "the bare goddess".

34
00:04:49,667 --> 00:04:54,624
I live down in the valley out of the wind,
so does the GeneraI and so do the people.

35
00:04:54,709 --> 00:04:57,999
Mopu Palace stands in the wind
on a shelf on the mountain.

36
00:04:58,084 --> 00:05:01,583
It was buiIt by the GeneraI's father
to keep his women there.

37
00:05:01,667 --> 00:05:03,291
It's called a paIace,

38
00:05:03,375 --> 00:05:07,666
but there may be a sIight difference between
your idea of a paIace and the General's.

39
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:09,416
Anyhow, there it is.

40
00:05:10,542 --> 00:05:14,458
The peopIe are Iike mountain peasants
everywhere, simpIe and independent.

41
00:05:14,584 --> 00:05:19,624
They work because they must, smile when they
feel Iike it and are no respecters of persons.

42
00:05:19,709 --> 00:05:23,041
The men are men.
No better, no worse than anywhere eIse.

43
00:05:23,125 --> 00:05:24,749
The women are women,

44
00:05:24,834 --> 00:05:26,749
the children, children.

45
00:05:26,834 --> 00:05:30,666
Up on the mountain, above the palace,
we have our hoIy man,

46
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:33,833
who sits there, day in and day out,
in all weathers.

47
00:05:33,917 --> 00:05:39,541
All the peopIe around are very proud of him
and bring him food and little offerings.

48
00:05:39,625 --> 00:05:42,416
The wind up at the palace
blows seven days a week,

49
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:45,583
so, if you must come,
bring some warm things with you.

50
00:05:45,667 --> 00:05:48,916
Nobody has Iived there for a Iong time,
except Angu Ayah,

51
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,041
who has aIways been there
and stays on as caretaker.

52
00:05:53,084 --> 00:05:58,833
As a caretaker, she's a bit of a failure, but she's
a faithful, dirty old bird and goes with the place.

53
00:05:59,875 --> 00:06:01,708
She lives there alone,

54
00:06:01,792 --> 00:06:04,166
with the ghosts of bygone days.

55
00:06:11,167 --> 00:06:14,291
(Voices overlapping) Ayah! Ayah!

56
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:58,958
(Ghostly voice) Ayah!

57
00:07:09,459 --> 00:07:11,541
(Birdsong)

58
00:07:21,834 --> 00:07:23,458
(Ayah squawks)

59
00:07:23,542 --> 00:07:25,208
(Mimics parrot)

60
00:07:33,834 --> 00:07:35,916
(Bugle fanfare)

61
00:07:38,334 --> 00:07:40,374
(Fanfare continues)

62
00:07:40,459 --> 00:07:42,541
(Excited shouting)

63
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:52,333
(Men call out)

64
00:08:01,167 --> 00:08:03,249
(Fanfare continues)

65
00:08:37,209 --> 00:08:39,749
Ayah! Ayah!

66
00:08:39,834 --> 00:08:43,583
- That's Mr Dean.
- Never mind Mr Dean. He will find us.

67
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:46,791
Now, listen, Ayah,

68
00:08:46,875 --> 00:08:51,166
I have invited some ladies to stay here
at the House of Women.

69
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:52,749
Ladies?

70
00:08:52,834 --> 00:08:56,249
Oh, that will be like old times!

71
00:08:56,334 --> 00:08:58,666
It will not be in the least like "old times".

72
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:00,791
They are not that kind of lady, at all.

73
00:09:00,875 --> 00:09:03,958
- Then they won't be any fun.
- They are not coming for fun.

74
00:09:04,042 --> 00:09:05,583
These are nuns.

75
00:09:06,625 --> 00:09:08,583
You know what a nun is?

76
00:09:08,667 --> 00:09:11,583
They pray all day
like the monks you invited last year.

77
00:09:11,667 --> 00:09:15,999
I am going to give them this house
to make a school and a hospital for the people.

78
00:09:16,084 --> 00:09:18,708
But you know nobody here wants a school.

79
00:09:18,792 --> 00:09:21,416
And I'm sure they don't want a hospital.

80
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:24,124
How do they know what
they want untiI they try it?

81
00:09:25,167 --> 00:09:27,333
The people have all kinds of diseases.

82
00:09:27,417 --> 00:09:30,624
- They have ringworm...
- They don't mind having ringworm.

83
00:09:30,709 --> 00:09:33,291
Then they ought to mind and it will all be free.

84
00:09:33,375 --> 00:09:35,541
It was free last time and nobody came.

85
00:09:37,167 --> 00:09:38,749
They will this time.

86
00:09:38,875 --> 00:09:44,916
Mr Dean! You will receive them for me and you
will do everything for them that they want doing.

87
00:09:45,959 --> 00:09:48,333
You, too. You will engage servants for them.

88
00:09:48,417 --> 00:09:52,124
You will both look after them
until they can look after themselves.

89
00:09:52,209 --> 00:09:54,874
What do they eat?
How do I know what nuns eat?

90
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:57,041
I have remembered that.

91
00:10:01,334 --> 00:10:03,416
Do you see that crate?

92
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:08,916
Sausages!

93
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,833
They will eat sausages.

94
00:10:10,917 --> 00:10:13,874
Europeans eat sausages wherever they go.

95
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:19,166
They will eat them when they come and until
they can tell the cook what else they want to eat.

96
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:21,124
(Babble of voices)

97
00:10:23,459 --> 00:10:27,166
Now, remember, Ayah,
if you give any trouble, you will be sorry.

98
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:29,333
I'm sorry now!

99
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,833
A convent in this house!

100
00:10:54,917 --> 00:10:56,791
What do you think of that?

101
00:10:57,834 --> 00:11:00,041
The brothers only stayed five months.

102
00:11:01,167 --> 00:11:03,791
Perhaps the sisters won't stay long, either.

103
00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:10,958
The house is nine thousand feet up.

104
00:11:11,042 --> 00:11:12,916
Very coId, but good air.

105
00:11:13,959 --> 00:11:18,874
General Toda Rai, who has invited us to Mopu
has promised us every help.

106
00:11:19,959 --> 00:11:24,999
He was a little afraid, when he learnt that
we are bound to our Order only by yearly vows.

107
00:11:25,084 --> 00:11:28,249
- I explained this rule to him.
- Yes, Reverend Mother.

108
00:11:28,334 --> 00:11:33,666
For more than a century, to serve voluntarily
has been one of the glories of our Order.

109
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:35,791
And our greatest strength.

110
00:11:35,875 --> 00:11:37,333
Exactly.

111
00:11:38,375 --> 00:11:40,124
He understands now.

112
00:11:40,209 --> 00:11:44,041
- Is there anything you would like to ask?
- Who am I to take with me?

113
00:11:54,334 --> 00:11:57,416
Remember, a community is not a class of girls.

114
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,541
The sisters won't be easy to manage.

115
00:11:59,625 --> 00:12:01,291
Or to impress.

116
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:05,833
Now, let me see...

117
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:12,999
I'll give you Sister Briony.

118
00:12:13,084 --> 00:12:15,249
You'll need her strength.

119
00:12:15,334 --> 00:12:17,416
Thank you, Reverend Mother.

120
00:12:20,542 --> 00:12:22,624
Sister Philippa for the garden.

121
00:12:26,084 --> 00:12:27,791
- Sister Blanche...
- Sister Blanche.

122
00:12:27,875 --> 00:12:29,708
You know what the others call her?

123
00:12:29,792 --> 00:12:31,833
- Sister Honey.
- Yes, Honey.

124
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:33,958
I think you'll need Sister Honey.

125
00:12:34,042 --> 00:12:36,333
She's popuIar and you'II need to be popuIar.

126
00:12:36,417 --> 00:12:38,958
(Giggling)

127
00:12:45,125 --> 00:12:47,708
- And Sister Ruth.
- But Sister Ruth is ill.

128
00:12:47,792 --> 00:12:49,499
That is why I want her to go.

129
00:12:53,042 --> 00:12:56,124
Forgive me for saying so,
Reverend Mother, but...

130
00:12:56,209 --> 00:12:59,249
do you think our vocation is her vocation?

131
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:03,041
Yes, she's a problem.

132
00:13:04,084 --> 00:13:06,583
I'm afraid she'll be a problem for you, too.

133
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,541
With a smaller community, she may be better.

134
00:13:10,625 --> 00:13:13,041
Give her responsibiIities, Sister.

135
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:15,166
She badIy wants importance.

136
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:18,499
Do you think it's a good thing
to let her feel important?

137
00:13:19,792 --> 00:13:22,249
Spare her some of your own importance.

138
00:13:22,334 --> 00:13:23,958
If you can.

139
00:13:24,042 --> 00:13:28,166
Mother, are you sorry that I have been
appointed to take charge of St Faith?

140
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:29,749
Yes.

141
00:13:29,834 --> 00:13:32,249
I don't think you're ready for it.

142
00:13:32,334 --> 00:13:34,416
And I think you'll be lonely.

143
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:40,749
Never forget, we are an order of workers.

144
00:13:41,792 --> 00:13:43,624
Work them hard

145
00:13:43,709 --> 00:13:47,958
and, remember,
the superior of all is a servant of all.

146
00:13:48,042 --> 00:13:49,708
I understand.

147
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:28,583
(Bell continues to ring)
- It was a good, good idea.

148
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,374
One thing about 'em, they keep good time.

149
00:14:36,042 --> 00:14:37,499
Go!

150
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:48,041
(Horn)

151
00:14:54,917 --> 00:14:57,374
(Bell and prolonged note of horn echo)

152
00:14:57,459 --> 00:14:59,541
(Wind howls)

153
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:25,333
(Local men sing)

154
00:15:40,125 --> 00:15:44,749
Oh, dear. A whole garden so terribly overgrown
I don't know where to begin.

155
00:15:47,292 --> 00:15:50,458
Please come and help the fat Lemini
who asks questions.

156
00:15:50,542 --> 00:15:53,708
Sister Briony?
Ayah, you must learn our proper names.

157
00:15:53,792 --> 00:15:57,083
- Anyway, there aren't any patients yet.
- Aren't there?

158
00:15:57,167 --> 00:16:00,458
There are dozens waiting.
And more coming every minute.

159
00:16:00,542 --> 00:16:02,624
(All talk at once in local language)

160
00:16:09,709 --> 00:16:11,374
ALL: Ah!

161
00:16:17,167 --> 00:16:20,458
Now, tell them to go away
and help me with the ones that are left.

162
00:16:20,542 --> 00:16:25,499
Sister Blanche, these girls are to work in your
lace schooI. They were sent by the GeneraI.

163
00:16:25,584 --> 00:16:27,208
Don't they look nice?

164
00:16:27,292 --> 00:16:31,874
Oh, but, Sister, you ought to see the children.
The schoolroom is full of them already.

165
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,083
The little ones are so sweet.
Some of them can scarcely do more than toddle.

166
00:16:37,167 --> 00:16:40,708
- Joseph Anthony has come.
- Ayah, you must knock before you come in.

167
00:16:40,792 --> 00:16:43,166
- Who is Joseph Anthony?
- Who is Joseph Anthony?

168
00:16:43,292 --> 00:16:47,624
He is the son of the General's cook. He is going
to interpret for you. He speaks English.

169
00:16:48,667 --> 00:16:50,124
Come in.

170
00:16:55,709 --> 00:16:57,749
Has the General sent you?

171
00:16:57,834 --> 00:17:00,916
- Yes, lady.
- She isn't a lady. She is a sister.

172
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,624
Say, yes, Lemini.

173
00:17:02,709 --> 00:17:04,124
Yes, Lemini.

174
00:17:04,209 --> 00:17:08,333
I have my box and my bedding outside,
because I shall live here with you.

175
00:17:08,417 --> 00:17:09,916
Oh?

176
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,499
Would you like to see my box
and bedding, lady...Sister...Lemini?

177
00:17:14,584 --> 00:17:16,666
Would you, Auntie? They are new.

178
00:17:17,709 --> 00:17:19,791
- How old are you?
- Six to eleven.

179
00:17:20,875 --> 00:17:23,958
- What did you say?
- I can remember that I am six.

180
00:17:24,042 --> 00:17:27,416
But my father married my mother
eleven years ago.

181
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,874
So I may probably be about ten.

182
00:17:29,959 --> 00:17:31,458
(Knock at door)

183
00:17:32,542 --> 00:17:34,791
The schoolroom is overflowing with children.

184
00:17:34,875 --> 00:17:37,791
We've nothing unpacked.
No-one understands the language.

185
00:17:37,875 --> 00:17:39,499
There are too many and they smell.

186
00:17:39,584 --> 00:17:41,291
l don't know what to do with them.

187
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:44,666
Tell them to come back later.
Start with some of the older ones.

188
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:47,499
- They won't go away, Lemini.
- Oh, why not?

189
00:17:47,584 --> 00:17:50,333
They were paid to come
and so they can't go away.

190
00:17:50,417 --> 00:17:51,749
- Paid?
(Knock at door)

191
00:17:51,834 --> 00:17:56,666
Sister, the General's clerk has orders to pay
everybody who comes to my dispensary.

192
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:58,791
So, of course, they all want to come.

193
00:17:58,875 --> 00:18:01,249
- Excuse me, may I suggest...
- Yes, Sister?

194
00:18:01,334 --> 00:18:03,833
Wouldn't it be a pity to send the children away?

195
00:18:03,917 --> 00:18:07,499
- They were paid to come.
- But if they like it, they may come again.

196
00:18:07,584 --> 00:18:10,416
What can you do with them?
They look very stupid to me.

197
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:13,166
They can't speak a word of Hindustani
or English.

198
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:15,083
Joseph can.

199
00:18:17,209 --> 00:18:19,249
You'll help us, won't you, Joseph?

200
00:18:19,334 --> 00:18:21,791
The brothers left a blackboard in the school.

201
00:18:21,875 --> 00:18:24,083
I'II draw things on it in coloured chaIk.

202
00:18:24,167 --> 00:18:27,958
They can tell me their name for it
and I'll tell them the English.

203
00:18:28,042 --> 00:18:30,874
l can take their names
and ages and make a register.

204
00:18:30,959 --> 00:18:32,708
You can hardly call that a lesson.

205
00:18:32,792 --> 00:18:34,916
You can call it a very sensible idea.

206
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,666
Thank you, Sister Blanche.

207
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,583
(Men shouting)

208
00:19:04,917 --> 00:19:06,999
I suppose you know who I am?

209
00:19:08,209 --> 00:19:10,291
You must be Mr Dean.

210
00:19:13,459 --> 00:19:14,999
I must.

211
00:19:16,334 --> 00:19:19,041
And you must be the Sister Superior.

212
00:19:24,709 --> 00:19:28,708
What curious feathers.
Are they all from the birds that you've shot?

213
00:19:28,792 --> 00:19:30,874
I don't shoot birds.

214
00:19:32,042 --> 00:19:35,041
When you've shot everything, it palls, doesn't it?

215
00:19:38,334 --> 00:19:40,874
I'm the General's agent.
He welcomes you to Mopu.

216
00:19:40,959 --> 00:19:42,791
I understood you wanted to see me.

217
00:19:42,875 --> 00:19:44,999
We want to talk to you on business.

218
00:19:45,084 --> 00:19:47,958
I didn't suppose you want to talk to me
on anything else.

219
00:19:51,834 --> 00:19:53,916
Sorry. Perhaps that wasn't fair.

220
00:19:54,959 --> 00:19:56,458
Mr Dean,

221
00:19:56,542 --> 00:20:01,791
you know that General Toda Rai, has given us
this house for a new foundation of our Order.

222
00:20:01,875 --> 00:20:03,916
We very much appreciate it.

223
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,083
It's very generous of him.

224
00:20:07,125 --> 00:20:08,624
Yes.

225
00:20:08,709 --> 00:20:10,749
You'd like the General, Sister.

226
00:20:10,834 --> 00:20:12,874
He also is a superior being.

227
00:20:12,959 --> 00:20:14,333
Really!

228
00:20:15,459 --> 00:20:18,333
I don't know why you are being
so rude to me, Mr Dean.

229
00:20:18,417 --> 00:20:21,624
I have to talk business with you,
whether I like it or not.

230
00:20:21,709 --> 00:20:23,999
Well, talk it then and don't teach it me.

231
00:20:26,667 --> 00:20:29,124
It's no place to put a nunnery, I can tell you that.

232
00:20:29,209 --> 00:20:31,041
Difficult, but not impossible.

233
00:20:31,125 --> 00:20:34,291
- Nothing is impossible...
- Is yours a contempIative order?

234
00:20:35,417 --> 00:20:39,499
I mean, do you live in meditation
or whatever you call it? Do you keep solitude?

235
00:20:40,959 --> 00:20:44,583
Our Order isn't in the least like that.
We are very busy people.

236
00:20:44,667 --> 00:20:48,708
We're going to open a dispensary,
a school for children and a class for girls.

237
00:20:48,834 --> 00:20:53,666
Good. You'll be doing me a great favour
when you begin to educate the local girls, Sister.

238
00:20:57,709 --> 00:21:01,666
I have already been told, Mr Dean,
that you do not believe in solitude.

239
00:21:04,709 --> 00:21:07,583
Do you know what the people call this place?

240
00:21:07,667 --> 00:21:09,249
The House of Women.

241
00:21:09,334 --> 00:21:12,291
The General's father
used to keep his Iadies here.

242
00:21:12,375 --> 00:21:15,416
From now on,
it will be known as the House of St Faith.

243
00:21:16,459 --> 00:21:19,166
Sister, will you have that picture taken down?

244
00:21:25,417 --> 00:21:27,291
I give you till the rains break.

245
00:21:31,542 --> 00:21:33,624
(Rhythmic drumbeat)

246
00:21:50,542 --> 00:21:52,208
(Wind whistles)

247
00:22:03,875 --> 00:22:05,749
Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

248
00:22:08,209 --> 00:22:09,833
(Knock at door)

249
00:22:09,917 --> 00:22:11,416
Who is it?

250
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:13,958
(Door opens, wind howls)
- Sister Briony.

251
00:22:14,042 --> 00:22:16,124
(Bells jingle)

252
00:22:21,875 --> 00:22:23,958
(Drums continue to beat)

253
00:22:25,459 --> 00:22:27,124
I can't sleep.

254
00:22:33,375 --> 00:22:35,249
Anything wrong, Sister?

255
00:22:36,375 --> 00:22:38,833
It's Sister Ruth. I've just seen her.

256
00:22:38,917 --> 00:22:40,791
- How is she?
- She's sick.

257
00:22:41,834 --> 00:22:46,166
She has violent pains in her joints,
a boil on her finger and headaches.

258
00:22:47,542 --> 00:22:49,374
It's this wind.

259
00:22:49,459 --> 00:22:51,499
And we all seem so tired.

260
00:22:51,584 --> 00:22:53,666
It's the altitude.

261
00:22:55,667 --> 00:22:58,041
My dispensary is more crowded than ever.

262
00:22:59,084 --> 00:23:01,124
This big house to look after.

263
00:23:01,209 --> 00:23:03,249
All the unpacking still to be done.

264
00:23:03,334 --> 00:23:05,624
And the plumbing has broken down again.

265
00:23:06,667 --> 00:23:09,249
What do you think, Sister? Perhaps Mr Dean...

266
00:23:09,334 --> 00:23:11,916
Certainly not. We can manage without Mr Dean.

267
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,666
Yes, of course.

268
00:23:19,875 --> 00:23:22,958
- Are you all right, Sister?
- Of course I'm all right.

269
00:23:23,042 --> 00:23:25,666
- Show me your arm.
- I'm perfectly all right.

270
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:31,083
So, you've got them, too.

271
00:23:31,167 --> 00:23:32,999
- What have I got?
- Spots.

272
00:23:33,084 --> 00:23:35,458
I've got them. Every one of us has got them.

273
00:23:35,542 --> 00:23:38,916
There must be something in the water here
that's very unhealthy.

274
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,833
- The natives drink it.
- They get sick, themselves.

275
00:23:42,875 --> 00:23:46,708
Ayah has the General's ear,
the Young General. He's very ill.

276
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:52,833
Those drums are beating for him.

277
00:23:54,917 --> 00:23:56,999
They beat all night while he's ill.

278
00:23:59,917 --> 00:24:02,208
If you hear them stop, he's dead.

279
00:24:07,542 --> 00:24:09,624
(Drums continue beating)

280
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:18,916
(Drums stop)

281
00:24:52,625 --> 00:24:54,124
You!

282
00:24:54,209 --> 00:24:55,874
How do you do?

283
00:24:56,917 --> 00:24:58,958
What are you doing here?

284
00:24:59,042 --> 00:25:01,999
Excuse Old Feltie,
I haven't a hand to take him off.

285
00:25:02,084 --> 00:25:04,541
I've come to mend a loose joint in your pipe.

286
00:25:04,625 --> 00:25:07,916
- You must send a plumber!
- The nearest one is in Darjeeling.

287
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,041
- I count plumbing among my other gifts.
- That's not...

288
00:25:11,125 --> 00:25:13,999
I swear to you, it's only the pipe I'm interested in.

289
00:25:14,084 --> 00:25:17,041
- I must see Sister Clodagh about this.
- All right.

290
00:25:17,125 --> 00:25:19,208
I forbid you to stay in there.

291
00:25:20,250 --> 00:25:21,791
All right.

292
00:25:30,875 --> 00:25:34,791
We have to build a work room
and a school and, later on, a chapel.

293
00:25:34,875 --> 00:25:38,208
Somebody has got to put locks
on my cupboards. I daren't unpack a thing.

294
00:25:38,292 --> 00:25:42,499
And the windows don't open and the doors
don't shut and the plumbing won't work.

295
00:25:45,792 --> 00:25:47,833
SISTER BRIONY:
Come in, Mr Dean.

296
00:25:47,917 --> 00:25:49,499
May I go now, Sister?

297
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,874
Please sit down, Mr Dean.

298
00:25:59,125 --> 00:26:01,166
Would you like some coffee, Mr Dean?

299
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:04,499
- Can you make it decently?
- Can I make coffee!

300
00:26:05,542 --> 00:26:08,166
- Can she?
- Full of grits.

301
00:26:11,167 --> 00:26:15,541
Mr Dean, Joseph tells us
that people are still being paid to come to us.

302
00:26:15,625 --> 00:26:17,666
Ah, the General's a wise man.

303
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:19,749
It's only till it becomes a habit.

304
00:26:19,875 --> 00:26:24,791
Let it become a habit for them to come and
they won't remember the time when they didn't.

305
00:26:24,875 --> 00:26:27,499
Then, gradually, he'll leave off paying them.

306
00:26:27,584 --> 00:26:30,249
Gradually, it will become a habit not to be paid.

307
00:26:30,334 --> 00:26:31,958
They're like children.

308
00:26:32,042 --> 00:26:35,083
He told me he was going to order them to come.

309
00:26:35,167 --> 00:26:37,124
They don't know what an order is.

310
00:26:37,209 --> 00:26:39,041
Then they should learn.

311
00:26:39,125 --> 00:26:41,166
- Why?
- We all need discipline.

312
00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:45,749
You said they're like children. Without discipline,
we should all behave like children.

313
00:26:45,834 --> 00:26:47,874
Don't you like children?

314
00:26:47,959 --> 00:26:49,708
(Door opens)

315
00:26:53,875 --> 00:26:55,749
Thank you, Sister Briony.

316
00:27:13,334 --> 00:27:15,416
Talking of medicine, Sister Briony,

317
00:27:15,542 --> 00:27:20,499
if you get a bad case, one that seems to you as
though it might be dangerous or even serious,

318
00:27:20,584 --> 00:27:22,083
don't take it.

319
00:27:22,167 --> 00:27:24,416
- But that would be...
- It would be wise.

320
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:28,624
If you got a bad case and someone died,
you'd have all the people up against you.

321
00:27:28,709 --> 00:27:30,541
Why?

322
00:27:30,625 --> 00:27:34,166
Well, you must remember
they are primitive people and like...

323
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:36,458
Like children. Unreasonable children.

324
00:27:37,417 --> 00:27:41,333
They've never seen medicine before.
They'd think it was magic, a new kind of magic.

325
00:27:41,417 --> 00:27:43,499
So, remember, I've warned you.

326
00:27:44,542 --> 00:27:46,916
By the way, how are you feeling, all of you?

327
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,749
Not very well. Sister Ruth is the worst.

328
00:27:49,834 --> 00:27:52,999
I think the water must be bad.
Ayah says it's the water.

329
00:27:53,084 --> 00:27:55,249
On the contrary, the water is too good.

330
00:27:55,334 --> 00:27:56,958
It's Darjeeling tummy.

331
00:27:57,042 --> 00:27:59,416
Well, I'd better get that plumbing fixed.

332
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:01,249
Sister!

333
00:28:02,959 --> 00:28:04,999
What has happened, Sister?

334
00:28:05,084 --> 00:28:08,124
Oh, Sister, they brought in a woman,
our first bad case.

335
00:28:08,209 --> 00:28:11,208
She was covered in blood.
I've never seen such a sight.

336
00:28:11,292 --> 00:28:13,208
She must have cut a vein or an artery.

337
00:28:13,292 --> 00:28:16,666
I had such a time stopping it.
I've never seen bIeeding Iike that.

338
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:20,041
I didn't know what to do at first,
but, at last, I managed to stop it.

339
00:28:20,125 --> 00:28:23,833
A minute would have fetched Sister Briony,
who would have stopped it at once.

340
00:28:23,959 --> 00:28:27,666
- I told you to stay in bed.
- I was only trying to consider you, Sister Briony.

341
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:32,124
It might have been better to have considered
the woman, who was bIeeding to death.

342
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,624
Shall I wait?

343
00:28:37,709 --> 00:28:39,749
We are coming in a moment.

344
00:28:39,834 --> 00:28:42,166
I think you'd better go back to your room.

345
00:28:50,709 --> 00:28:53,791
Goodbye, Sister. I hope your patient does well.

346
00:28:53,875 --> 00:28:55,499
Who is she?

347
00:28:55,584 --> 00:28:58,999
It sounded like Samuel,
but it couldn't be, could it?

348
00:28:59,084 --> 00:29:02,166
Oh, Samil, she's a good old soul,
one of my best workers.

349
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:04,124
I'm very much obliged to you.

350
00:29:05,334 --> 00:29:06,999
Thank you.

351
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:22,249
(Nuns gasp)

352
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:33,333
Now the old place is a pukka convent.

353
00:30:02,042 --> 00:30:04,166
Hello, Sister Ruth. Going for a walk?

354
00:30:04,250 --> 00:30:06,291
It's time to ring the bell.

355
00:30:06,375 --> 00:30:08,041
You're slipping.

356
00:30:09,917 --> 00:30:11,999
A quarter of an hour early.

357
00:30:18,292 --> 00:30:19,749
Thank you.

358
00:30:27,125 --> 00:30:29,708
I came to ask Mr Dean to wait in the Blue Room.

359
00:30:29,792 --> 00:30:33,499
- How did you know he was here?
- I saw him from the schoolroom.

360
00:30:36,792 --> 00:30:39,083
I've brought something for you.

361
00:30:52,834 --> 00:30:56,166
Her name is Hirsempal, but we caII her Kanchi.

362
00:30:57,292 --> 00:30:59,374
She's 1 7. She's an orphan.

363
00:31:00,959 --> 00:31:02,999
And it's high time she was married.

364
00:31:03,084 --> 00:31:06,874
Every evening when I come home,
I find her sitting on my veranda.

365
00:31:06,959 --> 00:31:09,791
She dresses herself up, puts flowers in her hair.

366
00:31:09,875 --> 00:31:11,958
Becoming an absolute nuisance.

367
00:31:13,042 --> 00:31:16,124
lf she is cloistered for a few months,
her uncIe will marry her off,

368
00:31:16,209 --> 00:31:18,791
but she's been behaving so badIy
that no-one wants her.

369
00:31:18,875 --> 00:31:21,166
I don't think we want her, either.

370
00:31:22,834 --> 00:31:24,874
Why did you bring her to us?

371
00:31:24,959 --> 00:31:27,374
Isn't it your business to save souls?

372
00:31:27,459 --> 00:31:30,291
You are not to speak to me like that, Mr Dean.

373
00:31:30,375 --> 00:31:31,833
Sorry.

374
00:31:33,250 --> 00:31:35,458
Can't she go into some sort of service?

375
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:38,583
She'd set any house by the ears.

376
00:31:39,625 --> 00:31:43,041
I thought no-one would have patience with her.
Except you.

377
00:31:47,959 --> 00:31:50,874
Would you ask Sister Briony
to come here, please?

378
00:31:53,959 --> 00:31:55,624
(Whistles) Kanchi!

379
00:32:10,292 --> 00:32:11,708
Kanchi.

380
00:32:11,792 --> 00:32:13,874
(Asks her to make a salaam)

381
00:32:49,709 --> 00:32:52,958
You're sure there's no question
you're dying to ask me?

382
00:32:55,584 --> 00:32:57,041
None.

383
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,583
You wanted me, Sister?

384
00:33:03,709 --> 00:33:08,291
I have agreed to have this girl with us for a
while. Can you find somewhere for her to sleep?

385
00:33:09,459 --> 00:33:11,291
What is she to do?

386
00:33:11,375 --> 00:33:14,124
Sister Honey can take her into the lace school.

387
00:33:15,209 --> 00:33:16,208
Yes...

388
00:33:16,292 --> 00:33:18,749
Tell Ayah to give her some housework.
Keep her busy.

389
00:33:22,875 --> 00:33:24,416
Come along.

390
00:33:44,667 --> 00:33:46,166
Well, thanks.

391
00:33:46,250 --> 00:33:48,791
The Young General's death,
is the General grieving?

392
00:33:48,875 --> 00:33:50,666
You can never tell with these people.

393
00:33:50,750 --> 00:33:53,958
- What's the new Young General's name?
- Dilip. Dilip Rai.

394
00:33:54,042 --> 00:33:57,666
He was going to Cambridge.
Now he'll be a warrior and marry young.

395
00:33:57,750 --> 00:34:00,958
It'll suit him, all right,
these Rai are a fighting race.

396
00:34:01,917 --> 00:34:05,041
- Gun.
CHILDREN: Gun.

397
00:34:06,084 --> 00:34:07,874
Warship.

398
00:34:07,959 --> 00:34:09,749
CHILDREN: Warship.

399
00:34:10,792 --> 00:34:14,083
JOSEPH: Bayonet.
CHILDREN: Bayonet.

400
00:34:15,125 --> 00:34:16,708
Dagger.

401
00:34:16,792 --> 00:34:18,249
CHILDREN: Dagger.

402
00:34:30,334 --> 00:34:32,416
- Gun.
CHILDREN: Gun.

403
00:34:37,209 --> 00:34:40,333
You know, we may have
to mix something with it.

404
00:34:41,417 --> 00:34:43,499
Here. Let me have a look.

405
00:35:18,959 --> 00:35:21,791
Hail Mary, full of grace, blessed is the...

406
00:35:24,625 --> 00:35:26,708
(Bell continues to ring)

407
00:35:45,875 --> 00:35:47,416
Sister?

408
00:35:48,459 --> 00:35:50,541
Did you hear the bell?

409
00:35:55,917 --> 00:36:00,166
This morning, in chapel,
I suddenly had the feeling you were not with us.

410
00:36:01,209 --> 00:36:03,458
- I try hard enough.
- Try what?

411
00:36:04,584 --> 00:36:06,749
I used to forget everything in chapel.

412
00:36:06,834 --> 00:36:10,124
I used to feel light and happy and...near God.

413
00:36:10,209 --> 00:36:11,749
Let me help you.

414
00:36:11,834 --> 00:36:13,624
What is worrying you?

415
00:36:14,667 --> 00:36:17,291
I remember things, before I joined our order.

416
00:36:18,334 --> 00:36:20,124
Things I wanted to forget.

417
00:36:21,209 --> 00:36:23,249
I never thought of them until now.

418
00:36:23,334 --> 00:36:26,291
I've been 21 years in the Order and...

419
00:36:26,375 --> 00:36:28,458
now they come back to me.

420
00:36:30,625 --> 00:36:32,708
I think you can see too far.

421
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:35,416
I look out there and...

422
00:36:36,459 --> 00:36:38,958
..then I can't see the potato I'm planting.

423
00:36:40,084 --> 00:36:44,041
And, after a bit, it doesn't seem to matter
whether I plant it or not.

424
00:36:45,334 --> 00:36:47,166
It's this place,

425
00:36:47,250 --> 00:36:50,083
with its strange atmosphere and new people.

426
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:55,124
Stay with me tonight, after chapel,
and we will pray together.

427
00:36:55,209 --> 00:36:57,041
And work, Sister, work hard.

428
00:36:57,125 --> 00:37:00,333
Work until you're too tired
to think of anything else.

429
00:37:28,792 --> 00:37:31,208
(Remembers) Oh, isn't it a grand day, Con?

430
00:37:46,167 --> 00:37:48,208
Con, isn't it a grand day?

431
00:37:48,292 --> 00:37:49,749
Mm.

432
00:37:58,792 --> 00:38:01,083
- What's wrong?
- Everything.

433
00:38:01,167 --> 00:38:03,708
- What especially?
- Oh, nothing.

434
00:38:03,792 --> 00:38:05,874
You wouldn't understand.

435
00:38:07,334 --> 00:38:09,166
Is it money, Con?

436
00:38:09,250 --> 00:38:11,083
Whatever else is it?

437
00:38:11,167 --> 00:38:13,666
Desmond is well out of it in Michigan.

438
00:38:15,209 --> 00:38:17,249
I heard from him last week.

439
00:38:17,334 --> 00:38:19,374
He's been made a partner.

440
00:38:19,459 --> 00:38:23,583
Just because I'm the eldest son,
I have to stay here in Ireland all my life

441
00:38:23,667 --> 00:38:26,166
and hang around waiting for...this.

442
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,874
I'll have a little money, Con. When I marry.

443
00:38:34,959 --> 00:38:39,541
It isn't "a little money" it wants, it's a fortune,
and then it would be a waste.

444
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:44,749
Clo, don't you sometimes itch to get away?

445
00:38:46,125 --> 00:38:48,166
No, I don't want to go away.

446
00:38:48,250 --> 00:38:51,499
I want to stay here like this for the rest of my life.

447
00:38:57,875 --> 00:38:59,541
(Dog whines)

448
00:39:00,875 --> 00:39:02,541
(Dog barks)

449
00:39:57,417 --> 00:39:59,499
(Dog continues to bark)

450
00:40:02,625 --> 00:40:04,708
MAN: Ayah! Angu Ayah!

451
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:08,124
(Horse bells jingle)

452
00:40:08,209 --> 00:40:09,874
(Calls to servant)

453
00:40:14,542 --> 00:40:16,624
(Dog continues to bark)

454
00:40:37,292 --> 00:40:39,166
Ayah! Angu Ayah!

455
00:40:44,375 --> 00:40:47,166
Salaam, my Little General.

456
00:40:47,250 --> 00:40:49,333
I want to see the Reverend Sisters.

457
00:40:56,500 --> 00:41:01,166
Why are they called "the servants of Mary"?
Is the Superior Sister called Mary?

458
00:41:02,209 --> 00:41:04,249
Ask her. Here she comes.

459
00:41:04,334 --> 00:41:06,624
Go now. I will speak to her alone.

460
00:41:16,459 --> 00:41:18,708
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

461
00:41:18,792 --> 00:41:21,041
I want to see the Superior Sister.

462
00:41:21,125 --> 00:41:23,166
I am the Sister Superior.

463
00:41:23,250 --> 00:41:24,416
Oh.

464
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:26,541
I want to be a student here with you.

465
00:41:26,625 --> 00:41:28,666
I want to study a lot of learning.

466
00:41:28,750 --> 00:41:32,374
I want to study mathematics,
history, poetry and languages.

467
00:41:32,459 --> 00:41:35,458
I have a note from my uncle
to ask you to encourage me.

468
00:41:35,542 --> 00:41:38,749
I'm very sorry.
We only teach children and young girls.

469
00:41:38,834 --> 00:41:40,249
Why?

470
00:41:40,334 --> 00:41:42,583
Convents don't teach men pupils.

471
00:41:42,667 --> 00:41:46,624
- That's not very polite to men.
- We don't mean it that way. It's the custom.

472
00:41:46,709 --> 00:41:50,208
Convents are for girls.
The brotherhoods are for men.

473
00:41:53,667 --> 00:41:55,749
Jesus Christ was a man.

474
00:41:57,250 --> 00:41:59,541
He took the shape of a man.

475
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:03,624
But you don't need to count me as a man.

476
00:42:03,709 --> 00:42:05,999
I'm only interested in studious things.

477
00:42:06,125 --> 00:42:10,041
Please, Sister? I have written out my timetable.
May I read it to you?

478
00:42:10,125 --> 00:42:13,291
5am to 7am:
algebra with the mathematical Sister.

479
00:42:13,375 --> 00:42:17,083
8am to 1 0am: reIigion, especially Christianity,
with the scriptural Sister.

480
00:42:17,167 --> 00:42:18,583
1 0am art.

481
00:42:18,667 --> 00:42:23,624
1 pm to 3pm: French and Russian
with the French and Russian Sisters, if any.

482
00:42:23,709 --> 00:42:27,041
3pm to 4pm: Physics with the physical Sister.

483
00:42:32,792 --> 00:42:34,874
(The Young General calls his servant)

484
00:43:28,584 --> 00:43:30,124
(Door opens)

485
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,791
SISTER CLODAGH:
Please wait in here, General.

486
00:44:20,125 --> 00:44:23,333
Aren't you afraid
that you've let a cuckoo into your nest?

487
00:44:23,417 --> 00:44:26,624
We didn't want to offend the General.
He might turn us out.

488
00:44:26,709 --> 00:44:28,374
He wouldn't do that.

489
00:44:29,417 --> 00:44:31,458
You may have trouble with Kanchi.

490
00:44:31,542 --> 00:44:33,083
Kanchi?

491
00:44:34,334 --> 00:44:35,999
She'd never dare.

492
00:44:37,042 --> 00:44:38,874
After all, he is a prince

493
00:44:38,959 --> 00:44:40,999
and she is...what she is.

494
00:44:41,084 --> 00:44:45,083
Still, I expect she knows the story
of The Prince And The Beggar Maid.

495
00:44:45,167 --> 00:44:47,208
..40, 41 , 42,

496
00:44:47,292 --> 00:44:49,333
43, 44,

497
00:44:49,417 --> 00:44:51,458
45, 46,

498
00:44:51,542 --> 00:44:53,583
47, 48,

499
00:44:53,667 --> 00:44:54,874
49.

500
00:44:54,959 --> 00:44:56,999
When the General gave us the deeds,

501
00:44:57,084 --> 00:45:00,083
our boundary line
was to be 500 yards round the building.

502
00:45:00,167 --> 00:45:03,666
- That's right.
- So, the Holy Man is living on our ground.

503
00:45:03,750 --> 00:45:05,499
He was here first.

504
00:45:05,584 --> 00:45:09,083
Yes, but, Mr Dean,
I find all these things very distracting.

505
00:45:09,167 --> 00:45:10,583
Distracting?

506
00:45:10,667 --> 00:45:12,499
Yes. Disturbing.

507
00:45:12,584 --> 00:45:14,208
This clear air

508
00:45:14,292 --> 00:45:16,291
and the wind always blowing

509
00:45:16,417 --> 00:45:20,124
and the mountain and the Holy Man sitting there,
day in and day out

510
00:45:20,209 --> 00:45:22,249
and the people coming to see him.

511
00:45:22,334 --> 00:45:26,249
They climb the path by the house
and they stop and sit and stare at us.

512
00:45:26,334 --> 00:45:28,166
What do you want to do about it?

513
00:45:28,250 --> 00:45:30,124
Ask the General to ask the Holy Man to move.

514
00:45:30,250 --> 00:45:34,374
- I couldn't. It wouldn't be polite.
- I don't suppose the General knows he's there.

515
00:45:34,459 --> 00:45:37,374
Oh, yes, he does.
That old man worries him quite a bit.

516
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:42,416
Particularly when he's in the middle of his dinner
or when he's trying on a new frock coat.

517
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:43,958
Why?

518
00:45:44,042 --> 00:45:47,208
Well, I suppose he feels
he ought to go and do likewise.

519
00:45:47,292 --> 00:45:49,041
Then he wouldn't turn him out?

520
00:45:49,125 --> 00:45:53,041
Well, it would be a bit awkward
for the General to turn out his own uncle.

521
00:45:53,125 --> 00:45:54,541
His uncle?

522
00:45:54,625 --> 00:45:56,999
General Sir Krishna Rai.

523
00:45:57,084 --> 00:45:59,124
KCVO, KCSI, CMG.

524
00:45:59,209 --> 00:46:01,583
He has several foreign decorations, too.

525
00:46:01,667 --> 00:46:04,333
He lent our General the money to buy this place.

526
00:46:04,417 --> 00:46:08,624
l've never heard him talk.
They say he speaks perfect EngIish.

527
00:46:08,709 --> 00:46:11,083
Several other European languages, too.

528
00:46:15,542 --> 00:46:17,583
Does he never speak at all?

529
00:46:17,667 --> 00:46:19,416
I've never heard him.

530
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:21,958
- When does he eat or sleep?
- No-one knows.

531
00:46:22,042 --> 00:46:24,291
He's always in his place under the tree.

532
00:46:24,375 --> 00:46:26,458
People come miles to see him.

533
00:46:43,667 --> 00:46:45,749
Well, I really don't know what to do.

534
00:46:46,792 --> 00:46:48,666
What would Christ have done?

535
00:46:59,834 --> 00:47:01,916
(Bells jingle)

536
00:47:14,917 --> 00:47:18,166
- Good morning, General.
- Good morning, Sister Honey.

537
00:47:20,125 --> 00:47:22,208
Good morning, Sister Ruth.

538
00:48:03,542 --> 00:48:05,083
(Sniffs)

539
00:48:10,125 --> 00:48:12,166
Do you like it, Sister Ruth?

540
00:48:12,250 --> 00:48:14,291
It's called Black Narcissus.

541
00:48:14,375 --> 00:48:17,208
It comes from the Army and Navy Stores
in London.

542
00:48:18,542 --> 00:48:20,249
Black Narcissus?

543
00:48:20,334 --> 00:48:22,374
I don't like scent, at all.

544
00:48:22,459 --> 00:48:26,999
Oh, Sister, don't you think it's rather common
to smell of ourselves?

545
00:48:34,084 --> 00:48:36,124
Have you seen the Young General today?

546
00:48:36,209 --> 00:48:38,833
- What's the latest?
- Emeralds. Beautiful emeralds.

547
00:48:38,917 --> 00:48:41,333
The deepest, most beautiful green
l've ever seen.

548
00:48:41,417 --> 00:48:43,791
At that hour in the morning,
they make me biIious.

549
00:48:43,875 --> 00:48:47,083
Have you seen his coats?
A different one for every day in the year!

550
00:48:47,167 --> 00:48:49,541
He's lucky he doesn't have to do
his own laundry.

551
00:48:49,625 --> 00:48:53,333
Yesterday, a coat the colour of ripe corn,
patterned with flowers and damask.

552
00:48:53,459 --> 00:48:57,249
His earrings were amethysts, three inches long,
and his rings were turquoise.

553
00:48:57,375 --> 00:49:02,416
Today, he's aII jade and emeralds and his coat
is a most wonderfuI pattern of paIe vioIet stripes,

554
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:06,374
worked entireIy in petit point,
just Iike my grandmother's footstool!

555
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,083
Oh, Granny!

556
00:49:21,125 --> 00:49:22,791
Turn round.

557
00:49:24,750 --> 00:49:28,416
These emeralds are for you, my darling,
when you marry.

558
00:49:30,292 --> 00:49:31,749
There.

559
00:49:42,834 --> 00:49:44,624

00:49:45,667 --> 00:49:47,166

561
00:49:47,250 --> 00:49:49,333
Good night, everybody!

562
00:49:55,542 --> 00:49:56,874
Not too late, darling.

563
00:49:57,750 --> 00:50:00,874
MOTHER: I hope they get something settled
by the winter.

564
00:50:09,209 --> 00:50:10,958
Where are you, Con?

565
00:50:11,042 --> 00:50:15,833
SISTER RUTH: He said it was called Black
Narcissus, from the Army and Navy Stores.

566
00:50:18,042 --> 00:50:19,583
Black Narcissus!

567
00:50:21,209 --> 00:50:24,958
That's what I'm going to call him.
It's a wonderful name for him.

568
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,041
He's so vain, like a peacock.

569
00:50:28,125 --> 00:50:29,874
A fine, black peacock.

570
00:50:29,959 --> 00:50:32,541
- He's not Black.
- They all Iook alike to me.

571
00:50:37,417 --> 00:50:40,124

I know that you're trying to keep up,
for all our sakes,

but I feel that you really must go
and see the doctor.

I shan't see the doctor!
I'm perfectly well. You know it.

647
00:57:21,292 --> 00:57:23,374
You're just trying to make out that...

648
00:57:28,459 --> 00:57:30,083
I didn't mean...

649
00:57:30,167 --> 00:57:31,708
to be rude.

650
00:57:33,375 --> 00:57:35,541
I haven't been sleeping, that's all.

651
00:57:37,625 --> 00:57:41,249
If you haven't been sleeping,
there must be some reason for it.

00:57:41,334 --> 00:57:42,999
Can't you tell me?

653
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:47,041
Is something worrying you?

654
00:57:47,125 --> 00:57:48,541
Yes.

655
00:57:48,625 --> 00:57:50,291
Yes, that's it.

656
00:57:51,334 --> 00:57:52,874
I'm worried.

657
00:57:54,125 --> 00:57:56,541
Don't you think you could tell me about it?

658
00:58:02,584 --> 00:58:04,666
I'd like you to tell me, if you can.

659
00:58:06,375 --> 00:58:08,041
I can't speak of it.

660
00:58:09,459 --> 00:58:11,083
To anyone.

661
00:58:11,167 --> 00:58:13,499
Won't you try? You know you can trust me.

662
00:58:13,584 --> 00:58:15,624
You didn't want me to come here.

663
00:58:15,709 --> 00:58:17,791
None of you have ever wanted me here.

664
00:58:19,709 --> 00:58:23,041
Don't you think
you're letting things run away with you?

665
00:58:27,584 --> 00:58:29,249
I think...

666
00:58:30,459 --> 00:58:34,624
..you have let yourself fall into thinking
too much of Mr Dean.

667
00:58:38,417 --> 00:58:39,916
Sister...

668
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,124
Don't you realise what you're doing?

669
00:58:42,209 --> 00:58:45,208
What you're running the risk
of losing in yourself?

670
00:58:45,292 --> 00:58:47,124
Sister, you must...

671
00:58:47,209 --> 00:58:49,833
I must make you see, before it is too Iate.

672
00:58:49,917 --> 00:58:53,333
All the same, I've noticed
you're very pleased to see him, yourself.

673
00:58:57,500 --> 00:59:01,624
If that was in your mind, it's better said.
I think you're out of your senses.

674
00:59:01,709 --> 00:59:05,333
Listen to me. l don't know,
I can't decide now what to make of you.

675
00:59:05,417 --> 00:59:07,249
I shall have to think.

676
00:59:07,334 --> 00:59:09,624
And I want you to think, too.

677
00:59:10,709 --> 00:59:12,374
As for Mr Dean...

678
00:59:14,250 --> 00:59:17,416
In spite of his charm and kindliness,
he is not a good man.

679
00:59:17,500 --> 00:59:22,083
You must take him for what he is and not try
to glorify him into something he is not.

680
00:59:23,125 --> 00:59:25,749
When he came to chapel on Christmas night,
he was drunk.

681
00:59:27,209 --> 00:59:28,749
Can I go?

682
00:59:31,750 --> 00:59:33,958
I want you to write to Reverend Mother.

683
00:59:35,292 --> 00:59:39,124
I shan't look at the letter
and her reply will be your own business.

684
00:59:39,209 --> 00:59:40,833
Am I to write two or three pages?

685
00:59:40,917 --> 00:59:43,874
Would you rather I did it now
or finish my class work first?

686
00:59:48,334 --> 00:59:49,999
You may go.

687
00:59:58,459 --> 00:59:59,999
(Slams door)

688
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,041
That parcel is mine! Give it to me.

689
01:01:04,125 --> 01:01:07,374
I can't. I must give all the mail to Sister Clodagh.

690
01:01:07,459 --> 01:01:09,791
It's mine. Give it to me, you little fool.

691
01:01:09,875 --> 01:01:13,999
Can't you see? It's addressed to me.
I ordered it myself from Calcutta.

692
01:01:14,084 --> 01:01:16,166
It's nothing to do with anyone else.

693
01:01:22,875 --> 01:01:27,083
Sister Briony, do you know what's happened
to the other gold chain off this censer?

694
01:01:27,167 --> 01:01:29,541
No. It was there
when we had it out at Christmas.

695
01:01:29,625 --> 01:01:32,374
- Well, it isn't here now.
- Ask Kanchi if she's seen it.

696
01:01:32,459 --> 01:01:34,333
(Screams)

697
01:01:34,417 --> 01:01:37,499
And that...is for stealing in my house.

698
01:01:38,542 --> 01:01:42,041
(Kanchi screams again)
- That's for stealing a brass chain.

699
01:01:42,125 --> 01:01:45,166
That's for steaIing it in such a silly way.

700
01:01:45,250 --> 01:01:46,874
And that...

701
01:01:46,959 --> 01:01:50,291
(Kanchi screams again)
- ..is for getting found out.

702
01:02:08,834 --> 01:02:10,874
What has the girl done?

703
01:02:10,959 --> 01:02:17,208
She's a thief. She stole a brass chain
from the church to put round her dirty neck.

704
01:02:18,292 --> 01:02:21,583
Finish the beating, my Little General Bahadur.

705
01:02:21,667 --> 01:02:23,916
You're going to be a great man.

706
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,958
Not like your uncIe, oh, dear, no.

707
01:02:27,042 --> 01:02:29,291
Like your grandfather.

708
01:02:29,375 --> 01:02:31,916
Ha ha! He was a man.

709
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:35,624
Finish the beating and begin to be a man!

710
01:02:39,334 --> 01:02:41,416
(Kanchi sobbing)

711
01:02:45,875 --> 01:02:47,958
Get up.

712
01:03:45,500 --> 01:03:47,124
Forget-me-not.

713
01:03:47,209 --> 01:03:49,291
CHILDREN: Forget-me-not.

714
01:03:50,125 --> 01:03:51,624
Sweet pea.

715
01:03:51,709 --> 01:03:53,791
CHILDREN: Sweet pea.

716
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:57,624
JOSEPH: Daffodil.

717
01:03:57,709 --> 01:03:59,791
CHILDREN: Daffodil.

718
01:04:01,792 --> 01:04:04,749
JOSEPH: Japanese peony.

719
01:04:05,792 --> 01:04:08,624
CHILDREN: Japanese peony.

720
01:04:09,792 --> 01:04:11,833
JOSEPH: Chinese IiIy.

721
01:04:11,917 --> 01:04:15,041
CHILDREN: Chinese lily.

722
01:04:16,084 --> 01:04:19,124
- Tulip.
CHILDREN: Tulip.

723
01:04:19,209 --> 01:04:20,833
Honeysuckle.

724
01:04:20,917 --> 01:04:23,541
CHILDREN: Honeysuckle.

725
01:04:23,625 --> 01:04:25,333
Honeysuckle.

726
01:04:27,375 --> 01:04:30,041
Delphin-i-um.

727
01:04:30,125 --> 01:04:33,708
- Sister Honey!
CHILDREN: Delphin-i-um.

728
01:04:33,792 --> 01:04:36,583
Will you find Sister Philippa for me, please?

729
01:04:38,042 --> 01:04:40,499
- And the cabbage patch?
- Foxgloves.

730
01:04:40,584 --> 01:04:43,124
- And the runner beans?
- Honeysuckle.

731
01:04:43,209 --> 01:04:44,833
And the onions?

732
01:04:44,917 --> 01:04:46,374
Tulips.

733
01:04:47,750 --> 01:04:50,124
And the potatoes? All flowers?

734
01:04:53,125 --> 01:04:55,166
No, not the little round bed.

735
01:04:55,250 --> 01:04:59,749
And there are some more vegetables,
down by the stables, where they won't show.

736
01:04:59,834 --> 01:05:02,083
But what on earth came over you...

737
01:05:05,792 --> 01:05:07,874
Would you like to sit down?

738
01:05:10,042 --> 01:05:12,999
Sister, I want to be transferred.

739
01:05:14,875 --> 01:05:16,374
Transferred?

740
01:05:16,459 --> 01:05:19,916
Yes, I want you, if you will,
to write and ask for my transfer at once.

741
01:05:21,834 --> 01:05:23,916
If you will. At once.

742
01:05:25,500 --> 01:05:27,124
But why?

743
01:05:27,209 --> 01:05:29,583
I was becoming too fond of the place.

744
01:05:31,209 --> 01:05:33,291
I was too wrapped up in my work. I...

745
01:05:34,792 --> 01:05:36,833
I thought too much about it.

746
01:05:36,917 --> 01:05:38,583
I'd forgotten.

747
01:05:39,834 --> 01:05:41,916
Forgotten what?

748
01:05:42,959 --> 01:05:44,583
What I am.

749
01:05:44,667 --> 01:05:47,083
I was losing the spirit of our Order.

750
01:05:48,334 --> 01:05:50,833
I've been thinking it over, you see, and...

751
01:05:51,875 --> 01:05:53,541
I must go at once.

752
01:05:56,917 --> 01:05:58,999
I don't see that at all.

753
01:06:00,792 --> 01:06:04,249
Now that you know and you realise the danger,
you needn't go.

754
01:06:05,292 --> 01:06:07,124
Surely, now is the time to stay.

755
01:06:07,209 --> 01:06:08,874
I daren't stay.

756
01:06:10,250 --> 01:06:13,458
I think there are only two ways
of living in this place.

757
01:06:14,500 --> 01:06:17,083
Either, you must live like Mr Dean or...

758
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:19,874
or like the Holy Man.

759
01:06:21,042 --> 01:06:23,749
Either ignore it or give yourself up to it.

760
01:06:26,625 --> 01:06:28,666
Neither would do for us.

761
01:06:28,750 --> 01:06:30,208
No.

762
01:06:31,917 --> 01:06:36,416
Well, we are here and I don't think
it will help matters if we run away.

763
01:06:38,792 --> 01:06:40,874
(Horn)

764
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:47,249
You know if I ask for you to be transferred,
it'll be a bad mark against you?

765
01:06:47,334 --> 01:06:49,249
That's all the better.

766
01:06:50,292 --> 01:06:52,166
That's what I need.

767
01:06:54,459 --> 01:06:56,541
Ayah! Ayah!

768
01:07:13,875 --> 01:07:15,499
(Asks question)

769
01:07:15,584 --> 01:07:18,291
- What did she say, Ayah?
- Give him something.

770
01:07:19,334 --> 01:07:21,416
It's Om's little brother.

771
01:07:22,875 --> 01:07:24,916
Shall we give him magnesia?

772
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,416
Or some of the paraffin emulsion?

773
01:07:36,542 --> 01:07:38,083
1 03!

774
01:07:39,125 --> 01:07:43,083
That's not much in a baby, is it?
I mean, they go up and down easily, don't they?

775
01:07:43,167 --> 01:07:44,624
(Asks a question)

776
01:07:44,709 --> 01:07:45,708
(Replies)

777
01:07:45,792 --> 01:07:50,291
He's been like it three days. This morning,
he wouldn't wake, so she brought him.

778
01:07:51,917 --> 01:07:55,833
Let him sleep. Take him home
and put him on your bed and let him sleep.

779
01:07:55,917 --> 01:07:59,291
(Translates instructions)

780
01:08:01,584 --> 01:08:03,749
Aren't you going to give him anything?

781
01:08:03,834 --> 01:08:05,708
There's nothing I can do.

782
01:08:06,750 --> 01:08:09,541
But there must be something we can do.

783
01:08:10,584 --> 01:08:12,333
At least, bathe his eyes

784
01:08:12,417 --> 01:08:14,583
or relieve his tummy with a little oil.

785
01:08:14,667 --> 01:08:18,291
I daren't touch him, Sister.
I don't think he feels any pain.

786
01:08:18,375 --> 01:08:20,208
You can see how it must hurt him.

787
01:08:20,292 --> 01:08:24,458
You're afraid of what Mr Dean said.
You'll give up his life without a struggle!

788
01:08:24,542 --> 01:08:26,166
That's enough, Sister!

789
01:08:26,250 --> 01:08:29,499
I won't have any hysteria from you.
I know what I'm doing.

790
01:08:30,750 --> 01:08:35,416
The kindest thing you can do is to make her go
home where she'll be amongst her own people.

791
01:08:39,250 --> 01:08:41,333
Lemini? Lemini?

792
01:08:57,250 --> 01:08:58,791
Sister Ruth!

793
01:09:01,042 --> 01:09:03,083
Everyone is very late this morning.

794
01:09:03,167 --> 01:09:05,249
I do hope nothing's happened.

795
01:09:08,667 --> 01:09:12,083
Joseph, go down the path and hurry them up.

796
01:09:13,917 --> 01:09:15,416
Well, go on.

797
01:09:15,500 --> 01:09:17,124
I don't want to.

798
01:09:17,209 --> 01:09:20,624
- You don't want to?
- Why don't you want to?

799
01:09:20,709 --> 01:09:23,166
How dare you answer me like that! Go at once.

800
01:09:23,250 --> 01:09:25,083
No, I won't go.

801
01:09:25,167 --> 01:09:26,666
Joseph!

802
01:09:26,750 --> 01:09:29,249
Now, stand still. Tell me what's the matter!

803
01:09:29,334 --> 01:09:31,666
- Don't frighten him.
- He knows something.

804
01:09:31,750 --> 01:09:35,124
- Joseph, why haven't the children come?
- Where are they?

805
01:09:35,209 --> 01:09:37,041
He knows why. Tell us.

806
01:09:37,125 --> 01:09:40,124
I don't want to. Lemini, don't make me tell.

807
01:09:40,209 --> 01:09:42,874
Joseph, you must tell us. Please, Joseph, dear.

808
01:09:42,959 --> 01:09:45,749
- Tell us.
- The little baby is dead!

809
01:09:45,834 --> 01:09:49,124
SISTER HONEY: Oh, no.
- Our little brother is dead.

810
01:09:49,209 --> 01:09:52,416
And they say that a Lemini killed him!

811
01:09:52,500 --> 01:09:54,791
ALL: Sister Clodagh!
- Nobody in the dispensary.

812
01:09:54,875 --> 01:09:56,791
- No children have come.
- No gardeners.

813
01:09:56,875 --> 01:09:59,124
- Kanchi has gone.
- So has the Young General.

814
01:09:59,209 --> 01:10:02,791
- Not a servant in the place.
- We're all alone. There's no-one in the house.

815
01:10:03,917 --> 01:10:05,499
It was my fault.

816
01:10:05,584 --> 01:10:08,666
Because I loved him.
Because I couldn't bear to see him die.

817
01:10:08,750 --> 01:10:10,416
I did it. I killed him!

818
01:10:12,209 --> 01:10:16,124
I gave her a bottle to take away,
some cotton wool and one of our spoons.

819
01:10:16,209 --> 01:10:18,041
I killed him! I killed him!

820
01:10:18,125 --> 01:10:19,499
Ayah!

821
01:10:20,625 --> 01:10:24,166
- Ayah, how much of this is true?
- All true. The people are very angry.

822
01:10:24,292 --> 01:10:28,749
We must explain. Somebody must tell them.
The Young General, surely he hasn't run away?

823
01:10:28,834 --> 01:10:30,583
No. He's run away with Kanchi.

824
01:10:30,667 --> 01:10:32,708
Ayah, will you take a message to the village?

825
01:10:32,792 --> 01:10:34,374
Me? No.

826
01:10:34,459 --> 01:10:36,083
Well, can Joseph?

827
01:10:36,167 --> 01:10:39,041
- He can go, but they won't Iet him come back.
- I'll go.

828
01:10:39,125 --> 01:10:41,291
It's not safe for you to go outside the garden.

829
01:10:42,375 --> 01:10:45,916
- You can't go, Sister. It's far too dangerous.
- I'm not going down.

830
01:10:56,834 --> 01:10:58,916
(Animals call out)

831
01:11:11,542 --> 01:11:13,624
(Bell continues to ring)

832
01:11:16,084 --> 01:11:17,624
(Calls servant)

833
01:11:20,167 --> 01:11:22,041
My clothing, quickly!

834
01:11:26,500 --> 01:11:28,166
Well? Who was it?

835
01:11:29,792 --> 01:11:31,916
Oh, you.

836
01:11:35,334 --> 01:11:39,333
Mr Dean, do you think it's serious?
Don't you think they'll come back?

837
01:11:39,459 --> 01:11:44,624
Sister Clodagh, the agent before my time was
riding down to the factory one day on his pony.

838
01:11:44,709 --> 01:11:47,999
He let it kick an umbrella
that was lying open in the path.

839
01:11:48,084 --> 01:11:51,041
There was a child asleep under it
and it was killed.

840
01:11:51,125 --> 01:11:52,958
It was just an accident,

841
01:11:53,042 --> 01:11:55,124
but they murdered him that night.

842
01:11:56,542 --> 01:12:00,999
I'm not trying to frighten you,
but I want you to see that it may be serious.

843
01:12:01,084 --> 01:12:03,124
The village seems quiet enough.

844
01:12:03,209 --> 01:12:06,166
SISTER CLODAGH: Did they say anything?
- Nothing.

845
01:12:06,250 --> 01:12:08,374
They listened to me and said nothing.

846
01:12:08,459 --> 01:12:13,291
I saw the woman. I drank the stuff that
Sister Honey was foolish enough to give her.

847
01:12:13,375 --> 01:12:14,874
You drank it?

848
01:12:14,959 --> 01:12:19,458
I wanted to prove to them that I wouldn't
drop down dead. It was only castor oil.

849
01:12:20,500 --> 01:12:24,624
Now, none of you must go out of the garden.
Behave as though nothing has happened.

850
01:12:24,709 --> 01:12:26,999
I'll go down now and come back this evening.

851
01:12:56,917 --> 01:13:09,374
Lemini?

852
01:13:14,542 --> 01:13:16,624
Lemini.

853
01:13:17,667 --> 01:13:20,416
- What's that for?
- For you, Lemini.

854
01:13:20,500 --> 01:13:22,583
Who sent it? Sister Clodagh?

855
01:14:59,959 --> 01:15:01,833
(Horn echoes)

856
01:15:05,750 --> 01:15:08,458
Do you notice a change in us
since we came here?

857
01:15:09,500 --> 01:15:11,541
I notice a change in you.

858
01:15:11,625 --> 01:15:13,708
Am I very different?

859
01:15:14,750 --> 01:15:16,083
Yes.

860
01:15:18,542 --> 01:15:20,166
You're much nicer.

861
01:15:20,250 --> 01:15:21,874
- Nicer?
- Mm.

862
01:15:21,959 --> 01:15:23,583
You're human.

863
01:15:23,667 --> 01:15:25,124
Human?

864
01:15:26,750 --> 01:15:28,833
Yes, we're all human, aren't we?

865
01:15:33,709 --> 01:15:35,791
When I was a girl, I loved a man.

866
01:15:36,834 --> 01:15:40,124
We were children together in Ireland,
where I come from.

867
01:15:40,209 --> 01:15:42,291
A little place called Enniskelly.

868
01:15:43,334 --> 01:15:44,958
I thought...

869
01:15:45,042 --> 01:15:47,624
Everyone thought we should marry.

870
01:15:48,750 --> 01:15:50,499
But he was ambitious

871
01:15:50,584 --> 01:15:54,041
and I found out he was going to America,
to his uncle.

872
01:15:55,584 --> 01:15:57,666
And he didn't intend to take me.

873
01:15:59,917 --> 01:16:02,458
He didn't think he was doing anything wrong.

874
01:16:02,542 --> 01:16:05,124
I don't think he ever thought of us marrying.

875
01:16:06,167 --> 01:16:08,249
But in a little place like that...

876
01:16:09,292 --> 01:16:11,374
..and I had shown I loved him.

877
01:16:12,709 --> 01:16:14,791
I had to get away first.

878
01:16:16,292 --> 01:16:18,583
And that's why you entered the order?

879
01:16:21,209 --> 01:16:24,041
And, being you, you wouldn't go back?

880
01:16:25,334 --> 01:16:27,499
It was a strange way of bringing me in.

881
01:16:28,542 --> 01:16:30,624
But God works in strange ways.

882
01:16:31,667 --> 01:16:33,291
I had work to do

883
01:16:33,375 --> 01:16:34,999
and I had the life.

884
01:16:35,084 --> 01:16:38,041
No-one outside
can possibly know what that means.

885
01:16:38,125 --> 01:16:39,958
It came to be my life.

886
01:16:40,042 --> 01:16:43,166
I had forgotten everything until I came here.

887
01:16:47,834 --> 01:16:51,583
The first day I came
I thought of him for the first time for years.

888
01:16:53,667 --> 01:16:57,499
I seem to go back to the first time I loved him
when we were children.

889
01:16:59,459 --> 01:17:01,833
The Young General reminds me of him, too.

890
01:17:03,792 --> 01:17:06,499
The world comes thrusting in behind him.

891
01:17:08,209 --> 01:17:10,499
I've been drifting and dreaming and...

892
01:17:11,542 --> 01:17:15,958
(Voice breaks) Now I seem to be living through
the struggle and the bitterness again.

893
01:17:21,584 --> 01:17:22,874
Here.

894
01:17:22,959 --> 01:17:25,749
It's quite clean. I washed my hair this morning.

895
01:17:30,125 --> 01:17:35,333
Don't take on so, there's a good girl.
It'll all blow over. There's nothing really wrong.

896
01:17:36,667 --> 01:17:38,708
Sister Philippa is leaving.

897
01:17:38,792 --> 01:17:41,874
And this morning I had a letter
from Reverend Mother.

898
01:17:41,959 --> 01:17:44,291
Sister Ruth is giving up the Order.

899
01:17:44,375 --> 01:17:46,624
She has not renewed her vows.

900
01:17:46,709 --> 01:17:48,249
I'm sorry.

901
01:17:48,334 --> 01:17:49,958
And you.

902
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,041
Ever since we came here,

903
01:17:53,125 --> 01:17:58,416
over all our troubles, it's been,
"Ask Mr Dean, ask Mr Dean."

904
01:17:58,500 --> 01:18:01,166
There was just no-one else you could ask.

905
01:18:03,417 --> 01:18:05,874
Well, I had to take the Young General.

906
01:18:05,959 --> 01:18:07,999
I couldn't turn out the Holy Man.

907
01:18:08,084 --> 01:18:13,249
I couldn't stop the wind from blowing
and the air from being as clear as crystal.

908
01:18:13,334 --> 01:18:15,208
I couldn't hide the mountain.

909
01:18:16,584 --> 01:18:19,708
Look, you must get away from here,
all of you, at once.

910
01:18:21,459 --> 01:18:23,874
- Run away?
- Yes, if you've got any sense.

911
01:18:24,917 --> 01:18:27,124
What, leave all this work, like the brothers?

912
01:18:27,209 --> 01:18:28,916
Yes.

913
01:18:30,625 --> 01:18:32,958
I told you it was no place to put a nunnery.

914
01:18:33,042 --> 01:18:37,666
There's something in the atmosphere
that makes everything seem exaggerated.

915
01:18:37,750 --> 01:18:41,833
Don't you understand? You must all get away
before something happens!

916
01:18:45,125 --> 01:18:47,208
(Rhythmic drums)

917
01:19:23,042 --> 01:19:25,124
(Wind howls)

918
01:19:44,334 --> 01:19:46,791
SISTER PHILIPPA: ..all snares near me.

919
01:19:46,875 --> 01:19:50,499
May thy hoIy angeIs dwell here
and keep us in peace...

920
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:57,083
(Sister Honey sobs)

921
01:20:06,375 --> 01:20:08,458
(Sister Briony snores)

922
01:20:23,084 --> 01:20:24,749
Sister, are you there?

923
01:20:35,042 --> 01:20:36,916
(Door rattles)

924
01:20:38,417 --> 01:20:41,416
Sister! Do you want me to wake the others?

925
01:20:48,209 --> 01:20:52,124
You can't order me about.
You have nothing to do with me any more.

926
01:20:52,209 --> 01:20:54,999
I know what you've done.
I know that you've left the Order.

927
01:20:55,084 --> 01:20:58,083
I only want to stop you
from doing something you'll be sorry for.

928
01:20:58,209 --> 01:21:01,999
Sister PhiIippa is going back in a few days' time.
I want to send you with her.

929
01:21:02,084 --> 01:21:04,124
That's what you would like to do.

930
01:21:04,209 --> 01:21:06,249
Send me back and shut me up!

931
01:21:06,334 --> 01:21:08,416
That's what you wouId all Iike to do!

932
01:21:32,125 --> 01:21:37,124
You know that isn't true. Why should we want
to keep you here against your will?

933
01:21:37,209 --> 01:21:39,249
Because you're all jealous of me.

934
01:21:39,334 --> 01:21:40,791
Especially you.

935
01:21:45,167 --> 01:21:47,249
At least wait till the morning.

936
01:21:49,417 --> 01:21:51,999
Wait till the morning and I'll wait with you.

937
01:23:53,917 --> 01:23:55,999
(Manic laughter)

938
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:09,374
- Ayah, wake up!
SISTER HONEY: What is it?

939
01:24:09,459 --> 01:24:11,499
- What's happened?
- It's Sister Ruth!

940
01:24:11,584 --> 01:24:13,458
Stop her! She's gone mad!

941
01:24:13,542 --> 01:24:15,583
Oh, it's my fault. It's all my fault!

942
01:24:15,667 --> 01:24:16,708
Sssh!

943
01:24:18,792 --> 01:24:21,249
Can't stop mad people.
You should leave them alone.

944
01:24:21,334 --> 01:24:24,374
- She may kill herself.
- If she's really mad, that won't matter.

945
01:24:24,459 --> 01:24:27,041
All of you, search the house! We must stop her!

946
01:24:27,125 --> 01:24:29,499
NUNS: Sister Ruth! Sister Ruth!

947
01:24:29,584 --> 01:24:31,458
We must get lanterns!

948
01:24:33,167 --> 01:24:34,708
Sister Ruth!

949
01:24:37,125 --> 01:24:39,791
(Mimics nuns) Sister Ruth! Sister Ruth!

950
01:24:39,875 --> 01:24:42,249
(Overlapping voices) Sister Ruth!

951
01:24:42,334 --> 01:24:44,916
SISTER BRIONY: Sister Ruth!
- Sister Ruth!

952
01:24:55,584 --> 01:24:58,458
SISTER CLODAGH:
Joseph! Ask him if he's seen her.

953
01:24:58,542 --> 01:25:00,958
Oh, no, Lemini, we couldn't do that.

954
01:25:01,042 --> 01:25:04,749
But, Joseph, anything may have happened
to the Lemini. She may be hurt.

955
01:25:04,834 --> 01:25:08,374
That would be a very little thing to him, Lemini.

956
01:25:08,459 --> 01:25:10,333
He wouldn't notice it.

957
01:25:10,834 --> 01:25:12,916
(Drums beat)

958
01:25:20,959 --> 01:25:22,499
(Growling)

959
01:25:24,584 --> 01:25:26,666
(Monkeys chatter)

960
01:25:28,667 --> 01:25:30,749
(Screeching)

961
01:25:34,709 --> 01:25:36,791
(Whistling, hissing)

962
01:26:12,459 --> 01:26:14,541
(Whistles)

963
01:26:44,209 --> 01:26:45,749
Good evening.

964
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:53,541
Sister Ruth?

965
01:26:54,834 --> 01:26:56,874
I can't stand it any longer.

966
01:26:56,959 --> 01:26:59,208
I left the Order. I gave up my vows.

967
01:26:59,292 --> 01:27:01,166
I'm finished with them up there.

968
01:27:02,375 --> 01:27:03,833
I see.

969
01:27:04,875 --> 01:27:09,249
Well, I can arrange for you to stay
at the rest house. I'll send my boy over now.

970
01:27:09,334 --> 01:27:13,333
In the morning, I'll get ponies and porters
to take you to Darjeeling.

971
01:27:15,292 --> 01:27:16,791
I love you.

972
01:27:16,875 --> 01:27:17,916
You...

973
01:27:19,375 --> 01:27:21,749
Well, if you do, you can forget about it.

974
01:27:26,709 --> 01:27:29,166
I'm sorry, Sister Ruth, very sorry, but...

975
01:27:29,250 --> 01:27:32,624
Look, let me take you back to the palace.
lt isn't too late.

976
01:27:32,709 --> 01:27:35,749
Sister CIodagh is your friend.
She wants to heIp you.

977
01:27:35,875 --> 01:27:40,541
She hates me. They all hate me.
You're the only one that's ever been kind to me.

978
01:27:40,625 --> 01:27:42,958
- I? I've hardly spoken a word to you.
- You have.

979
01:27:43,042 --> 01:27:45,416
When I stopped the woman
from bleeding to death.

980
01:27:45,500 --> 01:27:47,291
- You said you were grateful.
- Did I?

981
01:27:47,375 --> 01:27:49,708
Then when you stopped me in the hall,
you said...

982
01:27:49,792 --> 01:27:51,833
Whatever I said, it didn't mean a thing.

983
01:27:51,917 --> 01:27:54,374
Ever since you came here,
you've all gone crazy.

984
01:27:54,459 --> 01:27:56,833
Drive one another crazy, but leave me out of it!

985
01:27:58,417 --> 01:28:00,458
Are you going to Darjeeling or not?

986
01:28:00,542 --> 01:28:02,916
- No!
- Then you must go back to the palace.

987
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:05,791
- No.
- You'll go back if I have to carry you back.

988
01:28:06,834 --> 01:28:10,666
Go and talk to Sister Clodagh. She brought you
here, she can get you back again.

989
01:28:10,750 --> 01:28:12,374
Sister Clodagh, Sister Clodagh!

990
01:28:12,459 --> 01:28:15,374
- You know what she says about you?
- Whatever it is, it's true.

991
01:28:15,459 --> 01:28:18,416
- You say that because you love her!
- I don't love anyone!

992
01:28:18,500 --> 01:28:20,124
CIodagh.

993
01:28:20,209 --> 01:28:22,249
CIodagh, CIodagh.

994
01:28:22,334 --> 01:28:25,416
CIodagh! CIodagh! CIodagh!

995
01:28:25,500 --> 01:28:26,958
(Crash)

996
01:28:44,084 --> 01:28:46,166
Feel better now?

997
01:28:53,625 --> 01:28:55,166
All right.

998
01:28:56,209 --> 01:28:57,708
I'll go.

999
01:28:57,792 --> 01:28:59,541
That's a good girl.

1000
01:28:59,625 --> 01:29:01,624
Try and get some sleep.

1001
01:29:01,750 --> 01:29:06,083
In the morning, you'II wake up
and be sorry you made such a fool of yourself.

1002
01:29:06,167 --> 01:29:08,208
Come on. I'll come with you.

1003
01:29:08,292 --> 01:29:09,791
I'll go alone.

1004
01:29:09,875 --> 01:29:11,916
You'll do nothing of the sort.

1005
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,374
I'll go alone or not at all.

1006
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:18,666
Suit yourself.

1007
01:29:54,625 --> 01:29:55,624
(Gasps)

1008
01:29:55,709 --> 01:29:57,791
It's morning, Lemini.

1009
01:29:58,834 --> 01:30:01,166
Oh, yes, Joseph, it's morning.

1010
01:30:01,250 --> 01:30:02,874
What time is it?

1011
01:30:02,959 --> 01:30:05,374
5:45 by Auntie's watch.

1012
01:30:09,750 --> 01:30:11,374
Fine day, Lemini.

1013
01:30:11,459 --> 01:30:13,666
The people call it the...

1014
01:30:13,750 --> 01:30:16,124
"the flying of the snows".

1015
01:30:17,667 --> 01:30:21,124
Joseph, if Sister Briony asks for me,
I'll be in the chapel.

1016
01:31:38,625 --> 01:31:40,708
(Door opens and shuts)

1017
01:32:02,875 --> 01:32:04,958
(Silence)

1018
01:32:56,625 --> 01:32:58,708
(Wind howls)

1019
01:33:52,209 --> 01:33:54,291
(Bell rings out)

1020
01:34:00,334 --> 01:34:02,374
(Weakly) Hail Mary, full of grace,

1021
01:34:02,459 --> 01:34:05,041
blessed is the fruit of thy womb...

1022
01:34:27,125 --> 01:34:28,874
(Screams)

1023
01:34:39,750 --> 01:34:41,208
Argh!

1024
01:34:47,792 --> 01:34:49,583
(Screams)

1025
01:34:55,875 --> 01:34:57,541
(Drums beat)

1026
01:35:00,542 --> 01:35:02,208
(Drums stop)

1027
01:35:11,500 --> 01:35:13,583
(Chatter and shouting)

1028
01:35:48,459 --> 01:35:50,541
What do you want, General?

1029
01:36:00,750 --> 01:36:02,249
Sister,

1030
01:36:02,334 --> 01:36:04,624
you know I have not been here, lately,

1031
01:36:04,709 --> 01:36:07,124
and I'm deeply sorry about Sister Ruth.

1032
01:36:07,209 --> 01:36:08,624
Thank you.

1033
01:36:09,667 --> 01:36:11,291
Is there anything else?

1034
01:36:11,375 --> 01:36:13,124
You're cross with me.

1035
01:36:13,209 --> 01:36:15,249
Please do not be cross with me.

1036
01:36:15,334 --> 01:36:18,916
I've done a very wrong thing,
but I didn't mean to do it.

1037
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:22,041
Isn't it rather late to tell me about that?

1038
01:36:22,125 --> 01:36:23,541
Yes.

1039
01:36:23,625 --> 01:36:25,458
Yes, it is, rather.

1040
01:36:25,542 --> 01:36:28,124
I don't mean to do anything wrong again.

1041
01:36:29,167 --> 01:36:31,916
I'm going to give up being clever and famous.

1042
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:34,541
I'm going to be exactly like my ancestors.

1043
01:36:34,625 --> 01:36:36,666
They were warriors and princes.

1044
01:36:36,750 --> 01:36:38,999
They were modest and brave and polite

1045
01:36:39,084 --> 01:36:41,374
and they never did anything cheating.

1046
01:36:42,625 --> 01:36:47,499
That is why I came to you as soon as I thought
of it, to teII you what I have done.

1047
01:36:49,584 --> 01:36:51,416
Must you tell me now?

1048
01:36:51,500 --> 01:36:54,291
- Please, Sister?
- Well, what have you done?

1049
01:36:59,167 --> 01:37:02,249
Sister Clodagh, I didn't know how to tell you,

1050
01:37:02,334 --> 01:37:04,374
so I asked Mr Dean.

1051
01:37:04,459 --> 01:37:07,458
And he said to tell
it was the story of The Prince...

1052
01:37:09,542 --> 01:37:11,416
..And The Beggar Maid.

1053
01:37:57,709 --> 01:37:59,374
(Dismisses servant)

1054
01:38:08,042 --> 01:38:10,499
You said you'd give us till the rains break.

1055
01:38:10,584 --> 01:38:12,458
They haven't broken yet.

1056
01:38:13,500 --> 01:38:15,624
What will they do with you down there?

1057
01:38:15,709 --> 01:38:19,708
I shall be sent to another convent
with less responsibility.

1058
01:38:19,792 --> 01:38:22,624
I shall be superseded as Sister-in-charge.

1059
01:38:23,667 --> 01:38:25,708
Will you be able to stomach that?

1060
01:38:25,792 --> 01:38:28,374
A stiff-necked, obstinate creature like you?

1061
01:38:29,417 --> 01:38:31,041
It's what I need.

1062
01:38:31,125 --> 01:38:34,999
I expect I shall have to remind myself of it
a hundred times a day.

1063
01:38:35,084 --> 01:38:38,208
I can't change in a minute,
like the Young General.

1064
01:38:40,375 --> 01:38:42,708
But I shall have my ghosts to remind me.

1065
01:38:42,792 --> 01:38:45,083
You're leaving me with more than one.

1066
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:51,083
Will you do one last thing for me?

1067
01:38:52,125 --> 01:38:54,166
I know you'd rather not do it.

1068
01:38:54,250 --> 01:38:55,874
Of course I'll do it.

1069
01:38:55,959 --> 01:38:58,041
Will you look after the grave?

1070
01:38:59,709 --> 01:39:01,749
All right.
