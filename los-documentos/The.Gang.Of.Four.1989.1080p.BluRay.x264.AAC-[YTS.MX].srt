00:00:11,136 --> 00:00:13,530
Gang of Four

4
00:01:05,602 --> 00:01:07,581
Paris, present day:

5
00:01:07,652 --> 00:01:09,666
the end of November
or the beginning of December,

6
00:01:09,735 --> 00:01:11,573
the beginning of the afternoon

7
00:02:54,707 --> 00:02:56,092
So, listen to me!

8
00:02:56,166 --> 00:02:57,197
Oh, just leave me alone!

9
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,452
Come on, be reasonable.

10
00:02:58,531 --> 00:03:00,437
No, I don't have to,
if I don't want to.

11
00:03:00,512 --> 00:03:01,790
And so...?

12
00:03:01,867 --> 00:03:03,545
And so I don't even
want to have a reason for it.

13
00:03:03,569 --> 00:03:05,644
And after you ask 50 times,
like I know you will,

14
00:03:05,726 --> 00:03:08,462
I still won't know!
What are you doing here?

15
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:10,791
You've been eating so little
that you're going to be sick

16
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:12,583
if you don't eat a little
something for breakfast.

17
00:03:12,607 --> 00:03:15,344
I don't care about my health,
it's fine with me if I'm sick!

18
00:03:15,423 --> 00:03:17,568
And you can take this all away

19
00:03:17,647 --> 00:03:19,626
because today, I'm not going
to have breakfast,

20
00:03:19,697 --> 00:03:21,748
or lunch, or dinner!

21
00:03:21,817 --> 00:03:23,796
And the same for tomorrow.

22
00:03:23,869 --> 00:03:27,934
I want to be angry,
and refute all you say

23
00:03:28,004 --> 00:03:30,114
until I see Arlequin

24
00:03:30,194 --> 00:03:31,890
because they
took him away from me.

25
00:03:31,967 --> 00:03:33,875
There they are,
my proclamations.

26
00:03:33,948 --> 00:03:35,928
So, unless you want
to drive me completely crazy,

27
00:03:35,998 --> 00:03:38,428
stop telling me
to be more reasonable!

28
00:03:38,502 --> 00:03:40,716
You're getting pretty close
to driving me nuts!

29
00:03:44,411 --> 00:03:49,305
Raphaelle, I already told you,
no more scripts.

30
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:52,603
I don't intend to try.

31
00:03:52,683 --> 00:03:55,906
I can see you'll keep your word.

32
00:03:55,986 --> 00:03:57,052
And so, if I

33
00:03:57,132 --> 00:03:59,905
Another "and so"!

34
00:03:59,982 --> 00:04:01,535
Oh, I beg your pardon,

35
00:04:01,616 --> 00:04:03,867
this one was a slip,
but it's the last one.

36
00:04:03,945 --> 00:04:05,224
But, please, consider

37
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:06,994
I thought you stood corrected!

38
00:04:07,073 --> 00:04:09,253
I don't want
your considerations!

39
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:10,919
But he's your prince,
he loves you.

40
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,695
I can't keep him from loving me,

41
00:04:12,774 --> 00:04:14,575
but do I have to love him?

42
00:04:14,651 --> 00:04:17,766
No, because I can't.

43
00:04:17,849 --> 00:04:20,028
A child could see it,
but apparently you don't.

44
00:04:20,107 --> 00:04:24,930
You are the bride he
has chosen among his subjects.

45
00:04:25,007 --> 00:04:27,152
Who told him to choose me?

46
00:04:27,233 --> 00:04:29,971
Did he ask my opinion?

47
00:04:30,048 --> 00:04:33,485
If he had asked me,
I would have answered,

48
00:04:33,559 --> 00:04:37,138
"No, my lord, a woman
must love her husband,

49
00:04:37,209 --> 00:04:39,152
and I don't love you."

50
00:04:39,224 --> 00:04:40,990
Is that a good enough
reason for you?

51
00:04:41,066 --> 00:04:43,317
But no, he thinks he loved me,

52
00:04:43,395 --> 00:04:45,469
he carries me off,
and never asks my opinion.

53
00:04:45,551 --> 00:04:48,430
He carried you off to give
you his hand in marriage.

54
00:04:48,505 --> 00:04:52,534
But I don't want
to give him my hand!

55
00:04:52,606 --> 00:04:54,372
Do you force people
to take presents

56
00:04:54,449 --> 00:04:56,392
in spite of their feelings?

57
00:04:56,465 --> 00:04:59,451
But consider how he has
treated you the last two days,

58
00:04:59,523 --> 00:05:02,474
aren't you waited on
as if you were his wife?

59
00:05:02,547 --> 00:05:04,597
Look at the tokens of respect
offered to you,

60
00:05:04,667 --> 00:05:07,582
the many women
at your service...

61
00:05:07,657 --> 00:05:10,809
Anything you want.
Oh right, anything you want.

62
00:05:10,889 --> 00:05:12,275
Okay, cut.

63
00:05:12,348 --> 00:05:16,129
Raphaelle, you'll do it
when you learn the text.

64
00:05:16,207 --> 00:05:18,530
I'm sorry, I just forgot.

65
00:05:18,605 --> 00:05:22,764
That's right, you're not here.

66
00:05:22,846 --> 00:05:24,955
I don't know where you are,
but you're not here.

67
00:05:25,035 --> 00:05:27,216
You're not in this theatre.

68
00:05:27,295 --> 00:05:30,518
Maybe you're out
on a motorcycle.

69
00:05:30,597 --> 00:05:31,876
You, Anna,

70
00:05:31,952 --> 00:05:34,582
there are some obvious problems
with your performance.

71
00:05:34,664 --> 00:05:37,401
First, why do you always speak
with such force like that?

72
00:05:37,479 --> 00:05:40,431
Once you start like that,
you never lighten up.

73
00:05:40,502 --> 00:05:42,517
We don't hear anything,
despite your volume.

74
00:05:42,588 --> 00:05:45,954
We don't understand anything,
we're not listening.

75
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:47,937
Everyone knows it,
everyone sees it,

76
00:05:48,011 --> 00:05:53,391
everyone can say it,
we don't understand, it's true.

77
00:05:53,467 --> 00:05:58,290
There's another thing.

78
00:05:58,369 --> 00:06:00,727
Can anybody tell me what it is?

79
00:06:06,919 --> 00:06:08,993
Louise?

80
00:06:09,074 --> 00:06:13,305
It seems like a whim.

81
00:06:13,384 --> 00:06:16,441
Jeanne?

82
00:06:22,942 --> 00:06:26,652
Well, CÃ©cile?

83
00:06:26,731 --> 00:06:29,196
I agree with Louise.

84
00:06:29,269 --> 00:06:31,449
She doesn't seem very angry,

85
00:06:31,528 --> 00:06:37,679
we're not convinced
she's thinking about Arlequin.

86
00:06:37,749 --> 00:06:39,586
What do you think, Anna?

87
00:06:39,662 --> 00:06:40,870
I don't know.

88
00:06:40,947 --> 00:06:43,649
I know it doesn't work, but

89
00:06:43,727 --> 00:06:48,693
When you're in love,
people can see it.

90
00:06:48,768 --> 00:06:51,920
People should see it, anyway.

91
00:06:52,001 --> 00:06:58,566
If you don't feel the situation
others see nothing.

92
00:07:02,532 --> 00:07:04,642
Have you ever been angry, Anna?

93
00:07:04,722 --> 00:07:07,424
Yes, of course.

94
00:07:07,502 --> 00:07:11,212
Anger is not a fixed emotion.

95
00:07:11,291 --> 00:07:16,434
Anger rises,
the heart starts beating,

96
00:07:16,504 --> 00:07:19,621
but with you,
the anger was superficial.

97
00:07:19,702 --> 00:07:21,468
Your anger was static.

98
00:07:21,544 --> 00:07:23,523
I thought I was doing it.

99
00:07:23,595 --> 00:07:24,733
Here you don't think.

100
00:07:24,812 --> 00:07:29,635
You feel,
you experience emotion.

101
00:07:29,713 --> 00:07:34,086
The theater
is made for emotions.

102
00:07:34,161 --> 00:07:36,520
Can I ask you a question?

103
00:07:36,595 --> 00:07:39,581
We've been working on it
for 3 weeks,

104
00:07:39,653 --> 00:07:41,383
and I don't understand.

105
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:44,648
When I played the part of Silvia
I did exactly what you said,

106
00:07:44,728 --> 00:07:46,529
the anger, the fury

107
00:07:46,605 --> 00:07:50,872
I objected to it because
it wasn't Silvia's anger.

108
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:53,000
You played on your own anger.

109
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:56,672
The words you're saying
are not your words,

110
00:07:56,755 --> 00:07:59,184
they're Marivaux's words.

111
00:07:59,257 --> 00:08:01,651
No matter what we do,
it's never enough.

112
00:08:01,725 --> 00:08:04,355
No, it's never enough.

113
00:08:04,436 --> 00:08:08,015
Well, sometimes.

114
00:08:08,085 --> 00:08:12,352
Lucia, you take Raphaelle's
place, play Trivelin.

115
00:08:54,452 --> 00:08:56,846
Are you sure you like the room?

116
00:08:56,921 --> 00:08:58,449
Sure you won't regret it?

117
00:08:58,519 --> 00:09:00,320
Yeah, I'm sure.

118
00:09:00,396 --> 00:09:04,212
I don't want to carry my things
up and down anymore.

119
00:09:14,056 --> 00:09:16,106
Sure you've got everything?

120
00:09:16,177 --> 00:09:18,049
No, I'm leaving a box
with some of my things.

121
00:09:18,123 --> 00:09:21,311
I'll pick it up some other time.

122
00:09:21,391 --> 00:09:25,491
You'll see, my room's nice
except for the ghost.

123
00:09:25,562 --> 00:09:27,090
Oh, stop it!

124
00:09:27,161 --> 00:09:29,306
Everybody knows
you're full of it.

125
00:09:29,385 --> 00:09:32,442
I'm not joking, ask Joyce.

126
00:09:32,513 --> 00:09:35,286
She was the first one
who heard the ghost.

127
00:09:35,363 --> 00:09:37,129
Okay.

128
00:09:37,205 --> 00:09:40,262
But I bet you're taking it
with you in your bag.

129
00:09:40,333 --> 00:09:43,248
No, I'm only taking
the good memories.

130
00:09:46,695 --> 00:09:49,018
Look out!

131
00:09:50,866 --> 00:09:52,394
Joyce!

132
00:09:59,868 --> 00:10:01,705
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm clumsy.

133
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:04,066
I told you I can do it myself.

134
00:10:04,143 --> 00:10:06,916
Well, she was just
trying to help you.

135
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,294
What happened?

136
00:10:11,373 --> 00:10:14,075
Nothing, no big deal.

137
00:10:14,153 --> 00:10:16,298
I knocked over the flask.

138
00:10:23,121 --> 00:10:26,308
What is that? Nothing!

139
00:10:26,388 --> 00:10:28,888
Just a bad memory.

140
00:10:34,939 --> 00:10:37,368
You have a nice carpet.

141
00:10:37,441 --> 00:10:38,993
Is it from Portugal?

142
00:10:39,074 --> 00:10:43,898
Yes, when I left two years ago,

143
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:46,227
it was the only thing
I took with me.

144
00:10:47,973 --> 00:10:49,287
I'm leaving!

145
00:10:49,363 --> 00:10:50,643
Wait!

146
00:10:50,719 --> 00:10:52,413
Wait!

147
00:11:11,469 --> 00:11:15,428
Why are you in such a hurry?

148
00:11:15,501 --> 00:11:17,337
Somebody's waiting for me.

149
00:11:19,603 --> 00:11:21,475
Still the same "somebody".

150
00:11:21,549 --> 00:11:23,421
Why don't you
introduce him to us?

151
00:11:23,496 --> 00:11:25,403
Are you afraid we'll hit on him?

152
00:11:25,477 --> 00:11:27,657
Yeah, that's it, I'm scared.

153
00:11:27,735 --> 00:11:29,394
What about your telephone calls?

154
00:11:29,474 --> 00:11:31,524
You can tell me in class.

155
00:11:31,594 --> 00:11:33,845
Okay.

156
00:11:33,923 --> 00:11:36,388
It would be easier if you
gave us the number or address.

157
00:11:36,461 --> 00:11:40,098
Oh, I will, but right now
it's too complicated.

158
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:42,810
I'll give it to you
as soon as possible.

159
00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:45,628
Oh, the keys, I forgot,
I won't need them anymore.

160
00:11:45,706 --> 00:11:49,285
Oh, no, keep them,
Lucia has hers.

161
00:11:49,356 --> 00:11:51,370
That's nice of you.

162
00:11:51,441 --> 00:11:53,242
Besides, you never know.

163
00:11:58,045 --> 00:11:59,431
Bye!

164
00:12:07,221 --> 00:12:09,721
She seems to be in love.

165
00:12:09,793 --> 00:12:12,566
Happiness is a pain in the ass.

166
00:12:12,643 --> 00:12:15,416
Do you think we'll have
much fun with Lucia?

167
00:13:38,322 --> 00:13:41,688
You'll get tired
if you don't stop.

168
00:13:41,763 --> 00:13:44,606
You know what
happened last night?

169
00:13:44,682 --> 00:13:45,682
No.

170
00:13:45,725 --> 00:13:46,792
It moved.

171
00:13:46,872 --> 00:13:48,779
Oh, that's great!

172
00:14:15,548 --> 00:14:19,577
Here's something, it's from
South Yemen, it's for you.

173
00:14:19,649 --> 00:14:22,279
It's from my father,
there's a check inside.

174
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:24,435
No reason to complain.

175
00:14:27,227 --> 00:14:29,620
How do you say good morning
in Portuguese?

176
00:14:29,694 --> 00:14:31,317
You say "Bondia".

177
00:14:31,397 --> 00:14:32,985
Bondia.

178
00:14:35,221 --> 00:14:38,373
I'd be glad to get a check from
Limerick every once in a while.

179
00:14:38,453 --> 00:14:43,241
That would save me
from killing myself.

180
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,891
Yes, but that way
you would've never met CÃ©cile.

181
00:14:45,961 --> 00:14:49,955
And you wouldn't have
got her job at the bar.

182
00:14:50,027 --> 00:14:52,836
And she wouldn't
have found her love.

183
00:14:52,913 --> 00:14:55,128
Well, small streams...

184
00:14:55,207 --> 00:14:57,422
make big rivers!

185
00:14:59,204 --> 00:15:00,732
Where's this Limerick?

186
00:15:00,803 --> 00:15:02,189
In Ireland.

187
00:15:02,263 --> 00:15:05,486
My parents returned there
three years ago.

188
00:15:05,564 --> 00:15:08,787
I'll never return
to where I came from.

189
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:11,437
Why?

190
00:15:11,508 --> 00:15:15,016
I disgraced my family.

191
00:15:15,088 --> 00:15:17,198
Did you?

192
00:15:17,278 --> 00:15:20,821
You don't look it.

193
00:15:20,893 --> 00:15:24,530
I didn't want to marry my fiancÃ©
and where I come from,

194
00:15:24,612 --> 00:15:27,563
that's worse than a crime.

195
00:15:27,636 --> 00:15:30,338
You mean you didn't choose him?

196
00:15:30,417 --> 00:15:35,691
It had been arranged.

197
00:15:35,769 --> 00:15:39,620
We grew up together.

198
00:15:39,697 --> 00:15:45,112
Then there was Paris,
The scene, the life.

199
00:15:45,188 --> 00:15:48,590
The Seine, the river?

200
00:15:48,665 --> 00:15:51,295
The stage, the theater.

201
00:15:51,376 --> 00:15:54,528
I wanted to be in a tragedy.

202
00:15:54,608 --> 00:15:56,718
I'm rather interested in comedy.

203
00:15:56,798 --> 00:15:58,705
I love Feydeau.

204
00:15:58,779 --> 00:16:00,272
Jelly?

205
00:16:00,343 --> 00:16:01,765
Never heard of it.

206
00:16:01,838 --> 00:16:06,768
I'm asking her if
she wants some jelly.

207
00:16:06,843 --> 00:16:09,758
Sure, why not?

208
00:16:09,832 --> 00:16:12,889
Anyway, your parents
send you money

209
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:15,140
in spite of your crime?

210
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:17,294
They think I study science.

211
00:16:17,375 --> 00:16:19,033
So, you lie to them
all the time?

212
00:16:19,112 --> 00:16:20,807
Well, yes. That's disgusting.

213
00:16:20,885 --> 00:16:23,907
Nothing is worse than lying.

214
00:16:23,979 --> 00:16:27,274
And you want to be an actress?

215
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:31,309
Well, acting is not lying,
it's searching for the truth.

216
00:16:31,383 --> 00:16:32,875
Well, that's debatable.

217
00:16:32,946 --> 00:16:34,534
You can always ask Constance.

218
00:16:34,615 --> 00:16:36,831
Sure, ask her and be careful
with the jam, Pauline.

219
00:16:36,909 --> 00:16:39,444
Oh, I don't care about your jam.

220
00:16:39,515 --> 00:16:42,537
Anyway, no lying here.

221
00:16:42,609 --> 00:16:45,560
I've already suffered
enough with lies.

222
00:16:45,633 --> 00:16:51,084
Well, there's no reason
for lying here.

223
00:16:51,159 --> 00:16:54,347
Or for telling the truth.

224
00:17:13,961 --> 00:17:18,476
Well, I think we've finished
with this scene for tonight.

225
00:17:18,549 --> 00:17:22,056
There's nothing more to say.

226
00:17:22,129 --> 00:17:25,803
You see, Louise, you're
satisfied with what you did.

227
00:17:25,883 --> 00:17:28,798
Often the actors
judge themselves the wrong way.

228
00:17:28,872 --> 00:17:30,638
Sometimes they think
they acted well

229
00:17:30,715 --> 00:17:35,123
but the show was bad.

230
00:17:35,198 --> 00:17:38,872
I'll tell you a story because
we're finished for tonight.

231
00:17:38,951 --> 00:17:44,154
Two years ago I co-acted
with one of the biggest stars.

232
00:17:44,235 --> 00:17:49,200
She always judged
the acting by the applause.

233
00:17:49,273 --> 00:17:50,895
So, she watched and said,

234
00:17:50,976 --> 00:17:53,854
"A six minute applause,
my dear, we're wonderful!

235
00:17:53,931 --> 00:17:56,918
"Eleven curtain calls,
we're great!

236
00:17:56,989 --> 00:18:01,921
Six curtain calls,
the acting wasn't so great."

237
00:18:01,995 --> 00:18:04,105
Once we went to Holland

238
00:18:04,186 --> 00:18:08,664
and we gave the best performance
we'd ever given.

239
00:18:08,737 --> 00:18:10,397
It was just great.

240
00:18:10,476 --> 00:18:14,292
The author and the director
cried from joy.

241
00:18:14,366 --> 00:18:16,348
And me, I was really happy then.

242
00:18:16,419 --> 00:18:20,485
Yes, I'm even satisfied
from time to time.

243
00:18:20,556 --> 00:18:22,499
But the Dutch hardly
understood French

244
00:18:22,573 --> 00:18:25,664
and the applauding
was just polite, but not more.

245
00:18:25,734 --> 00:18:27,157
So, she said to me,

246
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:28,888
"Constance, tonight
we didn't do well,

247
00:18:28,968 --> 00:18:33,234
but fortunately
it was for the Dutch."

248
00:18:33,314 --> 00:18:35,363
So, that's the story.

249
00:18:35,432 --> 00:18:38,833
Well, see you tomorrow.

250
00:18:38,908 --> 00:18:42,203
Has anybody seen my notebook?

251
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:45,884
Thank you.

252
00:18:45,965 --> 00:18:48,144
Don't go to bed too late.

253
00:18:48,223 --> 00:18:52,110
Raphaelle, you heard me?

254
00:18:52,186 --> 00:18:56,702
No cigarettes if possible,
no alcohol if possible.

255
00:18:56,774 --> 00:18:58,538
Be on time, learn your parts.

256
00:18:58,616 --> 00:19:00,348
There's a girl waiting outside.

257
00:19:00,424 --> 00:19:04,418
Tell her to come in
in just a second.

258
00:19:05,395 --> 00:19:08,060
- What time is it?
- Twenty to six.

259
00:19:17,942 --> 00:19:19,638
Joyce, are you
going straight home?

260
00:19:19,714 --> 00:19:21,764
Yes.

261
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:32,884
Bye!

262
00:19:32,957 --> 00:19:35,067
So, you're going out?

263
00:19:35,147 --> 00:19:36,155
Have a good time.

264
00:19:36,226 --> 00:19:37,849
You bet!

265
00:19:42,828 --> 00:19:44,665
Goodnight. Bye.

266
00:19:46,548 --> 00:19:48,100
Can you take this for me,
please?

267
00:19:48,182 --> 00:19:49,769
Again?

268
00:19:59,790 --> 00:20:03,050
What are you doing now? Nothing.

269
00:20:03,127 --> 00:20:04,372
How about a drink?

270
00:20:04,448 --> 00:20:06,593
Sure, but not too much,
I have an appointment later.

271
00:20:06,673 --> 00:20:07,703
Great!

272
00:20:23,703 --> 00:20:27,140
- Hello.
- Hi.

273
00:20:27,215 --> 00:20:29,395
What have you prepared?

274
00:20:29,473 --> 00:20:31,867
Yes, "Esther's Prayer".

275
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:35,129
Good, so...

276
00:20:35,209 --> 00:20:37,426
- Shall I begin?
- Yes.

277
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:55,154
Oh, my sovereign King!

278
00:20:55,228 --> 00:21:00,917
Here I stand trembling
and alone before you.

279
00:21:04,094 --> 00:21:07,803
When I was a child, my father
told me a thousand times

280
00:21:07,882 --> 00:21:12,290
that you had sworn
a sacred bond with us.

281
00:21:12,365 --> 00:21:15,768
When in search of a people
pleasant to you eyes

282
00:21:15,841 --> 00:21:19,798
your love chose our ancestors.

283
00:21:19,874 --> 00:21:23,203
You promised them
with your sacred lips

284
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:27,439
eternal posterity.

285
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:32,937
Alas!
This people despised your law.

286
00:21:33,012 --> 00:21:36,484
The beloved nation
rejected her faith.

287
00:21:36,556 --> 00:21:39,259
She repudiated her spouse
and her father

288
00:21:39,337 --> 00:21:43,331
and paid tribute to other gods.

289
00:21:43,404 --> 00:21:47,433
Now she is serving
a foreign king.

290
00:21:47,506 --> 00:21:50,245
But being a slave
is not all she is.

291
00:21:50,321 --> 00:21:53,687
They want to cut her throat.

292
00:21:53,763 --> 00:21:57,401
Our great conquerors
attribute their victory

293
00:21:57,481 --> 00:22:00,324
to the power of their gods.

294
00:22:00,401 --> 00:22:04,881
And wish that the same mortal
blow would destroy your name,

295
00:22:04,955 --> 00:22:08,735
your nation and your altar.

296
00:22:08,812 --> 00:22:14,441
In this way, disloyalty
after so many miracles

297
00:22:14,513 --> 00:22:18,993
It's good.

298
00:22:20,665 --> 00:22:24,374
It's very good.

299
00:22:30,711 --> 00:22:33,034
Have you already acted?

300
00:22:33,108 --> 00:22:34,731
No, not in public.

301
00:22:34,811 --> 00:22:39,529
- I studied with Mr....
- Oh, I know.

302
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:44,017
You can join my class this year.

303
00:22:44,092 --> 00:22:45,963
Do you know the terms?

304
00:22:46,038 --> 00:22:48,184
That's what
I wanted to ask you about.

305
00:22:48,262 --> 00:22:51,899
I have a part-time job,
but it's just to make a living.

306
00:22:51,982 --> 00:22:53,854
And your course
is very expensive.

307
00:22:53,929 --> 00:22:58,088
I mean, perhaps
I could pay you later,

308
00:22:58,169 --> 00:23:00,906
at the end of the year.

309
00:23:00,984 --> 00:23:03,485
Do you really want
to be in my class?

310
00:23:03,557 --> 00:23:06,509
I've dreamed about it
for two years now.

311
00:23:06,581 --> 00:23:08,762
Well, now you can stop dreaming.

312
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:13,663
I can't make exceptions,
do you understand?

313
00:23:13,741 --> 00:23:19,678
What I want from everyone here
is a real commitment.

314
00:23:19,754 --> 00:23:22,633
I told CÃ©cile, the girl
you just passed,

315
00:23:22,708 --> 00:23:24,688
the same thing two years ago.

316
00:23:24,759 --> 00:23:32,012
She was also very good
and she had no money.

317
00:23:32,093 --> 00:23:36,989
When you find a solution
come back and see me.

318
00:23:45,995 --> 00:23:48,661
Goodbye. I hope to see you soon.

319
00:24:28,609 --> 00:24:30,376
What time do you have?

320
00:24:30,450 --> 00:24:33,603
I can only stay
for 10 more minutes.

321
00:24:33,684 --> 00:24:35,379
So, do you like the room?

322
00:24:35,456 --> 00:24:39,000
Yes, it's nice
and quiet up there.

323
00:24:39,071 --> 00:24:41,251
At least that way
she leaves us alone.

324
00:24:41,330 --> 00:24:45,253
You shouldn't talk like that
about your new friend.

325
00:24:49,987 --> 00:24:53,387
So, how's the new girl?

326
00:24:53,461 --> 00:24:55,119
You think she'll take her?

327
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:58,531
She's having her audition now.

328
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:05,720
I never understood
how Constance chose us.

329
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,743
Do you remember
your second time?

330
00:25:07,818 --> 00:25:10,447
- The third time.
- Yeah, the third time.

331
00:25:10,527 --> 00:25:15,042
You said it was
your worst audition,

332
00:25:15,116 --> 00:25:17,924
and it's then that
she accepted you.

333
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,366
She took pity on you.

334
00:25:21,441 --> 00:25:24,665
Well, I think
it's a good reason.

335
00:25:24,744 --> 00:25:26,544
What is yours?

336
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:29,215
I judge by feeling.

337
00:25:29,296 --> 00:25:31,583
No, but it's true,

338
00:25:31,659 --> 00:25:34,753
the more you do in this course,
the less you know.

339
00:25:34,824 --> 00:25:36,281
Why don't you say something?

340
00:25:36,354 --> 00:25:40,453
That way it won't
cost you so much.

341
00:25:40,524 --> 00:25:45,075
It's costs a lot already.

342
00:25:45,147 --> 00:25:47,469
It's always the same with you.

343
00:25:47,545 --> 00:25:49,525
Nobody forces you
to take this course.

344
00:25:49,596 --> 00:25:52,473
If you take it, it's because
it has something to offer.

345
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:55,502
You're always
here to justify it.

346
00:25:55,574 --> 00:25:58,346
She's right.

347
00:25:58,425 --> 00:26:00,438
I know the first time
she kicked me out,

348
00:26:00,509 --> 00:26:02,524
it was for my own good.

349
00:26:02,596 --> 00:26:05,747
There's one thing
I don't understand.

350
00:26:05,828 --> 00:26:07,735
Why are there only girls
in our class?

351
00:26:07,808 --> 00:26:09,574
At the beginning
there were also boys.

352
00:26:09,651 --> 00:26:10,860
When was that?

353
00:26:10,936 --> 00:26:13,295
Well, 6 or 7 years ago.

354
00:26:13,370 --> 00:26:17,637
It's good to work
on men's parts.

355
00:26:17,715 --> 00:26:20,737
Sure, your problem
is female characters.

356
00:26:20,809 --> 00:26:23,167
You want to talk
about your problems?

357
00:26:23,241 --> 00:26:24,972
I have none.

358
00:26:25,048 --> 00:26:26,541
Neither with
boys nor with girls.

359
00:26:26,613 --> 00:26:28,236
And that guy you threw out?

360
00:26:28,316 --> 00:26:29,454
What guy?

361
00:26:29,533 --> 00:26:30,397
I don't know.

362
00:26:30,472 --> 00:26:32,415
The jerk I took the room from.

363
00:26:32,487 --> 00:26:36,789
I never kicked him out,
he left himself.

364
00:26:36,865 --> 00:26:39,437
Why had Constance
stopped with the boys?

365
00:26:39,508 --> 00:26:41,973
Maybe they were too bad.

366
00:26:42,046 --> 00:26:45,447
No, it was just
one of her ideas.

367
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:52,017
She gives herself rules and
at the start they're arbitrary.

368
00:26:52,091 --> 00:26:55,598
I don't think she's arbitrary.

369
00:26:55,670 --> 00:26:56,986
She knows what she wants.

370
00:26:57,061 --> 00:26:59,040
And if not, she's crazy,

371
00:26:59,112 --> 00:27:02,205
It's not crazy
to give yourself rules,

372
00:27:02,275 --> 00:27:04,599
but she is strange.

373
00:27:04,671 --> 00:27:06,997
Doesn't she scare you sometimes?

374
00:27:07,073 --> 00:27:08,528
Do you know she lives there?

375
00:27:08,601 --> 00:27:11,196
In the theater,
what do you mean?

376
00:27:11,278 --> 00:27:15,306
Yes, on the second floor,
she bought the building.

377
00:27:15,378 --> 00:27:17,037
Is that so strange?

378
00:27:17,118 --> 00:27:20,624
And have you ever been there?

379
00:27:20,696 --> 00:27:22,427
No, I have no reason
to go there.

380
00:27:22,503 --> 00:27:25,692
Nobody's ever been there,
and she never goes out.

381
00:27:25,772 --> 00:27:28,509
All right, Jeanne,
stop talking nonsense.

382
00:27:28,587 --> 00:27:32,746
She has to go out
when she has a performance.

383
00:27:32,827 --> 00:27:35,291
She does more than give courses.

384
00:27:35,364 --> 00:27:37,900
Yeah, sometimes she acts,
you know.

385
00:27:37,973 --> 00:27:40,638
Is it you that told me she quit
acting 6 or 7 years ago?

386
00:27:40,717 --> 00:27:42,827
Yes, before
starting the courses.

387
00:27:42,907 --> 00:27:45,407
10 or 12 years ago
she worked all the time.

388
00:27:45,478 --> 00:27:47,872
And after that,
I think she left France.

389
00:27:47,948 --> 00:27:49,191
I don't know.

390
00:27:49,268 --> 00:27:51,175
Anyway, who cares.

391
00:27:51,249 --> 00:27:54,271
You look for secrets because
she is mysterious.

392
00:27:54,342 --> 00:27:56,214
Either you're mysterious
or you're not.

393
00:27:56,289 --> 00:27:59,441
But you can't explain it.

394
00:27:59,522 --> 00:28:02,638
Now, I really have to go.

395
00:28:03,831 --> 00:28:06,224
CÃ©cile, you said you'd lend me

396
00:28:06,298 --> 00:28:08,372
Oh, sure.

397
00:28:10,054 --> 00:28:11,404
But it's too much.

398
00:28:11,478 --> 00:28:14,108
I've no change,
you can pay me back later.

399
00:28:14,190 --> 00:28:16,369
Next week will be okay?
No problem.

400
00:28:16,450 --> 00:28:18,735
I'll see you, girls.

401
00:28:26,042 --> 00:28:29,195
She seems well, doesn't she?

402
00:29:00,592 --> 00:29:04,336
You can't refuse it, 3 weeks
in Africa, don't refuse!

403
00:29:04,415 --> 00:29:07,532
Yeah, it's great,
travel, adventure.

404
00:29:07,612 --> 00:29:12,163
Listen, I told you, I want
to attend my acting class.

405
00:29:12,236 --> 00:29:15,114
Photography is how I make money,
it is not my real profession.

406
00:29:15,190 --> 00:29:17,785
What matters to me is theatre.

407
00:29:17,865 --> 00:29:19,109
Theatre!

408
00:29:19,187 --> 00:29:21,686
You'll work nonstop, Anna,
and you'll regret it.

409
00:29:21,758 --> 00:29:24,008
You can't imagine
how lucky you are!

410
00:29:24,087 --> 00:29:25,640
There will be a book about you,

411
00:29:25,721 --> 00:29:28,007
"Anna Van Damme and the Desert".

412
00:29:28,084 --> 00:29:28,806
That's all?

413
00:29:28,884 --> 00:29:31,384
Listen, I'm nothing.

414
00:29:31,457 --> 00:29:32,392
Just an eye.

415
00:29:32,463 --> 00:29:36,101
An eye, my foot.

416
00:29:36,185 --> 00:29:37,949
Think about it.

417
00:29:38,025 --> 00:29:39,826
Not everybody can see
The Tenere Desert.

418
00:29:39,902 --> 00:29:42,889
I don't like the desert.

419
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,348
I prefer crowds.

420
00:29:44,421 --> 00:29:48,725
What a coincidence, me too.

421
00:29:48,801 --> 00:29:50,424
Do I know you?

422
00:29:50,504 --> 00:29:53,799
Everybody knows me.

423
00:29:53,875 --> 00:29:58,142
Nobody knows me.

424
00:29:58,221 --> 00:30:01,313
Could you free one of my hands?

425
00:30:01,382 --> 00:30:03,563
Thank you.

426
00:30:05,797 --> 00:30:09,507
There's a telephone call
for Anna Van Damme, please.

427
00:30:17,893 --> 00:30:19,137
No.

428
00:30:19,215 --> 00:30:22,331
Still nothing, I'm afraid.

429
00:30:22,411 --> 00:30:25,706
Don't say that,
it is worthwhile.

430
00:30:25,783 --> 00:30:30,013
I'm sure I'll find her.

431
00:30:30,094 --> 00:30:33,494
And how's daddy doing?

432
00:30:33,569 --> 00:30:39,779
I'll come by the end
of the year.

433
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:42,112
I'll see you, goodbye.

434
00:30:53,137 --> 00:30:54,833
You're leaving already?

435
00:30:54,910 --> 00:30:56,048
We just arrived.

436
00:30:56,127 --> 00:30:58,662
I'm tired, you can stay.

437
00:31:09,127 --> 00:31:10,821
Easy, honey.

438
00:31:18,929 --> 00:31:20,279
Excuse me.

439
00:31:20,355 --> 00:31:23,956
Excuse me, it's my sister.

440
00:31:24,037 --> 00:31:25,944
What's going on here?

441
00:31:26,853 --> 00:31:28,868
Leave him,
let's get out of here!

442
00:31:35,994 --> 00:31:40,119
Are you all right?

443
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:41,930
I'm fine.

444
00:31:46,699 --> 00:31:49,852
I'll drive you home.

445
00:31:49,934 --> 00:31:54,306
Okay, my car's just over here.

446
00:31:56,084 --> 00:31:59,485
I live far from here,
in Monfermeil, in the suburbs.

447
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:01,669
That's one more reason.

448
00:32:42,104 --> 00:32:44,699
After Raincy,
I'll tell you the way.

449
00:32:47,074 --> 00:32:48,389
Are you better now?

450
00:32:48,465 --> 00:32:50,231
I'm fine, thank you.

451
00:32:53,470 --> 00:32:55,614
Does this kind of thing
happen to you often?

452
00:32:55,694 --> 00:32:57,674
No, it's the first time.

453
00:32:57,745 --> 00:33:02,012
Why, do I look like
I make up stories?

454
00:33:23,952 --> 00:33:25,895
You do photography or theatre?

455
00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:27,842
Theatre.

456
00:33:27,915 --> 00:33:30,867
I do photography to pay
for my school.

457
00:33:30,939 --> 00:33:34,163
Constance Dumas' course,
the best!

458
00:33:34,241 --> 00:33:36,078
Constance Dumas?

459
00:33:36,153 --> 00:33:37,610
So you must know CÃ©cile Morin.

460
00:33:37,682 --> 00:33:41,012
CÃ©cile, yes,
she's a friend of mine.

461
00:33:44,217 --> 00:33:45,461
If she's your friend,

462
00:33:45,537 --> 00:33:48,002
tell her to be more careful
picking friends.

463
00:33:48,076 --> 00:33:50,503
If she continues like that
she may get into trouble.

464
00:33:50,577 --> 00:33:52,520
Why are you telling me that?

465
00:33:52,594 --> 00:33:54,360
What did she do?

466
00:33:54,437 --> 00:33:57,244
How do you know her?

467
00:33:57,321 --> 00:33:59,856
We have common friends.

468
00:33:59,927 --> 00:34:03,081
What did she do?

469
00:34:03,161 --> 00:34:05,588
What, your friends don't
tell you what they're up to?

470
00:34:05,662 --> 00:34:10,000
Actually, she's careful,
maybe it's better that way.

471
00:34:10,076 --> 00:34:11,214
What did she do?

472
00:34:11,294 --> 00:34:12,397
Nothing.

473
00:34:12,476 --> 00:34:15,733
No, nothing.

474
00:34:27,734 --> 00:34:29,641
The ashtray's right there.

475
00:34:41,811 --> 00:34:43,363
Who are you?

476
00:34:43,445 --> 00:34:46,915
I told you,
my name's Henri Demorsais.

477
00:34:52,063 --> 00:34:54,079
You're a cop?

478
00:34:54,150 --> 00:34:57,302
No, I'm a printer.

479
00:34:57,382 --> 00:35:00,085
I mean, I was a printer.

480
00:35:00,164 --> 00:35:02,272
A printer?

481
00:35:02,352 --> 00:35:04,261
You don't look it.

482
00:35:04,334 --> 00:35:07,426
Listen, Anna, you shouldn't
judge by appearances.

483
00:35:07,497 --> 00:35:11,563
Can I call you Anna?

484
00:35:11,633 --> 00:35:13,957
There are different kinds
of printers.

485
00:35:14,032 --> 00:35:16,700
My line of business
was identity cards.

486
00:35:16,778 --> 00:35:19,929
I was partners
with CÃ©cile's boyfriend.

487
00:35:20,009 --> 00:35:21,705
Real identity cards?

488
00:35:21,782 --> 00:35:25,634
Real.

489
00:35:25,710 --> 00:35:28,553
Really fake.

490
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:32,660
We were making some good money.

491
00:35:32,730 --> 00:35:36,547
But it was too risky.

492
00:35:36,624 --> 00:35:38,984
The partners got greedy.

493
00:35:45,557 --> 00:35:47,915
And now, what are you doing?

494
00:35:47,991 --> 00:35:50,799
Now I'm a painter.

495
00:35:50,875 --> 00:35:56,042
I paint stolen cars,
and I drive them.

496
00:35:56,125 --> 00:35:58,483
Stop here, please.

497
00:35:58,557 --> 00:36:02,443
No, I'm joking.

498
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:06,442
You want to see my papers?

499
00:36:06,517 --> 00:36:09,184
I print art catalogs.

500
00:36:22,331 --> 00:36:23,752
Don't make such a face, Anna.

501
00:36:23,826 --> 00:36:26,060
I'm not going to leave you here
in the middle of the suburbs,

502
00:36:26,084 --> 00:36:28,964
not after what
just happened to you.

503
00:36:38,042 --> 00:36:41,135
Why did you turn left?

504
00:36:41,204 --> 00:36:44,262
It's not the right way?

505
00:36:44,334 --> 00:36:48,185
No, it's absolutely right,

506
00:36:48,261 --> 00:36:49,789
but I didn't tell you.

507
00:36:49,861 --> 00:36:51,803
Well, I have an instinct.

508
00:36:51,877 --> 00:36:53,784
East-West.

509
00:36:56,185 --> 00:36:59,824
So, this is
the right way, right?

510
00:37:07,170 --> 00:37:13,357
You've been playing with me.

511
00:37:13,426 --> 00:37:15,192
Do I look like a joker?

512
00:37:15,269 --> 00:37:16,926
I don't know.

513
00:37:17,006 --> 00:37:20,408
It's here.

514
00:37:22,984 --> 00:37:26,420
Oh, it's a lovely place.

515
00:37:26,494 --> 00:37:31,282
Can we meet again?

516
00:37:31,361 --> 00:37:34,170
Can I leave you my phone number?

517
00:37:34,247 --> 00:37:37,505
You know where to find me,
in Constance Dumas' class.

518
00:37:57,290 --> 00:38:02,672
Thomas...

519
00:38:02,748 --> 00:38:08,472
No, she doesn't know anything.

520
00:38:08,553 --> 00:38:12,190
I'm sure it's in the house.

521
00:38:12,272 --> 00:38:20,272
No, no warrant,
officially I'm on leave.

522
00:38:21,587 --> 00:38:26,445
I'll go into this hole
whenever I feel like it.

523
00:38:41,191 --> 00:38:42,469
You scared me!

524
00:38:42,546 --> 00:38:44,346
Me too!

525
00:38:48,594 --> 00:38:50,845
- Do you want anything?
- No.

526
00:39:05,833 --> 00:39:08,429
I had a nightmare.

527
00:39:08,509 --> 00:39:12,397
I dreamed Constance
kicked me out.

528
00:39:12,472 --> 00:39:14,308
I had to recite
"Esther's Prayer"

529
00:39:14,384 --> 00:39:18,579
and I messed up, I kept
reciting "Athalie's Dream".

530
00:39:18,659 --> 00:39:22,061
It was horrible.

531
00:39:22,136 --> 00:39:26,722
Did you have a good time?

532
00:39:26,793 --> 00:39:29,780
I met a guy who knew CÃ©cile.

533
00:39:29,850 --> 00:39:31,722
I have to go to bed.

534
00:39:31,798 --> 00:39:33,255
Just listen!

535
00:39:33,327 --> 00:39:36,030
He said she's in a fix.

536
00:39:36,108 --> 00:39:38,087
She doesn't seem
to be in trouble.

537
00:39:38,158 --> 00:39:39,474
That's right.

538
00:39:39,550 --> 00:39:43,613
Her money comes from a trade.

539
00:39:43,685 --> 00:39:46,422
False identity cards.

540
00:39:46,501 --> 00:39:49,486
It looks like a risky business.

541
00:39:49,558 --> 00:39:52,781
What does this guy look like?

542
00:39:52,861 --> 00:39:57,720
He's not bad, blue eyes,
big nose,

543
00:39:57,797 --> 00:39:59,871
some face, you know.

544
00:39:59,952 --> 00:40:01,304
No!

545
00:40:01,377 --> 00:40:04,008
10 days ago I met a guy who
spoke to me about CÃ©cile.

546
00:40:04,087 --> 00:40:05,474
What did he say?

547
00:40:05,547 --> 00:40:06,900
I didn't quite get it.

548
00:40:06,972 --> 00:40:08,595
Some story about hiding guns,

549
00:40:08,677 --> 00:40:11,141
I thought he was
trying to pick me up.

550
00:40:11,213 --> 00:40:14,236
He gave me his number.

551
00:40:16,287 --> 00:40:19,131
3 o'clock, my god!

552
00:40:19,208 --> 00:40:21,223
Did you keep the number?

553
00:40:21,294 --> 00:40:22,396
Yeah, I guess.

554
00:40:22,475 --> 00:40:27,618
We'll talk tomorrow.

555
00:40:27,688 --> 00:40:30,011
The world's full of loonies.

556
00:41:03,838 --> 00:41:05,851
What's going on?

557
00:41:05,923 --> 00:41:09,431
Anna just got home.

558
00:41:09,503 --> 00:41:10,711
I can't sleep.

559
00:41:10,788 --> 00:41:12,139
Neither can I.

560
00:41:12,213 --> 00:41:14,015
Maybe it's the full moon.

561
00:41:14,090 --> 00:41:16,450
I keep thinking too much.

562
00:41:16,525 --> 00:41:18,633
I don't even know what about.

563
00:41:18,714 --> 00:41:21,001
Well, let's get to bed.

564
00:41:21,077 --> 00:41:24,100
Bye, sleep tight.

565
00:42:13,736 --> 00:42:15,536
Give me a drag.

566
00:42:27,464 --> 00:42:30,901
I'd rather be at home today.

567
00:42:30,976 --> 00:42:33,156
I had a dreadful night.

568
00:42:33,235 --> 00:42:37,300
- You're not the only one.
- I can believe it.

569
00:42:37,370 --> 00:42:39,586
I mean, you look pale.

570
00:42:43,315 --> 00:42:44,843
Anything wrong?

571
00:42:44,913 --> 00:42:47,059
No, everything's fine.

572
00:42:47,138 --> 00:42:49,840
We've got to go.

573
00:42:49,919 --> 00:42:52,977
Wait.

574
00:42:53,046 --> 00:42:55,156
If anything's wrong...

575
00:42:55,237 --> 00:42:58,566
I mean, if I can help you,
let me know.

576
00:42:58,644 --> 00:43:00,444
I know.

577
00:43:07,019 --> 00:43:08,156
Tell me,

578
00:43:08,236 --> 00:43:10,630
you and all the women
who keep talking to me,

579
00:43:10,704 --> 00:43:13,476
why must you bother me?

580
00:43:13,554 --> 00:43:16,849
Are you being paid to irritate
me with your nonsense?

581
00:43:16,926 --> 00:43:22,129
Do you enjoy going off
about what I should do?

582
00:43:22,209 --> 00:43:26,060
I do what I can for you
that's the sum of my wisdom.

583
00:43:26,137 --> 00:43:29,917
Your wisdom has accomplished
precious little.

584
00:43:29,996 --> 00:43:33,112
At least tell me
where I am wrong.

585
00:43:33,192 --> 00:43:35,243
Yes, I'll tell you, yes.

586
00:43:35,312 --> 00:43:38,300
I didn't mean
to provoke you, ma'am.

587
00:43:38,372 --> 00:43:41,667
So, you're a burglar.

588
00:43:41,744 --> 00:43:43,686
I am your servant.

589
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:47,196
My servant!

590
00:43:47,269 --> 00:43:51,572
Well, then instead of singing
the praises of this place,

591
00:43:51,649 --> 00:43:58,487
tell me why these
five men are spying on me.

592
00:43:58,566 --> 00:44:02,074
My love is taken away from me,

593
00:44:02,146 --> 00:44:04,220
I'm given these
women to replace him,

594
00:44:04,301 --> 00:44:09,445
and now I'm expected
to be happy.

595
00:44:09,516 --> 00:44:12,667
If the Prince is so in love,
it's not my fault.

596
00:44:12,748 --> 00:44:15,213
I didn't ask him to be.

597
00:44:15,285 --> 00:44:19,479
There are plenty of others who'd
be delighted to be with him.

598
00:44:19,559 --> 00:44:22,226
I just want him
to leave me alone

599
00:44:22,306 --> 00:44:24,070
and let me have
my dear Arlequin,

600
00:44:24,148 --> 00:44:29,634
who is no richer, no vainer
and no better lodged than I am

601
00:44:29,709 --> 00:44:32,245
who loves me, and I love him,

602
00:44:32,315 --> 00:44:36,416
and for whom I'll die of grief
if I don't see him again.

603
00:44:36,486 --> 00:44:41,204
Alas, the poor boy,
what has become of him?

604
00:44:41,283 --> 00:44:49,283
He must be sunk in despair,
because he's so kind.

605
00:44:49,417 --> 00:44:52,782
Maybe he's being mistreated.

606
00:44:52,859 --> 00:44:54,623
Oh, I'm beside myself!

607
00:44:54,700 --> 00:44:57,093
Do you want to please me?

608
00:44:57,167 --> 00:44:58,897
Let me get straight
to the point.

609
00:44:58,976 --> 00:45:02,092
Leave me alone!

610
00:45:02,174 --> 00:45:06,059
Calm yourself, please.

611
00:45:06,135 --> 00:45:07,663
Leave without a word!

612
00:45:07,735 --> 00:45:08,837
CÃ©cile.

613
00:45:08,916 --> 00:45:10,088
Yes?

614
00:45:10,168 --> 00:45:13,190
This is not a tragedy.

615
00:45:13,260 --> 00:45:16,213
I know.

616
00:45:16,285 --> 00:45:20,764
Everybody has problems,
some more serious than others,

617
00:45:20,838 --> 00:45:23,955
but you mustn't
carry them on the stage.

618
00:45:24,037 --> 00:45:25,979
There are directors
who would be pleased

619
00:45:26,051 --> 00:45:27,605
to see you act like this,

620
00:45:27,686 --> 00:45:31,192
showing there's
cruelty in this play.

621
00:45:31,266 --> 00:45:32,653
It's true.

622
00:45:32,724 --> 00:45:34,076
When Flamina says,

623
00:45:34,150 --> 00:45:38,796
"Let's break
Silvia's love for Arlequin,"

624
00:45:38,877 --> 00:45:42,279
it's a terrible plot.

625
00:45:42,353 --> 00:45:45,955
But Silvia doesn't know it.

626
00:45:46,038 --> 00:45:49,154
Besides, she's not crushed,
she's angry.

627
00:45:49,235 --> 00:45:51,345
I know what this scene is about.

628
00:45:51,426 --> 00:45:52,705
Really?

629
00:45:52,781 --> 00:45:54,997
It's "Don't cry, Jeannette."

630
00:45:55,074 --> 00:45:56,533
What?

631
00:45:56,604 --> 00:46:04,604
<i>I don't want a Prince,
tra la la la la la la la la la</i>

632
00:46:05,850 --> 00:46:11,681
<i>I don't want a Prince
and I want a Baron even less</i>

633
00:46:11,758 --> 00:46:13,666
<i>and a Baron even less</i>

634
00:46:13,739 --> 00:46:21,739
<i>I want my friend Pierre
tra la la la la la la la la la</i>

635
00:46:22,186 --> 00:46:27,567
<i>I want my friend Pierre
he, who is now in prison</i>

636
00:46:27,644 --> 00:46:30,073
<i>he, who is now in prison</i>

637
00:46:30,146 --> 00:46:33,060
<i>You will not be with Pierre...</i>

638
00:46:33,136 --> 00:46:35,043
CÃ©cile!

639
00:46:35,115 --> 00:46:36,395
Pauline, go get her.

640
00:46:36,472 --> 00:46:38,380
Leave her, I'll go.

641
00:46:48,740 --> 00:46:51,833
I'm sorry.

642
00:46:55,312 --> 00:46:56,698
Tell me,

643
00:46:56,770 --> 00:46:59,544
you and all the women
who keep talking to me,

644
00:46:59,620 --> 00:47:02,015
why must you bother me?

645
00:47:02,088 --> 00:47:08,584
Are you being paid to irritate
me with your nonsense?

646
00:48:05,140 --> 00:48:07,805
Claude, will you stop it?

647
00:48:07,885 --> 00:48:09,308
I'm upset.

648
00:48:09,379 --> 00:48:11,951
And I need some peace.

649
00:48:12,021 --> 00:48:15,388
Where's the lemon?

650
00:48:15,462 --> 00:48:16,813
Everybody's upset.

651
00:48:16,888 --> 00:48:22,089
What do you have
to be upset about?

652
00:48:22,171 --> 00:48:25,358
It's not about me.

653
00:48:25,437 --> 00:48:28,176
It's about CÃ©cile.

654
00:48:28,253 --> 00:48:32,900
I'd like to reverse the charges
on a call to Los Angeles.

655
00:48:32,980 --> 00:48:36,524
Thomas Santelli,
Beverly Wilshire,

656
00:48:36,596 --> 00:48:41,833
213-475-7676.

657
00:48:49,038 --> 00:48:51,017
She's completely topsyturvy.

658
00:48:51,089 --> 00:48:53,791
You say topsyturvy...

659
00:48:53,870 --> 00:48:56,500
Well, she's upset.

660
00:48:56,581 --> 00:48:58,039
Who are you talking about?

661
00:48:58,111 --> 00:49:01,204
CÃ©cile.

662
00:49:01,274 --> 00:49:06,441
I'm afraid it's because
of her lover.

663
00:49:06,522 --> 00:49:09,474
Who knows?

664
00:49:09,547 --> 00:49:12,533
I was like that a while back.

665
00:49:12,604 --> 00:49:18,887
The next day I landed
in a hospital.

666
00:49:18,966 --> 00:49:21,217
Is that what that flask was?

667
00:49:21,294 --> 00:49:27,577
Yes, I swallowed a little,
but I spit up.

668
00:49:27,656 --> 00:49:29,183
Nice story.

669
00:49:29,253 --> 00:49:32,027
Well, Anna, it happens.

670
00:49:32,104 --> 00:49:34,463
It can happen to you, too.

671
00:49:34,536 --> 00:49:36,752
And to me.

672
00:49:36,831 --> 00:49:40,268
I can understand
these things very well.

673
00:49:40,342 --> 00:49:42,249
Dying for a man's love?

674
00:49:42,323 --> 00:49:45,202
Well, I'm sorry,
but I don't get it.

675
00:49:45,278 --> 00:49:49,022
For a man, or a woman,
it's the same.

676
00:49:49,101 --> 00:49:51,317
So, what is love for you?

677
00:49:51,394 --> 00:49:52,982
Listen, Claude,

678
00:49:53,063 --> 00:49:56,607
love isn't always a burden,
a desperate tragedy.

679
00:49:56,679 --> 00:49:58,586
I've been with Thomas
for three years now

680
00:49:58,660 --> 00:50:00,911
and it's been three years
of happiness.

681
00:50:00,988 --> 00:50:04,176
Oh, cut it out,
Thomas calls you at 3 a.m.

682
00:50:04,255 --> 00:50:08,215
from Los Angeles,
12,000 kilometers away.

683
00:50:08,286 --> 00:50:11,130
You see him, what,
once every 6 months?

684
00:50:11,207 --> 00:50:13,149
Is that what you call love?

685
00:50:13,223 --> 00:50:14,751
Fine, if you're happy like that,

686
00:50:14,822 --> 00:50:18,152
but for me that's
always been a horror,

687
00:50:18,227 --> 00:50:19,887
and it's the same with her.

688
00:50:19,966 --> 00:50:23,059
Maybe you want it
to be like that?

689
00:50:23,129 --> 00:50:27,158
Oh, excuse me!

690
00:50:27,231 --> 00:50:30,253
Excuse me, you've
got nothing to do with it.

691
00:50:30,325 --> 00:50:34,627
Tomorrow I'm seeing somebody
I haven't seen for a long time,

692
00:50:34,704 --> 00:50:40,891
and for one minute of joy
I pay three months of hell.

693
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:44,634
Don't go then.

694
00:50:44,714 --> 00:50:47,771
That's easy to say.

695
00:50:47,843 --> 00:50:50,438
Of course you should go.

696
00:50:50,519 --> 00:50:54,477
One minute of joy,
even one minute is worth it.

697
00:50:54,549 --> 00:50:56,316
Now cut the crap,

698
00:50:56,393 --> 00:51:01,181
I have to read
and I need some peace.

699
00:51:01,258 --> 00:51:04,411
Besides, I know
your nonsense by heart.

700
00:51:04,491 --> 00:51:06,991
Try to understand that love
is a lot more strong

701
00:51:07,063 --> 00:51:10,049
when it's realistic.

702
00:51:10,122 --> 00:51:12,860
Maybe if you didn't complicate
it so much, it would work.

703
00:51:17,144 --> 00:51:19,538
Well, Claude, it's true.

704
00:51:23,504 --> 00:51:27,605
You're always upset about it.

705
00:51:27,674 --> 00:51:29,690
Her name's Sarah, isn't it?

706
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:32,296
The girl that lives
with your father?

707
00:51:32,367 --> 00:51:36,431
Not anymore.

708
00:51:36,504 --> 00:51:44,504
I know where to find her,
but I know it's a bad idea.

709
00:51:48,044 --> 00:51:55,296
What I want is
not love everyday,

710
00:51:55,377 --> 00:51:58,186
I need just a little bit
from time to time.

711
00:51:59,514 --> 00:52:00,935
From time to time.

712
00:52:15,398 --> 00:52:18,727
Do you want some herbal tea?

713
00:52:46,750 --> 00:52:47,757
Oh, excuse me.

714
00:52:47,827 --> 00:52:49,071
Miss, listen to me...

715
00:52:49,148 --> 00:52:51,506
Don't bother me!

716
00:52:51,580 --> 00:52:53,940
Excuse me, it's...

717
00:52:54,015 --> 00:52:55,815
Act I, Scene I.

718
00:52:55,891 --> 00:52:57,277
Is that it?

719
00:52:57,351 --> 00:52:59,116
So, you are CÃ©cile Maurin.

720
00:52:59,193 --> 00:53:01,302
You know me, Thomas Derville.

721
00:53:01,383 --> 00:53:03,166
There's something
our friend must understand...

722
00:53:03,190 --> 00:53:07,978
Wait, I don't understand,
I'm not CÃ©cile.

723
00:53:08,057 --> 00:53:09,442
You're not CÃ©cile Mourin?

724
00:53:09,516 --> 00:53:12,572
No, I'm Claude Fayard.

725
00:53:12,644 --> 00:53:15,074
You've got the script,
you live in Montfermeil.

726
00:53:15,147 --> 00:53:18,061
Yes, but CÃ©cile moved out.

727
00:53:18,136 --> 00:53:22,259
My train's coming,
but what's going on?

728
00:53:22,341 --> 00:53:25,458
What is it that her
friend must understand?

729
00:53:25,540 --> 00:53:29,046
Well, I have no time,
I'll explain it some other time.

730
00:53:29,119 --> 00:53:32,829
There are no
"some other times," never!

731
00:53:32,909 --> 00:53:36,794
There's always
some other time, Claude.

732
00:53:36,871 --> 00:53:38,814
Well, we'll see!

733
00:53:52,580 --> 00:53:53,968
Do you understand?

734
00:53:54,040 --> 00:53:56,092
I think so.

735
00:53:56,161 --> 00:53:58,104
It's already much better now.

736
00:53:58,177 --> 00:54:03,320
Start again, please, Joyce,
control your look.

737
00:54:03,390 --> 00:54:07,136
It's important in this scene.

738
00:54:14,062 --> 00:54:15,555
Why don't we try?

739
00:54:15,626 --> 00:54:17,806
Give me an example,

740
00:54:17,885 --> 00:54:20,799
for instance, a candid look.

741
00:54:24,767 --> 00:54:28,098
How is this?

742
00:54:28,174 --> 00:54:30,497
It needs a little more work.

743
00:54:30,572 --> 00:54:34,457
You're just a woman,
you don't inspire me like a man.

744
00:54:34,534 --> 00:54:37,936
Forget the test,
I can't do it for you.

745
00:54:38,011 --> 00:54:39,740
All this is for Arlequin?

746
00:54:39,817 --> 00:54:41,310
That's right.

747
00:54:41,382 --> 00:54:46,548
That poor boy, I'll deceive him
if I don't love him.

748
00:54:46,630 --> 00:54:49,404
I'm a woman of honor,
but I'll fool him.

749
00:54:49,481 --> 00:54:53,438
If he loves you,
you'll marry him and get rich.

750
00:54:53,512 --> 00:54:56,321
Does that make you feel better
about being deceitful?

751
00:54:56,398 --> 00:54:59,621
We're but the daughters
of the lower-class,

752
00:54:59,698 --> 00:55:02,436
now you'll become a lady.

753
00:55:02,513 --> 00:55:04,978
So much for my conscience.

754
00:55:05,052 --> 00:55:09,424
As a lady, I won't
have to love my husband.

755
00:55:09,501 --> 00:55:11,159
I messed up.

756
00:55:11,238 --> 00:55:15,197
That's for me to say,
not you, Joyce.

757
00:55:15,271 --> 00:55:19,987
You always do that when
she tells you to look at her,

758
00:55:20,066 --> 00:55:22,389
the audience has to see it.

759
00:55:22,466 --> 00:55:26,103
Your look had to be seen,
even at the back of the theatre.

760
00:55:26,184 --> 00:55:29,728
It's a big theater.

761
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:34,208
Did you girls in the back
see anything?

762
00:55:34,283 --> 00:55:35,705
I did.

763
00:55:35,778 --> 00:55:38,101
There was a bug in the air.

764
00:55:38,175 --> 00:55:39,668
Look out, it's landing!

765
00:55:39,741 --> 00:55:42,857
Claude, articulate!

766
00:55:42,938 --> 00:55:46,269
Your look must come
from your heart.

767
00:55:46,344 --> 00:55:48,074
Start again, please.

768
00:55:54,303 --> 00:55:57,182
Give me a candid look.

769
00:55:57,259 --> 00:55:59,653
How is this?

770
00:55:59,726 --> 00:56:01,006
Very bad.

771
00:56:01,081 --> 00:56:04,483
Start again.

772
00:56:04,557 --> 00:56:07,129
Give me a candid look.

773
00:56:07,199 --> 00:56:10,528
How is this?

774
00:56:12,204 --> 00:56:16,613
How is this?

775
00:56:16,688 --> 00:56:18,595
How about this?

776
00:56:23,013 --> 00:56:24,886
You don't know
what you're doing.

777
00:56:24,961 --> 00:56:28,467
Listen, Lisette is a specialist.

778
00:56:28,541 --> 00:56:32,534
She knows how to impress a man.

779
00:56:32,607 --> 00:56:35,380
Maybe you're
not interested in men?

780
00:56:35,457 --> 00:56:38,575
I know how to impress
some men, too.

781
00:56:38,654 --> 00:56:42,577
Not all of them, but some I do.

782
00:56:42,651 --> 00:56:45,151
Another thing, Pauline.

783
00:56:45,225 --> 00:56:46,991
These are two sisters
plotting a coup.

784
00:56:47,067 --> 00:56:49,390
They are in it together.

785
00:56:49,465 --> 00:56:51,088
Yeah, we didn't
think about that.

786
00:56:51,168 --> 00:56:53,668
You should have.

787
00:56:53,740 --> 00:56:59,642
I can't find the secret for you.

788
00:56:59,718 --> 00:57:03,190
Well, let's have a break.

789
00:57:33,574 --> 00:57:36,074
You think she knows the secret?

790
00:57:36,145 --> 00:57:37,212
Possibly.

791
00:57:37,292 --> 00:57:39,686
And you?

792
00:57:39,759 --> 00:57:43,054
Why are you asking me?

793
00:57:43,130 --> 00:57:44,826
I don't know.

794
00:57:48,310 --> 00:57:50,041
Before, you used to be happy,

795
00:57:50,118 --> 00:57:52,060
you smiled a lot,
you talked to me.

796
00:57:52,133 --> 00:57:53,828
Now you look sad all the time.

797
00:57:53,905 --> 00:57:56,679
I'm not sad,
you're embarrassing me.

798
00:58:03,186 --> 00:58:05,817
I'm sure it's your boyfriend.

799
00:58:05,899 --> 00:58:08,150
I'll tell you, it's him.

800
00:58:08,227 --> 00:58:09,814
He's got nothing to do with it.

801
00:58:09,896 --> 00:58:12,526
Stop imagining things.

802
00:58:12,606 --> 00:58:15,070
You're unkind, CÃ©cile,
I'm your friend.

803
00:58:15,144 --> 00:58:19,790
Well, okay,
but I'm also your friend.

804
00:58:19,871 --> 00:58:22,928
You just worry too much.

805
00:58:27,587 --> 00:58:29,872
Are you coming?

806
00:58:42,150 --> 00:58:44,509
A Manhattan with lemon?

807
00:58:44,584 --> 00:58:46,207
You must be joking.

808
00:58:46,286 --> 00:58:53,790
No, I'd like
a Kiss in the Dark, please.

809
00:58:53,864 --> 00:58:57,087
Do you know
the Kiss in the Dark, Joyce?

810
00:58:57,166 --> 00:58:59,240
It depends.

811
00:58:59,321 --> 00:59:01,916
One measure of Gin,
one of Sherry,

812
00:59:01,997 --> 00:59:04,567
and two fingers of Vermouth.

813
00:59:04,639 --> 00:59:07,896
Two.

814
00:59:11,833 --> 00:59:15,056
I thought you lost my number.

815
00:59:15,135 --> 00:59:17,115
I keep them all.

816
00:59:17,187 --> 00:59:18,574
Disappointed?

817
00:59:18,646 --> 00:59:23,505
Glad, very glad.

818
00:59:23,582 --> 00:59:27,019
So, you didn't believe my story?

819
00:59:27,093 --> 00:59:28,965
CÃ©cile with the Basques.

820
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:31,953
What, are you kidding?

821
00:59:32,027 --> 00:59:35,629
No, you're wrong,
and I'm serious.

822
00:59:45,271 --> 00:59:49,823
It's true,
she's a little strange lately.

823
00:59:49,895 --> 00:59:51,482
You see?

824
00:59:55,454 --> 00:59:56,912
Salut!

825
00:59:58,305 --> 01:00:01,043
Cheers!

826
01:00:01,121 --> 01:00:06,678
So, she works for
some underground group?

827
01:00:06,752 --> 01:00:09,003
And you're one of them, too.

828
01:00:09,081 --> 01:00:12,825
I, myself, am a group.

829
01:00:12,903 --> 01:00:15,084
I'm a parasite on the others.

830
01:00:17,805 --> 01:00:21,799
Are you with, or against CÃ©cile?

831
01:00:21,872 --> 01:00:23,886
I'm neither with
nor against her.

832
01:00:23,957 --> 01:00:26,386
I stand on the side.

833
01:00:28,302 --> 01:00:30,245
I've no doubts
that the sabotage at the top

834
01:00:30,317 --> 01:00:33,091
is a front for
the one on the bottom,

835
01:00:33,167 --> 01:00:40,740
and the sabotage in France
fronts an international one.

836
01:00:42,344 --> 01:00:45,082
She's supposed
to have hidden guns?

837
01:00:45,160 --> 01:00:46,854
They're hidden.

838
01:00:46,932 --> 01:00:47,932
Where?

839
01:00:47,975 --> 01:00:49,846
I thought it was in your house.

840
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:52,385
Our house?

841
01:00:52,459 --> 01:00:54,852
You can't hide a mouse in it.

842
01:00:54,927 --> 01:00:56,479
It's a suburban house?

843
01:00:56,559 --> 01:00:57,496
Yup.

844
01:00:57,568 --> 01:00:59,096
How many floors?

845
01:00:59,165 --> 01:01:01,181
Two.

846
01:01:01,251 --> 01:01:04,308
Then you can put
an arsenal in it.

847
01:01:04,380 --> 01:01:07,437
In our four little bedrooms?

848
01:01:07,508 --> 01:01:09,582
Where was CÃ©cile's room?

849
01:01:09,664 --> 01:01:13,931
Next to mine, I would know
if she hid a slingshot in there.

850
01:01:14,008 --> 01:01:16,544
Yeah, possibly.

851
01:01:16,616 --> 01:01:18,902
Do you live on the ground floor?

852
01:01:18,979 --> 01:01:21,194
No, on the second.

853
01:01:21,273 --> 01:01:24,710
She had to pass through
my room to go into hers.

854
01:01:24,784 --> 01:01:27,249
Who lives there now?

855
01:01:27,320 --> 01:01:31,658
Now?

856
01:01:31,735 --> 01:01:32,764
Now it's Anna's.

857
01:01:32,848 --> 01:01:35,620
There she is, over there.

858
01:02:26,547 --> 01:02:28,040
This guy is nuts!

859
01:02:28,112 --> 01:02:33,007
Yes, we thought
we would get him,

860
01:02:33,083 --> 01:02:34,883
but he escaped.

861
01:02:41,043 --> 01:02:43,022
Can you help me here?

862
01:02:49,420 --> 01:02:52,334
I used to know a guy like that.

863
01:02:52,409 --> 01:02:55,738
He thought we were
made for each other,

864
01:02:55,815 --> 01:02:59,144
which gave him the right
to ask everybody what I did,

865
01:02:59,221 --> 01:03:04,009
where I was, who I saw.

866
01:03:04,087 --> 01:03:06,481
How did it end?

867
01:03:06,555 --> 01:03:09,399
They locked him up,

868
01:03:09,475 --> 01:03:13,812
and I had the best vacation
of my life.

869
01:03:22,996 --> 01:03:25,626
You know what I think?

870
01:03:25,706 --> 01:03:26,949
What?

871
01:03:27,026 --> 01:03:30,463
He's a sick guy.

872
01:03:30,537 --> 01:03:33,488
He's in love with CÃ©cile, and
is following her everywhere.

873
01:03:33,562 --> 01:03:35,220
He's not a madman.

874
01:03:35,300 --> 01:03:38,903
He's the Social Service,
offering anything,

875
01:03:38,984 --> 01:03:43,251
friendship, trafficking,
loyalty,

876
01:03:43,328 --> 01:03:47,667
he's, how
do you say it... ballistic,

877
01:03:47,744 --> 01:03:50,552
slick, cultured.

878
01:03:50,627 --> 01:03:53,401
I can see he impressed you!

879
01:03:53,478 --> 01:03:54,792
Why do you say that?

880
01:03:54,869 --> 01:03:59,491
I like guys who are honest,
ones with only one name.

881
01:03:59,561 --> 01:04:06,541
Henri for me, Lucien for you,
DesirÃ©e for whom?

882
01:04:06,617 --> 01:04:08,383
If he was a perfume?

883
01:04:08,459 --> 01:04:09,489
A potpourri.

884
01:04:09,571 --> 01:04:11,929
Brilliant!

885
01:04:17,704 --> 01:04:20,727
If he was a famous personality?

886
01:04:20,797 --> 01:04:23,713
Casanova, Pasqua, Jekyll.

887
01:04:23,788 --> 01:04:25,694
Hyde!

888
01:04:36,579 --> 01:04:38,380
So...?

889
01:04:43,356 --> 01:04:44,884
What happened,
Sarah stood you up?

890
01:04:44,954 --> 01:04:46,341
I wish she had!

891
01:04:46,414 --> 01:04:48,916
Did you get into a fight?

892
01:04:48,987 --> 01:04:53,573
There were 15 people
and she didn't talk to me once.

893
01:04:53,645 --> 01:04:55,896
She loves the other woman.

894
01:04:55,974 --> 01:05:00,382
I'm sick of admiring her,
it's the only thing I'm good at.

895
01:05:00,458 --> 01:05:02,472
Forget it, Claude.

896
01:05:02,542 --> 01:05:05,043
Things you expect
too much from never happen.

897
01:05:05,115 --> 01:05:07,330
You'll find love the day
you stop thinking about it.

898
01:05:07,409 --> 01:05:09,104
Maybe it'll be a man this time.

899
01:05:09,182 --> 01:05:11,812
So he'll get me pregnant
and then run away.

900
01:05:27,917 --> 01:05:30,619
Okay, once more.

901
01:05:39,699 --> 01:05:44,179
Oh, how his words
have darkened my mood.

902
01:05:44,252 --> 01:05:49,288
For my hymen Achilles
changed his mind.

903
01:05:49,362 --> 01:05:52,762
I'm dishonored,
I have to go return.

904
01:05:52,836 --> 01:05:55,894
Are you looking for
someone other than Calchas?

905
01:05:55,966 --> 01:05:58,917
Madame, I do not
understand your words.

906
01:05:58,989 --> 01:06:02,735
Corinne, what is this movement
back and forth at the end?

907
01:06:02,814 --> 01:06:08,016
You told me to use agitation to
contrast Iphigenia's immobility.

908
01:06:08,096 --> 01:06:09,790
There's no agitation
in your movement.

909
01:06:09,869 --> 01:06:13,933
That was an arbitrary movement
and it doesn't make sense.

910
01:06:14,006 --> 01:06:16,400
Do it again.

911
01:06:16,472 --> 01:06:18,974
Madame, I do not
understand your words.

912
01:06:19,045 --> 01:06:23,940
No, say it in a way
that makes sense.

913
01:06:24,015 --> 01:06:29,052
Madame, I do not
understand your words.

914
01:06:29,124 --> 01:06:30,854
Go on.

915
01:06:30,932 --> 01:06:34,855
You will, if you just listen.

916
01:06:34,929 --> 01:06:40,001
Cruel fate has rid me
of a husband;

917
01:06:40,073 --> 01:06:44,103
Madame, will you leave me
in my misery?

918
01:06:44,175 --> 01:06:47,291
Without me, you could not
stay in Mycene.

919
01:06:47,372 --> 01:06:51,296
Shall the Queen and I
depart without you?

920
01:06:51,369 --> 01:06:53,172
I wanted to see Calchas
before I leave.

921
01:06:53,248 --> 01:06:55,676
Why do you hesitate
to send him word?

922
01:06:55,750 --> 01:06:57,929
In a moment from Argos
you shall leave.

923
01:06:58,009 --> 01:07:00,509
A moment sometimes
clarifies all doubts.

924
01:07:00,581 --> 01:07:04,646
Yet, Madame, I see,
I'm pressing you too hard.

925
01:07:04,718 --> 01:07:07,076
I see what I always
refused to think.

926
01:07:07,150 --> 01:07:09,224
Achilles...

927
01:07:09,305 --> 01:07:12,885
You cannot wait to see me gone.

928
01:07:12,954 --> 01:07:18,265
You suspect me of such vileness?

929
01:07:18,342 --> 01:07:20,250
To love so furious a victor,

930
01:07:20,322 --> 01:07:25,597
who, bloodstained,
comes before me,

931
01:07:25,676 --> 01:07:29,184
torch in hand
and lusting for more killing,

932
01:07:29,256 --> 01:07:31,128
having reduced Lesbos
to cinders...

933
01:07:31,203 --> 01:07:32,826
Yes, you love him

934
01:07:32,906 --> 01:07:38,571
Corinne,
what did I tell you last time?

935
01:07:38,641 --> 01:07:41,664
To physically feel it.

936
01:07:41,735 --> 01:07:44,328
Is that why you act
so furiously?

937
01:07:44,410 --> 01:07:49,269
No, for me, Eriphilia
is defending herself.

938
01:07:49,346 --> 01:07:51,288
That's what you do all the time,

939
01:07:51,362 --> 01:07:52,820
defend yourself.

940
01:07:52,892 --> 01:07:58,378
Yelling, but one
can't hear a thing.

941
01:07:58,454 --> 01:08:03,135
Like at the flea market.

942
01:08:03,215 --> 01:08:06,723
If I'm that bad, there's
no point in wasting your time.

943
01:08:06,795 --> 01:08:08,941
You're wasting your time,
not me.

944
01:08:09,020 --> 01:08:11,236
Stay here, listen.

945
01:08:11,313 --> 01:08:15,128
Corrine, listen to me.

946
01:08:15,205 --> 01:08:17,777
You only think about yourself,

947
01:08:17,848 --> 01:08:20,869
you don't trust the poetry,

948
01:08:20,941 --> 01:08:23,371
you don't work on your diction.

949
01:08:23,443 --> 01:08:29,452
Make up your mind, is it
the emotion or the diction?

950
01:08:29,527 --> 01:08:31,079
What do you want?

951
01:08:31,161 --> 01:08:35,285
I want everything.

952
01:08:35,366 --> 01:08:38,318
Look at Lucia here,
it's her first year.

953
01:08:38,389 --> 01:08:41,720
She's audible,
the feelings are clear,

954
01:08:41,797 --> 01:08:44,332
she's not being melodramatic.

955
01:08:44,403 --> 01:08:49,155
You try to score with your
tyranny, and you think it works.

956
01:08:49,235 --> 01:08:54,436
No, I know it's bad.

957
01:08:54,518 --> 01:08:59,968
It's getting worse every day.

958
01:09:00,044 --> 01:09:06,053
Last year, I felt your
indications were clear.

959
01:09:06,127 --> 01:09:12,336
For the past six months,
I have not understood.

960
01:09:12,419 --> 01:09:16,721
I'm not making any progress
and I don't know where I am.

961
01:09:16,798 --> 01:09:24,050
You're only worried about
protecting your self esteem.

962
01:09:24,132 --> 01:09:30,519
Leave all your petty fears
in the dressing room.

963
01:09:30,597 --> 01:09:34,377
That's all I want.

964
01:09:34,454 --> 01:09:36,706
Thank you...

965
01:09:39,738 --> 01:09:42,025
for the dressing room...

966
01:10:09,838 --> 01:10:14,840
Do you think
I was too hard on her?

967
01:10:14,912 --> 01:10:18,349
No?

968
01:10:18,423 --> 01:10:22,797
If she didn't get it now,
she'll never get it.

969
01:10:30,206 --> 01:10:35,243
Jeanne is with her
at the cafe next door.

970
01:10:35,316 --> 01:10:38,990
She had emotion,
that's all that counts.

971
01:10:43,657 --> 01:10:49,772
You have to deal
with destruction, all the time.

972
01:10:49,846 --> 01:10:57,846
You must have destruction
and doubts in order to rebuild,

973
01:10:58,466 --> 01:11:02,874
create, invent.

974
01:11:02,949 --> 01:11:10,759
Destruction and doubt,
that's what I have to teach you.

975
01:11:15,566 --> 01:11:16,574
How is she?

976
01:11:16,643 --> 01:11:20,637
She wants to be alone.

977
01:11:20,710 --> 01:11:23,803
I don't think she's coming back.

978
01:11:37,845 --> 01:11:41,484
Why did you ask me to come?

979
01:11:41,565 --> 01:11:44,030
I want to show you Paris.

980
01:11:44,103 --> 01:11:45,904
But I know Paris.

981
01:11:45,979 --> 01:11:48,196
You think you know,
just like all the others.

982
01:11:48,274 --> 01:11:51,426
But I'm not like all the others.

983
01:11:53,522 --> 01:11:54,979
What do you see?

984
01:11:55,051 --> 01:11:56,994
Nothing much.

985
01:11:57,068 --> 01:11:59,841
Roofs, not even
the Eiffel Tower.

986
01:11:59,918 --> 01:12:01,753
And?

987
01:12:01,829 --> 01:12:03,380
And what?

988
01:12:03,463 --> 01:12:05,749
What's under the roofs?

989
01:12:05,826 --> 01:12:07,213
I don't know.

990
01:12:07,287 --> 01:12:09,266
People...

991
01:12:09,337 --> 01:12:11,103
Yes, people.

992
01:12:11,180 --> 01:12:15,373
Lives crossing
till the end of time.

993
01:12:15,455 --> 01:12:16,628
And beneath that?

994
01:12:16,706 --> 01:12:22,371
The subway, sewers, catacombs.

995
01:12:22,440 --> 01:12:24,348
Why are you asking?

996
01:12:24,422 --> 01:12:28,096
Are you part of a network?

997
01:12:28,176 --> 01:12:30,155
You might call it that.

998
01:12:30,227 --> 01:12:33,106
What, a gang, a group?

999
01:12:33,180 --> 01:12:36,617
Not at all, just the opposite.

1000
01:12:36,692 --> 01:12:38,635
What then?

1001
01:12:38,708 --> 01:12:42,700
Brothers in Arms, the Fifteen?

1002
01:12:42,774 --> 01:12:45,546
Fifteen or twenty,
not much more.

1003
01:12:45,624 --> 01:12:47,567
What do you do?

1004
01:12:47,639 --> 01:12:50,757
Is CÃ©cile part of it?

1005
01:12:50,838 --> 01:12:55,661
Not her, but a person she knows.

1006
01:12:55,739 --> 01:12:59,105
People you ought
to stay away from.

1007
01:12:59,180 --> 01:13:01,775
You mean her boyfriend?

1008
01:13:01,856 --> 01:13:06,715
I don't know his name,
I've never even seen him.

1009
01:13:06,792 --> 01:13:10,158
Maybe it's better that way.

1010
01:13:10,234 --> 01:13:17,071
Why, is he dangerous?

1011
01:13:17,150 --> 01:13:21,002
Mostly to himself
and his friends.

1012
01:13:21,078 --> 01:13:23,649
And for CÃ©cile?

1013
01:13:23,719 --> 01:13:26,457
Maybe.

1014
01:13:26,535 --> 01:13:28,929
Do you know Frenhofer?

1015
01:13:29,003 --> 01:13:30,982
One of your gang?

1016
01:13:31,053 --> 01:13:36,742
Not at all, he's a painter.

1017
01:13:36,823 --> 01:13:41,504
A great painter,
from around 300 years ago.

1018
01:13:41,585 --> 01:13:44,287
The unknown master of "Poussin".

1019
01:13:44,366 --> 01:13:46,132
His most famous work
is "La Belle Noiseuse".

1020
01:13:46,208 --> 01:13:48,009
La Belle what?

1021
01:13:48,085 --> 01:13:51,036
Noiseuse.

1022
01:13:51,109 --> 01:13:55,755
It means a woman
who likes to quarrel.

1023
01:13:55,836 --> 01:14:03,551
It was painted more than
a century ago, around 1830.

1024
01:14:03,622 --> 01:14:08,588
We mainly know it through
old descriptions and a print,

1025
01:14:08,661 --> 01:14:12,169
maybe not very accurate.

1026
01:14:12,242 --> 01:14:16,200
The painting reappeared
in Johannesburg, Tokyo,

1027
01:14:16,273 --> 01:14:19,011
and London a few years ago.

1028
01:14:19,089 --> 01:14:22,668
It was last seen in Sydney.

1029
01:14:22,738 --> 01:14:26,245
Funny, how a painting can travel
these days, isn't it?

1030
01:14:26,318 --> 01:14:29,020
It makes me dream.

1031
01:14:29,100 --> 01:14:31,943
What does it have to do with me?

1032
01:14:32,018 --> 01:14:34,092
With you, nothing,

1033
01:14:34,174 --> 01:14:39,969
but with CÃ©cile,
or rather her boyfriend.

1034
01:14:40,048 --> 01:14:43,378
Wait, I don't understand.

1035
01:14:43,454 --> 01:14:48,171
Do you rob paintings,
like ArsÃ¨ne Lupin?

1036
01:14:48,251 --> 01:14:51,095
No.

1037
01:14:51,170 --> 01:14:56,408
We are trying to find works
of art that have been stolen.

1038
01:14:56,488 --> 01:15:02,212
I've been tracking
"La Belle Noiseuse" for months,

1039
01:15:02,293 --> 01:15:07,816
I work with Antoine,
CÃ©cile's boyfriend.

1040
01:15:07,889 --> 01:15:10,841
I didn't know these
kind of things really exist!

1041
01:15:10,913 --> 01:15:12,572
It's crazy!

1042
01:15:12,651 --> 01:15:17,332
Crazy and dangerous.

1043
01:15:17,413 --> 01:15:19,522
Did you know
that art trafficking

1044
01:15:19,602 --> 01:15:22,968
is almost as lucrative
as drug-trafficking?

1045
01:15:23,044 --> 01:15:26,516
I won't tell you the estimated
price of a Frenhofer.

1046
01:15:26,589 --> 01:15:31,412
Well, CÃ©cile's friend
seems to know where it is.

1047
01:15:31,490 --> 01:15:33,505
That's great!

1048
01:15:33,576 --> 01:15:37,391
Yes, but there's a problem.

1049
01:15:37,468 --> 01:15:41,320
He's trying to negotiate
with collectors and the robbers,

1050
01:15:41,396 --> 01:15:45,425
which is a very dangerous game.

1051
01:15:45,497 --> 01:15:49,727
I want to make sure
he understands that.

1052
01:15:49,807 --> 01:15:52,237
I could talk to him,
or actually CÃ©cile.

1053
01:15:52,310 --> 01:15:55,533
No, don't, it's my problem.

1054
01:15:59,470 --> 01:16:06,629
This is a secret, Claude,
can you keep a secret?

1055
01:16:06,700 --> 01:16:08,607
I think so.

1056
01:16:08,681 --> 01:16:09,960
What's wrong?

1057
01:16:10,036 --> 01:16:11,174
I don't know.

1058
01:16:11,253 --> 01:16:14,760
I have to go, I feel strange.

1059
01:16:14,833 --> 01:16:16,184
Will I see you again?

1060
01:16:16,258 --> 01:16:19,375
Maybe, but I don't know
how I can help.

1061
01:16:19,456 --> 01:16:20,250
You never know.

1062
01:16:20,325 --> 01:16:21,463
No, don't.

1063
01:16:21,542 --> 01:16:24,042
I have to go now.

1064
01:17:23,897 --> 01:17:26,527
Hey, you scared me!

1065
01:17:26,608 --> 01:17:28,931
You can't play with ghosts,
you know!

1066
01:17:29,006 --> 01:17:33,521
There are no ghosts,
only hungry rats.

1067
01:17:33,595 --> 01:17:35,467
Listen...

1068
01:17:35,541 --> 01:17:40,779
it's an ancient dance,
it's a Polish folk dance

1069
01:17:40,859 --> 01:17:42,909
When was this house built?

1070
01:17:42,980 --> 01:17:44,331
I don't know.

1071
01:17:44,405 --> 01:17:45,980
Maybe during the reign
of Louis Phillipe.

1072
01:17:46,004 --> 01:17:47,734
I'm not good at French history.

1073
01:17:47,811 --> 01:17:49,198
Is that 19th century?

1074
01:17:49,271 --> 01:17:53,371
I don't know,
I only know I want to sleep.

1075
01:17:53,442 --> 01:17:56,179
You can sleep in my room.

1076
01:17:56,257 --> 01:17:58,023
I'll stay here, don't worry.

1077
01:17:58,099 --> 01:17:59,129
I'm not worried.

1078
01:17:59,212 --> 01:18:00,669
Why do you think I'm scared?

1079
01:18:00,741 --> 01:18:06,500
I'm not scared at all,
I'm just upset, really upset.

1080
01:18:41,825 --> 01:18:49,825
One, two, three, four...

1081
01:18:49,924 --> 01:18:57,924
The night, the moon,
take your shoes off.

1082
01:18:58,370 --> 01:19:04,378
The night and the moon,
stop dancing.

1083
01:19:04,452 --> 01:19:10,639
The night, the moon,
take your shoes off.

1084
01:19:10,709 --> 01:19:13,932
The night and the moon,
stop dancing.

1085
01:19:14,011 --> 01:19:18,111
The night, the moon,
take your shoes off.

1086
01:19:18,182 --> 01:19:20,576
The night and the moon,
stop dancing.

1087
01:19:20,650 --> 01:19:23,529
The night, the moon,
take your shoes off.

1088
01:19:23,604 --> 01:19:25,713
The night and the moon,
stop dancing.

1089
01:19:25,793 --> 01:19:28,673
The night, the moon,
take your shoes off.

1090
01:19:28,749 --> 01:19:31,557
The night and the moon,
stop dancing.

1091
01:20:10,353 --> 01:20:13,576
The night, the moon,
take your shoes off.

1092
01:20:13,655 --> 01:20:16,878
The night and the moon,
stop dancing.

1093
01:20:16,958 --> 01:20:21,058
The night, the moon,
take your shoes off.

1094
01:20:21,129 --> 01:20:24,423
The night and the moon,
stop dancing.

1095
01:20:24,501 --> 01:20:28,080
The night, the moon,
take your shoes off.

1096
01:20:28,150 --> 01:20:30,852
The night and the moon, stop

1097
01:22:29,073 --> 01:22:34,145
I made you swear
not to see me again.

1098
01:22:34,217 --> 01:22:38,211
My Lord, your duty
surprises my presence

1099
01:22:38,284 --> 01:22:41,306
and what once filled my heart
with joy...

1100
01:22:41,378 --> 01:22:45,478
"My Lord, your presence
surprises my duty."

1101
01:22:45,549 --> 01:22:48,216
And it's your absence that
surprises me.

1102
01:22:50,727 --> 01:22:54,329
Once your dream or nightmare
has ended,

1103
01:22:54,412 --> 01:22:57,813
you will act this scene again
in the next few days.

1104
01:23:00,112 --> 01:23:02,647
Sophie, Marina, your turn.

1105
01:23:20,446 --> 01:23:23,432
We changed something,
you will see.

1106
01:23:25,728 --> 01:23:30,551
What, that lovely maiden name
is a title, dear sister,

1107
01:23:30,629 --> 01:23:33,852
the sweet charm of which you
wish to abandon.

1108
01:23:33,932 --> 01:23:37,190
And to getting married,
dare you look forward?

1109
01:23:37,268 --> 01:23:39,519
This vulgar plan can make proud?

1110
01:23:39,597 --> 01:23:41,019
Yes, my sister.

1111
01:23:41,092 --> 01:23:42,680
Ah, this "yes" have I to suffer?

1112
01:23:42,760 --> 01:23:45,260
And no aching heart
shall I feel?

1113
01:23:45,332 --> 01:23:48,520
Well, what is it in marriage,
my sister, that...

1114
01:23:48,600 --> 01:23:51,064
Oh, for heaven's sake, forbear!

1115
01:23:51,137 --> 01:23:52,666
How?

1116
01:23:52,735 --> 01:23:54,228
Oh, forbear, I pray you!

1117
01:23:57,150 --> 01:23:59,923
Can't you see that the mere
sound of this word

1118
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:03,959
is an offense to the spirit?

1119
01:24:04,033 --> 01:24:06,947
That evil image it conjures up,

1120
01:24:07,021 --> 01:24:09,865
and on wicked roads
it leads the mind?

1121
01:24:09,941 --> 01:24:11,956
Does it not make you shudder?

1122
01:24:12,027 --> 01:24:13,270
And can you, my sister,

1123
01:24:13,347 --> 01:24:15,457
convince your heart to suffer
all the word entails?

1124
01:26:22,889 --> 01:26:27,227
I prepared the scene
with Claude Fayard, but...

1125
01:26:27,303 --> 01:26:29,874
Pauline, what's wrong?

1126
01:26:33,387 --> 01:26:35,602
Claude called in sick.

1127
01:26:35,681 --> 01:26:37,481
And CÃ©cile...

1128
01:26:37,557 --> 01:26:39,774
Yes, I know.

1129
01:26:41,416 --> 01:26:43,950
Who worked on Flaminia?

1130
01:26:44,023 --> 01:26:45,266
I did.

1131
01:26:45,344 --> 01:26:48,461
Okay, so give Lucia the lines.

1132
01:26:59,074 --> 01:27:01,811
My dear,
while I look for Arlequin,

1133
01:27:01,887 --> 01:27:03,647
who may have stayed a bit
too long at dinner,

1134
01:27:03,696 --> 01:27:05,460
why don't you try this dress?

1135
01:27:05,537 --> 01:27:07,481
He can't wait to see you.

1136
01:27:07,553 --> 01:27:15,056
Here. It will fit me,
but I'd rather not take it.

1137
01:27:15,131 --> 01:27:18,117
The Prince wants me in exchange.

1138
01:27:18,190 --> 01:27:19,397
You're mistaken.

1139
01:27:19,475 --> 01:27:22,107
Even if he left you,
everything would be yours.

1140
01:27:22,186 --> 01:27:24,615
Really, you don't know him.

1141
01:27:24,689 --> 01:27:27,841
If you say so...

1142
01:27:27,921 --> 01:27:29,830
I hope he doesn't ask me
afterwards,

1143
01:27:29,903 --> 01:27:32,498
"Why did you take my gifts?"

1144
01:27:32,580 --> 01:27:36,917
He'll ask you,
"Why didn't you take more?"

1145
01:27:36,993 --> 01:27:38,901
Very well.

1146
01:27:38,975 --> 01:27:41,025
I'll take everything.

1147
01:27:41,095 --> 01:27:43,240
That way, he won't blame me.

1148
01:27:43,320 --> 01:27:46,792
Go right ahead!
I'll answer for it.

1149
01:27:52,358 --> 01:27:54,408
What are you looking at?

1150
01:28:05,460 --> 01:28:09,584
Stay like that.

1151
01:28:09,666 --> 01:28:12,201
You look like
"la Belle Noiseuse".

1152
01:28:12,273 --> 01:28:14,075
Because I'm under the blanket?

1153
01:28:19,990 --> 01:28:23,982
Because it's the most beautiful
foot in the history of painting.

1154
01:28:26,837 --> 01:28:28,673
Well, I'm thirsty.

1155
01:28:52,593 --> 01:28:54,428
What would you like to drink?

1156
01:28:54,503 --> 01:28:56,031
Carrot juice.

1157
01:28:58,501 --> 01:29:02,044
It's in the fridge
in the kitchen.

1158
01:30:40,517 --> 01:30:42,247
Damn it.

1159
01:31:22,642 --> 01:31:25,237
It took you quite a while.

1160
01:31:25,320 --> 01:31:28,684
I couldn't find what I was
looking for.

1161
01:31:28,761 --> 01:31:30,526
Your beautiful

1162
01:31:30,603 --> 01:31:32,297
What?

1163
01:31:32,375 --> 01:31:34,947
Your beautiful
I-don't-know-what.

1164
01:31:35,017 --> 01:31:37,233
I found her, my beautiful
I-don't-know-what.

1165
01:31:37,312 --> 01:31:38,449
And who is it?

1166
01:31:38,527 --> 01:31:40,958
It's you, my beautiful
I-don't-know-what.

1167
01:31:53,160 --> 01:31:58,162
Any idea what time it is?

1168
01:31:58,235 --> 01:32:01,352
Looking at the sun, about five.

1169
01:32:01,432 --> 01:32:04,241
Then you have to leave,
the girls will be back soon.

1170
01:32:08,350 --> 01:32:10,257
You don't want me
to meet your friends?

1171
01:32:10,331 --> 01:32:13,034
It's not that, but still,
you should leave.

1172
01:32:29,864 --> 01:32:33,195
But Madam, listen to me.

1173
01:32:33,272 --> 01:32:34,965
You're bothering me.

1174
01:32:54,613 --> 01:32:56,591
I'll call you.

1175
01:33:28,814 --> 01:33:30,794
Here's the cake.

1176
01:33:32,082 --> 01:33:34,653
For someone who's sick,
you look pretty good!

1177
01:33:34,724 --> 01:33:38,160
Bug off.

1178
01:33:38,234 --> 01:33:39,821
Move over.

1179
01:33:41,606 --> 01:33:43,821
You don't know anything.

1180
01:33:55,509 --> 01:33:57,417
Well done, isn't it?

1181
01:33:57,491 --> 01:33:59,327
Who needs a spoon?

1182
01:33:59,403 --> 01:34:00,954
And where are the candles?

1183
01:34:01,036 --> 01:34:02,942
No candles.

1184
01:34:03,017 --> 01:34:04,154
Oh no?

1185
01:34:05,693 --> 01:34:07,673
I'll get it.

1186
01:34:13,964 --> 01:34:16,429
Anna, it's for you.

1187
01:34:21,334 --> 01:34:22,992
Me!

1188
01:34:25,052 --> 01:34:27,967
Do you know the story
of the big mouth frog?

1189
01:34:28,042 --> 01:34:31,100
Sure: what's your name, yaaaa?

1190
01:34:31,171 --> 01:34:33,872
What are you eating, yaaa?

1191
01:34:33,952 --> 01:34:35,231
Did Raphaelle tell it to you?

1192
01:34:35,306 --> 01:34:37,036
She told it to everybody.

1193
01:34:37,114 --> 01:34:38,987
And the one about logic,
you know it?

1194
01:34:39,060 --> 01:34:39,997
No.

1195
01:34:40,069 --> 01:34:42,427
A guy meets a friend he hasn't
seen for a long time.

1196
01:34:42,501 --> 01:34:43,741
He asks, "What are you in now?"

1197
01:34:43,787 --> 01:34:45,188
- I'm in logic.
- What's that, logic?

1198
01:34:45,212 --> 01:34:47,121
I'll explain it to you.

1199
01:34:47,194 --> 01:34:48,722
Do you have an aquarium at home?

1200
01:34:48,794 --> 01:34:50,145
Yes.

1201
01:34:50,219 --> 01:34:53,762
So, it's only logical you also
have water in the aquarium.

1202
01:34:53,832 --> 01:34:55,420
Sure.

1203
01:34:55,501 --> 01:34:57,231
If you have an aquarium filled
with water,

1204
01:34:57,310 --> 01:35:00,851
logically, you must have fish.

1205
01:35:00,924 --> 01:35:02,476
Of course.

1206
01:35:02,557 --> 01:35:05,887
If you have fish,
logically you must feed them...

1207
01:35:05,964 --> 01:35:08,215
I miss you, too.

1208
01:35:08,291 --> 01:35:10,615
Yeah, of course.

1209
01:35:10,690 --> 01:35:16,355
If you feed them, logically, you
must like animals.

1210
01:35:16,425 --> 01:35:19,163
Yeah, I like animals...

1211
01:35:19,242 --> 01:35:21,944
Oh, that's great.
At the end of the month?

1212
01:35:24,280 --> 01:35:26,461
You're coming
at the end of the month?

1213
01:35:26,540 --> 01:35:29,492
Well, yes, I am
tender and communicative.

1214
01:35:29,564 --> 01:35:32,895
Okay, if you are tender and
communicative,

1215
01:35:32,970 --> 01:35:37,687
I can then deduce logically,
you must love a woman,

1216
01:35:37,766 --> 01:35:39,760
and you must like spending
a quiet evening with her

1217
01:35:39,784 --> 01:35:41,928
at your place.

1218
01:35:42,007 --> 01:35:44,117
Yes, I like that.

1219
01:35:44,197 --> 01:35:46,412
So, you see,
starting with an aquarium,

1220
01:35:46,490 --> 01:35:47,949
logic allows me to deduce

1221
01:35:48,021 --> 01:35:50,414
that you like being
with a woman.

1222
01:35:50,488 --> 01:35:52,396
Ciao. Te voglio, belle.

1223
01:35:52,470 --> 01:35:55,278
- That's brilliant!
- It is.

1224
01:35:55,354 --> 01:35:56,906
- Good bye.
- Good bye.

1225
01:35:56,988 --> 01:35:58,516
The next day,
he meets another friend.

1226
01:35:58,588 --> 01:36:01,017
He says: I met Jean yesterday,
and he's in logic.

1227
01:36:01,089 --> 01:36:04,040
- What's that?
- Let me explain.

1228
01:36:04,114 --> 01:36:07,514
I'll give you an example.
Do you have an aquarium?

1229
01:36:07,589 --> 01:36:08,975
No.

1230
01:36:09,048 --> 01:36:13,802
Oh, no... I didn't know
you were one of them.

1231
01:36:13,881 --> 01:36:16,096
You didn't get it?

1232
01:36:16,175 --> 01:36:18,154
No.

1233
01:36:18,225 --> 01:36:19,884
Never mind.

1234
01:36:19,963 --> 01:36:22,462
Have a drink.

1235
01:36:25,316 --> 01:36:27,460
What about your dancer?

1236
01:36:27,540 --> 01:36:29,864
He'll be here by the end
of the month for a week.

1237
01:36:29,939 --> 01:36:32,013
That's great, Anna!

1238
01:36:32,092 --> 01:36:35,672
If you go again to
the Prince of Wales Hotel,

1239
01:36:35,743 --> 01:36:38,374
bring us some towels,
the big ones.

1240
01:36:38,454 --> 01:36:40,741
Didn't I have a piece of cake?

1241
01:36:40,816 --> 01:36:42,832
Yes, and it's not bad at all.

1242
01:36:42,904 --> 01:36:46,019
Great Tintin cake.

1243
01:36:46,101 --> 01:36:47,796
Ta-tin!

1244
01:36:51,558 --> 01:36:53,465
Did you invite anybody?

1245
01:36:53,539 --> 01:36:54,606
No.

1246
01:36:56,842 --> 01:36:58,395
I'll go.

1247
01:36:58,475 --> 01:37:00,205
Me too.

1248
01:37:01,603 --> 01:37:04,068
CÃ©cile, I thought
you had left Paris.

1249
01:37:04,142 --> 01:37:05,799
You're freezing.

1250
01:37:07,791 --> 01:37:09,069
I walked.

1251
01:37:10,154 --> 01:37:11,812
Have some St-Amour.

1252
01:37:11,891 --> 01:37:14,036
And a piece of cake.

1253
01:37:16,271 --> 01:37:18,415
Here, sit down.

1254
01:37:19,712 --> 01:37:21,135
Cake.

1255
01:37:21,207 --> 01:37:22,522
Wine.

1256
01:37:22,597 --> 01:37:24,671
Take off your coat.

1257
01:37:24,753 --> 01:37:26,553
Not now, I'm cold.

1258
01:37:26,629 --> 01:37:28,287
How was your vacation?

1259
01:37:28,367 --> 01:37:31,033
It's so good to see you...
oh, sorry.

1260
01:37:33,407 --> 01:37:35,978
I'm disturbing you, huh?

1261
01:37:36,049 --> 01:37:38,644
No, not at all.

1262
01:37:38,724 --> 01:37:41,463
I'm not very well.

1263
01:37:41,541 --> 01:37:43,341
I need to talk.

1264
01:37:43,417 --> 01:37:44,910
I don't have many friends.

1265
01:37:44,982 --> 01:37:46,474
What are you talking about?

1266
01:37:46,545 --> 01:37:48,240
This is my third birthday
in this house.

1267
01:37:48,318 --> 01:37:49,811
Of course,
you must party with us.

1268
01:37:49,882 --> 01:37:51,754
I didn't know you were in Paris.

1269
01:37:51,829 --> 01:37:54,744
Tell her the story
about the logic.

1270
01:37:54,818 --> 01:37:58,492
Why don't you tell her the one
about the frog?

1271
01:37:58,572 --> 01:38:01,239
CÃ©cile, do you know the story
about the big mouth frog?

1272
01:38:01,319 --> 01:38:03,189
No.

1273
01:38:03,263 --> 01:38:07,850
It's about a frog taking a walk
in the forest.

1274
01:38:07,921 --> 01:38:09,864
I'm sorry.

1275
01:38:13,936 --> 01:38:18,485
I can't stay,
I can't talk to you.

1276
01:38:18,559 --> 01:38:21,093
It's not you,
it's nobody's fault.

1277
01:38:21,164 --> 01:38:23,795
It's me.

1278
01:38:30,097 --> 01:38:32,384
CÃ©cile!

1279
01:38:33,503 --> 01:38:37,011
CÃ©cile! Wait!

1280
01:39:03,222 --> 01:39:06,658
Mr. Lucas, can you confirm
the accusations

1281
01:39:06,733 --> 01:39:08,877
appearing in today's paper?

1282
01:39:08,956 --> 01:39:10,936
That's what I said, yes.

1283
01:39:11,007 --> 01:39:15,416
Judge Bertrand
is suing you for libel.

1284
01:39:15,491 --> 01:39:16,913
What do you say?

1285
01:39:16,987 --> 01:39:19,415
Nothing. We'll see.

1286
01:39:21,713 --> 01:39:25,186
Do you think that
a gangster's word

1287
01:39:25,258 --> 01:39:27,166
is as trustworthy as a cop's?

1288
01:39:27,240 --> 01:39:29,977
I think the truth always
comes out in the end.

1289
01:39:30,055 --> 01:39:32,827
- Was it something we said?
- Shut up!

1290
01:39:35,721 --> 01:39:37,035
It's him.

1291
01:39:37,110 --> 01:39:39,883
Who?

1292
01:39:39,960 --> 01:39:41,975
Antoine Lucas,
CÃ©cile's boyfriend.

1293
01:39:42,046 --> 01:39:44,120
I saw him with her at the cafÃ©.

1294
01:39:45,904 --> 01:39:48,440
Antoine Lucas was involved in
the Bertrand affair,

1295
01:39:48,512 --> 01:39:50,063
three years ago,

1296
01:39:50,145 --> 01:39:52,206
when Judge Bertrand was
suspected of abusing his rights

1297
01:39:52,230 --> 01:39:54,590
to the advantage of
a prostitution ring in Lyon.

1298
01:39:54,664 --> 01:39:56,691
Today, Lucas was brought
before the court in Versailles,

1299
01:39:56,715 --> 01:39:59,488
accused of a hold-up and
complicity in a murder.

1300
01:39:59,564 --> 01:40:02,658
A trial seems
to be imminent... Josiane?

1301
01:40:02,728 --> 01:40:06,542
Anyway, it has no connection
with the Bertrand affair

1302
01:40:06,622 --> 01:40:09,324
and would probably
go unnoticed by the media

1303
01:40:09,402 --> 01:40:12,554
if not for the accused,

1304
01:40:12,634 --> 01:40:15,169
and the charge
rigorously rejected

1305
01:40:15,240 --> 01:40:19,792
by the defense who claims
they are being set up.

1306
01:40:19,863 --> 01:40:22,043
So, this case
is headed for trial.

1307
01:40:22,122 --> 01:40:23,852
In other news today...

1308
01:40:25,529 --> 01:40:29,832
- You hear what I hear?
- Yeah, poor CÃ©cile.

1309
01:40:29,908 --> 01:40:32,338
I'm not talking about CÃ©cile.

1310
01:40:32,412 --> 01:40:34,663
- I'm talking about Henri.
- Henri?

1311
01:40:34,739 --> 01:40:38,069
Henri, Thomas, Lucien, Raymond.
I don't care what his name is.

1312
01:40:38,147 --> 01:40:41,725
The guy who's been telling us
stories about CÃ©cile for weeks.

1313
01:40:45,758 --> 01:40:48,117
Well, you know what?

1314
01:40:48,192 --> 01:40:52,670
He knows about her boyfriend.

1315
01:40:52,745 --> 01:40:55,411
- So, he's a cop?
- Or a gangster.

1316
01:40:55,490 --> 01:40:57,884
They're the same to me.

1317
01:40:57,958 --> 01:40:59,545
Which guy?

1318
01:40:59,627 --> 01:41:00,836
A strange guy,

1319
01:41:00,912 --> 01:41:02,819
trying to flirt while talking
about CÃ©cile.

1320
01:41:02,894 --> 01:41:04,873
Wait, what does he look like?

1321
01:41:04,944 --> 01:41:06,674
Not bad, blue eyes.

1322
01:41:06,752 --> 01:41:09,561
A face, y'know? Why?

1323
01:41:09,636 --> 01:41:12,137
Just asking.

1324
01:41:12,208 --> 01:41:14,258
Is there any wine left?

1325
01:41:43,700 --> 01:41:45,951
This is the last time
we're seeing each other.

1326
01:41:46,029 --> 01:41:47,580
Are you crazy?

1327
01:41:47,661 --> 01:41:49,641
You lied to me about everything.

1328
01:41:49,712 --> 01:41:52,735
Your name isn't even Thomas.

1329
01:41:52,805 --> 01:41:54,193
Stop it.

1330
01:41:55,865 --> 01:41:58,888
First of all, my name is Thomas.

1331
01:41:58,958 --> 01:42:01,553
- Second, yes, I lied.
- You admit it.

1332
01:42:01,636 --> 01:42:03,128
I lied to your friends.

1333
01:42:03,199 --> 01:42:04,928
I needed to see them.

1334
01:42:05,007 --> 01:42:06,180
They know.

1335
01:42:06,259 --> 01:42:10,631
Try to understand.
Don't be so selfish.

1336
01:42:10,707 --> 01:42:11,881
Third...

1337
01:42:11,959 --> 01:42:15,466
This is another trap.
I saw CÃ©cile's guy on TV.

1338
01:42:15,537 --> 01:42:16,995
So?

1339
01:42:17,067 --> 01:42:19,010
Did he tell
all about his life on TV?

1340
01:42:19,084 --> 01:42:22,685
He said that in the end,
the truth always comes out.

1341
01:42:22,768 --> 01:42:26,726
I hope for him he's wrong.

1342
01:42:26,800 --> 01:42:28,850
Can I say my third?

1343
01:42:31,666 --> 01:42:34,962
Hurry, I don't want the girls
to see us.

1344
01:42:38,340 --> 01:42:39,963
Third...

1345
01:42:40,043 --> 01:42:41,844
I love you.

1346
01:42:41,919 --> 01:42:47,086
Stop saying that, I would so
much like to believe you.

1347
01:42:47,168 --> 01:42:50,805
I'll say it again and again.

1348
01:42:53,735 --> 01:42:55,644
But I'm scared.

1349
01:43:03,503 --> 01:43:06,762
I don't care about your first
and your second.

1350
01:43:06,841 --> 01:43:09,271
Everything is true.

1351
01:43:24,810 --> 01:43:28,448
That's when, three days later...

1352
01:44:34,153 --> 01:44:37,175
I'm Judge Vaudeville.

1353
01:44:37,245 --> 01:44:39,260
The accused, please stand.

1354
01:44:39,332 --> 01:44:42,840
No, I will not stand in front of
a revengeful justice.

1355
01:44:42,913 --> 01:44:44,299
Your name?

1356
01:44:44,373 --> 01:44:46,350
You know my name.

1357
01:44:46,422 --> 01:44:47,881
Your first name?

1358
01:44:47,950 --> 01:44:49,574
You know it.

1359
01:44:49,656 --> 01:44:52,949
Counselor, is this what
you call a defense?

1360
01:44:56,260 --> 01:44:58,405
I ask for a calm debate.

1361
01:44:58,483 --> 01:45:02,856
Why don't you first ask your
defendant to calm down?

1362
01:45:23,371 --> 01:45:27,045
There's trouble for the one
who provokes the scandal.

1363
01:45:27,126 --> 01:45:29,200
There's even more trouble

1364
01:45:29,279 --> 01:45:31,743
for a low-life stepping out
of his boundaries.

1365
01:45:31,817 --> 01:45:38,904
Gentlemen of the jury,
they want to punish this man

1366
01:45:38,977 --> 01:45:42,413
not for what he has done
and for which there is no proof,

1367
01:45:42,487 --> 01:45:47,109
but for the Lyon affair
which you all remember,

1368
01:45:47,178 --> 01:45:52,383
and in which he was used
as a pawn.

1369
01:45:55,242 --> 01:45:59,344
Don't let them intimidate you.

1370
01:46:15,196 --> 01:46:20,885
I'm the general prosecutor,
Pincemoi Jereve.

1371
01:46:24,302 --> 01:46:30,761
This can't be true, it's an
unacceptable insult to justice.

1372
01:46:49,154 --> 01:46:51,369
Let the witnesses enter.

1373
01:47:05,872 --> 01:47:08,989
I'm the widow Ponsardin.

1374
01:47:09,069 --> 01:47:11,119
I live on the 36th floor.

1375
01:47:11,189 --> 01:47:15,704
I'm shortsighted, farsighted
and astigmatic,

1376
01:47:15,779 --> 01:47:18,931
but I saw everything
on this dark moonless night.

1377
01:47:19,010 --> 01:47:21,783
I definitely recognize
the accused.

1378
01:47:21,861 --> 01:47:24,704
He shot at the policemen.

1379
01:47:30,098 --> 01:47:32,943
You are Jean Cliquot's sister,

1380
01:47:33,018 --> 01:47:36,835
who is accused of having driven
through a roadblock.

1381
01:47:36,910 --> 01:47:40,691
That has nothing to do with it.

1382
01:47:40,769 --> 01:47:45,249
Admit that
you were offered a deal.

1383
01:47:51,232 --> 01:47:53,591
I'm detective Ragot.

1384
01:47:53,665 --> 01:47:59,815
This is an intolerable insult
to the honor of the police!

1385
01:47:59,887 --> 01:48:03,358
He shot at us, I'm sure of it,

1386
01:48:03,432 --> 01:48:06,096
even if the cartridges have
never been found.

1387
01:48:06,176 --> 01:48:09,198
The accused must have picked
them up before running away.

1388
01:48:11,286 --> 01:48:13,360
With his previous offenses,

1389
01:48:13,441 --> 01:48:15,978
you won't make me believe
he's a saint.

1390
01:48:22,756 --> 01:48:26,572
Will I be judged
by my previous offenses?

1391
01:48:26,650 --> 01:48:29,637
It's like holding your head
underwater.

1392
01:48:30,576 --> 01:48:33,245
In some lives, prior offenses
follow each other

1393
01:48:33,324 --> 01:48:35,895
without there ever
being any future.

1394
01:48:42,605 --> 01:48:44,890
You are not allowed to say that.

1395
01:48:44,968 --> 01:48:48,155
This is a fair trial
with a local jury,

1396
01:48:48,234 --> 01:48:50,592
beneath the objective eye
of the police,

1397
01:48:50,666 --> 01:48:52,740
who all want you in jail.

1398
01:48:52,823 --> 01:48:55,844
Plus, your hands aren't
really clean, my boy!

1399
01:49:00,470 --> 01:49:03,976
This is an attempt to disturb
the trial.

1400
01:49:04,050 --> 01:49:07,972
The accused has
always been impertinent.

1401
01:49:08,046 --> 01:49:10,333
His outrageous revelations
in the media

1402
01:49:10,411 --> 01:49:14,262
made certain eminent
personalities in justice,

1403
01:49:14,337 --> 01:49:18,960
police and state very nervous.

1404
01:49:19,030 --> 01:49:21,945
The scandal has nothing to do
with this case,

1405
01:49:22,019 --> 01:49:28,549
but it still justifies
a severe sentence.

1406
01:49:29,978 --> 01:49:33,901
I demand that you punish
this rebel, this delinquent,

1407
01:49:33,976 --> 01:49:38,041
this hoodlum,
with ten years in prison.

1408
01:49:44,960 --> 01:49:47,873
There was never any proof of
Antoine Lucas' involvement

1409
01:49:47,949 --> 01:49:51,006
in the shooting of Lagny.

1410
01:49:54,692 --> 01:49:58,200
You will have
to decide for the defendant,

1411
01:49:58,272 --> 01:50:00,108
if there's a reasonable doubt.

1412
01:50:00,183 --> 01:50:02,125
I ask you to find Antoine Lucas
not guilty.

1413
01:50:06,441 --> 01:50:08,027
<i>There are things hidden
behind things</i>

1414
01:50:08,109 --> 01:50:10,124
<i>behind fear, it's true or not</i>

1415
01:50:10,194 --> 01:50:12,138
<i>there are things hidden
behind things</i>

1416
01:50:12,211 --> 01:50:14,118
<i>behind doubt,
whether free or guilty</i>

1417
01:50:14,192 --> 01:50:17,866
<i>behind the doubt,
free or convicted</i>

1418
01:50:17,945 --> 01:50:20,196
<i>ah, ah yes, indeed</i>

1419
01:50:20,274 --> 01:50:22,145
<i>free or inmate for a long time</i>

1420
01:50:22,220 --> 01:50:23,842
<i>ah, ah yes, indeed</i>

1421
01:50:23,924 --> 01:50:25,903
<i>free or inmate for a long time</i>

1422
01:50:25,973 --> 01:50:27,739
<i>there are things hidden
behind things</i>

1423
01:50:27,817 --> 01:50:29,618
<i>endlessly, it's tiring</i>

1424
01:50:29,692 --> 01:50:31,980
<i>there are reasons
for things seeming wrong</i>

1425
01:50:32,055 --> 01:50:33,335
<i>never miss anything</i>

1426
01:50:33,413 --> 01:50:37,228
<i>when things seem wrong
you look for a cause</i>

1427
01:50:37,305 --> 01:50:41,334
<i>and the cause is the innocent</i>

1428
01:50:41,407 --> 01:50:43,101
<i>ah ah, yes, indeed</i>

1429
01:50:43,179 --> 01:50:45,430
<i>the innocent
make the best victims</i>

1430
01:50:45,509 --> 01:50:47,239
<i>ah ah, yes, indeed</i>

1431
01:50:47,315 --> 01:50:49,851
<i>the innocent
make the best victims</i>

1432
01:51:05,008 --> 01:51:08,231
Well, I see, all countries
seem to be alike.

1433
01:51:08,310 --> 01:51:11,853
- Even in your country?
- Oh, everywhere.

1434
01:51:11,924 --> 01:51:13,761
Ah, the news.

1435
01:51:19,815 --> 01:51:23,215
Antoine Lucas was sentenced
today to ten years in prison.

1436
01:51:23,290 --> 01:51:25,958
"This is not justice,
it's murder!" Lucas shouted,

1437
01:51:26,037 --> 01:51:30,160
when the sentence was announced.

1438
01:51:30,241 --> 01:51:32,564
Nobody knew who was meant.

1439
01:51:32,640 --> 01:51:35,105
In any case, the police
are rejoicing...

1440
01:51:35,177 --> 01:51:40,628
Here comes Mr. Lucas,
surrounded by guards.

1441
01:51:40,704 --> 01:51:42,778
Mr. Lucas, a few words?

1442
01:51:42,858 --> 01:51:46,675
"Go home, sleep well!"

1443
01:51:46,751 --> 01:51:47,890
You heard him...

1444
01:51:50,123 --> 01:51:54,568
- Poor CÃ©cile.
- Shut up, you said that before.

1445
01:51:54,642 --> 01:51:56,787
- We have to do something.
- What can we do?

1446
01:51:56,866 --> 01:52:00,611
Nothing, there's nothing
we can do.

1447
01:52:17,061 --> 01:52:20,426
But the next day,
during afternoon classes...

1448
01:53:09,163 --> 01:53:10,408
Aren't you coming to the cafÃ©?

1449
01:53:10,484 --> 01:53:13,472
No, I have to think. Ciao.

1450
01:53:15,002 --> 01:53:17,053
She thinks too much.

1451
01:53:18,201 --> 01:53:19,694
Oh, a cat!

1452
01:53:19,765 --> 01:53:22,000
In fact, "Miss Tequila", you're
working tonight until when?

1453
01:53:22,024 --> 01:53:24,761
- A.m.
- We'll never rehearse.

1454
01:53:24,838 --> 01:53:26,535
Yes, we can,
at 6 a.m. at my place!

1455
01:53:26,612 --> 01:53:28,140
Can we come and see you?

1456
01:53:28,211 --> 01:53:32,169
There's nothing to see, nothing
to drink, everything's fake.

1457
01:53:37,908 --> 01:53:41,132
- I have to talk to you.
- CÃ©cile?

1458
01:53:41,211 --> 01:53:43,153
The keys which were
in the chimney,

1459
01:53:43,226 --> 01:53:44,578
what did you do with them?

1460
01:53:44,651 --> 01:53:46,504
What keys? What chimney?
What are you talking about?

1461
01:53:46,528 --> 01:53:49,407
The key I left in my room,
I mean, in your room.

1462
01:53:49,482 --> 01:53:50,884
This is serious,
you must give them back to me.

1463
01:53:50,908 --> 01:53:52,460
There are no keys
in the chimney.

1464
01:53:52,541 --> 01:53:54,128
Yes, there are, I need them.

1465
01:53:54,210 --> 01:53:57,125
I'm telling you.

1466
01:53:57,199 --> 01:53:58,726
I don't understand.

1467
01:53:58,797 --> 01:54:00,386
What keys?

1468
01:54:00,466 --> 01:54:04,176
- Did somebody come?
- Nobody came.

1469
01:54:04,256 --> 01:54:05,949
Listen CÃ©cile, are you sure?

1470
01:54:06,027 --> 01:54:08,078
I'm sure.

1471
01:54:08,147 --> 01:54:12,142
Somebody came for them.
I can't believe it, Anna.

1472
01:54:20,104 --> 01:54:21,905
What did she want?

1473
01:54:21,982 --> 01:54:23,819
Will she come back to class?

1474
01:54:23,894 --> 01:54:25,944
Did she say anything
about her boyfriend?

1475
01:54:26,014 --> 01:54:28,121
No, I didn't understand a thing.

1476
01:54:28,202 --> 01:54:31,841
She said something about keys
in my room,

1477
01:54:31,922 --> 01:54:34,031
and that someone came for them.

1478
01:54:34,111 --> 01:54:36,920
Who would that be?

1479
01:54:36,996 --> 01:54:39,070
It's silly.

1480
01:54:42,802 --> 01:54:44,876
Claude?

1481
01:54:48,085 --> 01:54:49,541
Laura!

1482
01:54:50,657 --> 01:54:53,429
Claire, what are you doing here?

1483
01:54:53,507 --> 01:54:55,449
I work at the pharmacy
next door.

1484
01:54:55,522 --> 01:54:56,981
Still studying economics.

1485
01:54:57,052 --> 01:54:58,330
And you?

1486
01:54:58,408 --> 01:55:02,437
I'm still taking theatre classes
with Constance Dumas.

1487
01:55:02,508 --> 01:55:04,204
Have you heard anything
about your sister?

1488
01:55:04,282 --> 01:55:07,752
Nothing yet,
but I'm still searching.

1489
01:55:07,826 --> 01:55:09,521
I'm in a hurry, gotta go.

1490
01:55:09,599 --> 01:55:12,551
See you.

1491
01:55:14,744 --> 01:55:16,759
Why did she call you Laura?

1492
01:55:16,830 --> 01:55:19,709
Well...

1493
01:55:19,784 --> 01:55:22,842
because my name is Laura.

1494
01:55:22,912 --> 01:55:23,942
No.

1495
01:55:25,972 --> 01:55:28,814
Anna is my sister's name.

1496
01:55:28,891 --> 01:55:31,558
She disappeared 3 years
and 28 days ago,

1497
01:55:31,636 --> 01:55:34,031
and I'm still looking for her.

1498
01:55:34,105 --> 01:55:37,505
Maybe one day, I'll meet someone
who knows her.

1499
01:55:46,999 --> 01:55:49,913
Put it down, put it down,
you'll break something.

1500
01:55:49,988 --> 01:55:54,540
Give me those keys,
you thief, you liar!

1501
01:55:54,610 --> 01:55:57,420
Disgusting cheat!

1502
01:55:57,496 --> 01:55:59,889
I'm telling you, I don't know
what you are talking about.

1503
01:55:59,963 --> 01:56:02,037
I was right to be suspicious.

1504
01:56:02,120 --> 01:56:04,690
In fact, that's the only thing
you came for,

1505
01:56:04,761 --> 01:56:06,776
and I thought you wanted me,

1506
01:56:06,846 --> 01:56:09,963
but no, I'm such an idiot.

1507
01:56:10,045 --> 01:56:12,544
Give me that.

1508
01:56:22,453 --> 01:56:24,326
Listen... think!

1509
01:56:24,400 --> 01:56:26,182
If I had come to steal
whatever you're talking about,

1510
01:56:26,206 --> 01:56:30,437
and if I had stolen it,
what would I be doing here now?

1511
01:56:30,516 --> 01:56:32,568
Stop confusing me.

1512
01:56:36,112 --> 01:56:38,543
It's over.

1513
01:56:38,615 --> 01:56:41,673
I'm not doing this anymore,

1514
01:56:41,743 --> 01:56:44,338
I won't let you destroy me.

1515
01:57:22,722 --> 01:57:24,773
Henri!

1516
01:57:24,843 --> 01:57:25,910
Lucien!

1517
01:57:25,991 --> 01:57:28,941
It's Thomas.

1518
01:57:29,014 --> 01:57:31,586
He's got the keys.

1519
01:57:31,656 --> 01:57:33,185
This is ridiculous.

1520
01:57:33,255 --> 01:57:35,578
She's been annoying me for hours
with these keys.

1521
01:57:35,654 --> 01:57:38,047
Do you know anything about keys?

1522
01:57:38,120 --> 01:57:40,337
The keys to shut your mouth!

1523
01:57:42,292 --> 01:57:44,472
We gotta frisk him.

1524
01:57:44,551 --> 01:57:47,774
He took the keys
from the chimney in your room.

1525
01:57:49,522 --> 01:57:51,429
No, it's not him.

1526
01:57:53,623 --> 01:57:56,466
I've been listening to your
shouting for a while now.

1527
01:57:56,542 --> 01:57:58,131
You were here?

1528
01:57:58,210 --> 01:58:00,191
I came home first.

1529
01:58:02,590 --> 01:58:05,435
Your friend
didn't take the keys.

1530
01:58:05,511 --> 01:58:09,017
- I did.
- Why didn't you say so earlier?

1531
01:58:09,091 --> 01:58:12,148
I usually don't intervene
when a couple fights.

1532
01:58:12,219 --> 01:58:13,949
What did you do with those keys?

1533
01:58:14,026 --> 01:58:16,243
Yes, what did you do with them?

1534
01:58:16,321 --> 01:58:20,941
Those keys keep the ghosts
from sleeping.

1535
01:58:28,521 --> 01:58:31,056
I threw them in the Seine.

1536
01:58:31,125 --> 01:58:33,413
Are you crazy?
What did you do that for?

1537
01:58:44,127 --> 01:58:46,235
And what are you doing
with this strange guy?

1538
01:58:50,104 --> 01:58:51,764
He's not strange.

1539
01:58:55,493 --> 01:58:58,336
He's just a man I love.

1540
01:59:15,305 --> 01:59:17,627
Listen everyone, I'll explain.

1541
01:59:17,703 --> 01:59:20,820
- Don't bother.
- Please don't.

1542
01:59:23,924 --> 01:59:26,592
- Wait, there's one thing...
- Thanks.

1543
01:59:28,930 --> 01:59:31,252
See you soon.

1544
01:59:38,801 --> 01:59:40,851
Scum!

1545
02:00:18,043 --> 02:00:22,523
I made you swear
not to see me again.

1546
02:00:22,597 --> 02:00:25,131
My lord, your presence
surprises my duty;

1547
02:00:25,201 --> 02:00:27,453
And what once filled my heart
with joy,

1548
02:00:27,531 --> 02:00:29,889
is now a cause for suffering.

1549
02:00:29,965 --> 02:00:32,111
Do you dare ignore it?

1550
02:00:32,190 --> 02:00:34,369
And seeing you is causing me
such pain;

1551
02:00:34,448 --> 02:00:38,442
Is your pain less than mine?

1552
02:00:38,515 --> 02:00:42,746
Are we both suffering less
for sighing together?

1553
02:00:42,826 --> 02:00:47,268
Go, content yourself
with seeing me tremble.

1554
02:00:47,343 --> 02:00:50,365
And with your dubious triumph,
have mercy.

1555
02:00:50,438 --> 02:00:53,875
Don't harass me
into shameful sighing.

1556
02:00:55,963 --> 02:00:59,436
Surena, I know just what it
costs my heart to see you,

1557
02:00:59,508 --> 02:01:02,661
but he who seeks to die
must seek the means.

1558
02:01:06,320 --> 02:01:08,715
Madam, the hour is nigh,
and tomorrow,

1559
02:01:08,790 --> 02:01:13,542
your faith commands you
to forget me.

1560
02:01:13,621 --> 02:01:17,686
I have but today,
this moment of my life.

1561
02:01:17,757 --> 02:01:20,565
Forgive Love
for sacrificing it to you,

1562
02:01:20,642 --> 02:01:25,429
and let me breathe this sigh...

1563
02:01:25,508 --> 02:01:29,325
and let me breathe this sigh
at your feet.

1564
02:01:29,401 --> 02:01:34,367
For my final joy
is giving my soul to you.

1565
02:01:34,442 --> 02:01:38,364
Eurydice and my soul, my lord,

1566
02:01:38,438 --> 02:01:41,768
you deem it strong enough,
as not to fear for it.

1567
02:01:41,845 --> 02:01:44,583
Might not the sighs
so fatal to your life

1568
02:01:44,661 --> 02:01:48,619
gain equal powers over me?

1569
02:01:48,691 --> 02:01:56,691
Live, my lord, live,
and let my desire

1570
02:01:57,137 --> 02:02:03,074
be equal to your passion's fire.

1571
02:02:03,152 --> 02:02:06,516
Trespassing now
seems all too sweet,

1572
02:02:06,592 --> 02:02:11,523
and I haven't done
my share of suffering yet.

1573
02:02:11,598 --> 02:02:17,463
Let a dark sorrow
consume me slowly,

1574
02:02:17,542 --> 02:02:21,843
let me fully taste
its bitterness.

1575
02:02:21,921 --> 02:02:28,072
Death shall not set me free,
I want to love always,

1576
02:02:28,140 --> 02:02:31,437
suffer always, die always.

1577
02:02:33,042 --> 02:02:35,401
But can you forgive
a weakness I admit

1578
02:02:35,476 --> 02:02:38,913
amidst this stinging
fatal tenderness?

1579
02:02:38,987 --> 02:02:44,128
Could you, my lord, convince
yourself to let

1580
02:02:44,200 --> 02:02:47,637
a fleeting happiness
alleviate the deepest pain?

1581
02:02:47,711 --> 02:02:50,934
Surena, to what joy
can the miserable aspire,

1582
02:02:51,013 --> 02:02:54,615
who, after so many favors, is
devoured by his own passion?

1583
02:02:54,698 --> 02:02:56,712
What can I do
in my present state?

1584
02:02:56,783 --> 02:02:59,769
This is the tenth time you
arrive in the middle of a scene.

1585
02:02:59,842 --> 02:03:02,935
Next time you can't get up,
stay in bed.

1586
02:03:03,005 --> 02:03:04,283
Are you jealous?

1587
02:03:04,359 --> 02:03:06,610
- It's not my fault.
- It's never your fault.

1588
02:03:06,688 --> 02:03:08,596
What was it this time?
A motorcycle-accident?

1589
02:03:08,670 --> 02:03:11,549
No, but the police
stopped everybody.

1590
02:03:11,624 --> 02:03:14,219
They announced it on the radio.

1591
02:03:14,300 --> 02:03:17,737
The guy who was sentenced the
other day, Antoine Lucas.

1592
02:03:17,812 --> 02:03:19,197
Well...?

1593
02:03:19,272 --> 02:03:21,487
He escaped last night
during his transfer.

1594
02:03:21,565 --> 02:03:24,267
Did you say Antoine Lucas?

1595
02:03:30,741 --> 02:03:34,072
Antoine Lucas escaped.

1596
02:03:58,270 --> 02:04:02,820
Please stop moving around
and talking.

1597
02:04:02,893 --> 02:04:05,464
What's all this excitement,
Pauline?

1598
02:04:20,863 --> 02:04:24,049
Enough for today.

1599
02:04:24,130 --> 02:04:28,089
Same time tomorrow.
Class dismissed.

1600
02:04:30,387 --> 02:04:33,574
CÃ©cile, wait, I have
to talk to you.

1601
02:04:36,502 --> 02:04:39,097
You need something?

1602
02:04:41,334 --> 02:04:43,835
- See you at the cafÃ©.
- Okay, I'll be right there.

1603
02:04:47,070 --> 02:04:49,322
You wanted to talk to me?

1604
02:04:49,399 --> 02:04:53,773
First, I wanted to tell you,
that what you did was good.

1605
02:04:53,848 --> 02:04:57,913
It was both well-balanced
and sensitive.

1606
02:04:57,984 --> 02:04:59,263
Very good.

1607
02:05:07,752 --> 02:05:09,303
What else?

1608
02:05:26,591 --> 02:05:27,727
Coffee?

1609
02:05:27,805 --> 02:05:30,059
- Herb tea, please.
- Yes, please.

1610
02:05:40,181 --> 02:05:41,603
Do we have aspirin?

1611
02:05:41,675 --> 02:05:43,690
On the fridge.

1612
02:05:43,761 --> 02:05:46,676
Joyce, can you give it to me,
please.

1613
02:05:49,774 --> 02:05:51,360
Don't you feel well?

1614
02:05:51,443 --> 02:05:53,100
Not too well.

1615
02:05:53,178 --> 02:05:54,458
Is it about Thomas?

1616
02:05:54,537 --> 02:05:56,550
Don't worry,
you'll see him again.

1617
02:05:56,622 --> 02:05:58,907
Yes, we'll see him again.

1618
02:06:04,442 --> 02:06:06,941
I'm worried about CÃ©cile.

1619
02:06:07,013 --> 02:06:09,088
She's disappeared.

1620
02:06:10,245 --> 02:06:12,083
She must feel very bad.

1621
02:06:12,158 --> 02:06:16,603
Why, because Antoine
is a fugitive now?

1622
02:06:16,677 --> 02:06:18,690
She should be glad.

1623
02:06:18,761 --> 02:06:21,192
What if they shoot him?

1624
02:06:21,264 --> 02:06:23,729
Just another police screw-up.

1625
02:06:34,090 --> 02:06:35,335
Hello.

1626
02:06:37,218 --> 02:06:39,363
You're having coffee.

1627
02:06:40,798 --> 02:06:43,264
I'd love a cup.

1628
02:06:52,755 --> 02:06:54,936
What a day!

1629
02:06:55,016 --> 02:06:58,595
- Real coffee, or instant?
- Real, please.

1630
02:07:03,948 --> 02:07:07,313
Everybody is upset today.

1631
02:07:07,389 --> 02:07:12,068
An escape at the courthouse;
we'll see heads rolling.

1632
02:07:12,636 --> 02:07:15,695
- See, he's a real cop.
- Yeah, that's me.

1633
02:07:19,518 --> 02:07:22,814
Thomas Santini,
criminal investigations.

1634
02:07:23,969 --> 02:07:25,461
You want to check?

1635
02:07:25,532 --> 02:07:28,068
It's almost the same name as
your boyfriend's.

1636
02:07:28,139 --> 02:07:31,470
I didn't do that
on purpose, Anna.

1637
02:07:31,545 --> 02:07:33,596
There are many
coincidences in life.

1638
02:07:33,665 --> 02:07:35,692
Without coincidence, everything
would be terribly routine.

1639
02:07:35,716 --> 02:07:41,475
I like coincidences...
and planning them.

1640
02:07:41,557 --> 02:07:44,612
So, what did you come here for?

1641
02:07:44,684 --> 02:07:46,970
Get out of here, okay?

1642
02:07:47,048 --> 02:07:50,271
The minute I have the keys,
that's all I want.

1643
02:07:50,350 --> 02:07:53,085
We told you,
they're in the Seine.

1644
02:07:53,164 --> 02:07:56,875
Yeah, in the Seine.

1645
02:07:59,108 --> 02:08:01,396
Might as well make me
believe in ghosts.

1646
02:08:03,489 --> 02:08:05,917
What do these keys mean to you?

1647
02:08:10,335 --> 02:08:13,594
The same as for Antoine Lucas:
an opportunity.

1648
02:08:18,016 --> 02:08:20,090
Have you heard
about the Bertrand case

1649
02:08:20,171 --> 02:08:22,422
and the acquittals?

1650
02:08:22,501 --> 02:08:24,645
Yes, bribery
by the Mafia in Lyon.

1651
02:08:24,726 --> 02:08:26,348
But they say it's not true.

1652
02:08:26,429 --> 02:08:27,742
Because three years ago,

1653
02:08:27,820 --> 02:08:31,185
when Antoine Lucas told
everything, he had no proof.

1654
02:08:32,406 --> 02:08:35,215
Some rumors from prison
he was unwise enough

1655
02:08:35,292 --> 02:08:38,171
to tell in front of a reporter
one night he was drunk.

1656
02:08:41,653 --> 02:08:45,718
Well, a little thief against
all these important persons,

1657
02:08:45,789 --> 02:08:49,854
there's not much you can do,
as I'm sure you would agree,

1658
02:08:49,923 --> 02:08:52,141
except...

1659
02:08:52,219 --> 02:08:55,620
Except?

1660
02:08:55,694 --> 02:09:02,083
One of these personalities
made a big mistake,

1661
02:09:02,159 --> 02:09:04,695
an epistolary mistake.

1662
02:09:04,767 --> 02:09:07,195
Epistolary?

1663
02:09:07,270 --> 02:09:09,804
A letter.

1664
02:09:09,875 --> 02:09:13,940
This letter fell into the hands
of an old gangster.

1665
02:09:14,013 --> 02:09:16,335
Let's call him Faria.

1666
02:09:16,410 --> 02:09:18,802
Lucas was lucky.

1667
02:09:18,876 --> 02:09:25,894
He spent some time in prison
with this Faria

1668
02:09:25,969 --> 02:09:27,840
and became his friend.

1669
02:09:27,916 --> 02:09:29,858
When was that?

1670
02:09:29,931 --> 02:09:34,090
Just before the scandal
three years ago.

1671
02:09:34,173 --> 02:09:37,502
So?

1672
02:09:37,578 --> 02:09:39,724
Did you keep these keys?

1673
02:09:42,269 --> 02:09:43,338
No.

1674
02:09:52,732 --> 02:09:56,133
Before dying of cancer
six months ago,

1675
02:09:56,208 --> 02:10:00,795
Faria gave his treasure
to Lucas:

1676
02:10:00,866 --> 02:10:05,060
some papers in a safe...

1677
02:10:05,139 --> 02:10:07,464
and the keys are for the safe.

1678
02:10:07,539 --> 02:10:08,997
Now you know it all.

1679
02:10:09,070 --> 02:10:11,807
Why didn't Antoine use them
six months ago?

1680
02:10:11,882 --> 02:10:14,133
Because these papers
are like dynamite.

1681
02:10:14,212 --> 02:10:18,407
He was afraid, but now he's got
nothing to lose.

1682
02:10:18,488 --> 02:10:20,668
What do you want the papers for?

1683
02:10:20,746 --> 02:10:22,762
Blackmail?

1684
02:10:25,022 --> 02:10:30,818
I like coincidences, but I also
like orderliness.

1685
02:10:33,712 --> 02:10:36,036
Scandals are always a mess.

1686
02:10:37,223 --> 02:10:40,897
I don't care about Antoine Lucas
or his escape.

1687
02:10:40,976 --> 02:10:45,005
Let him go to Switzerland
or Tierra del Fuego.

1688
02:10:45,077 --> 02:10:48,751
I only want these papers,
and I'll find them.

1689
02:10:53,420 --> 02:10:56,229
You should tell
your friend, CÃ©cile.

1690
02:10:56,303 --> 02:10:58,319
We don't know where she is.

1691
02:11:02,354 --> 02:11:05,056
She'll get in touch.

1692
02:11:05,134 --> 02:11:08,772
So tell her the deal.

1693
02:11:08,851 --> 02:11:12,288
Antoine is free
if I get the papers.

1694
02:11:27,067 --> 02:11:30,882
The ball is in your court now.

1695
02:11:34,539 --> 02:11:35,888
Think about it.

1696
02:11:37,736 --> 02:11:39,051
See you tomorrow.

1697
02:11:58,382 --> 02:12:00,740
This is outrageous!

1698
02:12:00,815 --> 02:12:04,182
We have to make him leave,
no matter what.

1699
02:12:04,256 --> 02:12:07,136
How are we gonna do that?

1700
02:12:07,211 --> 02:12:09,083
By calling the police?

1701
02:12:09,158 --> 02:12:12,454
He's setting up a trap
for CÃ©cile and Antoine.

1702
02:12:12,529 --> 02:12:15,338
He said he didn't care
about them.

1703
02:12:15,414 --> 02:12:17,560
You still believe his lies?

1704
02:12:17,639 --> 02:12:19,654
How naive can you be?

1705
02:12:19,724 --> 02:12:20,932
Leave her alone.

1706
02:12:21,011 --> 02:12:25,348
She's right,
for once he said the truth.

1707
02:12:25,425 --> 02:12:30,875
He could help Antoine and maybe
that's his only chance.

1708
02:12:30,949 --> 02:12:33,795
You must be joking.

1709
02:12:33,870 --> 02:12:36,194
You actually believe him?

1710
02:12:36,270 --> 02:12:37,929
Yes.

1711
02:12:38,008 --> 02:12:40,603
You know what?

1712
02:12:40,683 --> 02:12:43,007
I don't give a damn.

1713
02:12:43,082 --> 02:12:46,447
I'm not talking anymore
to insane people.

1714
02:13:03,138 --> 02:13:05,186
I feel so lost.

1715
02:13:06,509 --> 02:13:08,725
Don't worry,
you're not the only one.

1716
02:13:10,469 --> 02:13:13,457
I'll sleep in the living room.

1717
02:13:16,170 --> 02:13:18,044
Shall I come with you?

1718
02:13:19,716 --> 02:13:21,826
Yes.

1719
02:13:32,681 --> 02:13:39,449
I despise health
and I'm glad to be ill.

1720
02:13:39,529 --> 02:13:46,580
Send everything back,
because I will not eat today,

1721
02:13:46,655 --> 02:13:50,127
or tomorrow either.

1722
02:13:51,972 --> 02:13:57,138
All I want to do is
to be furious and hate you all.

1723
02:14:05,145 --> 02:14:07,219
CÃ©cile?

1724
02:14:07,301 --> 02:14:10,003
Yes, of course,
you can count on me,

1725
02:14:10,080 --> 02:14:12,924
I already told you.

1726
02:14:13,000 --> 02:14:14,980
Okay.

1727
02:14:19,605 --> 02:14:21,751
And then, after several days...

1728
02:14:45,464 --> 02:14:48,794
You're wasting your time.

1729
02:14:48,871 --> 02:14:50,920
It's my way to gain time.

1730
02:14:57,559 --> 02:15:00,856
What did you gain in the five
days you've been here?

1731
02:15:00,932 --> 02:15:04,439
We haven't seen CÃ©cile,
or heard from her.

1732
02:15:04,512 --> 02:15:06,491
She's not coming to class.

1733
02:15:09,483 --> 02:15:12,777
You should look for Antoine.

1734
02:15:12,854 --> 02:15:15,876
You won't find him
in this house.

1735
02:15:18,623 --> 02:15:22,262
Just doing my job, Joyce.

1736
02:15:22,343 --> 02:15:25,566
I'm not trying to show you
how to play comedy.

1737
02:15:25,644 --> 02:15:28,796
If you really want to help me,
you know what you need to do.

1738
02:15:28,876 --> 02:15:30,156
Excuse me.

1739
02:15:34,369 --> 02:15:37,804
Tell Lucia to give me the keys.

1740
02:15:37,879 --> 02:15:41,208
Don't you understand?
Don't you get it?

1741
02:15:41,286 --> 02:15:44,994
She threw them away!

1742
02:15:45,074 --> 02:15:48,925
You think everybody has your
pitiful vision of the world?

1743
02:15:49,002 --> 02:15:52,156
You think everybody is
such a lowlife?

1744
02:15:52,235 --> 02:15:55,008
Only interested in fighting over
stuff, just to sell it?

1745
02:15:56,997 --> 02:16:00,670
Go on, keep going,
you're looking through me.

1746
02:16:01,968 --> 02:16:04,077
I'm totally exposed.

1747
02:16:04,158 --> 02:16:05,781
Idiot!

1748
02:16:07,632 --> 02:16:14,128
That's just what I needed.
Someone who reads my soul.

1749
02:16:14,203 --> 02:16:19,584
You can come anytime, Joyce,
I'll tell you my evil plans

1750
02:16:19,659 --> 02:16:21,840
and you can give me lectures.

1751
02:16:21,919 --> 02:16:23,576
I know you'd love that.

1752
02:16:23,969 --> 02:16:27,442
I can see it,
deep in your eyes...

1753
02:16:30,955 --> 02:16:35,328
Please excuse me...

1754
02:16:35,405 --> 02:16:37,976
Moralists always turn me on.

1755
02:16:52,435 --> 02:16:55,659
What's wrong?

1756
02:16:55,737 --> 02:16:56,769
And you?

1757
02:16:56,849 --> 02:16:59,243
It's because of the scallions.

1758
02:16:59,317 --> 02:17:01,986
I'm gonna kill this guy.
I'm gonna kill him.

1759
02:17:12,804 --> 02:17:14,949
I'm warning you, I'm leaving.

1760
02:17:15,029 --> 02:17:17,078
It's either him or us.

1761
02:17:17,149 --> 02:17:18,642
What did he do?

1762
02:17:18,714 --> 02:17:20,728
He's scum.

1763
02:17:22,779 --> 02:17:25,552
A traitor, that's what he is!

1764
02:17:26,742 --> 02:17:28,234
Consider yourself warned.

1765
02:17:30,217 --> 02:17:32,847
I knew that already.

1766
02:17:32,930 --> 02:17:35,004
How can you let him touch you?

1767
02:17:40,158 --> 02:17:43,938
What happened?

1768
02:17:44,017 --> 02:17:45,024
What did he try to do?

1769
02:17:45,094 --> 02:17:48,946
Nothing, he kissed me,
that's all.

1770
02:17:57,746 --> 02:18:00,554
So say something!

1771
02:18:06,888 --> 02:18:10,431
- I don't care.
- You're not allowed to say that.

1772
02:18:10,502 --> 02:18:12,717
It's selfish.

1773
02:18:12,796 --> 02:18:16,542
And if she turns up like last
time, he'll lock her up.

1774
02:18:18,394 --> 02:18:21,379
I don't know, I don't
know anymore.

1775
02:18:35,737 --> 02:18:37,572
Me neither.

1776
02:18:45,329 --> 02:18:49,147
I love him, I love him...

1777
02:18:58,746 --> 02:19:00,820
Well, Arlequin, my love?

1778
02:19:00,902 --> 02:19:03,889
Well, Silvia, my soul?

1779
02:19:03,959 --> 02:19:06,698
How unhappy we are!

1780
02:19:06,776 --> 02:19:09,893
Let us love each other always.

1781
02:19:09,973 --> 02:19:11,325
Yes, but...

1782
02:19:11,399 --> 02:19:14,314
what will happen to our love?

1783
02:19:14,387 --> 02:19:16,403
I'm so worried.

1784
02:19:16,474 --> 02:19:20,574
I don't know, be patient, but
I'm no braver than you are.

1785
02:19:23,807 --> 02:19:26,202
My poor lovely treasure,

1786
02:19:26,276 --> 02:19:29,984
for three days, I have not seen
your beautiful eyes.

1787
02:19:30,064 --> 02:19:34,781
Look at me to compensate me.

1788
02:19:34,861 --> 02:19:39,375
I've many things to tell you.

1789
02:19:39,448 --> 02:19:42,186
I'm afraid of losing you.

1790
02:19:42,264 --> 02:19:46,636
I'm afraid of somebody
hurting you through jealousy.

1791
02:19:46,712 --> 02:19:51,120
I'm afraid of getting used to
your being away from me.

1792
02:20:53,413 --> 02:20:54,871
Hello.

1793
02:20:56,853 --> 02:21:00,220
Have you also come
to teach me how to behave?

1794
02:21:04,467 --> 02:21:09,019
Oh, Charlotte Corday now?
I'm impressed.

1795
02:21:22,123 --> 02:21:24,482
Stop that nonsense.

1796
02:21:31,335 --> 02:21:34,285
Knives belong
in the kitchen, right?

1797
02:21:38,218 --> 02:21:41,097
Come in, come in,
join the crowd.

1798
02:22:18,885 --> 02:22:20,377
So?

1799
02:22:22,150 --> 02:22:24,577
My room is on the top floor.

1800
02:22:24,651 --> 02:22:28,503
Come see me some evening, late,

1801
02:22:28,582 --> 02:22:30,976
so we can talk.

1802
02:22:35,012 --> 02:22:39,040
I don't want
to talk anymore, understand?

1803
02:22:39,113 --> 02:22:45,323
I see, you want to touch,
like St. Thomas.

1804
02:22:45,402 --> 02:22:48,627
That's right, he's my patron.

1805
02:22:50,200 --> 02:22:53,389
Excuse me, the kitchen.

1806
02:23:25,582 --> 02:23:29,470
If I'd known that you were
coming after him in good faith,

1807
02:23:29,544 --> 02:23:31,976
I would have waited.

1808
02:23:32,046 --> 02:23:36,980
But you're unlucky
and I'm not too happy myself.

1809
02:23:37,055 --> 02:23:40,454
Flaminia, you be the judge.

1810
02:23:40,529 --> 02:23:43,410
How can a man stop
loving Silvia?

1811
02:23:43,485 --> 02:23:48,451
Is there a heart more
sympathetic, more generous?

1812
02:23:48,525 --> 02:23:55,326
Anybody else's tenderness would
touch me less than her goodness.

1813
02:23:55,407 --> 02:24:00,442
You shall also judge.

1814
02:24:00,516 --> 02:24:04,262
How is one to behave with a man
who always thanks you,

1815
02:24:04,338 --> 02:24:07,668
no matter what you say to him?

1816
02:24:07,743 --> 02:24:13,054
I can't blame him, Silvia,
you're charming,

1817
02:24:13,134 --> 02:24:16,286
and in his place,
I would do the same.

1818
02:24:16,365 --> 02:24:23,061
Don't tell him I'm pretty,
he knows it.

1819
02:24:27,906 --> 02:24:34,993
Love me calmly, and help me
get even with this woman.

1820
02:24:36,455 --> 02:24:39,821
Dear Silvia, I will at once.

1821
02:24:40,906 --> 02:24:42,918
My mind is made up.

1822
02:24:42,991 --> 02:24:47,091
No matter how you treat me,

1823
02:24:47,160 --> 02:24:49,900
I will love you all my life.

1824
02:24:49,978 --> 02:24:51,707
Oh, I'm sure.

1825
02:24:51,783 --> 02:24:53,800
I know you...

1826
02:24:55,296 --> 02:24:56,953
Excuse me.

1827
02:25:00,682 --> 02:25:02,969
I can't hear you...

1828
02:25:03,602 --> 02:25:06,102
Hello? One moment please.

1829
02:25:06,171 --> 02:25:07,974
Hello?

1830
02:25:16,289 --> 02:25:18,304
What's going on?

1831
02:25:18,374 --> 02:25:21,880
You don't even
feel your lines anymore.

1832
02:25:21,954 --> 02:25:24,313
Do you realize what's going on?

1833
02:25:24,388 --> 02:25:27,019
Constance says nothing,
this guy following us,

1834
02:25:27,098 --> 02:25:30,047
at a time when
we should really be rehearsing.

1835
02:25:30,121 --> 02:25:33,106
I can't do this anymore.

1836
02:25:33,180 --> 02:25:35,291
Let's try not to think about it.

1837
02:25:35,371 --> 02:25:37,445
That's so easy to say.

1838
02:25:37,524 --> 02:25:39,019
It's all her fault.

1839
02:25:39,091 --> 02:25:42,668
Look at Lucia,
she's totally high!

1840
02:25:42,740 --> 02:25:48,535
I'd like to be in her shoes now,
I feel rather down.

1841
02:25:48,611 --> 02:25:52,987
Yes, okay... certainly.

1842
02:25:59,389 --> 02:26:03,454
Please start again,
a little earlier in the script.

1843
02:26:03,525 --> 02:26:05,954
Places, please.

1844
02:26:06,028 --> 02:26:09,702
And Anna, with more conviction.

1845
02:26:11,137 --> 02:26:13,316
Claude? Ready?

1846
02:26:13,397 --> 02:26:18,504
You shall also judge.

1847
02:26:18,576 --> 02:26:21,796
How is one to behave with a man
who always thanks you,

1848
02:26:21,878 --> 02:26:24,056
no matter what you say to him?

1849
02:26:24,137 --> 02:26:28,437
I can't blame him, Silvia,
you're charming,

1850
02:26:28,516 --> 02:26:30,910
and in his place,
I would do the same.

1851
02:26:30,984 --> 02:26:36,815
Don't tell him I'm pretty,

1852
02:26:36,892 --> 02:26:39,464
he knows it...

1853
02:26:58,860 --> 02:27:01,005
Go on, don't let them
distract you.

1854
02:27:01,085 --> 02:27:02,329
Concentrate.

1855
02:27:05,917 --> 02:27:13,525
Don't tell him I'm pretty,
he knows it.

1856
02:27:15,023 --> 02:27:20,854
Love me calmly, and help me get
even with this woman.

1857
02:27:20,931 --> 02:27:24,926
Dear Silvia, I will at once.

1858
02:27:24,998 --> 02:27:26,729
My mind is made up.

1859
02:27:26,806 --> 02:27:31,285
No matter how you treat me,

1860
02:27:31,357 --> 02:27:33,788
I will love you all my life.

1861
02:27:33,860 --> 02:27:35,662
Oh, I'm sure.

1862
02:27:45,297 --> 02:27:50,298
Mrs. Constance Dumas,
will you please come with us?

1863
02:27:50,372 --> 02:27:52,244
Certainly.

1864
02:27:59,375 --> 02:28:03,604
I will be gone for a few days.

1865
02:28:03,684 --> 02:28:07,500
If I...

1866
02:28:07,575 --> 02:28:13,479
If anything happens,
I'm counting on you.

1867
02:28:18,387 --> 02:28:21,752
Anyway, I won't always be there.

1868
02:29:25,504 --> 02:29:27,447
Whisky?

1869
02:29:27,520 --> 02:29:30,363
Yes, please.

1870
02:29:30,440 --> 02:29:32,762
You're nicer than your friends.

1871
02:29:32,837 --> 02:29:35,931
There's no point
in not being nice.

1872
02:30:00,784 --> 02:30:03,900
Your place is very austere.

1873
02:30:03,982 --> 02:30:06,375
I like austerity.

1874
02:30:25,010 --> 02:30:28,412
You had Constance arrested,
didn't you?

1875
02:30:28,487 --> 02:30:31,329
Why should I?

1876
02:30:31,404 --> 02:30:34,593
Because she was
hiding Antoine Lucas.

1877
02:30:34,673 --> 02:30:38,631
Fortunately, he had
already left.

1878
02:30:38,705 --> 02:30:40,849
I've told you a hundred times.

1879
02:30:40,928 --> 02:30:43,501
I'm not interested
in this little crook.

1880
02:30:43,569 --> 02:30:45,930
I'm leading this investigation
on my own.

1881
02:30:46,004 --> 02:30:48,634
And I'm with you now,

1882
02:30:48,715 --> 02:30:51,559
because I know you'll give me
what I'm looking for.

1883
02:30:55,980 --> 02:30:58,125
How can you be so sure?

1884
02:31:01,089 --> 02:31:02,784
You're smart.

1885
02:31:04,426 --> 02:31:07,519
Obstruction,
trafficking in stolen documents,

1886
02:31:07,589 --> 02:31:08,975
you could go to jail for that.

1887
02:31:10,995 --> 02:31:14,775
What will you do with the
papers, once you have them?

1888
02:31:18,573 --> 02:31:21,381
I'll destroy them.

1889
02:31:21,457 --> 02:31:25,451
Or return them to the owner,
which is the same thing.

1890
02:31:25,524 --> 02:31:28,781
Bring things back to order.

1891
02:31:28,860 --> 02:31:31,325
"Order."

1892
02:31:31,398 --> 02:31:34,171
That's the only word
you seem to know.

1893
02:31:34,248 --> 02:31:36,297
A bit sad, isn't it?

1894
02:31:36,369 --> 02:31:39,071
No, the opposite is sad.

1895
02:31:41,443 --> 02:31:43,386
Saint George and the Dragon.

1896
02:31:46,032 --> 02:31:48,106
Nice little Raphael.

1897
02:31:50,758 --> 02:31:53,425
For a cop,
you're pretty cultured.

1898
02:31:54,999 --> 02:31:57,049
From the Sorbonne
to the police station,

1899
02:31:57,120 --> 02:31:59,170
a path straight down.

1900
02:31:59,239 --> 02:32:02,190
You're a philosopher-cop, right?

1901
02:32:02,264 --> 02:32:04,100
Correct.

1902
02:32:06,190 --> 02:32:09,793
Man is a wolf
to his neighbor, etc., etc.

1903
02:32:09,875 --> 02:32:10,977
Interesting.

1904
02:32:14,985 --> 02:32:18,077
And what's the woman?

1905
02:32:22,388 --> 02:32:24,154
A man with...

1906
02:32:24,231 --> 02:32:26,589
or rather without...

1907
02:32:26,663 --> 02:32:28,121
Well, you know what I mean.

1908
02:32:28,192 --> 02:32:30,207
Not really.

1909
02:32:30,278 --> 02:32:32,778
Do you sometimes drink
with women?

1910
02:32:34,589 --> 02:32:37,183
As you can see.

1911
02:32:37,264 --> 02:32:39,207
I can't see anything.

1912
02:32:43,451 --> 02:32:44,909
You don't drink?

1913
02:32:44,981 --> 02:32:46,960
Not alcohol.

1914
02:32:50,160 --> 02:32:52,376
You know what I think?

1915
02:32:52,453 --> 02:32:56,091
You have these keys on you.

1916
02:32:56,173 --> 02:32:58,910
You want to check?

1917
02:32:58,988 --> 02:33:02,839
Maybe... that's part of my job.

1918
02:33:02,915 --> 02:33:06,140
Sorry, I scared you,
I'm not a brute.

1919
02:33:06,218 --> 02:33:08,955
You're so warm, have a drink.

1920
02:33:09,033 --> 02:33:11,736
No, thanks, it's for you.

1921
02:33:11,814 --> 02:33:14,480
Don't make such a fuss,
I didn't touch it.

1922
02:33:14,560 --> 02:33:18,624
No, I said.

1923
02:33:18,696 --> 02:33:20,248
Drink.

1924
02:33:37,187 --> 02:33:38,360
Thanks.

1925
02:33:42,749 --> 02:33:44,550
Goodbye.

1926
02:33:47,685 --> 02:33:49,662
Stop him! He has the key!

1927
02:33:54,011 --> 02:33:55,433
Sorry.

1928
02:34:06,732 --> 02:34:07,761
Good night.

1929
02:35:25,598 --> 02:35:27,541
Be brave!

1930
02:35:27,614 --> 02:35:29,900
You are now in fear.

1931
02:35:33,766 --> 02:35:37,760
I think he vowed
never to have a good time.

1932
02:35:37,831 --> 02:35:40,262
I admit that I'm afraid.

1933
02:35:40,334 --> 02:35:42,515
What a man!

1934
02:35:43,707 --> 02:35:46,551
I must uplift his spirit.

1935
02:35:50,102 --> 02:35:51,489
Don't be afraid.

1936
02:35:52,605 --> 02:35:55,936
I'll never love the Prince,
I vow...

1937
02:35:56,012 --> 02:35:58,298
Stop, Silvia.

1938
02:35:58,375 --> 02:36:02,013
Don't finish your vow,
I pray you.

1939
02:36:02,094 --> 02:36:04,761
Will you not let me swear it?

1940
02:36:05,431 --> 02:36:07,646
That's nice.

1941
02:36:07,724 --> 02:36:09,277
I'm glad.

1942
02:36:12,139 --> 02:36:15,291
Shall I let you vow against me?

1943
02:36:17,283 --> 02:36:18,705
Against you?

1944
02:36:22,567 --> 02:36:25,233
Are you the Prince?

1945
02:36:25,313 --> 02:36:29,959
Yes, Silvia,
I have hidden my rank 'til now.

1946
02:36:34,662 --> 02:36:38,336
So your tenderness
be due to mine,

1947
02:36:38,416 --> 02:36:41,604
let I should lose the pleasure
it would bring me,

1948
02:36:41,682 --> 02:36:43,270
now that you know me,

1949
02:36:43,352 --> 02:36:45,886
you are free to accept my heart
and hand,

1950
02:36:45,959 --> 02:36:48,139
or to refuse either.

1951
02:36:48,217 --> 02:36:49,708
Speak, Silvia.

1952
02:36:49,782 --> 02:36:51,927
Ah, my dear Prince.

1953
02:36:52,006 --> 02:36:55,822
I was going to make
so beautiful a vow!

1954
02:36:55,899 --> 02:36:59,442
If you were seeking the pleasure
of being loved by me,

1955
02:36:59,515 --> 02:37:05,666
you have found it,
you know I speak the truth.

1956
02:37:06,570 --> 02:37:08,371
I will have it so.

1957
02:37:11,402 --> 02:37:15,324
Our union is assured.

1958
02:37:15,397 --> 02:37:17,722
I heard every word, Silvia.

1959
02:37:17,797 --> 02:37:21,541
Well, Arlequin, I have nothing
to say to you.

1960
02:37:21,620 --> 02:37:24,050
Console yourself as you can.

1961
02:37:25,304 --> 02:37:27,521
The Prince will speak to you.

1962
02:37:27,599 --> 02:37:29,329
My heart is full.

1963
02:37:29,404 --> 02:37:32,948
It doesn't make sense,
we can't go on.

1964
02:37:33,021 --> 02:37:37,915
No, Pauline, don't start
all over again.

1965
02:37:37,990 --> 02:37:42,115
Pauline, we had agreed to
go all the way.

1966
02:37:42,197 --> 02:37:43,725
We're almost there.

1967
02:37:43,796 --> 02:37:45,346
Yes, we're almost there.

1968
02:37:45,430 --> 02:37:51,093
But we don't know
what we're doing.

1969
02:37:51,164 --> 02:37:54,802
What will we look like,
without Constance?

1970
02:37:54,884 --> 02:37:56,863
We'll look ridiculous.

1971
02:38:04,165 --> 02:38:06,450
That's why we have
to be even better.

1972
02:38:06,527 --> 02:38:08,468
Or else, we'll have lost
everything.

1973
02:38:08,543 --> 02:38:11,246
True, we would lose everything.

1974
02:38:11,323 --> 02:38:13,788
Remember what she said.

1975
02:38:13,862 --> 02:38:15,663
She wants us to go all the way.

1976
02:38:15,739 --> 02:38:17,884
That's what she said.

1977
02:38:17,963 --> 02:38:20,143
But I wanted her to see us.

1978
02:38:20,222 --> 02:38:22,130
That's not what's most
important.

1979
02:38:22,204 --> 02:38:23,554
What is, then?

1980
02:38:23,629 --> 02:38:26,129
- Not to disappoint her.
- Not to disappoint ourselves!

1981
02:38:26,201 --> 02:38:27,231
Maybe.

1982
02:38:39,756 --> 02:38:41,830
I think that
our acting got worse.

1983
02:38:41,912 --> 02:38:44,791
Look, we're working on it.

1984
02:38:46,360 --> 02:38:48,611
So, let's get to work.

1985
02:38:48,689 --> 02:38:51,497
Okay, let's go, up!

1986
02:38:54,944 --> 02:38:57,931
Quiet, please.

1987
02:39:02,975 --> 02:39:04,953
Okay, let's do it again.

1988
02:39:22,683 --> 02:39:26,119
Anna,

1989
02:39:26,193 --> 02:39:28,930
did you tell Joyce
I would go see her?

1990
02:39:29,009 --> 02:39:30,217
I did.

1991
02:39:32,102 --> 02:39:34,211
It made her happy.

1992
02:39:41,068 --> 02:39:42,765
Well, Arlequin.

1993
02:39:42,842 --> 02:39:46,137
I have nothing to say to you.

1994
02:39:46,214 --> 02:39:51,879
Console yourself as you can.

1995
02:39:51,949 --> 02:39:55,872
What is there to say to me?
That I shall leave you.

1996
02:39:55,946 --> 02:39:59,976
What is there for me to answer?
That I know.

1997
02:40:00,048 --> 02:40:03,449
Say that you have said so,
say that I have answered.

1998
02:40:03,524 --> 02:40:08,240
Then leave me alone,
and that's the end of it.

1999
02:40:11,101 --> 02:40:13,116
- to the prisoners,

2000
02:40:13,186 --> 02:40:16,967
to one among them,
to those who wait for them.

2001
02:40:16,991 --> 02:40:19,991
