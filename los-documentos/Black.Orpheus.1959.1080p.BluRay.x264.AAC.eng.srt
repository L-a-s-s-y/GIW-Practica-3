1
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:34,744
BLACK ORPHEUS

2
00:03:38,678 --> 00:03:40,972
Serafina, look what a beauty!

3
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,301
Forgive me.

4
00:05:01,177 --> 00:05:04,263
Please forgive me.
You really scared me.

5
00:05:04,931 --> 00:05:07,934
You're trembling, poor thing.

6
00:05:08,101 --> 00:05:10,770
I can feel your heart beat
here in your hand

7
00:05:10,937 --> 00:05:13,314
like a caged bird.

8
00:05:13,481 --> 00:05:16,150
Let me give you something
to help you forget.

9
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:20,196
Here.
I don't know if it's very pretty.

10
00:05:20,655 --> 00:05:22,115
Oh, but it is.

11
00:05:22,907 --> 00:05:24,784
Thank you very much.

12
00:05:25,827 --> 00:05:28,621
I can help you,
if you don't mind.

13
00:05:28,788 --> 00:05:31,916
But I can't guide you too far.
I don't know Rio.

14
00:05:32,083 --> 00:05:34,043
I'll manage.

15
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:36,629
I know this city
like the palm of my hand.

16
00:05:36,796 --> 00:05:39,674
I can even give you directions,
if you wish.

17
00:05:40,258 --> 00:05:41,968
Let's go.

18
00:06:27,221 --> 00:06:30,224
Onions, onions.

19
00:06:32,852 --> 00:06:34,479
Wanna buy a steak?

20
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:37,607
What a beauty!

21
00:06:44,572 --> 00:06:47,033
Come walk with me, pretty girl.

22
00:06:51,037 --> 00:06:53,581
The biggest necklaces around!

23
00:07:21,776 --> 00:07:25,488
Who wants to buy a necklace?

24
00:08:58,956 --> 00:09:00,917
Hey there, climb aboard!

25
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:47,296
<i>This is how our love will be</i>

26
00:09:47,463 --> 00:09:51,342
<i>Me for you and you for me</i>

27
00:10:01,102 --> 00:10:05,940
<i>I've had enough of sadness</i>

28
00:10:08,276 --> 00:10:10,319
<i>I'll make you happy</i>

29
00:10:10,444 --> 00:10:14,490
<i>I want to live in peace</i>

30
00:10:26,669 --> 00:10:27,669
Hermes!

31
00:10:27,795 --> 00:10:30,631
All done, Orfeu?
Gonna get your paycheck?

32
00:10:48,858 --> 00:10:51,152
Hey, what are you doing?

33
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:55,489
They said to go
to the end of the line.

34
00:10:55,781 --> 00:10:58,492
Well? You're looking at it.

35
00:10:59,327 --> 00:11:00,161
Thank you.

36
00:11:00,328 --> 00:11:02,580
- You're not from around here?
- No.

37
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:05,458
- Where are you going?
- My cousin's house.

38
00:11:05,624 --> 00:11:08,210
Well, that's okay then.

39
00:11:09,712 --> 00:11:12,715
Hermes, come help this girl.
She's looking for her cousin.

40
00:11:12,965 --> 00:11:16,010
He'll find her for you.
He can find anything.

41
00:11:16,635 --> 00:11:19,013
I gotta go get my paycheck.

42
00:11:21,807 --> 00:11:25,144
One more for your collection, eh?
Cute gal.

43
00:11:26,979 --> 00:11:29,690
- Just some silly girl.
- Yeah, I know you.

44
00:11:29,857 --> 00:11:33,652
- Better watch out. Mira's around.
<i>- Orfeu!</i>

45
00:11:33,861 --> 00:11:35,738
What did I tell you?

46
00:11:40,576 --> 00:11:44,705
Sorry to break up your little party.
You telling her fortune?

47
00:11:44,872 --> 00:11:46,499
- Why not?
- Don't bother.

48
00:11:46,665 --> 00:11:48,751
With her looks,
she'll never get lucky.

49
00:11:48,918 --> 00:11:51,587
And a show-off like you
doesn't deserve to get lucky.

50
00:11:52,171 --> 00:11:53,172
You coming?

51
00:11:53,672 --> 00:11:55,049
She's crazy.

52
00:11:55,216 --> 00:11:57,134
Have you been to Carnival?
- No.

53
00:11:57,301 --> 00:11:59,136
You've never been?

54
00:11:59,303 --> 00:12:01,889
Is that why you've come to Rio?
- No.

55
00:12:02,264 --> 00:12:05,309
You'll see.
You'll end up going.

56
00:12:05,726 --> 00:12:08,020
No one can resist the madness.

57
00:12:08,312 --> 00:12:11,190
Now look here.
You can't go wrong.

58
00:12:11,357 --> 00:12:14,485
Just follow that path
and you'll get there.

59
00:12:14,902 --> 00:12:17,405
- Thank you very much.
- My name is Hermes.

60
00:12:17,571 --> 00:12:20,241
If you get lost again,
come back and see me.

61
00:12:20,449 --> 00:12:22,701
I'm always here.
I'm the station guard.

62
00:12:22,993 --> 00:12:25,079
Thanks.
I'll be back someday.

63
00:12:27,748 --> 00:12:29,417
You're loaded!

64
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:32,002
Hand it over!
Let me see!

65
00:12:36,132 --> 00:12:37,925
Did you get directions?

66
00:12:39,802 --> 00:12:42,388
Yes, thanks.

67
00:12:43,389 --> 00:12:45,099
- Do you know her?
- No.

68
00:12:45,266 --> 00:12:48,644
- Then why all the fuss?
- 'Cause I'm a nice guy.

69
00:12:48,894 --> 00:12:51,814
- A nice guy.
- Cute, isn't she?

70
00:12:51,981 --> 00:12:55,192
- And I'm not? Let's go.
- Where?

71
00:12:55,443 --> 00:12:57,820
Where?
You hear that, Hermes?

72
00:12:57,987 --> 00:13:00,489
He has the nerve to ask where.

73
00:13:00,739 --> 00:13:03,284
Did you forget
we're getting a marriage license?

74
00:13:03,409 --> 00:13:07,246
Pay attention, man.
- What eyes she has.

75
00:13:07,955 --> 00:13:10,583
And I have the memory
of an elephant, you know?

76
00:13:12,793 --> 00:13:13,919
I know.

77
00:13:14,086 --> 00:13:15,629
Hey, pass it here!

78
00:13:20,634 --> 00:13:22,511
That's enough.

79
00:13:26,348 --> 00:13:30,811
- Where's Court No. 5, please?
- Upstairs, second door on the right.

80
00:13:34,023 --> 00:13:36,025
- Take off that cap.
- Why?

81
00:13:36,192 --> 00:13:38,152
And fix your tie.
What a mess.

82
00:13:39,028 --> 00:13:41,155
Let me fix your tie.

83
00:13:41,822 --> 00:13:44,366
Now give me a kiss.
- People are coming.

84
00:13:45,367 --> 00:13:46,785
Come on.

85
00:13:50,789 --> 00:13:52,708
Marriage licenses?

86
00:13:59,882 --> 00:14:02,718
I'm sorry!
This is for tomorrow.

87
00:14:03,344 --> 00:14:07,556
Well, we want a license today.
We're getting married.

88
00:14:07,723 --> 00:14:09,433
Are you sure?

89
00:14:10,309 --> 00:14:13,771
- Of course.
- Sorry. I was just kidding.

90
00:14:13,896 --> 00:14:18,859
I say that because
everybody comes here to get married.

91
00:14:19,026 --> 00:14:21,362
It's a funny line!

92
00:14:23,864 --> 00:14:26,367
Give me your names.
Let's start with yours.

93
00:14:28,619 --> 00:14:30,704
Orfeu.

94
00:14:33,165 --> 00:14:36,085
Then of course the bride
must be Eurídice.

95
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:39,547
What? My name's not Eurídice.
Why do you say that?

96
00:14:40,756 --> 00:14:43,342
"Orpheus loves Eurydice."
Everyone knows that.

97
00:14:44,176 --> 00:14:46,387
Do you love some girl
named Eurídice?

98
00:14:46,887 --> 00:14:49,723
I don't know any Eurídice.
What is this?

99
00:14:49,974 --> 00:14:52,601
Nothing.
Just an old story.

100
00:14:52,768 --> 00:14:54,228
I was being funny.

101
00:14:54,353 --> 00:14:56,146
It wasn't funny at all.

102
00:14:56,313 --> 00:14:59,191
Not another word
about some old stories, you hear?

103
00:14:59,358 --> 00:15:00,985
That's enough.

104
00:15:01,402 --> 00:15:03,404
My name is Mira.

105
00:15:38,272 --> 00:15:39,815
Mira, let's go!

106
00:15:46,071 --> 00:15:48,532
Happy now?
You got what you wanted.

107
00:15:48,699 --> 00:15:51,410
- You gonna buy the ring now?
- What ring?

108
00:15:51,577 --> 00:15:55,289
We're engaged now.
You have to give me a ring.

109
00:15:55,456 --> 00:15:59,752
- With what money?
- I saw your paycheck. Let's go!

110
00:16:00,127 --> 00:16:01,462
You won't do it?

111
00:16:01,629 --> 00:16:05,924
I've gotta get my guitar out of hock.
Tomorrow is Carnival.

112
00:16:06,091 --> 00:16:09,553
A ring.
Buy your own ring.

113
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:13,349
- No, you have to give me one!
- I said I have no money!

114
00:16:14,475 --> 00:16:17,478
- I can loan you some.
- All right.

115
00:16:17,895 --> 00:16:20,773
But you have to get me a ring.
Come on!

116
00:16:20,981 --> 00:16:22,775
Now what?

117
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:24,693
First my guitar.

118
00:16:39,249 --> 00:16:40,834
104.

119
00:16:41,794 --> 00:16:43,504
310.

120
00:16:44,505 --> 00:16:45,964
102.

121
00:16:46,256 --> 00:16:47,841
340.

122
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:49,551
350.

123
00:16:50,678 --> 00:16:52,638
Orfeu.

124
00:17:09,947 --> 00:17:12,199
You're gonna look like a king!

125
00:17:12,825 --> 00:17:14,660
I am a king.

126
00:17:22,876 --> 00:17:26,714
Sorry, but those crooks
aren't interested in this.

127
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,341
Hold it a minute.
It works great.

128
00:17:29,508 --> 00:17:35,222
A museum would pay a lot more
than 100 cruzeiros for this.

129
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:37,850
Quiet, everyone!

130
00:17:38,016 --> 00:17:41,145
Just 100 cruzeiros.
- I'm on to you.

131
00:17:41,311 --> 00:17:45,941
I just need 100 cruzeiros for Carnival,
but they won't give it to me.

132
00:17:47,234 --> 00:17:50,404
Here are 100 cruzeiros.
Now take this thing back!

133
00:17:50,529 --> 00:17:53,490
- A hundred cruzeiros! Great!
- Take this damn thing away!

134
00:17:53,657 --> 00:17:55,951
No, it's yours now.

135
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:58,787
Hold on.
The rest is yours!

136
00:18:10,257 --> 00:18:12,092
You think it's funny, huh?

137
00:18:13,093 --> 00:18:15,095
You got a good deal.

138
00:18:16,305 --> 00:18:18,849
- Hold this piece of junk.
- Wait a minute.

139
00:18:19,767 --> 00:18:21,226
Take this.

140
00:18:25,814 --> 00:18:27,775
Don't get mad, all right?

141
00:18:28,108 --> 00:18:29,902
Isn't it a beauty?

142
00:18:32,112 --> 00:18:35,949
- It is pretty.
- But you owe me 110 bucks.

143
00:18:36,366 --> 00:18:38,911
- What?
- 110 bucks.

144
00:18:46,835 --> 00:18:49,338
Sad, little birdie?
Hasn't he come yet?

145
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:51,673
But he will.

146
00:18:52,007 --> 00:18:54,802
Sing, bird, sing.

147
00:18:54,968 --> 00:18:57,137
Serafina, some bread?

148
00:18:57,304 --> 00:19:00,474
Thanks, but I spent
everything on my costume.

149
00:19:14,905 --> 00:19:16,990
Chico!

150
00:19:17,991 --> 00:19:19,493
Oh, it's you.

151
00:19:20,035 --> 00:19:21,245
Good morning.

152
00:19:21,411 --> 00:19:23,956
Good morning.
Come in.

153
00:19:24,289 --> 00:19:28,001
This is all I need.
I thought it was him.

154
00:19:28,126 --> 00:19:30,003
- Who?
- Chico Boto.

155
00:19:30,212 --> 00:19:32,339
That's right —
you don't know him.

156
00:19:32,506 --> 00:19:35,676
Look how handsome.
He's always on the road.

157
00:19:35,843 --> 00:19:37,636
But he promised
to be here for Carnival.

158
00:19:37,803 --> 00:19:39,888
- Your husband?
- No, why?

159
00:19:40,264 --> 00:19:44,351
We just like each other.
And I'm all his.

160
00:19:44,518 --> 00:19:47,896
You should see
the chest on this man.

161
00:19:49,815 --> 00:19:52,693
But that doesn't mean
I'm not happy to see you.

162
00:19:52,901 --> 00:19:56,321
Actually, since he's not here,
it works out great.

163
00:19:56,488 --> 00:19:58,699
Let me guess —
you came for Carnival.

164
00:19:59,366 --> 00:20:01,285
- I ran away.
- Ran away?

165
00:20:01,785 --> 00:20:05,122
- I'm scared, Serafina.
- What's all this about?

166
00:20:05,414 --> 00:20:08,917
Scared of what... or whom?

167
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:14,047
A man who came to the farm
and kept chasing after me.

168
00:20:14,214 --> 00:20:16,258
Because you're pretty, silly.

169
00:20:16,466 --> 00:20:19,219
No. I'm sure he wants to kill me.

170
00:20:19,511 --> 00:20:20,762
Are you crazy?

171
00:20:20,929 --> 00:20:23,974
He just wants
to get into your pants.

172
00:20:24,266 --> 00:20:27,978
No, he means to kill me.
I know he does.

173
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:32,524
"I know, I know."

174
00:20:32,733 --> 00:20:35,485
Tell me:
Does he know you're here?

175
00:20:36,403 --> 00:20:40,282
Then put it out of your mind.
Come, you must be starving.

176
00:20:40,574 --> 00:20:42,951
All I have is onions.
You got any money?

177
00:20:43,076 --> 00:20:46,914
Never mind. I only ask
'cause my costume cost a fortune.

178
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:51,418
But the Portuguese grocer
will do anything for a kiss.

179
00:20:52,836 --> 00:20:55,088
You really are pretty,
you know that?

180
00:21:40,801 --> 00:21:42,386
Good trick.

181
00:21:43,595 --> 00:21:46,306
Hello there, Benedito.
How are you?

182
00:21:46,807 --> 00:21:48,642
Is that amulet for me?

183
00:21:48,809 --> 00:21:50,811
No, it's for her.

184
00:21:50,978 --> 00:21:52,646
You don't even know her.

185
00:21:52,771 --> 00:21:55,273
But I'm going to.
Would you like this?

186
00:21:55,482 --> 00:21:58,777
- Thank you, Benedito.
- You already know my name?

187
00:21:58,944 --> 00:22:02,197
My name's Eurídice.
I'll keep this forever.

188
00:22:02,447 --> 00:22:04,616
Even after I die?

189
00:22:04,783 --> 00:22:06,910
Enough nonsense.
Run along now.

190
00:22:07,244 --> 00:22:10,998
That boy has some strange ideas.
Come on.

191
00:22:31,226 --> 00:22:32,853
Now give me a kiss.

192
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:35,147
- Just one!
- And for you?

193
00:22:35,313 --> 00:22:36,815
Some fish.

194
00:22:42,404 --> 00:22:45,073
Whoever that is,
she's gonna hit me up for credit.

195
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:49,411
Exactly. And with a new
customer like me — sassy and broke.

196
00:22:49,578 --> 00:22:51,830
You'll give us a deal, won't you?

197
00:22:52,581 --> 00:22:55,125
My little dumpling,
just once more, please.

198
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:57,210
Another customer for credit!

199
00:22:57,377 --> 00:23:00,297
At least nobody owes me anything.

200
00:23:01,381 --> 00:23:04,051
There. That should hold you
for a while.

201
00:23:04,176 --> 00:23:07,971
- Much better. What about her?
- Of course.

202
00:23:08,138 --> 00:23:09,848
Let's have a kiss.

203
00:23:11,016 --> 00:23:14,644
Poor thing's
not used to this yet.

204
00:23:14,978 --> 00:23:16,563
How 'bout a kiss from you?

205
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:18,857
Forget it.
I'd rather pay.

206
00:23:19,107 --> 00:23:22,944
That's too bad, since her man —
But I better shut up.

207
00:23:23,111 --> 00:23:25,614
Some women
are smarter than you.

208
00:23:25,906 --> 00:23:29,493
- I don't care. That's all just talk.
- Everybody knows.

209
00:23:29,659 --> 00:23:31,119
- What about you?
- Me?

210
00:23:31,286 --> 00:23:34,456
If he's really getting married,
then poor guy.

211
00:23:34,623 --> 00:23:39,211
- Actually, here they come now.
- Both of them?

212
00:23:39,377 --> 00:23:41,505
Take anything you want.

213
00:23:42,255 --> 00:23:43,757
Is everybody crazy?

214
00:23:43,924 --> 00:23:46,510
I'm coming!
Isn't this beautiful?

215
00:23:49,471 --> 00:23:51,431
- You're not going to see him?
- Who?

216
00:23:51,598 --> 00:23:53,934
- "Who?"
- She doesn't know him yet.

217
00:23:54,059 --> 00:23:58,396
But when she does,
she'll run even faster than the others.

218
00:23:58,563 --> 00:24:01,191
You taking those?
- Forget it. They're still green.

219
00:24:02,234 --> 00:24:05,278
Of course they're green.
You waiting for red chayotes?

220
00:24:06,696 --> 00:24:09,741
It can't be. Poor baby.

221
00:24:09,866 --> 00:24:11,952
Are you really getting hitched?

222
00:24:12,244 --> 00:24:14,955
It's really gone to her head.

223
00:24:15,455 --> 00:24:19,126
Shall I take your little fiancée
off your hands for a while?

224
00:24:19,626 --> 00:24:21,128
May I?

225
00:24:28,844 --> 00:24:31,680
- How did you do it?
- He kept insisting.

226
00:24:31,847 --> 00:24:33,640
I'm so happy!

227
00:24:36,184 --> 00:24:39,938
- You're choking me!
- I'm so happy! Give me a hug!

228
00:24:45,569 --> 00:24:48,321
- What's going on?
- Oh, it's you. Nothing.

229
00:24:48,488 --> 00:24:50,824
I gotta tune my guitar
for rehearsal.

230
00:24:50,991 --> 00:24:53,034
- Orfeu.
- Later, later...

231
00:24:53,827 --> 00:24:56,329
He doesn't want you.
Didn't I tell you?

232
00:24:56,913 --> 00:24:58,957
- Idiot.
- You're the idiot.

233
00:24:59,124 --> 00:25:03,044
- My costume's great!
- I like mine better.

234
00:25:05,755 --> 00:25:07,340
It's so pretty.

235
00:25:07,757 --> 00:25:10,135
- Where's Orfeu?
- Did he leave?

236
00:25:10,468 --> 00:25:13,430
That's right.
He said he'd see us at rehearsal.

237
00:25:13,555 --> 00:25:16,183
What? He could have
at least told me.

238
00:25:16,433 --> 00:25:20,645
The poor thing's so excited,
you know.

239
00:25:20,979 --> 00:25:22,981
Let me see your ring again.

240
00:25:24,399 --> 00:25:28,028
What a beauty. Is it real?

241
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,863
Practically.

242
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:31,531
Isn't it pretty?

243
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:40,332
<i>Orfeu, don't I look great?</i>

244
00:25:40,457 --> 00:25:43,543
Yeah. See you at rehearsal.

245
00:25:44,878 --> 00:25:46,588
How's everybody?

246
00:25:48,798 --> 00:25:50,717
How are you, Caruso?

247
00:25:59,559 --> 00:26:01,811
Always cuddling, huh?

248
00:26:09,527 --> 00:26:11,696
- Ask him.
- No, you ask.

249
00:26:15,533 --> 00:26:17,494
I wanted to ask you something.

250
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:24,167
Can you really make the sun rise
just by playing your guitar?

251
00:26:26,628 --> 00:26:29,506
- Of course I can.
- Didn't I tell you?

252
00:26:30,090 --> 00:26:32,550
Could you make
the sun rise tomorrow?

253
00:26:34,469 --> 00:26:37,722
Sure. Especially
since tomorrow is Carnival.

254
00:26:38,014 --> 00:26:40,183
What do you play to do that?

255
00:26:41,309 --> 00:26:42,978
I make something up.

256
00:26:43,103 --> 00:26:44,604
Could you do that?

257
00:26:44,771 --> 00:26:49,651
I think I could make up a melody.
Man, I'd love to make the sun rise.

258
00:26:51,695 --> 00:26:54,030
Lend him your guitar.
Just to see.

259
00:26:54,447 --> 00:26:57,117
Look here.
This guitar is very old.

260
00:26:57,450 --> 00:27:01,162
- "Orfeu is my master."
- It's true.

261
00:27:01,788 --> 00:27:03,999
There was an Orpheus before me,

262
00:27:04,291 --> 00:27:06,835
and there may be another
after I'm gone,

263
00:27:07,127 --> 00:27:09,921
but for now I'm the boss.

264
00:27:10,046 --> 00:27:11,589
Understand?

265
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:14,801
Don't be sad.

266
00:27:15,135 --> 00:27:17,512
If you promise not to tell,

267
00:27:17,637 --> 00:27:21,266
I'll play you the new song
I just wrote.

268
00:27:42,329 --> 00:27:43,872
Pretty, isn't it?

269
00:27:51,713 --> 00:27:57,677
<i>The dawn of a beautiful morn</i>

270
00:28:00,889 --> 00:28:07,520
<i>A new song is born</i>

271
00:28:09,647 --> 00:28:13,360
<i>It sings of your eyes</i>

272
00:28:14,027 --> 00:28:17,614
<i>Of your laughter and your hands</i>

273
00:28:18,573 --> 00:28:25,080
<i>One day you will come to me</i>

274
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:34,381
<i>From the strings of my guitar</i>

275
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:42,639
<i>That seeks only your love</i>

276
00:28:46,101 --> 00:28:50,063
<i>A voice comes forth</i>

277
00:28:51,398 --> 00:28:54,067
<i>That speaks of kisses</i>

278
00:28:54,734 --> 00:29:01,574
<i>Lost on your lips</i>

279
00:29:01,825 --> 00:29:04,536
<i>My heart sings
with newfound happiness</i>

280
00:29:04,702 --> 00:29:07,872
<i>At the dawning of this new love</i>

281
00:29:13,128 --> 00:29:16,798
- What are you doing here?
- I have every right!

282
00:29:16,965 --> 00:29:20,135
- Take the guitar! You didn't see me!
- Okay!

283
00:29:30,437 --> 00:29:32,272
- Isn't he here?
- Who?

284
00:29:32,564 --> 00:29:34,774
Was that you playing?

285
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:36,901
Orfeu taught me.

286
00:29:37,026 --> 00:29:38,736
Where is he?

287
00:29:40,363 --> 00:29:42,615
He just left with some woman.

288
00:29:42,782 --> 00:29:44,284
What?

289
00:29:47,662 --> 00:29:50,081
Now that you've got the guitar,
play something.

290
00:29:50,206 --> 00:29:51,958
He'll hear me.

291
00:29:52,542 --> 00:29:54,377
Even better. Play.

292
00:30:04,721 --> 00:30:08,141
You again?
What are you doing here?

293
00:30:09,017 --> 00:30:13,146
Ah, you didn't tell me
your cousin was Serafina.

294
00:30:14,647 --> 00:30:17,484
Then we're already close friends.
What's your name?

295
00:30:17,775 --> 00:30:20,236
Don't you remember?
I'm Eurídice.

296
00:30:20,361 --> 00:30:23,656
Amazing!
No wonder I liked you right away.

297
00:30:23,907 --> 00:30:27,202
"Orpheus likes Eurydice,"
as the story goes.

298
00:30:27,952 --> 00:30:29,704
Are you Orpheus?

299
00:30:30,413 --> 00:30:31,831
From head to toe.

300
00:30:31,998 --> 00:30:34,375
Well... I don't like you.

301
00:30:34,876 --> 00:30:36,628
Yes, you do.

302
00:30:37,045 --> 00:30:40,340
Try to remember.
It's a very old story.

303
00:30:41,007 --> 00:30:43,718
Thousands of years ago,

304
00:30:43,843 --> 00:30:46,471
Orpheus was sad
and melancholic,

305
00:30:47,305 --> 00:30:50,141
like this little bird
trapped in its cage.

306
00:30:51,184 --> 00:30:53,061
But one day,

307
00:30:53,353 --> 00:30:57,941
from the strings of his guitar
that sought only one true love,

308
00:30:58,483 --> 00:31:04,280
a voice spoke to him of lost kisses
from the lips of Eurydice.

309
00:31:10,370 --> 00:31:15,041
Eurydice's lips
trembled anxiously,

310
00:31:15,917 --> 00:31:20,880
and her mouth opened slightly
like a fragrant flower —

311
00:31:22,298 --> 00:31:25,802
No, you're too young
to remember.

312
00:31:25,927 --> 00:31:27,428
But I do.

313
00:31:27,554 --> 00:31:29,931
I remember
the words you sang.

314
00:31:30,557 --> 00:31:33,601
- They were the same words.
- That's right.

315
00:31:34,894 --> 00:31:37,730
But it was the melody
I liked best.

316
00:32:24,902 --> 00:32:27,071
Forgive me, Eurídice.

317
00:33:27,256 --> 00:33:28,758
Look.

318
00:33:29,175 --> 00:33:30,593
It's them.

319
00:33:31,552 --> 00:33:33,262
I need to talk to him.

320
00:33:33,513 --> 00:33:35,348
No, leave them alone.

321
00:33:36,933 --> 00:33:39,894
They're waiting
for you at rehearsal!

322
00:33:40,353 --> 00:33:41,688
All right.

323
00:33:43,272 --> 00:33:45,316
I have to go.

324
00:33:46,150 --> 00:33:47,652
I know.

325
00:33:48,861 --> 00:33:50,947
I'll sing and dance for you.

326
00:33:53,116 --> 00:33:55,535
Will you be there?
- Yes.

327
00:33:57,537 --> 00:34:00,248
Take good care of her.
Let's go.

328
00:34:02,041 --> 00:34:03,710
See you later.

329
00:37:11,981 --> 00:37:13,482
Thanks.

330
00:37:14,025 --> 00:37:16,277
Why aren't you paying
attention to me?

331
00:37:16,444 --> 00:37:18,279
I have no time for that now.

332
00:37:19,071 --> 00:37:21,782
- Answer me!
- Get back to your place!

333
00:37:42,762 --> 00:37:46,432
<i>This is how our love will be</i>

334
00:37:46,599 --> 00:37:50,311
<i>Me for you and you for me</i>

335
00:38:02,490 --> 00:38:03,616
Excuse us.

336
00:38:03,783 --> 00:38:06,243
He already saw you.
He's the sun.

337
00:38:06,369 --> 00:38:09,163
Look at Serafina.
She's the Queen of the Night.

338
00:38:09,413 --> 00:38:11,624
Look how happy she is.

339
00:38:36,732 --> 00:38:38,401
And who's she?

340
00:38:38,526 --> 00:38:41,904
That's Mira.
She's the Queen of the Day.

341
00:38:43,239 --> 00:38:45,449
Pretty, isn't she?
- Yes.

342
00:38:45,825 --> 00:38:47,827
She's Orfeu's fiancée.

343
00:39:07,346 --> 00:39:09,640
Look, he's going to kiss her.

344
00:39:16,188 --> 00:39:18,024
- That's enough now!
- What's so funny?

345
00:39:18,190 --> 00:39:21,485
- Nothing! That's enough!
- Why didn't you kiss me?

346
00:39:21,652 --> 00:39:25,114
Leave me alone.
Have you tried on your costumes?

347
00:39:25,281 --> 00:39:28,034
Oh, right. Mira's costume
is a beauty, isn't it?

348
00:39:28,451 --> 00:39:31,203
It has embroidered sleeves.
Let's go see it.

349
00:39:56,145 --> 00:39:58,689
Come and dance, Eurídice!

350
00:39:58,856 --> 00:40:01,484
Come on!

351
00:40:40,397 --> 00:40:43,400
- And who's this?
- Ask Orfeu.

352
00:42:16,952 --> 00:42:19,872
- I want a costume for her, okay?
- All right.

353
00:42:21,916 --> 00:42:24,877
No one dances
with the ladies like you do.

354
00:42:25,377 --> 00:42:26,837
Leave me alone.

355
00:42:27,588 --> 00:42:30,424
Such a pretty girl.

356
00:42:30,591 --> 00:42:33,552
- Better than Mira, isn't she?
- Much better.

357
00:42:33,719 --> 00:42:36,096
- Smooth operator.
- Stop babbling.

358
00:42:36,263 --> 00:42:38,474
- He has good taste.
- Stop it.

359
00:42:38,641 --> 00:42:41,852
- What's wrong with it?
- Where's her costume?

360
00:42:42,353 --> 00:42:44,438
This is all we have.

361
00:42:44,647 --> 00:42:47,608
A body like this
doesn't need a costume.

362
00:42:48,025 --> 00:42:50,736
Wait. I'll look next door.

363
00:42:53,197 --> 00:42:55,407
- That's right — Mira.
- What about her?

364
00:42:55,574 --> 00:42:57,243
Oh, nothing.

365
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,253
You don't waste any time,
do you?

366
00:43:07,419 --> 00:43:09,463
May I introduce my cousin?

367
00:43:10,256 --> 00:43:12,466
Be good now.
Take care of her.

368
00:43:12,591 --> 00:43:14,760
I want a pretty costume for her.

369
00:43:14,927 --> 00:43:18,097
- Oh, you...
- I'm serious.

370
00:43:18,264 --> 00:43:20,099
You don't even know her.

371
00:43:20,391 --> 00:43:21,767
Yes, I do.

372
00:43:21,976 --> 00:43:23,602
Look at me.

373
00:43:24,270 --> 00:43:26,105
Look at me.

374
00:43:26,438 --> 00:43:28,941
Oh, my!

375
00:43:29,984 --> 00:43:33,487
Don't look like that.
It's no big deal.

376
00:43:33,779 --> 00:43:36,782
Leave the girl to me.
I'll take care of her.

377
00:43:36,949 --> 00:43:40,369
- I'll help.
- It's about time.

378
00:43:40,494 --> 00:43:43,080
Don't just stand there.
Get going.

379
00:43:43,247 --> 00:43:45,624
Hurry up now.
I'll take care of her.

380
00:43:46,250 --> 00:43:49,253
- Orfeu, is Eurídice here?
- Yes. Why?

381
00:43:49,420 --> 00:43:51,714
Eurídice,
someone's looking for you.

382
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:53,465
- Who?
- Some man.

383
00:43:53,632 --> 00:43:56,760
- Who is he?
- I don't know. He's not from around here.

384
00:43:59,138 --> 00:44:01,140
Don't be afraid, sweetie.

385
00:44:01,307 --> 00:44:04,018
Tell him she's gone.

386
00:44:05,102 --> 00:44:06,979
What are you waiting for?

387
00:44:11,692 --> 00:44:13,277
Calm down.

388
00:44:16,030 --> 00:44:18,115
It's him.

389
00:44:26,415 --> 00:44:29,001
Calm down!
There's nothing to be afraid of!

390
00:44:29,668 --> 00:44:31,378
Take care of her!

391
00:44:31,503 --> 00:44:35,382
- What happened?
- My cousin Eurídice's frightened.

392
00:44:35,507 --> 00:44:38,427
- Her name's Eurídice?
- Something wrong with that?

393
00:44:38,719 --> 00:44:40,137
Orfeu!

394
00:44:45,642 --> 00:44:47,311
What happened, Benedito?

395
00:44:47,478 --> 00:44:49,855
I tried to catch him,
but he threw me to the ground.

396
00:44:50,022 --> 00:44:53,609
- Where did he go?
- I don't know. That way.

397
00:44:54,193 --> 00:44:56,653
Impossible.
There's a cliff there.

398
00:44:57,029 --> 00:44:59,948
- The man ran that way.
- That way?

399
00:45:00,115 --> 00:45:01,700
What's wrong with him?

400
00:45:02,034 --> 00:45:03,702
Take care of him.

401
00:45:05,371 --> 00:45:07,539
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

402
00:45:07,706 --> 00:45:10,751
Who's this Eurídice?
Did you two have an affair?

403
00:45:10,876 --> 00:45:12,419
- Let me by!
- Stay here!

404
00:45:14,671 --> 00:45:16,298
If you go...

405
00:45:21,136 --> 00:45:22,888
Did you chase him away?

406
00:45:25,682 --> 00:45:26,892
Serafina!

407
00:45:28,394 --> 00:45:29,978
Eurídice!

408
00:45:41,532 --> 00:45:42,825
Is that you?

409
00:45:42,950 --> 00:45:45,244
Serafina, answer me!

410
00:45:49,415 --> 00:45:50,999
Eurídice!

411
00:45:56,296 --> 00:45:57,840
Where are you?

412
00:46:00,592 --> 00:46:02,219
Idiot! You scared me!

413
00:46:02,344 --> 00:46:05,472
That's a good one.
I'm the one who scared you?

414
00:46:05,639 --> 00:46:08,183
- Where's my cousin?
- Your cousin?

415
00:46:08,350 --> 00:46:09,768
Yes, my cousin.

416
00:46:09,893 --> 00:46:11,937
Ah, that was your cousin?

417
00:46:12,104 --> 00:46:15,482
- You scared her too, right?
- Who, me?

418
00:46:15,649 --> 00:46:17,985
Fine.
I have to find her.

419
00:46:18,944 --> 00:46:20,612
Hold it.

420
00:46:20,821 --> 00:46:22,698
I came from Montevideo
just to see you.

421
00:46:22,823 --> 00:46:24,783
She'll find her way.

422
00:46:26,410 --> 00:46:28,954
- Where's Eurídice?
- He saw her, but she ran off.

423
00:46:29,121 --> 00:46:30,497
Where?

424
00:46:30,664 --> 00:46:32,291
Answer, man.

425
00:46:32,458 --> 00:46:34,251
I don't know. That way.

426
00:46:38,297 --> 00:46:39,965
He'll find her.

427
00:46:44,386 --> 00:46:46,013
Chico!

428
00:46:46,638 --> 00:46:49,475
My love!
- You're suffocating me!

429
00:47:54,706 --> 00:47:57,876
No! He'll kill you!

430
00:48:03,215 --> 00:48:05,050
Take care of her.

431
00:48:06,468 --> 00:48:08,637
I'm not in any hurry.

432
00:48:13,267 --> 00:48:15,727
We'll meet again later.

433
00:48:19,565 --> 00:48:20,899
So long.

434
00:48:56,602 --> 00:48:59,104
You're in my arms, Eurídice.

435
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:04,610
I'll protect you always,
from everything.

436
00:49:06,612 --> 00:49:08,530
I care for you, Eurídice.

437
00:49:14,953 --> 00:49:17,623
You'll never be frightened again.

438
00:49:52,991 --> 00:49:55,994
Chico Boto showed up.
You want to stay here?

439
00:49:57,204 --> 00:49:58,497
Yes.

440
00:49:59,331 --> 00:50:02,042
You needn't be frightened here.
Look here.

441
00:50:02,459 --> 00:50:04,086
They're great.

442
00:50:04,753 --> 00:50:08,298
This guy here will protect you too.
He's a real beast.

443
00:50:09,341 --> 00:50:10,884
And then...

444
00:50:11,677 --> 00:50:13,303
there's me.

445
00:50:15,180 --> 00:50:17,599
- Let go!
<i>- Orfeu, is that you?</i>

446
00:50:22,688 --> 00:50:25,524
I swear I heard talking.
Didn't you?

447
00:50:25,649 --> 00:50:27,984
- It was the dog.
- Talking?

448
00:50:28,110 --> 00:50:29,945
No. But so what?

449
00:50:35,867 --> 00:50:37,035
Gimme.

450
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:40,539
- She's in good hands.
- Who?

451
00:50:40,664 --> 00:50:43,750
- My cousin.
- Didn't she run off?

452
00:50:44,042 --> 00:50:47,462
Dummy. Open your mouth
and close your eyes.

453
00:50:47,629 --> 00:50:49,881
Wider.

454
00:51:00,225 --> 00:51:02,477
The dog tore
one of the little animals.

455
00:51:02,644 --> 00:51:06,064
They're not animals.
They're the signs of the zodiac.

456
00:51:06,565 --> 00:51:08,233
It's beautiful.

457
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:11,361
This is where I was born.
My house in the heavens.

458
00:51:11,528 --> 00:51:13,238
A baby sheep?

459
00:51:15,699 --> 00:51:20,370
I'll take the one next door,
so I'll always be near you.

460
00:51:21,913 --> 00:51:23,582
Would you like that?

461
00:51:38,180 --> 00:51:39,681
Good night.

462
00:51:41,516 --> 00:51:43,018
Good night.

463
00:51:49,858 --> 00:51:51,568
I'll sleep outside.

464
00:51:51,693 --> 00:51:54,529
I'll be closer to my house
in the heavens...

465
00:51:54,863 --> 00:51:56,531
and yours.

466
00:51:58,408 --> 00:52:00,202
Good night, Eurídice.

467
00:52:06,708 --> 00:52:10,712
One... two... three...

468
00:52:15,801 --> 00:52:19,387
- What a ruckus.
- I hope we can get some sleep.

469
00:52:46,832 --> 00:52:48,500
Come here.

470
00:52:50,210 --> 00:52:51,628
Come on.

471
00:52:57,843 --> 00:52:59,469
Got you!

472
00:53:02,430 --> 00:53:04,349
You haven't got me yet!

473
00:53:13,984 --> 00:53:16,069
<i>Come here, Serafina.</i>

474
00:53:16,862 --> 00:53:19,906
<i>No, you come catch me.</i>

475
00:53:20,031 --> 00:53:21,700
<i>I can't.</i>

476
00:53:25,662 --> 00:53:27,205
<i>I'll get you!</i>

477
00:53:28,373 --> 00:53:29,791
Did I hurt you?

478
00:53:33,461 --> 00:53:35,672
Poor thing.

479
00:53:41,595 --> 00:53:43,263
Does it still hurt?

480
00:53:43,430 --> 00:53:45,765
No, it's better now.

481
00:53:47,225 --> 00:53:48,685
Wait.

482
00:53:59,029 --> 00:54:00,572
I won, didn't I?

483
00:54:00,739 --> 00:54:02,574
You always win.

484
00:55:49,264 --> 00:55:51,266
Zeca!

485
00:55:55,854 --> 00:55:57,188
Let's go. It's time.

486
00:55:57,355 --> 00:55:58,940
Hurry.

487
00:55:59,107 --> 00:56:00,692
All right, I'm coming.

488
00:56:16,499 --> 00:56:20,086
It's too early to be up, boy.
Let us sleep in peace.

489
00:56:20,253 --> 00:56:22,756
Close that door.
- Yes, Grandma.

490
00:56:23,381 --> 00:56:25,842
Let's go! We're late!

491
00:56:27,177 --> 00:56:29,846
What are those devils
doing at this hour?

492
00:56:32,891 --> 00:56:34,893
Quiet, Caruso.

493
00:57:13,389 --> 00:57:16,226
He won't find it.
We better tell him.

494
00:57:16,392 --> 00:57:19,604
You're crazy.
Come on, let's watch.

495
00:57:20,105 --> 00:57:21,815
What if he's asleep?

496
00:57:22,982 --> 00:57:24,776
I'll knock on the door.

497
00:57:33,118 --> 00:57:35,078
What did I tell you?

498
00:57:38,248 --> 00:57:44,087
<i>My happiness is dreaming</i>

499
00:57:44,504 --> 00:57:49,801
<i>Deep within
my sweetheart's eyes</i>

500
00:57:50,176 --> 00:57:55,682
<i>It's like this night
passing swiftly by</i>

501
00:57:56,182 --> 00:58:00,228
<i>In search of the dawn</i>

502
00:58:00,728 --> 00:58:05,358
<i>Speak softly, please</i>

503
00:58:06,234 --> 00:58:08,736
<i>So she'll wake up happy</i>

504
00:58:08,903 --> 00:58:11,281
Look! It's rising!

505
00:58:15,326 --> 00:58:20,832
<i>Offering up kisses of love</i>

506
00:58:21,833 --> 00:58:23,209
It's true.

507
00:58:23,376 --> 00:58:28,298
<i>Sadness has no end</i>

508
00:58:30,925 --> 00:58:36,264
<i>But happiness does</i>

509
00:58:39,225 --> 00:58:47,775
<i>Happiness is like a dewdrop</i>

510
00:58:48,610 --> 00:58:52,363
<i>On a flower petal</i>

511
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:58,244
<i>It shines bright and still</i>

512
00:58:58,411 --> 00:59:02,540
<i>Then quivers lightly</i>

513
00:59:03,249 --> 00:59:09,297
<i>And falls like a lover's tear</i>

514
00:59:13,885 --> 00:59:15,970
Serafina,
aren't you in costume yet?

515
00:59:16,137 --> 00:59:18,640
No, Chico's here,
and he's always hungry!

516
00:59:18,765 --> 00:59:22,644
You look beautiful!
- Wait, let me get Orfeu!

517
00:59:22,936 --> 00:59:25,521
No, I'm in a hurry.
I'll run on ahead.

518
00:59:29,734 --> 00:59:31,236
Thanks.

519
00:59:33,071 --> 00:59:36,074
- Are you getting married today?
- Orfeu must have forgot.

520
00:59:36,241 --> 00:59:38,493
Why? Didn't he invite you?

521
00:59:43,039 --> 00:59:44,540
Eurídice!

522
00:59:47,335 --> 00:59:49,045
So there you two are.

523
00:59:49,212 --> 00:59:52,257
Quick,
get your costume on.

524
00:59:52,423 --> 00:59:54,759
No, not that way!
Come this way!

525
00:59:54,926 --> 00:59:57,971
- In a hurry, aren't we?
- Mira's coming.

526
00:59:58,137 --> 00:59:59,681
So let her come.

527
01:00:00,098 --> 01:00:02,225
Come on.
Aren't you ready yet?

528
01:00:02,350 --> 01:00:05,228
- I'm in no hurry.
- Is he crazy?

529
01:00:05,395 --> 01:00:07,313
Orfeu, you promised me —

530
01:00:07,438 --> 01:00:09,816
I'll keep your scarf.

531
01:00:09,983 --> 01:00:14,237
God, he's acting silly.
What did you do to him?

532
01:00:16,072 --> 01:00:19,284
You're up.
At least say good morning.

533
01:00:19,826 --> 01:00:22,120
- Who's this?
- My cousin.

534
01:00:23,955 --> 01:00:25,331
Your cousin?

535
01:00:27,125 --> 01:00:29,585
Don't start that again.
Go back to sleep.

536
01:00:30,086 --> 01:00:31,629
- I'm hungry.
- Wait.

537
01:00:31,796 --> 01:00:35,758
Always hungry.
Eat and stop bothering me.

538
01:00:35,967 --> 01:00:37,302
God help me.

539
01:00:37,427 --> 01:00:39,804
But what can I do?
I like him.

540
01:00:39,929 --> 01:00:42,015
It happens to everybody.

541
01:00:42,140 --> 01:00:44,475
You're the living proof.

542
01:00:45,560 --> 01:00:48,104
Wow.
It looks great on you.

543
01:00:48,229 --> 01:00:50,148
What am I supposed to drink?

544
01:00:50,940 --> 01:00:53,651
Here. Now don't let me
see your face again.

545
01:00:54,485 --> 01:00:57,238
- Nice costume.
- It was Orfeu's idea.

546
01:00:57,405 --> 01:00:59,490
- Lucky you.
- Me?

547
01:00:59,657 --> 01:01:03,661
Carnival's very nice, child,
but Chico leaves again tomorrow.

548
01:01:04,495 --> 01:01:05,997
Button that.

549
01:01:06,164 --> 01:01:09,667
I'd rather fool around with him.
- And I'd rather dance with Orfeu.

550
01:01:09,834 --> 01:01:11,836
<i>Orfeu, open the door!</i>

551
01:01:13,254 --> 01:01:14,839
What a fix.

552
01:01:15,548 --> 01:01:18,676
Say, what if you were
to dance in my place?

553
01:01:19,677 --> 01:01:21,846
Yes! That's it!

554
01:01:24,015 --> 01:01:26,893
<i>- Orfeu, open the door.
- I'm coming.</i>

555
01:01:29,687 --> 01:01:31,606
What are you doing?

556
01:01:32,190 --> 01:01:33,941
Can't you see?

557
01:01:38,237 --> 01:01:39,989
Do I look pretty?

558
01:01:41,032 --> 01:01:43,284
- Yes.
- What's the matter?

559
01:01:44,702 --> 01:01:46,329
You could at least look.

560
01:01:58,132 --> 01:02:00,134
You have a sore throat?

561
01:02:02,845 --> 01:02:05,139
Do you?
- Listen, Mira —

562
01:02:05,264 --> 01:02:08,017
Is this new?
Looks cheap.

563
01:02:08,142 --> 01:02:10,978
What are these little animals?

564
01:02:13,189 --> 01:02:16,818
They're not animals.
They're signs of the zodiac.

565
01:02:17,151 --> 01:02:20,363
Signs of the zodiac —
you don't say.

566
01:02:21,072 --> 01:02:25,701
And the girl next door took you
to heaven last night, right?

567
01:02:27,286 --> 01:02:28,663
Answer me.

568
01:02:29,580 --> 01:02:32,625
Here's what I think
of that bitch's dirty rag!

569
01:02:32,750 --> 01:02:34,335
I'll show you!

570
01:02:34,460 --> 01:02:35,837
It's her, isn't it?

571
01:02:36,003 --> 01:02:38,714
- Shut up!
- Afraid she'll hear?

572
01:02:39,590 --> 01:02:44,387
Listen, if I see her with you again,
I'll kill her!

573
01:02:47,849 --> 01:02:50,059
We came to help you
carry the sun.

574
01:02:51,436 --> 01:02:53,604
I'll wait for you outside.

575
01:02:59,986 --> 01:03:02,280
Here, take my tambourine.

576
01:03:09,537 --> 01:03:11,998
You look so pretty.

577
01:03:12,665 --> 01:03:15,960
- Who was that shouting next door?
- Oh, nobody.

578
01:03:16,127 --> 01:03:18,337
- Mira?
- Seems you already know.

579
01:03:18,504 --> 01:03:20,923
Orfeu told me everything.

580
01:03:21,299 --> 01:03:24,635
He promised to talk to her.
- I understand.

581
01:03:24,802 --> 01:03:28,264
<i>- Serafina, are you coming?</i>
- I'll be right there!

582
01:03:28,931 --> 01:03:33,311
She's gonna be furious
if she finds out.

583
01:03:33,478 --> 01:03:35,354
Quick, pull your veil down.
- Now?

584
01:03:35,480 --> 01:03:38,858
Yes, or Mira will think
I've been playing tricks on her.

585
01:03:38,983 --> 01:03:41,027
She can be really mean.

586
01:03:41,319 --> 01:03:42,361
I'm coming!

587
01:03:42,528 --> 01:03:46,574
Chico, wake up and give
my cousin a kiss, quick!

588
01:03:47,492 --> 01:03:49,410
- Your cousin?
- Yes!

589
01:03:50,536 --> 01:03:54,040
- That's her!
- You win the prize for smarts.

590
01:03:54,165 --> 01:03:58,669
She's me now, so kiss her
like it was me, okay?

591
01:04:00,421 --> 01:04:02,340
- Kiss her?
- Yes!

592
01:04:02,924 --> 01:04:04,675
Not here! At the door!

593
01:04:04,842 --> 01:04:06,844
I'm coming!

594
01:04:07,303 --> 01:04:09,889
Kiss her. Hard.

595
01:04:11,015 --> 01:04:12,683
That's enough!

596
01:04:13,100 --> 01:04:14,977
Say something to her.

597
01:04:16,312 --> 01:04:18,856
- Like what?
- What do you mean, what?

598
01:04:19,357 --> 01:04:22,985
What? What? What?

599
01:04:23,528 --> 01:04:25,530
I don't even know your cousin.

600
01:04:38,376 --> 01:04:41,504
Look at Serafina's costume.

601
01:04:41,629 --> 01:04:44,173
With all that veil,
you can't see her face.

602
01:04:44,340 --> 01:04:46,759
Trust me:
It's better that way!

603
01:04:56,060 --> 01:04:59,188
Orfeu, you gonna
stand there forever?

604
01:04:59,313 --> 01:05:00,731
Let's go.

605
01:05:03,985 --> 01:05:06,612
Run and ask Serafina
if Eurídice is coming.

606
01:05:10,783 --> 01:05:13,995
Serafina, Orfeu wants to know
if Eurídice's coming.

607
01:05:17,915 --> 01:05:20,334
Why do you have her amulet?

608
01:05:24,380 --> 01:05:27,758
- Is it a secret?
- Yes, and only Orfeu can know.

609
01:05:27,925 --> 01:05:30,761
I'll run and tell him
to wait for you.

610
01:06:38,663 --> 01:06:43,626
<i>Your attention, please.
Here comes the best!</i>

611
01:06:43,751 --> 01:06:45,711
<i>The Portela samba school!</i>

612
01:09:05,100 --> 01:09:06,811
Zeca!

613
01:09:06,936 --> 01:09:10,314
Ah, it's you. Come on.
Let's help hold the rope.

614
01:09:14,360 --> 01:09:16,403
Didn't even notice, did you?

615
01:09:16,821 --> 01:09:19,990
- What?
- I don't know. Look at Serafina.

616
01:09:31,919 --> 01:09:34,255
- I love you.
- And I love you, Orfeu.

617
01:09:39,802 --> 01:09:42,847
Let's go!
It's our turn!

618
01:10:32,354 --> 01:10:37,735
<i>Here comes
the United Babylon samba school!</i>

619
01:10:58,505 --> 01:11:03,177
<i>This is how our love will be</i>

620
01:11:03,427 --> 01:11:08,140
<i>Me for you and you for me</i>

621
01:12:14,039 --> 01:12:17,001
- Do you love me?
- Dance in your spot!

622
01:12:22,297 --> 01:12:23,716
Answer me!

623
01:12:23,882 --> 01:12:27,344
I meant to explain earlier.
Now it's too late. Go!

624
01:13:47,257 --> 01:13:50,260
- Where's your cousin?
- She's there and I'm here.

625
01:13:56,767 --> 01:14:00,020
How dare you!
Buy your own!

626
01:14:01,730 --> 01:14:03,690
Zeca, look. Death.

627
01:14:04,066 --> 01:14:06,110
That's just some guy in a mask.

628
01:14:26,213 --> 01:14:27,840
Look!

629
01:14:35,931 --> 01:14:37,182
My amulet!

630
01:14:39,309 --> 01:14:40,477
Eurídice!

631
01:14:43,272 --> 01:14:46,024
Careful, Benedito!
Grab it!

632
01:15:20,684 --> 01:15:22,311
<i>Your attention, please!</i>

633
01:15:22,436 --> 01:15:26,815
<i>Will Orfeu,
representative of United Babylon,</i>

634
01:15:26,982 --> 01:15:29,484
<i>please come to the jury stand.</i>

635
01:15:30,569 --> 01:15:33,614
Why did you choose Serafina
to dance with you?

636
01:15:33,739 --> 01:15:35,866
Not now.
The jury's calling me.

637
01:15:36,033 --> 01:15:38,202
Lourdes, come with me.

638
01:15:38,535 --> 01:15:41,955
<i>Orfeu, please report
to the jury stand.</i>

639
01:16:03,352 --> 01:16:05,270
We have to help Eurídice!

640
01:16:20,577 --> 01:16:24,039
Thank you.
This belongs to everyone. Look.

641
01:16:30,504 --> 01:16:32,214
I'll kill you!

642
01:17:06,790 --> 01:17:09,418
I'll kill you!

643
01:17:16,133 --> 01:17:17,718
Idiot!

644
01:17:20,012 --> 01:17:21,888
<i>Your attention, please!</i>

645
01:17:22,014 --> 01:17:24,850
<i>Here comes
the Mangueira school!</i>

646
01:17:57,132 --> 01:17:59,217
Eurídice!

647
01:18:00,093 --> 01:18:03,513
- Hermes!
- What's wrong, child? Calm down.

648
01:18:03,680 --> 01:18:05,307
He's going to kill me.

649
01:18:05,432 --> 01:18:07,851
Stop crying! Come on.

650
01:18:11,355 --> 01:18:13,190
He's going to kill me.

651
01:18:14,316 --> 01:18:17,277
Go to my house.
You'll be safe there.

652
01:18:17,736 --> 01:18:20,697
I'll tell Orfeu.
- No! I'm so scared.

653
01:18:20,864 --> 01:18:22,866
Calm down, child.

654
01:18:23,241 --> 01:18:26,870
I'll find him for you.
You know the way.

655
01:18:29,706 --> 01:18:31,208
Go, my child.

656
01:18:32,626 --> 01:18:34,544
Don't worry. Go on.

657
01:18:34,753 --> 01:18:37,881
I'll tell Orfeu right away.
Go!

658
01:21:15,664 --> 01:21:18,375
Eurídice, where are you?

659
01:21:49,990 --> 01:21:51,616
She's mine now.

660
01:22:43,293 --> 01:22:47,130
It's okay. It's nothing.

661
01:23:03,104 --> 01:23:05,940
- It's over, Orfeu.
- Eurídice.

662
01:23:26,670 --> 01:23:28,296
She's dead.

663
01:23:28,463 --> 01:23:30,674
No! I must see Eurídice.

664
01:23:30,840 --> 01:23:33,009
You can only see her dead.

665
01:23:34,844 --> 01:23:37,555
They just sent her
to the morgue.

666
01:23:37,806 --> 01:23:40,767
No, she's alive.
I'm going to find her.

667
01:23:41,851 --> 01:23:45,105
It's true, Orfeu. Wait!

668
01:23:45,689 --> 01:23:47,524
May I go?
- Yes.

669
01:23:47,691 --> 01:23:50,944
Orfeu, wait!

670
01:23:52,237 --> 01:23:55,281
- They all react like that at first.
- No.

671
01:23:55,865 --> 01:23:58,201
They loved each other.

672
01:23:58,493 --> 01:24:00,161
It was true love.

673
01:24:00,286 --> 01:24:03,540
True love?
Is there such a thing?

674
01:24:05,375 --> 01:24:06,918
There is.

675
01:24:19,389 --> 01:24:21,683
Orfeu, wait for me!

676
01:24:32,569 --> 01:24:34,404
I'd like some information.

677
01:24:41,202 --> 01:24:44,205
Are you family?
If not, you can't stay here.

678
01:24:52,589 --> 01:24:55,091
This is off-limits.
You can't come in.

679
01:24:57,886 --> 01:24:59,429
Eurídice!

680
01:25:01,139 --> 01:25:02,766
Stop!

681
01:25:04,017 --> 01:25:05,393
You can't go up there!

682
01:25:05,852 --> 01:25:07,228
Get out of here.

683
01:25:18,948 --> 01:25:20,450
It went up.

684
01:25:33,713 --> 01:25:35,048
Stop!

685
01:25:38,760 --> 01:25:40,428
What do you want?

686
01:25:44,307 --> 01:25:45,975
What are you doing here?

687
01:25:47,185 --> 01:25:50,271
- Nothing.
- Then please leave.

688
01:25:50,605 --> 01:25:52,649
You can't be here,
and we don't have time.

689
01:26:52,083 --> 01:26:54,335
Don't be sad, Orfeu.

690
01:27:30,413 --> 01:27:32,248
The party's over.

691
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:35,585
Party's over.

692
01:27:43,426 --> 01:27:45,303
Hold this one.

693
01:27:45,970 --> 01:27:49,599
What do you want?
- Hey, I know this guy.

694
01:27:49,766 --> 01:27:51,976
Aren't you Orfeu
of the Babylon school?

695
01:27:52,101 --> 01:27:55,021
He's incredible.
A great singer.

696
01:27:55,146 --> 01:27:58,816
Sing that song of yours.
How did it go?

697
01:27:59,025 --> 01:28:01,402
Sing, man.
What's your problem?

698
01:28:01,611 --> 01:28:04,781
- I'm looking for a missing person.
- That's not here.

699
01:28:04,948 --> 01:28:08,534
These are just brawlers.
Missing Persons is in Precinct 12.

700
01:28:08,785 --> 01:28:11,287
- Where's that?
- I'll show you. Come on.

701
01:28:15,375 --> 01:28:17,377
Show me that step you did.

702
01:28:17,585 --> 01:28:21,339
You know, that one that —
Like this.

703
01:28:23,549 --> 01:28:26,803
Okay, get out of here.
That door over there.

704
01:28:27,303 --> 01:28:29,722
Beat it, kid!

705
01:28:32,350 --> 01:28:33,476
Scram!

706
01:29:11,180 --> 01:29:12,974
Anybody there?

707
01:29:23,860 --> 01:29:25,737
What are you looking for,
brother?

708
01:29:27,030 --> 01:29:29,198
The Missing Persons department.

709
01:29:31,117 --> 01:29:34,245
There is such a department,

710
01:29:34,829 --> 01:29:37,707
but I never saw
any missing persons there.

711
01:29:37,832 --> 01:29:40,126
Just mountains of paper.

712
01:29:40,501 --> 01:29:42,795
Missing Persons is right here.

713
01:29:47,383 --> 01:29:50,386
See? There's no one there.

714
01:29:50,720 --> 01:29:53,222
Just piles of paper.

715
01:29:54,766 --> 01:29:58,728
The whole place is full of it.
Fifteen floors of paper.

716
01:29:59,604 --> 01:30:01,105
All for nothing.

717
01:30:02,398 --> 01:30:04,067
Can you read?

718
01:30:05,109 --> 01:30:06,861
- Yes.
- I can't.

719
01:30:07,570 --> 01:30:10,198
Look around if you like.

720
01:30:20,750 --> 01:30:23,753
But you won't find any missing persons
among those papers.

721
01:30:23,920 --> 01:30:26,923
On the contrary.
That's where they go missing.

722
01:30:39,393 --> 01:30:41,729
Are you in pain, my brother?

723
01:30:42,605 --> 01:30:44,565
I lost Eurídice.

724
01:30:47,944 --> 01:30:51,781
It's as if she were burning
inside my heart.

725
01:30:52,156 --> 01:30:55,284
Keep calling to her.
She'll come.

726
01:30:56,369 --> 01:30:58,287
I've been calling to her.

727
01:30:59,080 --> 01:31:01,916
Your voice alone
isn't strong enough,

728
01:31:02,583 --> 01:31:06,462
and these papers
can't answer you back.

729
01:31:06,796 --> 01:31:09,799
You think these papers
care about anybody?

730
01:31:12,468 --> 01:31:15,429
Come, my brother.
I know where to take you.

731
01:31:16,889 --> 01:31:18,349
Let's go.

732
01:31:19,142 --> 01:31:21,561
Besides,
whether I sweep or not,

733
01:31:21,686 --> 01:31:24,105
the paper keeps piling up.

734
01:32:04,687 --> 01:32:06,022
Come, Orfeu.

735
01:32:09,567 --> 01:32:10,568
Quiet!

736
01:32:10,735 --> 01:32:12,862
Calm down, Cerberus.

737
01:32:13,029 --> 01:32:14,864
Calm down, Cerberus.

738
01:35:56,961 --> 01:36:00,714
That's right.
She received the spirit.

739
01:37:05,112 --> 01:37:07,656
Call to her.
Sing, Orfeu.

740
01:37:25,591 --> 01:37:27,009
Sing, Orfeu.

741
01:37:27,510 --> 01:37:29,929
Go on. Sing.

742
01:38:17,309 --> 01:38:20,479
<i>No, you mustn't
look back, Orfeu,</i>

743
01:38:20,604 --> 01:38:22,690
<i>or you'll never see me again.</i>

744
01:38:22,815 --> 01:38:24,525
Where are you, Eurídice?

745
01:38:24,692 --> 01:38:27,361
<i>I'm getting closer, Orfeu.</i>

746
01:38:27,653 --> 01:38:31,740
<i>Do you love me enough
to hear my voice but not see me?</i>

747
01:38:32,491 --> 01:38:35,911
I love you, Eurídice,
but I want to see you.

748
01:38:36,036 --> 01:38:37,913
My arms are empty.

749
01:38:38,038 --> 01:38:41,083
I want to see you
and hold you close —

750
01:38:41,208 --> 01:38:44,753
<i>No! You'll lose me forever,
Orfeu.</i>

751
01:38:46,005 --> 01:38:48,757
You're not there.
You're tricking me!

752
01:38:50,759 --> 01:38:52,469
I want to see you!

753
01:38:52,928 --> 01:38:55,097
Orfeu, you're killing me.

754
01:38:55,514 --> 01:38:58,100
Farewell, Orfeu.
You'll never see me again.

755
01:38:59,351 --> 01:39:01,437
Why did you lie to me?

756
01:39:01,895 --> 01:39:04,148
You lied to me!
- Calm down, Orfeu.

757
01:39:04,315 --> 01:39:06,317
Don't leave!

758
01:39:44,021 --> 01:39:46,857
Hermes, that's him!

759
01:39:58,160 --> 01:40:01,413
Orfeu, it's me.

760
01:40:02,873 --> 01:40:04,792
Hermes is here too.

761
01:40:05,834 --> 01:40:08,337
I have nothing left to live for.

762
01:40:09,171 --> 01:40:11,715
I'm poorer
than the poorest of black men.

763
01:40:11,840 --> 01:40:13,676
Beg for mercy, my son.

764
01:40:13,801 --> 01:40:15,636
We're all poor,

765
01:40:15,761 --> 01:40:20,224
and the only words left for us
are those of the poor man:

766
01:40:20,432 --> 01:40:22,226
Thank you.

767
01:40:29,233 --> 01:40:31,652
I beg for your mercy, Hermes.

768
01:40:31,902 --> 01:40:34,947
All I can offer you
is man's mercy.

769
01:40:37,032 --> 01:40:38,534
Here.

770
01:40:41,120 --> 01:40:43,706
I've done
all that had to be done.

771
01:40:43,872 --> 01:40:48,127
I think you'll find
true mercy there.

772
01:40:54,883 --> 01:40:56,218
Thank you, Hermes.

773
01:40:57,219 --> 01:40:58,929
No, my son.

774
01:40:59,096 --> 01:41:01,724
Save your thanks for Eurídice.

775
01:41:06,478 --> 01:41:08,063
Let's see.

776
01:41:10,607 --> 01:41:13,068
Are you going
to take the body?

777
01:41:13,318 --> 01:41:15,237
Because if not —

778
01:41:17,406 --> 01:41:18,949
Very well.

779
01:41:19,241 --> 01:41:20,784
Come with me.

780
01:41:29,293 --> 01:41:31,378
Because if you don't want to,

781
01:41:31,545 --> 01:41:37,676
another cadaver is always of use
to doctors and scientists.

782
01:41:37,885 --> 01:41:41,472
Works out cheaper
for you too.

783
01:41:43,766 --> 01:41:49,104
I only ask
because I'm required to.

784
01:41:49,313 --> 01:41:52,566
And the truth is,

785
01:41:52,691 --> 01:41:54,777
once you're here...

786
01:41:59,573 --> 01:42:01,325
Carnival is over.

787
01:42:01,492 --> 01:42:03,702
There's nothing anyone can do.

788
01:42:06,038 --> 01:42:07,998
Would you like to identify her?

789
01:42:08,624 --> 01:42:11,794
Careful. You'll catch a cold
dressed like that.

790
01:42:12,669 --> 01:42:14,963
Death is cheap here, eh?

791
01:42:15,422 --> 01:42:18,258
Careful.
You're shaking all over.

792
01:42:18,634 --> 01:42:21,345
The same thing happens to me.

793
01:42:22,137 --> 01:42:24,014
It's no use being careful.

794
01:42:24,348 --> 01:42:27,017
I have a cold year-round.

795
01:43:11,144 --> 01:43:13,188
Everything's beautiful, Eurídice.

796
01:43:13,856 --> 01:43:18,443
My heart's like a bird whose thirst
is quenched by a single dewdrop.

797
01:43:19,486 --> 01:43:21,363
Thank you, Eurídice.

798
01:43:21,905 --> 01:43:24,408
Thank you for this new day.

799
01:43:40,591 --> 01:43:43,552
It's you who's carrying me.

800
01:43:44,219 --> 01:43:47,764
I rest in your arms
like a sleeping child,

801
01:43:48,557 --> 01:43:51,393
and from the sweet breath
in your bosom,

802
01:43:51,685 --> 01:43:55,647
I know you'll take me
where I must go.

803
01:44:07,242 --> 01:44:09,244
Thank you, Eurídice.

804
01:44:09,494 --> 01:44:12,915
The path you've chosen
is laden with flowers.

805
01:44:14,249 --> 01:44:17,753
The sun is rising
to welcome us, my love.

806
01:44:21,798 --> 01:44:23,884
Sing, Eurídice.

807
01:44:26,136 --> 01:44:31,266
<i>The happiness of the poor</i>

808
01:44:31,934 --> 01:44:35,896
<i>Is like the great illusion of Carnival</i>

809
01:44:37,439 --> 01:44:43,278
<i>We work all year long</i>

810
01:44:53,747 --> 01:44:55,457
You snake!

811
01:44:55,624 --> 01:44:57,167
I'll kill you!

812
01:44:57,334 --> 01:45:01,088
I'll grind you to dust!

813
01:45:01,338 --> 01:45:03,173
I'll kill you both!

814
01:45:37,833 --> 01:45:39,251
Zeca!

815
01:45:42,254 --> 01:45:44,464
Hurry!

816
01:45:45,424 --> 01:45:48,093
Play and make the sun rise!
- I can't.

817
01:45:48,218 --> 01:45:49,803
- Sure you can.
- I don't know if I can.

818
01:45:49,970 --> 01:45:51,930
You can.
Make something up.

819
01:45:56,518 --> 01:45:58,687
- Come on, play.
- I don't know how.

820
01:45:58,854 --> 01:46:01,023
Yes, you do. Come on.

821
01:46:19,541 --> 01:46:23,170
He plays well, doesn't he?
What are you looking at?

822
01:46:23,295 --> 01:46:26,423
Shut up.
He's making the sun rise.

823
01:46:38,810 --> 01:46:42,564
He made the sun rise.

824
01:46:42,731 --> 01:46:45,067
Wow. Just like Orfeu.

825
01:46:45,358 --> 01:46:48,070
Now you're Orfeu.

826
01:46:48,528 --> 01:46:51,073
Yes, you are.
Take this flower.

827
01:46:51,323 --> 01:46:54,076
Play a song for me.

828
01:47:13,095 --> 01:47:14,596
Come on!
