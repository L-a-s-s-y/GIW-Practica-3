1
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:57,510
Miss Alisha, Father wants you
to eat breakfast with him.

2
00:03:02,807 --> 00:03:04,017
In a minute.

3
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:06,603
Father says he can't stay long.

4
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:08,188
Come on.

5
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:36,633
I want to look for a job.

6
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:39,719
You need more money? How much?

7
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:42,472
I just want to be kept busy.

8
00:03:43,514 --> 00:03:46,351
I feel bored to death
when I'm just in the house

9
00:03:46,851 --> 00:03:48,311
waiting for you to come.

10
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:53,358
Why don't you let me go
out of the country with you?

11
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:56,110
I'm going to work.

12
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:00,573
I could stay in a hotel

13
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:02,408
or go for a walk on my own.

14
00:04:13,461 --> 00:04:15,838
Unless that other woman
has already asked to come along.

15
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,477
I was just joking. No need to get upset.

16
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:52,458
BASTARD

17
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:17,859
Where is this job interview?

18
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:26,284
This is the address.

19
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:35,960
MULTIZONAMEDIA COMPANY

20
00:05:58,566 --> 00:06:00,068
Who have you worked for?

21
00:06:00,651 --> 00:06:02,779
I've never had a job. I've just graduated.

22
00:06:12,997 --> 00:06:14,082
Do you have something else?

23
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:18,378
Something with a more
serious style, perhaps?

24
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:21,464
That's all I have, sir.

25
00:06:22,131 --> 00:06:24,300
But this is my style.

26
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:32,392
Twenty years old.

27
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:35,728
So young.

28
00:06:40,149 --> 00:06:41,067
Hello?

29
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:47,949
Okay, I'll take it outside.

30
00:06:58,793 --> 00:06:59,836
Yes?

31
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:02,547
Oh. Hello, sir.

32
00:07:04,048 --> 00:07:05,049
Oh yes.

33
00:07:06,342 --> 00:07:07,468
What can I do for you?

34
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:15,476
Is that so?

35
00:07:17,728 --> 00:07:18,688
All right, sir.

36
00:07:22,358 --> 00:07:23,943
No problem. Good day, sir.

37
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:34,871
When can you start work?

38
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:36,664
I got the job?

39
00:07:37,665 --> 00:07:39,500
-Yes.
-Why?

40
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:41,210
What do you mean?

41
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:44,922
A moment ago,
you were not sure about my ability.

42
00:07:46,257 --> 00:07:47,467
I never said that.

43
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:49,010
Who was on the phone?

44
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:55,600
I need a designer as soon as possible.

45
00:07:55,683 --> 00:07:57,351
And I like your portfolio.

46
00:07:58,144 --> 00:08:01,272
So I'll try to ignore
your impolite attitude,

47
00:08:01,355 --> 00:08:03,649
asking me who I was
talking to on the phone.

48
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:22,960
So, what do you think, Alisha?

49
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:39,519
Yes, sir. Okay.

50
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:41,938
Give me your phone.

51
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:47,443
MISTER HARYO

52
00:08:55,451 --> 00:08:57,203
<i>Multizonamedia. How may I help you?</i>

53
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:00,581
We're going home. Now.

54
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:55,761
You look really pretty, Alisha.

55
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,910
No one believes me.

56
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:04,830
But I know your father's plan.

57
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:14,924
Look, Alisha.

58
00:11:16,592 --> 00:11:19,720
This is what he is going to use
to kill me.

59
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:38,322
We were confused
about what name to give you.

60
00:11:44,161 --> 00:11:45,371
Ajeng,

61
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:48,958
Kirana,

62
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:51,210
or Alisha.

63
00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:57,758
Then…

64
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:01,887
your father gave in
and agreed to my choice.

65
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:07,017
But since your father met that woman,

66
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:09,270
he's become her dog.

67
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:15,818
She tells your father to kill me

68
00:12:16,318 --> 00:12:18,654
after your little brother is born.

69
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:24,994
But Mommy won't let that happen.

70
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:29,123
Your brother will never be born.

71
00:12:32,626 --> 00:12:34,712
You two will…

72
00:12:36,672 --> 00:12:38,299
never be hers.

73
00:12:42,344 --> 00:12:45,431
There's only one way,
Alisha, my lovely daughter.

74
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:50,269
You,

75
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:52,772
your little brother,

76
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:55,941
and Mommy,

77
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:59,278
we will be together again in Heaven.

78
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,294
Mommy can't do it, Alisha.

79
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:19,548
Mommy really can't do it!

80
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:26,222
You have to do it yourself.

81
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:27,515
After me.

82
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:38,234
Everything happens for a reason, Alisha.

83
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:01,483
Who's the guy cleaning the pool?

84
00:15:02,818 --> 00:15:06,155
He's replacing Mr. Pono
while he's on holiday.

85
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,366
Where is he from?

86
00:15:10,034 --> 00:15:14,204
He said that he sometimes
works for Mrs. Pono.

87
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:18,250
She owns a food stall in Block S.

88
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:20,169
Block S?

89
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:24,006
There are lots of roadside stalls there.

90
00:15:24,548 --> 00:15:29,303
They sell dumplings, satay, fried rice.

91
00:15:29,845 --> 00:15:32,056
They're all in Block S.

92
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:25,234
Miss Tuti! I'm going home!

93
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:26,527
Wait a minute!

94
00:16:49,466 --> 00:16:51,927
-What time will you come tomorrow?
-In the morning.

95
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:53,554
Thanks, Miss Tuti.

96
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:32,361
Miss Tuti!

97
00:18:32,861 --> 00:18:33,987
I'm going home!

98
00:18:34,822 --> 00:18:35,697
Hold on!

99
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:54,383
Thanks.

100
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:33,046
Miss Tuti, where's the pool cleaner?

101
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:35,632
He doesn't work here anymore.

102
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:37,301
Mr. Pono will be back tomorrow.

103
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:40,220
Why do you ask?

104
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:46,643
No reason.

105
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,934
Mr. Bambang, I'm going out.

106
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:37,861
Mr. Bambang, do you know
a place to eat called Block S?

107
00:20:41,031 --> 00:20:42,115
You want to go there?

108
00:21:08,225 --> 00:21:12,562
Okay, good afternoon.
You're with us again.

109
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:16,775
This is for the guests under the tent.

110
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:20,862
We will entertain you
with some of our songs.

111
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:30,998
One orange juice, please.

112
00:22:59,461 --> 00:23:00,420
Yes?

113
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:02,339
Are you going to be long?

114
00:23:03,006 --> 00:23:05,592
Yes, I am. No need to wait for me.
You can go home.

115
00:23:06,676 --> 00:23:07,844
I'll just wait.

116
00:23:27,447 --> 00:23:29,449
-Hey, Bar!
-What's up?

117
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:32,536
-Where have you been?
-Hey, ma'am.

118
00:23:35,122 --> 00:23:36,706
I've been working.

119
00:23:37,499 --> 00:23:40,794
-No wonder you brought an envelope. Cool!
-Tacky.

120
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:44,089
-Come on. Buy us some drinks.
-Thanks, ma'am.

121
00:23:44,172 --> 00:23:45,215
See you, guys.

122
00:23:57,769 --> 00:24:00,439
Block S to the left.

123
00:24:00,522 --> 00:24:01,857
Let's go.

124
00:25:02,751 --> 00:25:06,379
You're still studying?

125
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:10,008
I'll be done in a moment.

126
00:25:10,091 --> 00:25:11,051
Let's eat.

127
00:25:12,844 --> 00:25:13,803
What did you get?

128
00:25:14,846 --> 00:25:15,805
This.

129
00:25:16,848 --> 00:25:18,225
Gado-gado again?

130
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:22,854
Don't worry. When I'm rich,

131
00:25:22,938 --> 00:25:25,440
I'll take you to expensive restaurants
every night.

132
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:27,567
I'm just kidding, dear.

133
00:25:27,651 --> 00:25:30,695
As long as I'm with you,
I don't care if I eat at all.

134
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:33,281
Yeah, right. You're so cheesy.

135
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:38,245
FOR RENT

136
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:43,500
Miss Alisha, I was scared to death.

137
00:25:43,583 --> 00:25:45,627
Where have you been?

138
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:47,379
I just wanted to be alone.

139
00:25:47,462 --> 00:25:48,588
Don't do that.

140
00:25:49,089 --> 00:25:51,174
I'll get in trouble with your father.

141
00:25:51,258 --> 00:25:53,552
If he gets mad, just say it's my fault.

142
00:25:58,515 --> 00:26:01,351
Wherever and whenever you
want to go out, I can take you.

143
00:26:01,434 --> 00:26:02,519
You just need to ask.

144
00:26:02,602 --> 00:26:04,437
I'm bored going out with you.

145
00:26:05,188 --> 00:26:08,275
Bored or not, that's my job.

146
00:26:08,775 --> 00:26:12,445
What are you getting mad for?
Have you forgotten who's the boss here?

147
00:26:12,529 --> 00:26:14,155
Now, you listen.

148
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:16,908
Your father is my boss, not you.

149
00:26:17,492 --> 00:26:19,578
My job is to look after you!

150
00:26:20,662 --> 00:26:22,455
Okay, that's enough.

151
00:26:22,539 --> 00:26:27,586
Miss, it's fine if you don't
want to go out with Bambang.

152
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:29,629
Next time, let me accompany you.

153
00:26:29,713 --> 00:26:32,215
You want to go with her?
She'll go off by herself in a minute.

154
00:26:32,299 --> 00:26:34,259
You can't even look after a girl.

155
00:26:34,342 --> 00:26:36,511
Weren't you a private detective before?

156
00:27:46,414 --> 00:27:47,666
These are for you.

157
00:27:48,708 --> 00:27:50,085
I'm sorry about last night.

158
00:28:07,852 --> 00:28:09,312
But these are expensive.

159
00:28:09,396 --> 00:28:11,106
That's okay for once in a while.

160
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:19,656
You still want to take me around, right?

161
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:22,784
I promise I won't go off by myself again.

162
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:50,478
How long are you going to be
in the music studio?

163
00:28:51,104 --> 00:28:52,772
Only until the afternoon.

164
00:28:52,856 --> 00:28:55,650
Why don't you come inside
and watch me practice?

165
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:11,291
Please carry these.
My friends are waiting.

166
00:29:11,916 --> 00:29:14,085
Later, come back to take my cello.

167
00:30:36,376 --> 00:30:37,377
Please come in.

168
00:30:40,088 --> 00:30:40,922
Thank you.

169
00:30:52,642 --> 00:30:56,354
Pecel!

170
00:30:57,188 --> 00:31:01,359
Pecel!

171
00:31:38,813 --> 00:31:41,024
Who did you tell your parents
you lived with?

172
00:31:41,524 --> 00:31:43,318
With no one.

173
00:31:43,818 --> 00:31:44,694
I'm not crazy.

174
00:31:45,528 --> 00:31:47,989
They think <i>samenleven</i>
means premarital cohabitation.

175
00:31:48,489 --> 00:31:50,742
When it only means to live together.

176
00:31:50,825 --> 00:31:53,703
It's not just couples
who live together before marriage.

177
00:31:55,538 --> 00:31:58,416
Different races living in the same country
are also <i>samenleven</i>.

178
00:31:59,292 --> 00:32:00,793
And your point is?

179
00:32:01,461 --> 00:32:03,004
My point is

180
00:32:03,087 --> 00:32:07,467
Indonesians have many ways of giving
negative connotations to many things.

181
00:32:08,426 --> 00:32:09,469
Example?

182
00:32:10,511 --> 00:32:12,972
Well, we live together
because we love each other.

183
00:32:14,098 --> 00:32:15,350
Who's in love?

184
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:18,061
Why are you such a pain today?

185
00:32:58,851 --> 00:32:59,978
What's up?

186
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:03,231
Right. My friend's studying.
She has an exam tomorrow.

187
00:33:03,314 --> 00:33:04,732
So I came over.

188
00:33:05,525 --> 00:33:06,818
I'm scared she'll get pissed.

189
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:08,903
If she gets pissed, ouch.

190
00:33:11,906 --> 00:33:12,824
So?

191
00:33:16,035 --> 00:33:17,245
Oh, right. Sorry.

192
00:33:21,249 --> 00:33:22,542
What are you doing?

193
00:33:23,543 --> 00:33:25,378
I can't drain water out of the sink.

194
00:33:28,756 --> 00:33:29,674
Can I take a look?

195
00:33:55,783 --> 00:33:56,993
Try and open the faucet.

196
00:34:04,125 --> 00:34:05,418
You need to tighten it.

197
00:34:05,918 --> 00:34:08,004
Hitting it won't do any good.

198
00:34:20,266 --> 00:34:21,768
The water here is quite dirty.

199
00:34:23,936 --> 00:34:26,647
But I have a spare filter.

200
00:34:28,983 --> 00:34:29,901
Do you want it?

201
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:39,243
I'll go and get it.

202
00:34:41,412 --> 00:34:42,622
Can I come with you?

203
00:34:43,164 --> 00:34:45,666
I'd like to see
what the other rooms look like.

204
00:35:01,474 --> 00:35:04,393
Renta, we've got a new neighbor.

205
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:07,021
Hi. I'm Renta.

206
00:35:08,147 --> 00:35:09,065
Mia.

207
00:35:13,277 --> 00:35:14,612
I haven't introduced myself.

208
00:35:15,822 --> 00:35:16,656
I'm Bari.

209
00:35:20,451 --> 00:35:22,245
Bari told me you're studying for an exam.

210
00:35:22,328 --> 00:35:24,372
I'd better go.
I don't want to disturb you.

211
00:35:24,455 --> 00:35:25,414
No, not at all.

212
00:35:25,498 --> 00:35:29,252
If Bari sees someone reading,
he automatically thinks they're studying.

213
00:35:32,171 --> 00:35:33,506
What are you reading?

214
00:35:33,589 --> 00:35:35,258
It's just a coursebook.

215
00:35:36,676 --> 00:35:38,177
Renta is a budding psychologist.

216
00:35:40,555 --> 00:35:42,557
You never read the psychology book
I bought you.

217
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:44,851
That's just pop psychology, Bari.

218
00:35:44,934 --> 00:35:46,894
It doesn't have anything to do
with what I study.

219
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:47,937
What book?

220
00:35:48,646 --> 00:35:50,523
You know, self-help.

221
00:35:50,606 --> 00:35:52,984
How would I know?
It came from the psychology shelf.

222
00:35:53,067 --> 00:35:54,735
Read it, then.

223
00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:55,695
I can't be bothered.

224
00:35:55,778 --> 00:35:58,364
-A writer who doesn't like reading.
-I read.

225
00:35:58,447 --> 00:36:00,366
You never finish.

226
00:36:00,449 --> 00:36:04,704
Every good book I read makes me jealous

227
00:36:04,787 --> 00:36:06,706
and makes me want to write.

228
00:36:06,789 --> 00:36:08,040
You're a writer?

229
00:36:08,124 --> 00:36:11,669
Just like reading, he never finishes it!

230
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:14,881
One day, my book will be released,

231
00:36:14,964 --> 00:36:18,176
and it'll have "New York Times Bestseller"
written on the cover.

232
00:36:18,718 --> 00:36:19,927
You just wait,

233
00:36:21,053 --> 00:36:22,013
Miss Shrink.

234
00:36:22,555 --> 00:36:23,681
Are you at university?

235
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:25,558
No.

236
00:36:29,729 --> 00:36:31,355
Who likes rabbits?

237
00:36:31,439 --> 00:36:32,481
I do.

238
00:36:33,357 --> 00:36:34,692
Oh, hold on.

239
00:36:42,575 --> 00:36:44,076
Where did you steal this from?

240
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,578
From a rich person's house.

241
00:36:45,661 --> 00:36:47,288
They can just buy another one.

242
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:50,583
It's cute.

243
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:54,212
Psychologists shouldn't like
childish stuff like that.

244
00:36:56,672 --> 00:36:57,798
It's so cute.

245
00:36:58,633 --> 00:37:00,218
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

246
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:04,013
Are you friends or family?

247
00:37:54,855 --> 00:37:56,357
Oh shit! I am late!

248
00:37:57,733 --> 00:38:01,445
Relax. The traffic's not bad at this hour.

249
00:38:02,989 --> 00:38:05,324
By the way, our money
has nearly all gone, Bar.

250
00:38:05,866 --> 00:38:07,034
All right!

251
00:38:07,785 --> 00:38:09,120
Off you go!

252
00:40:46,527 --> 00:40:47,736
Wow. That sounded great.

253
00:40:49,697 --> 00:40:51,407
-Cello?
-Yes.

254
00:40:54,827 --> 00:40:55,786
Are you a musician?

255
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:57,371
No. It's just a hobby.

256
00:40:59,623 --> 00:41:00,833
Is it difficult to play?

257
00:41:01,417 --> 00:41:02,418
Have a go.

258
00:41:12,344 --> 00:41:13,262
Sorry.

259
00:41:16,348 --> 00:41:17,558
Place your hand like this.

260
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:34,241
It sounds bad now.

261
00:41:40,122 --> 00:41:41,749
You used a cassette, didn't you?

262
00:41:51,967 --> 00:41:53,093
Why did you move here?

263
00:41:55,471 --> 00:41:57,389
My parents died a long time ago.

264
00:41:57,890 --> 00:41:59,433
I lived with my aunt.

265
00:42:00,059 --> 00:42:02,102
I felt it was time for me to move out.

266
00:42:02,937 --> 00:42:03,979
Where do you work?

267
00:42:05,105 --> 00:42:07,233
I am still looking working for work. You?

268
00:42:09,109 --> 00:42:10,861
I'll do any work.

269
00:42:11,987 --> 00:42:15,366
Paint walls or be a driver.

270
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:21,830
Why did you choose to live here?

271
00:42:24,124 --> 00:42:25,334
I had a mate

272
00:42:26,168 --> 00:42:27,920
who told me
that if I wanted to be a writer

273
00:42:28,003 --> 00:42:29,880
and find inspiration,

274
00:42:30,506 --> 00:42:32,216
I should live in a block of flats.

275
00:42:33,092 --> 00:42:34,218
He was right.

276
00:42:37,471 --> 00:42:39,265
This block of flats is like a circus.

277
00:42:40,099 --> 00:42:42,643
You get all types
and loads of weirdos here.

278
00:42:44,186 --> 00:42:45,938
Have you got any material for your book?

279
00:42:47,064 --> 00:42:48,357
Oh, I've got lots.

280
00:42:52,152 --> 00:42:53,112
But I don't know.

281
00:42:53,779 --> 00:42:57,575
It seems that I can't find a good ending
for any story I write.

282
00:42:59,076 --> 00:43:03,956
Maybe because I use real people
from these flats for my characters.

283
00:43:06,083 --> 00:43:08,210
They continue to live their lives.

284
00:43:08,711 --> 00:43:09,795
If you think about it,

285
00:43:10,296 --> 00:43:13,215
that's the difference
between fiction and reality.

286
00:43:13,882 --> 00:43:15,050
Fiction has an ending,

287
00:43:15,551 --> 00:43:18,053
but in the real world, life goes on.

288
00:43:24,101 --> 00:43:25,811
Have you explored all the stories?

289
00:43:26,353 --> 00:43:27,271
Not yet.

290
00:43:30,274 --> 00:43:31,400
What have you seen, then?

291
00:43:32,359 --> 00:43:33,360
What's to see?

292
00:43:34,987 --> 00:43:37,156
So, you haven't been out
since moving here?

293
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:44,538
-Come on.
-Where to?

294
00:43:45,164 --> 00:43:46,582
I'll give you a free tour.

295
00:43:59,178 --> 00:44:01,138
The first floor is the business district.

296
00:44:01,221 --> 00:44:02,973
You can find anything you want here.

297
00:44:03,057 --> 00:44:06,060
Food, telephone service, Xerox machines,

298
00:44:06,143 --> 00:44:07,853
hairdresser, bathroom supplies.

299
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:09,480
They are all here.

300
00:44:10,272 --> 00:44:12,232
The second floor is mostly
regular families.

301
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:14,276
Hello, ma'am.

302
00:44:14,818 --> 00:44:17,363
It's the noisiest as there are many kids.

303
00:44:21,325 --> 00:44:24,286
The third floor is interesting.

304
00:44:24,870 --> 00:44:27,373
There are lots of lady-boys. Transsexuals.

305
00:44:28,082 --> 00:44:29,917
Monday to Thursday, they're men.

306
00:44:30,918 --> 00:44:32,670
On the weekend, they become women.

307
00:44:33,629 --> 00:44:35,214
They all stay in the same room.

308
00:44:37,132 --> 00:44:39,635
They work at park entrances
and a few other places.

309
00:44:41,053 --> 00:44:43,347
The fourth floor is mostly occupied
by whores.

310
00:44:43,430 --> 00:44:45,933
Pardon my language,
but that's what they are.

311
00:44:46,016 --> 00:44:48,852
They're pretty high class,
so they don't look like prostitutes.

312
00:44:49,395 --> 00:44:52,272
They stay in this cheap block of flats
so they can save money

313
00:44:52,356 --> 00:44:54,233
and send it to their family
in the countryside.

314
00:44:54,316 --> 00:44:56,485
Lots of them still have families
in the countryside.

315
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:03,033
The fifth floor is a nest of drug dealers.
You can get anything up here.

316
00:45:03,117 --> 00:45:05,786
If you need some weed,
you just have to go down one floor.

317
00:45:05,869 --> 00:45:07,705
Or you can just knock on my door.

318
00:45:11,208 --> 00:45:14,336
On our floor, most of the residents
are office workers and students.

319
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:16,922
So, it's cleaner and quieter
than the others.

320
00:45:17,005 --> 00:45:18,424
The seventh floor,

321
00:45:18,507 --> 00:45:21,051
believe it or not,
is mostly occupied by gays.

322
00:45:21,593 --> 00:45:24,513
On Friday nights,
there's usually a party up there.

323
00:45:24,596 --> 00:45:27,224
They're fun and very friendly.

324
00:45:31,854 --> 00:45:35,482
The eighth and final floor
is mostly filled with mistresses.

325
00:45:35,566 --> 00:45:37,943
They stay at the top
so others don't cross them.

326
00:45:42,489 --> 00:45:45,784
I thought this block had nine floors?

327
00:45:47,953 --> 00:45:49,204
The ninth floor is empty.

328
00:45:50,330 --> 00:45:51,457
It's haunted.

329
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:53,125
Really?

330
00:45:53,876 --> 00:45:57,129
People say that the ninth floor
is haunted by the ghosts of people

331
00:45:57,671 --> 00:45:59,089
whose houses caught fire.

332
00:46:01,341 --> 00:46:03,427
Or more precisely,
when their houses were burned down.

333
00:46:04,970 --> 00:46:07,973
This building is built over the remains.

334
00:46:14,396 --> 00:46:16,064
So, where are we going now?

335
00:46:16,148 --> 00:46:17,941
I want to show you my stories.

336
00:46:32,831 --> 00:46:36,502
That man has never gone into his flat
since this place was built five years ago.

337
00:46:37,669 --> 00:46:38,712
Why?

338
00:46:40,047 --> 00:46:41,131
In my story,

339
00:46:42,925 --> 00:46:45,719
he feels that if he goes in,
he loses, and they win.

340
00:46:46,553 --> 00:46:47,805
Who are "they"?

341
00:46:49,389 --> 00:46:53,644
The people who burned the houses
so they could build this block of flats.

342
00:46:55,103 --> 00:46:58,732
As compensation,
his family was given a flat.

343
00:47:00,526 --> 00:47:02,236
He's never entered? Not even once?

344
00:47:07,908 --> 00:47:11,995
The flat on the corner is never opened.

345
00:47:12,871 --> 00:47:14,414
A woman lives there.

346
00:47:14,498 --> 00:47:16,667
Sixty-five years old.
Her name is Mrs. Dirah.

347
00:47:17,835 --> 00:47:20,128
She has lived there
since this block of flats opened.

348
00:47:21,547 --> 00:47:24,591
She used to live in a house on this land.

349
00:47:26,301 --> 00:47:27,970
Why does she never open the door?

350
00:47:28,595 --> 00:47:30,180
There are loads of cats inside.

351
00:47:30,889 --> 00:47:34,142
People say that she's still a virgin.

352
00:47:35,769 --> 00:47:37,729
She never speaks to anyone.

353
00:47:38,522 --> 00:47:40,023
She loves her cats so much.

354
00:47:41,108 --> 00:47:45,279
At first, she only had one cat. Then two.
The cats got together and had kittens.

355
00:47:47,406 --> 00:47:48,657
If you ask me,

356
00:47:49,241 --> 00:47:52,327
I think she's crazy.

357
00:47:53,662 --> 00:47:57,207
She only goes out
to throw out the rubbish.

358
00:48:03,338 --> 00:48:04,172
Let's go.

359
00:48:05,841 --> 00:48:08,844
What's interesting in a story
about an old woman who loves her cats?

360
00:48:11,096 --> 00:48:12,431
In my story,

361
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:15,434
she used to have a fiancé.

362
00:48:16,226 --> 00:48:18,312
She loved him very much,

363
00:48:19,813 --> 00:48:21,189
but he was murdered.

364
00:48:22,232 --> 00:48:24,776
Next to his corpse was a cat.

365
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:29,239
She's sure that the soul
of her fiancé is in the cat.

366
00:48:30,824 --> 00:48:32,951
And the kittens are their children.

367
00:48:36,204 --> 00:48:37,706
It sounds cheap.

368
00:48:40,417 --> 00:48:43,378
But in my writing, it doesn't.
It will resemble fairy tales.

369
00:49:01,563 --> 00:49:03,482
The guy outside is called Rudi.

370
00:49:04,149 --> 00:49:05,734
The one inside is called Dani.

371
00:49:06,443 --> 00:49:07,569
They're a gay couple.

372
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:11,573
What's interesting is
I suspect they're father and son.

373
00:49:12,824 --> 00:49:14,242
So, they're not gay.

374
00:49:14,326 --> 00:49:16,578
Gay, but father and son as well.

375
00:49:16,662 --> 00:49:17,996
How do you know?

376
00:49:18,872 --> 00:49:20,207
I used to hang out with Dani.

377
00:49:20,707 --> 00:49:22,834
I was in their room one night,

378
00:49:23,543 --> 00:49:25,796
and Rudi hadn't been back for three days.

379
00:49:27,297 --> 00:49:30,550
Dani was in a panic, drunk and crying.

380
00:49:31,176 --> 00:49:33,261
I just listened to his incoherent babble.

381
00:49:33,762 --> 00:49:35,430
He said that Rudi was his father?

382
00:49:36,306 --> 00:49:38,183
Not directly.

383
00:49:38,266 --> 00:49:39,977
But he got a call from his mother.

384
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:42,187
She wanted to know where he was.

385
00:49:42,688 --> 00:49:44,106
He wouldn't tell her.

386
00:49:44,856 --> 00:49:46,984
How do you know
they're a gay couple, then?

387
00:49:47,484 --> 00:49:49,236
Everyone here knows that.

388
00:49:54,658 --> 00:49:55,617
But I don't know.

389
00:49:57,619 --> 00:49:59,037
Maybe I'm sick.

390
00:50:00,414 --> 00:50:01,415
Am I sick?

391
00:50:07,629 --> 00:50:10,048
Have you written all these stories?

392
00:50:10,132 --> 00:50:11,049
Yes.

393
00:50:12,217 --> 00:50:15,345
But I haven't got the endings.

394
00:50:15,971 --> 00:50:17,889
Why don't you just make them up?

395
00:50:18,473 --> 00:50:19,808
I haven't come up with a good one.

396
00:50:20,308 --> 00:50:23,645
All my stories
are what really happened here.

397
00:50:24,312 --> 00:50:25,522
So they have to be real.

398
00:50:26,189 --> 00:50:27,774
There is some artistic license,

399
00:50:28,275 --> 00:50:30,152
but the plot has to happen.

400
00:50:30,902 --> 00:50:33,238
Can I read the stories
that you've written?

401
00:50:33,321 --> 00:50:34,698
No way. It's embarrassing.

402
00:50:34,781 --> 00:50:35,991
Oh, come on.

403
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:42,497
Okay.

404
00:50:43,707 --> 00:50:44,875
For your eyes only.

405
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:47,544
Who am I gonna show them to?

406
00:50:48,462 --> 00:50:50,922
Maybe you'll show them
to the people I'm writing about.

407
00:50:51,006 --> 00:50:52,090
I'd freak out.

408
00:51:38,136 --> 00:51:43,058
FICTION. #2 BY BARI

409
00:52:32,607 --> 00:52:33,733
<i>Alisha.</i>

410
00:52:36,486 --> 00:52:37,737
<i>Alisha.</i>

411
00:53:15,984 --> 00:53:18,904
Everything happens for a reason, Alisha.

412
00:54:01,613 --> 00:54:02,447
Are you new?

413
00:54:02,530 --> 00:54:04,491
I've been here for a week.
I'm on the sixth floor.

414
00:54:04,574 --> 00:54:06,368
I can't open the rubbish shoot.

415
00:54:06,451 --> 00:54:09,537
Why did you come, not down?

416
00:54:09,621 --> 00:54:12,707
I go down a lot.
I wanted to see what upstairs was like.

417
00:54:12,791 --> 00:54:14,709
Well, it's like this. Just the same.

418
00:54:18,380 --> 00:54:19,339
Are you in college?

419
00:54:19,839 --> 00:54:20,715
Yes.

420
00:54:20,799 --> 00:54:21,841
What's your major?

421
00:54:21,925 --> 00:54:22,842
Product design.

422
00:54:25,011 --> 00:54:26,805
You don't have class today?

423
00:54:26,888 --> 00:54:27,931
Later today.

424
00:54:28,014 --> 00:54:30,684
I'm still working on a presentation.
I'm super busy.

425
00:54:33,478 --> 00:54:35,272
I'd invite you in,

426
00:54:35,355 --> 00:54:38,191
but I should finish my work.

427
00:54:38,275 --> 00:54:39,109
I'm sorry.

428
00:54:39,192 --> 00:54:41,111
Can I have a look at your work?

429
00:54:41,194 --> 00:54:44,239
I'm curious to see product design.

430
00:54:46,074 --> 00:54:48,034
Okay. But just for a minute.

431
00:54:48,118 --> 00:54:49,077
Come in.

432
00:54:58,670 --> 00:55:01,840
I'm doing a logo design for a new product.

433
00:55:03,758 --> 00:55:05,760
I have the concept in my head.

434
00:55:06,428 --> 00:55:08,930
The problem is how to present it on paper.

435
00:55:11,016 --> 00:55:12,726
Why don't you do this?

436
00:55:18,857 --> 00:55:20,025
I'm impressed.

437
00:55:20,900 --> 00:55:22,819
I have studied design.

438
00:55:24,112 --> 00:55:25,322
Can I help you or not?

439
00:55:27,574 --> 00:55:30,285
I always work on my own.

440
00:55:30,994 --> 00:55:34,164
But it's quite urgent,
so I can use your help.

441
00:55:46,426 --> 00:55:47,469
Done.

442
00:55:51,890 --> 00:55:52,807
Let me see.

443
00:55:54,976 --> 00:55:56,144
That's awesome!

444
00:55:56,686 --> 00:56:00,690
If I have another assignment,
can I ask for your help?

445
00:56:00,774 --> 00:56:02,525
I won't be able to do it this good.

446
00:56:03,401 --> 00:56:04,361
Anytime.

447
00:56:05,612 --> 00:56:06,780
Let's print it out.

448
00:56:22,170 --> 00:56:26,091
MOM

449
00:56:28,051 --> 00:56:30,804
By the way, what do you
want for your help? Tea?

450
00:56:31,971 --> 00:56:32,972
I'll make one for you.

451
00:56:37,352 --> 00:56:40,522
PHONE BOOTH X NO. 27
SELLING PHONE CREDIT

452
00:56:46,986 --> 00:56:49,739
-<i>Hello?</i>
-May I speak to Dani's mother?

453
00:56:50,615 --> 00:56:51,616
<i>This is she.</i>

454
00:56:53,743 --> 00:56:55,286
Are you really Dani's mother?

455
00:56:56,830 --> 00:56:57,789
<i>Yes, I am.</i>

456
00:56:58,415 --> 00:56:59,457
<i>Who's speaking?</i>

457
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:02,544
Is your husband's name Rudi?

458
00:57:04,295 --> 00:57:05,296
<i>Yes.</i>

459
00:57:06,881 --> 00:57:07,882
<i>Who's this?</i>

460
00:57:11,344 --> 00:57:13,012
I know where they are.

461
00:57:30,113 --> 00:57:33,074
-Hey!
-Papa Bear!

462
00:57:33,158 --> 00:57:34,534
Kiddy Bear!

463
00:58:09,944 --> 00:58:10,987
Mia!

464
00:58:12,405 --> 00:58:13,281
Come in.

465
00:58:16,159 --> 00:58:18,244
Meet my friend Mia.

466
00:58:18,328 --> 00:58:20,205
She helped me with my presentation.

467
00:58:21,623 --> 00:58:22,582
Have a drink, Mia!

468
00:58:36,137 --> 00:58:38,723
By the way, don't you feel out of place?

469
00:58:39,432 --> 00:58:40,683
I'm a friend of Dani.

470
00:58:42,644 --> 00:58:43,686
Dani's friend?

471
00:58:50,193 --> 00:58:51,319
Are you a lezzy?

472
00:58:51,861 --> 00:58:54,197
-What?
<i>-</i>Are you a lesbian?

473
00:58:54,864 --> 00:58:56,074
Oh no.

474
00:58:56,824 --> 00:58:57,992
Are you gay?

475
00:58:58,076 --> 00:58:58,952
Gay?

476
00:59:00,537 --> 00:59:01,454
No way.

477
00:59:15,093 --> 00:59:16,553
You're still a virgin, right?

478
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:18,221
Yeah, definitely.

479
00:59:19,931 --> 00:59:21,933
You should try it with a woman.

480
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:25,436
You should try both ways
before you decide which one you like.

481
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:26,938
There's a gun!

482
00:59:27,438 --> 00:59:30,567
-Hey!
-What's happening here?

483
00:59:58,720 --> 00:59:59,554
Mia!

484
01:00:01,514 --> 01:00:02,432
Mia!

485
01:00:04,767 --> 01:00:06,019
I was right!

486
01:00:06,519 --> 01:00:08,855
Rudi and Dani are father and son.

487
01:00:08,938 --> 01:00:10,315
Well, stepfather, actually.

488
01:00:12,525 --> 01:00:14,777
Dani's mother was just here
and shot him dead.

489
01:00:14,861 --> 01:00:15,695
It was nuts!

490
01:00:20,950 --> 01:00:22,076
What's wrong with you?

491
01:00:23,661 --> 01:00:25,538
I was there when it happened.

492
01:00:39,093 --> 01:00:40,136
Mia!

493
01:00:45,224 --> 01:00:46,100
Mia?

494
01:03:16,751 --> 01:03:19,378
-Where were you?
-Downstairs.

495
01:03:21,798 --> 01:03:24,383
Yeah, I heard about what happened.

496
01:03:25,134 --> 01:03:28,054
It's crazy. So tragic.

497
01:03:28,763 --> 01:03:30,223
I'm still shocked.

498
01:05:25,546 --> 01:05:27,757
Hi, neighbor. I never see you around.

499
01:05:28,257 --> 01:05:29,508
I brought you this.

500
01:05:30,009 --> 01:05:31,177
Such a hassle, Mi.

501
01:05:31,260 --> 01:05:32,803
It's just an old collection.

502
01:05:36,098 --> 01:05:37,016
Hi, Bar.

503
01:05:38,100 --> 01:05:39,101
Hi, Mi.

504
01:05:41,562 --> 01:05:42,813
Are you writing a story?

505
01:05:43,314 --> 01:05:44,398
He's sick.

506
01:05:44,482 --> 01:05:47,944
A terrible tragedy happens,
and it inspires him.

507
01:05:50,154 --> 01:05:52,782
See? He is autistic when he writes.

508
01:05:55,701 --> 01:05:57,036
I better go home.

509
01:05:57,119 --> 01:05:58,537
Why so fast?

510
01:05:59,080 --> 01:06:01,040
I just came by to give that to you.

511
01:06:02,875 --> 01:06:03,960
Bye, Bari.

512
01:06:04,043 --> 01:06:05,002
Bye.

513
01:08:22,348 --> 01:08:23,974
Bari, wake up!

514
01:08:24,642 --> 01:08:26,894
Did you see the book
that I was reading last night?

515
01:08:27,436 --> 01:08:28,312
Which one?

516
01:08:29,063 --> 01:08:30,606
The one with the white cover.

517
01:08:30,689 --> 01:08:31,649
No.

518
01:08:32,775 --> 01:08:34,276
This is it.

519
01:08:34,860 --> 01:08:35,820
Come on. Wake up.

520
01:08:35,903 --> 01:08:39,115
You wanted me to wake you up, right?
Don't you have a painting job today?

521
01:08:52,628 --> 01:08:53,504
Yes, Mia?

522
01:08:57,883 --> 01:08:59,760
That's so expensive. No, thanks.

523
01:09:01,512 --> 01:09:02,805
I'm sure. No.

524
01:09:03,764 --> 01:09:04,682
Thanks anyway.

525
01:09:06,308 --> 01:09:07,434
What did Mia want?

526
01:09:08,227 --> 01:09:10,938
She's in a store.

527
01:09:11,021 --> 01:09:12,439
She saw a bunny statue

528
01:09:12,940 --> 01:09:14,525
and offered to pick it up for me.

529
01:09:15,025 --> 01:09:16,485
But it's too expensive.

530
01:09:17,236 --> 01:09:18,445
Hurry up. Take a shower!

531
01:10:45,366 --> 01:10:46,492
Where were you, Mia?

532
01:10:46,575 --> 01:10:49,161
At a friend's, then I went shopping.
What's wrong?

533
01:10:49,912 --> 01:10:51,288
How long have you been out?

534
01:10:51,372 --> 01:10:52,539
All day.

535
01:10:52,623 --> 01:10:54,541
Didn't I phone Renta this morning?

536
01:10:55,751 --> 01:10:56,752
What's going on?

537
01:10:58,170 --> 01:10:59,546
Someone died.

538
01:10:59,630 --> 01:11:00,714
What? Who?

539
01:11:01,548 --> 01:11:02,758
Her name is Mrs. Dirah.

540
01:11:03,259 --> 01:11:04,677
You may have never met her.

541
01:11:05,219 --> 01:11:06,804
The lady with all the cats?

542
01:11:07,554 --> 01:11:09,848
Bari told me. How did she die?

543
01:11:10,349 --> 01:11:13,018
She jumped from the seventh floor.
Her cats were gone.

544
01:11:13,978 --> 01:11:16,730
A few of them were found dead
inside the first floor's garbage bin.

545
01:11:18,065 --> 01:11:19,733
Someone must have thrown them there.

546
01:11:20,776 --> 01:11:22,111
Who would do such a thing?

547
01:11:23,779 --> 01:11:25,906
There are a lot
of sick people around here.

548
01:11:32,246 --> 01:11:33,247
Hey.

549
01:11:36,417 --> 01:11:37,501
Where were you?

550
01:11:38,085 --> 01:11:40,963
I told you. I was at a friend's,
then I went shopping.

551
01:11:41,046 --> 01:11:43,215
Why are you interrogating me?

552
01:11:46,218 --> 01:11:49,305
If you think it was me
who threw the cats into the garbage bin,

553
01:11:49,388 --> 01:11:50,639
you're out of your mind!

554
01:11:50,723 --> 01:11:52,808
You're eaten up by your own fiction.

555
01:11:53,726 --> 01:11:54,810
Well, no.

556
01:11:56,562 --> 01:11:58,731
It's weird.
It seems this is all a coincidence.

557
01:11:59,690 --> 01:12:00,774
Yesterday, Rudi died.

558
01:12:01,275 --> 01:12:02,276
Now, Mrs. Dirah.

559
01:12:03,819 --> 01:12:06,572
And everything happened
after I showed you my stories.

560
01:13:26,944 --> 01:13:29,196
I brought you this. I found another one.

561
01:13:31,573 --> 01:13:35,661
But I am not going to
collect them anymore.

562
01:13:35,744 --> 01:13:38,455
-Why?
-For detachment.

563
01:13:38,539 --> 01:13:39,581
What do you mean?

564
01:13:40,082 --> 01:13:42,501
It's not good getting
too attached to something.

565
01:13:42,584 --> 01:13:45,170
There has got to be a separation
so you don't depend on it too much.

566
01:13:45,254 --> 01:13:48,090
Anyway, they're just statues
and bunny dolls.

567
01:13:50,092 --> 01:13:51,009
Hi, Bar.

568
01:13:52,136 --> 01:13:53,095
Hi, Mi.

569
01:13:57,015 --> 01:13:58,851
Okay then, I'd better be going.

570
01:13:58,934 --> 01:14:00,853
I just wanted to give you this.

571
01:14:07,276 --> 01:14:08,235
What's going on?

572
01:14:10,362 --> 01:14:11,947
What's going on between you and Mia?

573
01:14:12,030 --> 01:14:13,115
What do you mean?

574
01:14:15,909 --> 01:14:19,246
I'm not that stupid, Bari.

575
01:14:19,329 --> 01:14:21,373
I know there's something going on here.

576
01:14:29,548 --> 01:14:30,591
You swear?

577
01:14:34,887 --> 01:14:36,555
I just don't like the girl.

578
01:14:38,682 --> 01:14:39,892
Why?

579
01:14:40,726 --> 01:14:42,478
Don't you think she is a bit weird?

580
01:14:45,314 --> 01:14:47,232
Why does she give you those dolls?

581
01:14:48,358 --> 01:14:50,486
It's like she's looking for your sympathy.

582
01:14:51,320 --> 01:14:53,155
You're being oversensitive.

583
01:14:54,198 --> 01:14:55,532
Maybe writer's block?

584
01:14:56,617 --> 01:14:57,534
I don't know.

585
01:15:00,245 --> 01:15:04,541
It feels so cruel to write
about these sorts of events.

586
01:16:44,349 --> 01:16:45,601
In a minute.

587
01:17:21,928 --> 01:17:22,971
Who is it, Bar?

588
01:17:26,058 --> 01:17:27,684
No one. Just kids playing around.

589
01:17:30,062 --> 01:17:32,272
Just twist their ears if you catch them.

590
01:17:32,773 --> 01:17:33,815
All right.

591
01:17:39,196 --> 01:17:41,031
Renta, I'm going out for cigarettes!

592
01:18:38,672 --> 01:18:40,549
Bari, can I talk to you for a second?

593
01:18:47,013 --> 01:18:48,223
Renta, you better go in.

594
01:19:18,253 --> 01:19:19,713
What do you want to talk about?

595
01:19:21,506 --> 01:19:23,467
I want to apologize for yesterday.

596
01:19:23,550 --> 01:19:25,594
I don't know what I was thinking.

597
01:19:28,013 --> 01:19:30,056
-What do you want from me?
-I love you.

598
01:19:39,941 --> 01:19:41,693
I don't want anything from you.

599
01:19:41,777 --> 01:19:43,403
I'm not asking for anything.

600
01:19:44,029 --> 01:19:45,906
I just wanted to let you know.

601
01:19:54,790 --> 01:19:55,957
Bari, wait.

602
01:19:56,625 --> 01:19:58,126
Please accompany me for a while.

603
01:19:58,210 --> 01:20:00,212
I can't, Mi. I better go inside.

604
01:20:01,129 --> 01:20:02,380
I want to tell Renta.

605
01:20:02,464 --> 01:20:03,590
About what?

606
01:20:04,257 --> 01:20:06,718
-I want to tell her the truth.
-She doesn't need to know.

607
01:20:07,344 --> 01:20:09,262
-Of course she needs to know!
-But why?

608
01:20:09,346 --> 01:20:11,723
Why? Because I love her!

609
01:20:13,809 --> 01:20:15,936
And I wish for a miracle
that she will forgive me.

610
01:20:16,436 --> 01:20:20,065
You should be more concerned
about your stories, not her.

611
01:20:21,358 --> 01:20:22,818
I hate those stories.

612
01:20:23,527 --> 01:20:24,903
The endings are so cliché.

613
01:20:26,112 --> 01:20:27,864
And what's more cliché is my own story.

614
01:20:27,948 --> 01:20:30,116
A guy who already has a girlfriend
getting involved with…

615
01:20:30,200 --> 01:20:31,326
A what?

616
01:20:32,619 --> 01:20:33,620
A psychopath?

617
01:20:37,082 --> 01:20:38,542
I am not a psychopath.

618
01:20:40,836 --> 01:20:43,129
From now on, I won't bother you anymore.

619
01:20:45,674 --> 01:20:47,759
You don't need to tell Renta anything.

620
01:20:48,260 --> 01:20:50,178
Everything will go back
to how it used to be.

621
01:21:08,738 --> 01:21:09,656
Renta!

622
01:21:10,156 --> 01:21:11,992
Can you leave me alone, please?

623
01:21:12,701 --> 01:21:13,618
Ta.

624
01:21:14,160 --> 01:21:15,787
I will do anything for you.

625
01:21:16,872 --> 01:21:17,914
Anything.

626
01:21:19,749 --> 01:21:21,293
If it means that you'll forgive me.

627
01:21:23,003 --> 01:21:24,212
I don't know about that.

628
01:21:25,714 --> 01:21:27,507
But please leave me alone for now.

629
01:21:29,634 --> 01:21:30,552
Please.

630
01:22:14,930 --> 01:22:18,433
I AM SORRY, BAR.

631
01:22:18,516 --> 01:22:21,645
I HAVE TO GO. I JUST WISH FOR ONE THING.

632
01:22:21,728 --> 01:22:24,105
FINISH YOUR STORIES. RENTA.

633
01:22:45,627 --> 01:22:49,297
<i>The number you are calling</i>
<i>is not available right now.</i>

634
01:23:00,767 --> 01:23:03,436
<i>The number you are calling</i>
<i>is not available right now.</i>

635
01:23:08,650 --> 01:23:11,403
<i>The number you are calling</i>
<i>is not available right now.</i>

636
01:24:29,939 --> 01:24:31,566
<i>I'm sitting on this mat.</i>

637
01:24:33,026 --> 01:24:35,653
<i>The same mat</i>
<i>I've been sitting on for five years.</i>

638
01:24:37,280 --> 01:24:40,784
<i>Here, opposite my room.</i>

639
01:24:41,284 --> 01:24:43,578
<i>No, not my room.</i>

640
01:24:44,287 --> 01:24:46,873
<i>If I say this is my room,</i>

641
01:24:46,956 --> 01:24:49,959
<i>It means that I lose and they won.</i>

642
01:24:52,087 --> 01:24:54,506
<i>They burned my house five years ago.</i>

643
01:24:55,298 --> 01:24:57,967
<i>They took our land to build this flat.</i>

644
01:24:59,385 --> 01:25:01,096
<i>They didn't give us money.</i>

645
01:25:02,097 --> 01:25:05,100
<i>Just this room on the seventh floor</i>

646
01:25:05,183 --> 01:25:08,019
<i>that will never replace my old house.</i>

647
01:25:09,395 --> 01:25:11,731
<i>Not because it was a big house,</i>

648
01:25:12,315 --> 01:25:14,567
<i>but I built it with my own hands.</i>

649
01:25:15,693 --> 01:25:16,778
<i>My masterpiece.</i>

650
01:25:18,071 --> 01:25:20,532
<i>The only masterpiece I ever had.</i>

651
01:25:22,158 --> 01:25:24,702
<i>My marriage is clearly not a masterpiece.</i>

652
01:25:25,578 --> 01:25:26,746
<i>My wife is dumb.</i>

653
01:25:27,247 --> 01:25:28,373
<i>I am dumb.</i>

654
01:25:29,415 --> 01:25:32,085
<i>We don't even know how to communicate.</i>

655
01:25:33,545 --> 01:25:35,296
<i>We didn't go to school.</i>

656
01:25:36,089 --> 01:25:37,423
<i>Maybe that's why</i>

657
01:25:38,508 --> 01:25:40,635
<i>my three kids are not masterpieces either.</i>

658
01:25:42,637 --> 01:25:45,098
<i>My eldest son is missing now.</i>

659
01:25:46,558 --> 01:25:49,644
<i>He stabbed someone to death</i>
<i>when he was 14 years old.</i>

660
01:25:50,562 --> 01:25:54,607
<i>I don't know if he's already free</i>

661
01:25:55,233 --> 01:25:56,109
<i>or still in jail.</i>

662
01:25:56,609 --> 01:25:59,237
<i>My second son always stays in the house.</i>

663
01:25:59,737 --> 01:26:03,032
<i>He never leaves the house,</i>
<i>never hangs out,</i>

664
01:26:04,033 --> 01:26:05,451
<i>or does anything.</i>

665
01:26:06,327 --> 01:26:08,830
<i>He doesn't work, doesn't go to school.</i>

666
01:26:09,330 --> 01:26:11,791
<i>None of my kids go to school.</i>

667
01:26:12,500 --> 01:26:13,877
<i>Maybe that's why.</i>

668
01:26:15,211 --> 01:26:17,964
<i>My third kid is a daughter.</i>

669
01:26:19,174 --> 01:26:21,926
<i>Maybe she's the only one</i>
<i>that's close to a masterpiece.</i>

670
01:26:23,261 --> 01:26:25,889
<i>Her smile is charming. Her skin is fair.</i>

671
01:26:25,972 --> 01:26:28,641
<i>Even though she's never had a facial.</i>

672
01:26:29,142 --> 01:26:30,351
<i>A facial!</i>

673
01:26:30,435 --> 01:26:32,478
<i>Our family has to struggle just for food.</i>

674
01:26:32,979 --> 01:26:34,939
<i>She'll be home soon.</i>

675
01:26:36,274 --> 01:26:37,984
<i>She has found her soulmate.</i>

676
01:26:39,194 --> 01:26:42,322
<i>A biker who also owns a cart</i>
<i>to sell fried snacks.</i>

677
01:26:42,989 --> 01:26:44,324
<i>She will be somebody.</i>

678
01:26:45,825 --> 01:26:47,243
<i>Her life will be better.</i>

679
01:26:48,244 --> 01:26:52,248
<i>Today, her boyfriend and his family</i>
<i>are coming to propose to my daughter.</i>

680
01:26:53,458 --> 01:26:56,294
<i>Since morning, my wife has tried</i>
<i>to get me to enter the room.</i>

681
01:26:56,377 --> 01:26:59,380
Why don't you come in for a while?
It's for your daughter's sake!

682
01:26:59,881 --> 01:27:03,551
When their family has gone,
you can sit there again!

683
01:27:06,471 --> 01:27:08,431
Or go somewhere else

684
01:27:08,514 --> 01:27:11,226
until they've all gone,
then you can come back.

685
01:27:11,726 --> 01:27:13,645
<i>They'll never understand.</i>

686
01:27:14,771 --> 01:27:16,356
<i>No one can.</i>

687
01:27:17,106 --> 01:27:18,816
<i>Except for my daughter.</i>

688
01:27:19,776 --> 01:27:21,694
<i>She's the only one who understands me.</i>

689
01:27:22,362 --> 01:27:24,489
<i>I'm sure she won't force me</i>
<i>to come inside.</i>

690
01:27:26,157 --> 01:27:27,742
<i>I am sure she won't be ashamed.</i>

691
01:27:29,619 --> 01:27:31,329
<i>The time is getting near.</i>

692
01:27:31,412 --> 01:27:33,581
<i>She'll be home very soon.</i>

693
01:27:34,082 --> 01:27:36,251
<i>I can't wait to see her!</i>

694
01:27:36,751 --> 01:27:39,629
<i>She just had her first visit</i>
<i>to the hairdresser.</i>

695
01:27:42,548 --> 01:27:43,466
<i>There she is.</i>

696
01:27:46,094 --> 01:27:47,804
<i>Wow. She looks so pretty.</i>

697
01:27:48,805 --> 01:27:50,598
<i>She's prettier than usual.</i>

698
01:27:51,391 --> 01:27:53,017
<i>She's my masterpiece, after all.</i>

699
01:27:54,102 --> 01:27:55,770
<i>She understands me like no other.</i>

700
01:27:56,688 --> 01:27:59,899
<i>I'm sure she won't mind</i>
<i>if I stay on my mat.</i>

701
01:27:59,983 --> 01:28:01,901
Father, you're still out here?

702
01:28:02,402 --> 01:28:06,072
Are you trying to embarrass me?
Do you want my future in-laws to run away?

703
01:28:07,949 --> 01:28:10,076
Can you force that old man to come inside?

704
01:28:18,209 --> 01:28:21,587
<i>I am sure she is acting like that</i>
<i>because today is her big day.</i>

705
01:28:23,256 --> 01:28:24,799
<i>I can't be selfish.</i>

706
01:28:27,260 --> 01:28:28,886
<i>I have to do something.</i>

707
01:28:30,263 --> 01:28:31,597
<i>But what?</i>

708
01:28:33,099 --> 01:28:36,185
<i>If I go in, it means I lost,</i>

709
01:28:37,270 --> 01:28:38,646
<i>and they won.</i>

710
01:28:40,940 --> 01:28:42,608
<i>What should I do?</i>

711
01:28:43,818 --> 01:28:44,777
<i>What?</i>

712
01:28:46,404 --> 01:28:48,197
<i>My body feels so weak.</i>

713
01:28:49,157 --> 01:28:51,242
<i>I can't walk too far.</i>

714
01:28:52,160 --> 01:28:56,331
<i>If I'm still here, they would see me</i>

715
01:28:57,081 --> 01:28:59,292
<i>and my daughter will be ashamed.</i>

716
01:29:01,294 --> 01:29:02,920
<i>What should I do?</i>

717
01:29:04,589 --> 01:29:05,590
<i>What?</i>

718
01:29:10,595 --> 01:29:12,638
<i>This railing is not too high.</i>

719
01:29:13,931 --> 01:29:15,308
<i>Maybe I could climb on it.</i>

720
01:29:16,517 --> 01:29:19,479
<i>My body is very light anyway.</i>

721
01:29:26,861 --> 01:29:27,779
<i>Hop.</i>

722
01:29:29,280 --> 01:29:31,074
<i>I am on top of it now.</i>

723

<i>Everything is in slow motion.</i>

727
01:29:53,513 --> 01:29:54,555
<i>I am flying.</i>

728
01:29:56,349 --> 01:29:58,684
<i>Maybe because my body is very light.</i>

729
01:30:00,395 --> 01:30:01,604
<i>Did I lose?</i>

730
01:30:03,398 --> 01:30:04,482
<i>Or did I win?</i>

731
01:30:07,777 --> 01:30:11,447

Tell me you've got nothing to do with it.

01:31:14,469 --> 01:31:16,429
I've been out all afternoon, Bari.

737
01:32:41,889 --> 01:32:43,099
I want to talk to you.

738
01:32:45,518 --> 01:32:47,895
-There is nothing to talk about.
-Yes, there is.

739
01:32:52,441 --> 01:32:54,193
Okay, let's talk.

We can't talk here.

There is something important
that I need to show you.

Come with me, please.

743
01:33:06,205 --> 01:33:08,082
Then you will understand why.

I AM SORRY, BAR. I HAVE TO GO.

How did you get in here?

754
01:36:41,212 --> 01:36:43,923
Your description of me
is really interesting, Bar.
