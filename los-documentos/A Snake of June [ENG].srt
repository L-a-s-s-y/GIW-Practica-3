1
00:00:12,557 --> 00:00:27,557


2
00:00:28,323 --> 00:00:30,408
A small camera won't do. Has to be a big one with a flash.

3
00:00:30,456 --> 00:00:32,831


4
00:00:35,872 --> 00:00:38,833
Otherwise you can't make her come.

5
00:00:46,924 --> 00:00:48,718
'A big camera with a big flash...'

6
00:00:50,137 --> 00:00:55,229
Hey, let me buy you dinner. I found a good Korean place.

7
00:00:55,892 --> 00:00:56,934
Okay.

8
00:01:13,994 --> 00:01:17,913
Take some hot stuff like this, Mr Iguchi?

9
00:01:19,124 --> 00:01:21,083
No.

10
00:01:24,921 --> 00:01:26,714
This is fine.

11
00:01:29,468 --> 00:01:32,303
Why quit? What a shame.

12
00:01:33,305 --> 00:01:35,681
You always do a good job and you're cheap.

13
00:01:36,767 --> 00:01:39,464
Anyway, can you deliver the stuff by tomorrow?

14
00:01:45,525 --> 00:01:48,402
County Mental Health Center. What can I do for you?

15
00:01:52,783 --> 00:01:57,036
Hello...

16
00:02:02,537 --> 00:02:03,834
Are you there?

17
00:02:08,006 --> 00:02:11,717
I'm... thinking of killing myself...

18
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:43,582
A SNAKE OF JUNE

19
00:03:14,364 --> 00:03:19,118
Once you find what you really want to do, you'll be okay.

20
00:03:19,561 --> 00:03:20,837
Yes...

21
00:03:22,518 --> 00:03:23,598


22
00:03:24,082 --> 00:03:25,447
Oh, No no...

23
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:27,387
Yes...

24
00:03:33,258 --> 00:03:35,746
I know what you mean. I sure do.

25
00:03:35,927 --> 00:03:39,847
Go for it. Nobody can stop you.

26
00:03:46,345 --> 00:03:48,230
May I help you?

27
00:03:50,901 --> 00:03:52,776
I need to talk to Mrs Rinko TATSUMI.

28
00:03:55,121 --> 00:03:56,697
Is there anything I can do?

29
00:03:57,621 --> 00:03:59,617
I need to talk to her in person.

30
00:04:00,642 --> 00:04:01,827
Eh...

31
00:04:04,831 --> 00:04:06,373
I'm Mrs TATSUMI.

32
00:04:18,803 --> 00:04:21,228
Mental Health Center: Telephone Counseling

33
00:04:37,768 --> 00:04:40,282
So you saved her son's life!

34
00:04:41,117 --> 00:04:43,827
She looked so angry so I thought she had a complaint.

35
00:04:44,246 --> 00:04:46,038
Actually, I thought so too,

36
00:04:46,498 --> 00:04:51,502
because I've been a bit tough on the boy.

37
00:04:52,504 --> 00:04:54,755
He stopped calling me for a while.

38
00:05:00,262 --> 00:05:01,804
Thank goodness...

39
00:05:02,389 --> 00:05:04,473
- 'Safe,' eh? - Yeah...

40
00:05:29,812 --> 00:05:32,126
- I'm home. - You scared me.

41
00:05:33,588 --> 00:05:38,393
You're early today. I wouldn't have worked overtime if I had known.

42
00:05:39,499 --> 00:05:40,884
Never mind.

43
00:05:41,886 --> 00:05:46,223
Did you eat? I bought one only for myself.

44
00:05:47,726 --> 00:05:49,981
Don't worry. I ate already.

45
00:05:52,325 --> 00:05:56,275
Hey, I'll do it.Was it that dirty?

46
00:05:57,819 --> 00:06:00,112
I love to do this.

47
00:06:09,706 --> 00:06:12,166
- You know what? - What?

48
00:06:12,792 --> 00:06:15,586
Why don't we get a dog, a big one?

49
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:18,255
Don't know.

50
00:06:18,965 --> 00:06:20,841
How about a small rabbit, then?

51
00:06:22,135 --> 00:06:23,469
It'll grow big.

52
00:06:24,888 --> 00:06:26,805
How big do you mean?

53
00:06:28,099 --> 00:06:29,433
What's up with you?

54
00:06:32,354 --> 00:06:33,395
Rinko...

55
00:06:35,163 --> 00:06:37,299
There you go again.

56
00:06:38,943 --> 00:06:41,487
Don't you leave those books lying about, will you?

57
00:08:10,242 --> 00:08:11,785
- Here. - Thanks.

58
00:08:24,382 --> 00:08:26,425
YOUR HUSBAND'S SECRETS

59
00:08:27,429 --> 00:08:29,428
What's that? Any news?

60
00:08:31,296 --> 00:08:32,347
Nothing.

61
00:09:12,555 --> 00:09:15,098
YOUR HUSBAND'S SECRETS

62
00:09:25,971 --> 00:09:29,488
You've made me want to live.

63
00:09:30,406 --> 00:09:34,326
I shouldn't have said I wanted to die.

64
00:09:35,476 --> 00:09:38,718
I've found something to live for now. You should be happy for me.

65
00:09:38,823 --> 00:09:41,778


66
00:09:50,814 --> 00:09:54,346
Shigehiko was promoted again.

67
00:09:57,433 --> 00:10:02,813
The new position keeps him busy, but he'll come to see you soon.

68
00:10:05,108 --> 00:10:12,197
Today, Shigehiko nagged me to buy a new car

69
00:10:13,658 --> 00:10:18,954
but I told him off because I bought him one recently.

70
00:10:19,539 --> 00:10:21,498
He was dejected...

71
00:11:37,833 --> 00:11:39,291
You know, you're right. One must find something to live for.

72
00:11:39,383 --> 00:11:44,747


73
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:48,752
You... are the one calling the center...

74
00:11:49,003 --> 00:11:52,339
Why don't you do what you really want?

75
00:11:53,049 --> 00:11:55,884
Walk in the street, dressed in the mini skirt.

76
00:12:03,351 --> 00:12:06,436
Let's walk in the street dressed in the skirt cut short,

77
00:12:07,175 --> 00:12:09,677
just like when you did it alone.

78
00:12:10,692 --> 00:12:16,363
Bring and change the skirt at the place where I tell you to.

79
00:12:17,198 --> 00:12:21,410
Use the cell phone enclosed and follow my instructions...

80
00:12:22,234 --> 00:12:25,080
Then I'll give you the negatives.

81
00:12:26,124 --> 00:12:30,460
Who'd believe a sleaze like you!

82
00:12:30,628 --> 00:12:33,380
I'm not asking you for sex.

83
00:12:34,132 --> 00:12:38,927
I'm telling you to do what you want. Then you'll get the negatives.

84
00:12:40,096 --> 00:12:41,304
You're crazy!

85
00:12:44,892 --> 00:12:46,977
Please watch. Here we go.

86
00:13:05,246 --> 00:13:06,913
What... again?

87
00:13:07,623 --> 00:13:11,376
Let me clean it. I've got the time.

88
00:13:12,545 --> 00:13:15,046
Please. I love doing this.

89
00:13:35,919 --> 00:13:38,041
TO: Mr Shigehiko TATSUMI Minato-ku, Tokyo...

90
00:13:53,753 --> 00:13:55,462
Forgive me, Shigehiko.

91
00:14:49,433 --> 00:14:51,017
How about next Saturday?

92
00:14:51,561 --> 00:14:54,646
Your husband is working, but you'll be off,

93
00:14:55,731 --> 00:14:56,898
I'll call the police.

94
00:14:57,066 --> 00:15:00,402
Go ahead.We'll meet in hell.

95
00:15:01,153 --> 00:15:04,406
Why...Why me!

96
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:07,784
You made me want to live.

97
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:13,874
You said you only photographed still lives.

98
00:15:14,834 --> 00:15:16,126
You lied.

99
00:15:16,544 --> 00:15:18,295
No, I didn't.

100
00:15:19,171 --> 00:15:21,882
I've changed since I got to know you.

101
00:16:14,518 --> 00:16:16,686
- See you. - Have a nice day.

102
00:16:54,725 --> 00:16:56,768
Let's begin.

103
00:16:58,354 --> 00:17:00,730
Take the subway and get off at the fifth station.

104
00:17:03,609 --> 00:17:06,236
There's a toilet just in front of the ticket booths.

105
00:17:06,988 --> 00:17:09,781
That's where you should change into the skirt.

106
00:17:25,881 --> 00:17:30,093
Did you change?

107
00:17:35,474 --> 00:17:36,808
Look, I want to talk with you.

108
00:17:37,977 --> 00:17:41,104
We can talk on the phone or maybe we can meet at a cafe.

109
00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:49,320
I can't do this.

110
00:17:49,572 --> 00:17:51,740
You can do it when you're alone.

111
00:17:52,825 --> 00:17:56,244
You caught me the only time I did it.

112
00:17:56,454 --> 00:18:00,331
Tell me what made you become so daring

113
00:18:00,875 --> 00:18:03,501
at this rainy season of year.

114
00:18:05,755 --> 00:18:08,048
Something has burst open in you.

115
00:18:09,133 --> 00:18:11,051
Don't be afraid.You can do it.

116
00:18:11,622 --> 00:18:15,333
Don't worry about how people react. Show them who you are.

117
00:18:17,099 --> 00:18:19,851
I promise you'll get the negatives.

118
00:18:37,203 --> 00:18:39,662
No underwear.

119
00:18:42,625 --> 00:18:45,335
Just like when you did it alone.

120
00:20:03,747 --> 00:20:06,624
What about a shirt, your hair and some make-up?

121
00:20:07,168 --> 00:20:08,835
You should look the way you were.

122
00:20:10,212 --> 00:20:11,421
I forgot.

123
00:20:13,048 --> 00:20:14,507
What? Never-mind.

124
00:20:15,301 --> 00:20:19,429
Walk through the arcade to the department store.

125
00:20:47,374 --> 00:20:49,542
This cosmetic would go with your skin.

126
00:21:24,161 --> 00:21:26,537
-Well then... - Hold on a second.

127
00:21:29,041 --> 00:21:34,128
- Let's buy a vibrator now. - What?

128
00:21:34,672 --> 00:21:36,923
You want it, don't you?

129
00:21:37,925 --> 00:21:39,008
It's time to buy one.

130
00:21:40,594 --> 00:21:42,679
I don't want it.

131
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:45,014
-Yes, you do. - No.

132
00:21:45,557 --> 00:21:48,643
Please. Don't you want the negatives back?

133
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:53,356
Believe me I can't.

134
00:21:53,732 --> 00:21:56,109
You told me on the phone at the center:

135
00:21:57,069 --> 00:22:00,947
'You've got to do what you really want.'

136
00:22:32,771 --> 00:22:34,772
What? Which one?

137
00:22:37,109 --> 00:22:38,269
The bigger one?

138
00:22:40,321 --> 00:22:41,404
All right.

139
00:22:49,288 --> 00:22:55,376
I was wondering about you, prowling around the entrance.

140
00:22:57,212 --> 00:22:59,714
So you wanted this, eh?

141
00:23:02,551 --> 00:23:05,303
There is a window over your head.

142
00:23:07,890 --> 00:23:10,224
Show me what you bought.

143
00:23:17,441 --> 00:23:21,110
Wow, it sure looks big.

144
00:23:23,072 --> 00:23:25,156
Well, the show is over now.

145
00:23:28,911 --> 00:23:30,620
The negatives are...

146
00:23:33,582 --> 00:23:36,542
Maybe not quite yet.

147
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:42,757
This isn't what you really wanted.

148
00:23:46,136 --> 00:23:48,805
Put the vibrator in and walk in the streets.

149
00:23:49,973 --> 00:23:52,642
Place the remote control at the entrance.

150
00:23:56,230 --> 00:23:57,897
What about the negatives?

151
00:24:00,275 --> 00:24:01,859
You promised.

152
00:24:02,569 --> 00:24:05,696
I thought you're special since you saved my life.

153
00:24:06,365 --> 00:24:09,225
You tell people what to do but you can't do it yourself,

154
00:24:09,618 --> 00:24:13,037
You're not in touch with your husband's feelings.

155
00:24:13,497 --> 00:24:15,123
Some counselor!

156
00:24:16,667 --> 00:24:19,502
It seems you chose the right husband...

157
00:24:19,912 --> 00:24:24,582
He isn't like your father, who was a boozer and a womanizer.

158
00:24:27,344 --> 00:24:29,262
I'm not telling you to get laid.

159
00:24:30,055 --> 00:24:32,598
I'm telling you to do what you want.

160
00:24:32,850 --> 00:24:34,475
Let's finish this thing first.

161
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,426
You'll have the negatives. Be happy.

162
00:24:36,491 --> 00:24:37,910


163
00:25:01,253 --> 00:25:02,628
Let's do some shopping.

164
00:25:03,630 --> 00:25:05,423
You'll find a grocery store soon.

165
00:25:06,425 --> 00:25:09,302
Buy a cucumber, an eggplant and a banana.

166
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:11,554
Buy just one of each, okay?

167
00:25:12,936 --> 00:25:14,015
I'll kill you!

168
00:25:16,727 --> 00:25:17,894
One of each?

169
00:25:18,770 --> 00:25:20,271
You should've told me that first.

170
00:25:21,315 --> 00:25:22,648
That's 500 yen.

171
00:25:46,632 --> 00:25:48,841
Well, that's enough.

172
00:25:49,927 --> 00:25:52,136
You can go back to the toilet.

173
00:25:52,930 --> 00:25:54,388
You'll find the negatives.

174
00:29:41,533 --> 00:29:42,575
Shigehiko...

175
00:29:45,787 --> 00:29:47,663
- Hello. - Hello.

176
00:29:56,882 --> 00:30:00,509
Enough is enough! Now what do you want?

177
00:30:00,677 --> 00:30:02,553
There's something I must tell you...

178
00:30:22,616 --> 00:30:24,575
I still have a negative.

179
00:30:26,495 --> 00:30:28,037
You said that's all...

180
00:30:28,425 --> 00:30:30,051
Do what I say if you want this.

181
00:30:30,707 --> 00:30:33,550
- You lied! - No! I didn't mean to!

182
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:37,546
- Bastard! -Then, don't listen! Anyway...

183
00:30:49,768 --> 00:30:51,018
Go and see your doctor.

184
00:31:25,178 --> 00:31:26,219
Yes...

185
00:31:28,473 --> 00:31:31,100
Good... No, I didn't do much.

186
00:31:33,937 --> 00:31:35,729
Don't mention it.

187
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:38,357
No... Please...

188
00:31:40,318 --> 00:31:41,375
Well...

189
00:31:42,362 --> 00:31:45,322
Nice talking to you.

190
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:11,123
"Household Medical Encyclopedia"

191
00:32:43,321 --> 00:32:45,114
The Last Negative

192
00:32:51,514 --> 00:32:52,649
Yes?

193
00:32:53,516 --> 00:32:55,059
Pet Shop, 'Merry.'

194
00:35:13,114 --> 00:35:16,075
Hey...

195
00:35:16,423 --> 00:35:17,534
Umh...

196
00:35:19,746 --> 00:35:21,705
How did you know about it?

197
00:35:26,461 --> 00:35:27,628
Tell me how.

198
00:35:30,824 --> 00:35:31,924
Well, then...

199
00:35:33,384 --> 00:35:34,426
You are...

200
00:35:36,586 --> 00:35:40,589
I kind of figured and I hoped I was wrong.

201
00:35:44,354 --> 00:35:47,439
I've got tons of books on that 'thing.'

202
00:35:48,691 --> 00:35:49,733
'Thing?'

203
00:35:51,236 --> 00:35:52,402
Cancer.

204
00:35:54,046 --> 00:35:55,671
I wanted to get ready to die.

205
00:35:58,159 --> 00:36:00,577
When I found the last photo...

206
00:36:02,247 --> 00:36:04,581
I noticed a tiny hollow in your breast.

207
00:36:07,377 --> 00:36:09,628
The more I looked at it, the more I was convinced.

208
00:36:13,434 --> 00:36:15,050
I wish I were wrong.

209
00:36:17,262 --> 00:36:19,763
You're thinking about killing yourself.

210
00:36:21,349 --> 00:36:23,350
You didn't tell me about your illness.

211
00:36:26,771 --> 00:36:28,272
So it was cancer.

212
00:36:29,274 --> 00:36:31,191
I thought you wouldn't listen to me...

213
00:36:31,901 --> 00:36:33,902
if I told you that.

214
00:36:43,089 --> 00:36:45,079
You're in too much pain to move.

215
00:36:47,709 --> 00:36:49,334
You can't be a 'Peeping Tom' any more.

216
00:36:50,044 --> 00:36:52,546
I won't trouble you any more.

217
00:36:55,454 --> 00:36:58,218
At least, I had my last wish granted.

218
00:37:01,222 --> 00:37:03,348
I'm still hanging on.

219
00:37:04,434 --> 00:37:06,435
Shit! I'm going to make it.

220
00:37:08,813 --> 00:37:09,887
You know...

221
00:37:11,566 --> 00:37:14,735
On that day, I hammered a thick nail into my hand.

222
00:37:16,696 --> 00:37:18,780
Trying to kill my stomach-ache with the pain.

223
00:37:21,284 --> 00:37:22,826
It didn't work.

224
00:37:26,567 --> 00:37:28,526
You won't be redeemed.

225
00:37:29,667 --> 00:37:31,335
I know that.

226
00:37:35,577 --> 00:37:36,673
Stupid!

227
00:37:40,762 --> 00:37:43,096
You needed someone to make fun of before you died.

228
00:37:43,431 --> 00:37:45,933
Someone incapable of knowing her husbands feeling

229
00:37:46,517 --> 00:37:49,770
A "dummy" like me who can't do

230
00:37:52,565 --> 00:37:54,650
what she really wants to do.

231
00:37:57,278 --> 00:37:58,820
You're dying.

232
00:37:59,685 --> 00:38:04,231
So why don't you do it alone and peacefully.

233
00:38:40,655 --> 00:38:42,531
- Honey... - Yeah?

234
00:38:43,570 --> 00:38:45,404
There's something I need to talk about.

235
00:38:50,331 --> 00:38:52,958
What! Cut a breast off?!

236
00:38:54,168 --> 00:38:56,044
It prevents the cancer from spreading.

237
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:00,340
I don't understand.Why you?!

238
00:39:01,968 --> 00:39:03,593
I'll be fine.

239
00:39:04,637 --> 00:39:08,640
'Fine'? You'll lose your breast.

240
00:39:10,643 --> 00:39:13,687
But it'll save my life.

241
00:39:48,014 --> 00:39:49,306
Let me clean.

242
00:39:50,324 --> 00:39:52,392
Just leave it to me, will you?

243
00:39:54,812 --> 00:39:57,773
I'm allergic to animals.

244
00:39:58,524 --> 00:40:00,108
I can't stand the smell, either.

245
00:40:00,735 --> 00:40:02,778
You should've told me about the hamster.

246
00:40:56,249 --> 00:40:59,292
Yes.

247
00:41:02,755 --> 00:41:03,922
I see.

248
00:41:11,472 --> 00:41:14,891
Yes, my mother in-law is gone. I got a call from the hospital.

249
00:41:15,601 --> 00:41:18,061
I can't work today.

250
00:41:18,354 --> 00:41:20,605
I'll call you when I know more.

251
00:41:21,566 --> 00:41:24,693
There is a child who's in a difficult situation.

252
00:41:25,486 --> 00:41:30,115
Yes, that's him. Please speak carefully when he calls.

253
00:41:31,367 --> 00:41:33,910
Sorry I'm stuck with my work.

254
00:41:35,413 --> 00:41:38,373
Try to make it sooner, will you?

255
00:42:38,684 --> 00:42:42,646
How could you miss the vigil?

256
00:42:44,357 --> 00:42:48,235
You barely saw your mother when she died.

257
00:42:50,488 --> 00:42:53,281
Did you have to work that late?

258
00:42:55,618 --> 00:42:58,119
You arranged the funeral today

259
00:42:59,789 --> 00:43:04,084
but I was afraid you might disappear during the funeral.

260
00:43:06,796 --> 00:43:09,297
Were you that busy?

261
00:43:36,826 --> 00:43:38,785
This is a message for Mrs TATSUMI.

262
00:43:39,704 --> 00:43:41,955
An operation was scheduled for you today.

263
00:43:43,332 --> 00:43:44,624
Please call us...

264
00:43:47,036 --> 00:43:48,546
I'm home.

265
00:44:01,125 --> 00:44:03,234


266
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:05,854
Hi, honey.

267
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:08,064
There you are.

268
00:44:09,317 --> 00:44:12,068
- How were the results? - Fine.

269
00:44:13,833 --> 00:44:17,699
- ls everything okay? - The doc says I don't need an operation.

270
00:44:19,201 --> 00:44:21,745
- Are you sure? - Yeah.

271
00:44:22,413 --> 00:44:24,581
They'll keep my breast intact.

272
00:44:25,249 --> 00:44:28,877
- I'm glad to hear that. - Yeah.

273
00:44:30,921 --> 00:44:32,380
Are you okay?

274
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:34,591
Of course I am.

275
00:45:02,328 --> 00:45:05,288
You seem to like that cafe.

276
00:45:06,123 --> 00:45:07,499
What?

277
00:45:08,542 --> 00:45:12,379
You were there when your mother died.

278
00:45:13,547 --> 00:45:16,633
I sympathize with your wife and your mother.

279
00:45:17,551 --> 00:45:19,094
Who the hell are you?

280
00:45:19,645 --> 00:45:24,822
So you take it in powder. Mine was tablets.

281
00:45:26,268 --> 00:45:28,311
To get rid of the smell of your shit, you know.

282
00:45:29,046 --> 00:45:31,631
Do you hate the smell of shit, too?

283
00:45:33,234 --> 00:45:35,485
I used to...

284
00:45:36,696 --> 00:45:39,030
We have something in common...

285
00:45:40,241 --> 00:45:42,450
- Was it you who... - What?

286
00:45:42,952 --> 00:45:45,078
- Never mind. - Say it.

287
00:45:45,788 --> 00:45:47,330
Don't fool me.About the photos...

288
00:45:48,624 --> 00:45:50,667
- Never mind. - Did you see them?

289
00:45:50,835 --> 00:45:54,045
What did you say? So that was you!

290
00:45:54,505 --> 00:45:58,800
Didn't you think that the water in the cafe tasted strange?

291
00:45:59,009 --> 00:46:00,009
What?!

292
00:48:15,354 --> 00:48:19,190
Yes... it's about my wife.

293
00:48:19,942 --> 00:48:22,277
I want to know what she's up to.

294
00:48:23,028 --> 00:48:25,613
Yes...Yes... I mean...

295
00:48:26,198 --> 00:48:28,032
I mean... umm...

296
00:50:10,109 --> 00:50:12,110
I tried not to call you

297
00:50:14,838 --> 00:50:16,808
but I wanted to hear your voice.

298
00:50:18,686 --> 00:50:19,821
Hey...

299
00:50:21,146 --> 00:50:22,217
Umh?

300
00:50:25,442 --> 00:50:26,901
Do me a favour, will you?

301
00:50:44,128 --> 00:50:45,169
Excuse me.

302
00:50:48,549 --> 00:50:50,466
What are you doing here?

303
00:50:51,301 --> 00:50:52,384
Nothing.

304
00:50:52,553 --> 00:50:54,846
'Nothing?'

305
00:50:56,515 --> 00:51:00,435
She says you're watching her all the time.

306
00:51:02,646 --> 00:51:03,855
I don't know her.

307
00:51:03,856 --> 00:51:08,026
Tell me what else you've been doing here?

308
00:51:08,610 --> 00:51:10,778
You were watching her.

309
00:51:15,617 --> 00:51:19,495
Don't you dare! Stop right there.

310
00:56:21,631 --> 00:56:24,592
You still haven't got an operation!?

311
01:00:40,140 --> 01:00:41,307
Good evening.

312
01:00:43,727 --> 01:00:45,728
How many photos have you taken?

313
01:00:46,896 --> 01:00:48,731
What else did you do to her?

314
01:00:49,858 --> 01:00:51,150
You must have!

315
01:00:51,318 --> 01:00:53,569
Does she hang around that place often?

316
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:56,322
I wonder.

317
01:00:56,323 --> 01:00:58,616
Let me buy all those photos. All of them!

318
01:00:58,728 --> 01:01:00,213


319
01:01:02,287 --> 01:01:06,999
That place... really surprised me at first.

320
01:01:08,793 --> 01:01:11,712
But I'm sure you'll get used to it quickly.

321
01:01:13,673 --> 01:01:16,091
Because you're similar to me.

322
01:01:17,427 --> 01:01:20,971
What I want is the photos. Nothing else.

323
01:01:23,266 --> 01:01:26,393
You'll find a paper-bag at the front.

324
01:01:47,624 --> 01:01:49,833
What's this? I told you I want all of them.

325
01:01:50,627 --> 01:01:53,962
I saw the photos you sent her.

326
01:01:54,881 --> 01:01:57,675
I want to see all of her.

327
01:01:58,468 --> 01:02:00,511
You did.

328
01:02:01,680 --> 01:02:04,723
Then you've seen all of her!

329
01:02:15,026 --> 01:02:16,944
Take off your clothes.

330
01:02:31,501 --> 01:02:32,710
On your knees.

331
01:03:05,618 --> 01:03:10,581
Shigehiko... Shigehiko...

332
01:03:32,020 --> 01:03:33,562
Was it your idea

333
01:03:34,647 --> 01:03:36,815
not to cut off her breast?

334
01:03:37,734 --> 01:03:39,568
How do you know that?

335
01:03:40,653 --> 01:03:43,363
It's her doctor's decision.

336
01:03:43,990 --> 01:03:45,616
Idiot!!

337
01:03:48,578 --> 01:03:49,995
She's going to die soon.

338
01:03:54,209 --> 01:03:55,667
Oh, I see.

339
01:03:58,755 --> 01:04:00,297
That's it.

340
01:04:02,550 --> 01:04:04,301
She doesn't have to mutilate herself.

341
01:04:05,804 --> 01:04:07,554
She's better off dead

342
01:04:10,016 --> 01:04:12,601
than living like a freak!

343
01:04:20,109 --> 01:04:21,735
She asked me..

344
01:04:23,154 --> 01:04:24,947
to give these photos...

345
01:04:26,449 --> 01:04:28,200
to you.

346
01:04:29,953 --> 01:04:31,370
Why?!

347
01:04:33,289 --> 01:04:34,998
Why does she do that?

348
01:04:40,797 --> 01:04:43,131
Nuns tend to suffer from breast cancer

349
01:04:44,217 --> 01:04:46,385
because they repress their bodily desires.

350
01:04:48,012 --> 01:04:49,888
I have something to ask you.

351
01:04:52,600 --> 01:04:55,143
You think she's a nun, eh!?

352
01:04:55,728 --> 01:04:57,980
Is she a nun!?

353
01:04:59,148 --> 01:05:02,359
Shouldn't you have known she's sick?

354
01:05:29,721 --> 01:05:31,597
You'll die here!

355
01:05:33,308 --> 01:05:35,142
You don't want to see her die!

356
01:05:37,937 --> 01:05:40,689
I'll take care of her!

357
01:05:44,193 --> 01:05:46,945
I'll stay with her at your place.

358
01:05:48,197 --> 01:05:50,991
We'll start our life together!

359
01:05:56,664 --> 01:05:59,458
Give us your blessing!

360
01:08:11,215 --> 01:08:13,091
I love this sound.

361
01:08:14,427 --> 01:08:16,094
Stuffed sweet peppers.

362
01:08:17,263 --> 01:08:19,222
Your husband's favourite.

363
01:08:24,937 --> 01:08:28,440
You put those in Miso soup, eh?

364
01:08:30,693 --> 01:08:32,069
Isn't it good?

365
01:08:38,951 --> 01:08:41,912
I found a good old camera.

366
01:08:43,623 --> 01:08:45,791
I made it when I was a kid.

367
01:08:47,210 --> 01:08:50,712
With this camera, I wanted to take...

368
01:08:52,173 --> 01:08:53,340
a photo of you.

369
01:08:58,221 --> 01:09:01,181
Well, then...

370
01:09:03,309 --> 01:09:04,476
I must be going.

371
01:09:06,187 --> 01:09:07,646
All right.

372
01:09:38,302 --> 01:09:40,053
I'll be going soon.

373
01:10:10,334 --> 01:10:12,502
Am I in hell?

374
01:10:15,590 --> 01:10:17,174
Yes.You are right.

375
01:10:18,885 --> 01:10:20,135
Then...

376
01:10:21,220 --> 01:10:22,304
it's...

377
01:10:24,015 --> 01:10:25,182
time to go.

378
01:10:26,767 --> 01:10:28,685
I'll follow you.

379
01:10:57,757 --> 01:10:59,716
Give me my gun back!

380
01:10:59,884 --> 01:11:01,593
Son of a bitch! My gun!!

381
01:11:01,802 --> 01:11:04,679
- Give me back! - Calm down!

382
01:11:04,931 --> 01:11:07,515
Open the fucking door!

383
01:11:24,575 --> 01:11:26,409
He's in the house.

384
01:11:26,577 --> 01:11:29,246
Get ready! Go! Go!
