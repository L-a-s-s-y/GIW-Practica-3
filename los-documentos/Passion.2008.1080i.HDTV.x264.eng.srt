00:00:00,021 --> 00:00:04,015
Tokyo University of the Arts presents

2
00:01:52,166 --> 00:01:54,431
Sorry, that car just came in front.

3
00:01:54,535 --> 00:01:58,233
It's fine, the road is so busy.

4
00:01:58,673 --> 00:02:01,541
With the holiday season plus the weekend,
the roads get so busy.

5
00:02:07,215 --> 00:02:10,982
You're the guest tonight
let them wait a little.

6
00:02:11,419 --> 00:02:13,615
But I don't like to be late.

7
00:02:13,721 --> 00:02:15,883
You do teach at a good school.

8
00:02:17,892 --> 00:02:21,988
I know...
We already study high school curriculum’s.

9
00:02:22,964 --> 00:02:24,626
And they're only in junior high.

10
00:02:26,067 --> 00:02:27,865
So, you're a teacher?

11
00:02:28,903 --> 00:02:29,871
Yes.

12
00:02:30,805 --> 00:02:31,829
Of what?

13
00:02:31,939 --> 00:02:33,464
I teach math.

14
00:02:33,775 --> 00:02:38,270
Mathematics.
Would've studied more if my teachers were...

15
00:02:38,379 --> 00:02:39,813
...pretty like you.

16
00:02:43,951 --> 00:02:45,647
Thank you.

17
00:02:46,154 --> 00:02:47,747
Lucky students.

18
00:02:56,898 --> 00:02:58,457
Hey...

19
00:03:00,168 --> 00:03:03,661
Can we make that announcement tonight?

20
00:03:03,771 --> 00:03:05,171
That?

21
00:03:07,842 --> 00:03:09,174
Okay.

22
00:03:10,845 --> 00:03:12,837
Then you say it. Tomoya.

23
00:03:13,748 --> 00:03:15,273
Me?

24
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:18,249
Kaho, you say it. I'm shy.

25
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:22,554
Come on, you're not shy.

26
00:03:23,057 --> 00:03:24,548
You announce it.

27
00:03:34,969 --> 00:03:36,130
Sanae!

28
00:03:36,404 --> 00:03:37,667
We're here!

29
00:03:37,772 --> 00:03:39,206
Happy Birthday!

30
00:03:39,841 --> 00:03:41,639
Or belated birthday?

31
00:03:41,743 --> 00:03:44,178
Yes, it's fine. Thanks.

32
00:03:45,012 --> 00:03:48,380
Kaho, you get the birthday seat.

33
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:50,045
I feel special.

34
00:03:51,552 --> 00:03:54,647
Kenichiro, you're dressed up today.

35
00:03:55,857 --> 00:03:56,847
A funeral.

36
00:03:57,024 --> 00:03:58,424
Really?

37
00:03:58,659 --> 00:04:01,185
Not someone close. I'm fine.

38
00:04:01,896 --> 00:04:02,693
Congrats.

39
00:04:02,797 --> 00:04:04,129
Thanks.

40
00:04:04,565 --> 00:04:05,624
Takeshi and Marie?

41
00:04:05,733 --> 00:04:06,393
Not yet.

42
00:04:06,501 --> 00:04:08,527
But they're the hosts.

43
00:04:08,736 --> 00:04:09,760
Right?

44
00:04:14,075 --> 00:04:15,941
As we speak.

45
00:04:16,444 --> 00:04:17,605
Marie!

46
00:04:18,446 --> 00:04:20,210
Happy birthday!

47
00:04:20,314 --> 00:04:23,284
Thank you! How have you been?

48
00:04:27,021 --> 00:04:30,321
Sorry, taxi was a bad idea.

49
00:04:30,424 --> 00:04:31,790
Busy season.

50
00:04:32,293 --> 00:04:33,761
So how's it going?

51
00:04:34,328 --> 00:04:37,196
Doing fine. Better than you are.

52
00:04:37,298 --> 00:04:38,960
Whatever.

53
00:05:02,456 --> 00:05:03,424
Congrats.

54
00:05:03,524 --> 00:05:06,289
Thank you so much.

55
00:05:19,674 --> 00:05:21,142
29 years old.

56
00:05:21,409 --> 00:05:24,311
I'm already 29 years old.

57
00:05:24,979 --> 00:05:28,541
Not that bad, you're still in your 20s.

58
00:05:29,851 --> 00:05:33,151
Is there something wrong about being 30?

59
00:05:33,554 --> 00:05:34,385
No.

60
00:05:34,488 --> 00:05:36,980
That's mean!

61
00:05:37,491 --> 00:05:38,754
Didn't mean it.

62
00:05:39,493 --> 00:05:43,624
Yes you did!
Things only get better after 30.

63
00:05:43,731 --> 00:05:44,790
That's right.

64
00:05:45,166 --> 00:05:47,362
You're a mother now.

65
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:53,132
I know,
it feels so weird that Marie is a mom!

66
00:05:53,574 --> 00:05:55,634
I can feel it kicking.

67
00:05:55,810 --> 00:05:56,641
Can I touch?

68
00:05:57,778 --> 00:06:02,045
I think Takeshi will be such a good dad.

69
00:06:02,149 --> 00:06:04,015
I'm looking forward to it.

70
00:06:04,118 --> 00:06:08,283
Baseball to dollhouse.
I'll be an all-around dad.

71
00:06:10,157 --> 00:06:12,820
You can adapt to anything.

72
00:06:13,127 --> 00:06:19,089
Now I find all kids adorable and I never
used to feel that way.

73
00:06:19,233 --> 00:06:21,566
It's amazing.

74
00:06:22,236 --> 00:06:24,728
So amazing how things work.

75
00:06:24,839 --> 00:06:26,535
People do change.

76
00:06:26,641 --> 00:06:28,166
A bit over-excited.

77
00:06:29,176 --> 00:06:30,144
Ah shut up...

78
00:06:31,946 --> 00:06:33,539
What about you two?

79
00:06:35,149 --> 00:06:36,344
Us?

80
00:06:38,419 --> 00:06:40,820
So, what's up with you two?

81
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,594
Well actually...

82
00:06:47,795 --> 00:06:51,197
We... are getting married.

83
00:06:55,169 --> 00:06:56,102
Right?

84
00:06:56,203 --> 00:06:57,193
Yes we are.

85
00:06:58,773 --> 00:07:00,071
Congratulations!

86
00:07:09,784 --> 00:07:11,446
You upset. Kenichiro?

87
00:07:13,387 --> 00:07:14,946
I'm not upset!

88
00:07:15,189 --> 00:07:17,283
You're upset?

89
00:07:20,194 --> 00:07:21,662
No I'm not.

90
00:07:22,096 --> 00:07:24,327
You gotta be careful!

91
00:07:25,266 --> 00:07:28,100
Kaho, marry me when you leave him.

92
00:07:30,838 --> 00:07:32,033
Whatever.

93
00:07:35,876 --> 00:07:37,208
We'll see.

94
00:07:37,311 --> 00:07:38,472
Hey hey hey.

95
00:07:40,581 --> 00:07:41,981
Stop all this.

96
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:46,643
I'm so glad. We've been waiting for this.

97
00:07:46,821 --> 00:07:48,585
Yeah. 10 years.

98
00:07:49,357 --> 00:07:51,952
But it doesn't that long.

99
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:55,161
You first need a job.

100
00:07:55,262 --> 00:07:56,389
I do work.

101
00:07:56,497 --> 00:07:59,331
But you're still part-time lecturer.

102
00:07:59,433 --> 00:08:03,598
All researchers wait for their chances
like that.

103
00:08:03,804 --> 00:08:06,296
I'm lucky just to have a job.

104
00:08:11,212 --> 00:08:14,444
Sorry...I'm just being too emotional...

105
00:08:14,548 --> 00:08:16,210
Please excuse me.

106
00:08:17,284 --> 00:08:18,650
I'm fine...

107
00:08:26,027 --> 00:08:26,995
She okay?

108
00:08:28,996 --> 00:08:32,831
I guess women are emotional creatures.

109
00:08:38,005 --> 00:08:39,405
What time is it?

110
00:08:40,441 --> 00:08:41,568
Now?

111
00:08:42,143 --> 00:08:44,203
Little past 9.

112
00:08:44,712 --> 00:08:46,806
I should be heading off.

113
00:08:47,081 --> 00:08:48,879
...Maybe I will too.

114
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:50,413
Going to bathroom.

115
00:08:50,518 --> 00:08:51,349
Taxi?

116
00:08:51,452 --> 00:08:53,148
Early morning?

117
00:08:56,323 --> 00:08:56,983
Taxi?

118
00:08:57,091 --> 00:08:58,923
Yes. You can stay.

119
00:09:07,868 --> 00:09:10,064
Have fun but don't overspend.

120
00:09:10,838 --> 00:09:14,832
Take this. Okay, I'll see you later.

121
00:09:14,942 --> 00:09:16,774
See you.

122
00:09:18,012 --> 00:09:19,207
Oh yeah.

123
00:09:22,316 --> 00:09:23,682
You forgot your keys.

124
00:09:24,351 --> 00:09:25,410
Thank you.

125
00:09:25,986 --> 00:09:26,885
Alright?

126
00:09:27,254 --> 00:09:29,985
I'm fine. What time will you come back?

127
00:09:31,125 --> 00:09:32,024
Don't wait up for me.

128
00:09:32,126 --> 00:09:32,855
But you need...

129
00:09:34,562 --> 00:09:35,860
Put it in mailbox.

130
00:09:37,731 --> 00:09:39,063
Get good sleep.

131
00:09:55,483 --> 00:09:56,382
Ouch!

132
00:09:56,484 --> 00:09:57,452
What is it?

133
00:09:57,551 --> 00:10:00,988
You just complicate everything.

134
00:10:10,898 --> 00:10:12,127
Hey wait!

135
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:36,150
Making things complicated among friends.

136
00:10:40,728 --> 00:10:45,029
I slept with Sanae just once.
5 to 6 years ago.

137
00:10:45,166 --> 00:10:47,795
I'm surprised it happened, too.

138
00:10:49,069 --> 00:10:51,436
You've cheated before, right?

139
00:10:51,539 --> 00:10:53,132
No. I'd never cheat.

140
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,401
You're lying.

141
00:10:54,508 --> 00:10:57,910
If not, you're just fooling yourself.

142
00:11:05,286 --> 00:11:07,755
Hey, do you want to go to...

143
00:11:08,889 --> 00:11:10,255
...Takako's place?

144
00:11:10,524 --> 00:11:12,493
She wants to see you guys.

145
00:11:13,027 --> 00:11:14,461
Takako Nomura?

146
00:11:15,996 --> 00:11:18,465
You're still seeing her?

147
00:11:19,133 --> 00:11:21,568
It'll be cheaper there.

148
00:11:27,575 --> 00:11:28,873
...We'll go.

149
00:11:30,177 --> 00:11:31,270
Let's go.

150
00:11:38,385 --> 00:11:40,047
Is married life fun?

151
00:11:41,689 --> 00:11:44,955
It's not always fun and exciting.

152
00:11:45,159 --> 00:11:47,060
But it's not bad.

153
00:11:47,161 --> 00:11:49,027
Not bad at all.

154
00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:50,958
You'll change. too.

155
00:11:55,836 --> 00:11:57,566
I'm hoping so.

156
00:12:00,908 --> 00:12:03,503
Drop this subject at Takako's.

157
00:12:04,178 --> 00:12:08,240
Her cat died or something?
She must be lonely.

158
00:12:08,349 --> 00:12:11,183
She won't say it, but she probably is.

159
00:12:11,285 --> 00:12:13,049
Pets are like family.

160
00:12:14,221 --> 00:12:15,621
Hey...you!

161
00:12:15,723 --> 00:12:16,554
Phone call?

162
00:12:16,657 --> 00:12:18,990
Just telling her I'll be late.

163
00:12:19,093 --> 00:12:20,322
...You fool.

164
00:12:20,427 --> 00:12:24,387
Why? Just give it back!
Stop acting like a kid.

165
00:12:24,865 --> 00:12:27,960
Go home when the train starts moving.

166
00:12:28,969 --> 00:12:31,495
So much cheaper than taxi.

167
00:12:31,605 --> 00:12:34,575
Either way, I'm calling to tell her.

168
00:12:34,675 --> 00:12:37,873
Phone calls cost money.
Hey, Kenichiro!

169
00:12:39,513 --> 00:12:41,482
No. Kenichiro!

170
00:12:45,286 --> 00:12:46,845
Give it back...

171
00:12:47,955 --> 00:12:49,981
That's it, Takeshi.

172
00:12:50,891 --> 00:12:53,486
Back to being a mad dog.

173
00:12:53,627 --> 00:12:55,619
I was like a mad dog?

174
00:12:55,729 --> 00:12:58,824
Yup. before Marie chained you up.

175
00:13:00,668 --> 00:13:04,161
Kenichiro, just give it back to me.

176
00:13:05,439 --> 00:13:06,998
Sorry sorry.

177
00:13:21,188 --> 00:13:22,417
Come on in.

178
00:13:23,657 --> 00:13:24,386
Remember me?

179
00:13:24,491 --> 00:13:25,754
Of course.

180
00:13:25,859 --> 00:13:27,418
3-4 years ago?

181
00:13:27,728 --> 00:13:30,994
Yeah. I was still getting my master's.

182
00:13:31,398 --> 00:13:32,457
Can we come in?

183
00:13:32,566 --> 00:13:34,000
Your coats over there.

184
00:13:34,802 --> 00:13:36,168
Coming in.

185
00:13:43,677 --> 00:13:45,373
Long time, Takako!

186
00:13:49,783 --> 00:13:51,843
How's Professor Sakuma?

187
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:57,481
Perverted as usual.
My doctor thesis wasn't accepted.

188
00:13:57,591 --> 00:14:01,289
Well, he is strict.
I need to learn that.

189
00:14:01,395 --> 00:14:02,886
No worries.

190
00:14:03,497 --> 00:14:04,931
You're already a pervert.

191
00:14:06,266 --> 00:14:07,757
Using your sink.

192
00:14:22,282 --> 00:14:23,250
Thank you.

193
00:14:23,517 --> 00:14:24,746
I'm sorry about...

194
00:14:24,852 --> 00:14:29,051
No. no need.
I had you guys come to cheer me up.

195
00:14:29,156 --> 00:14:32,991
Let's just have a toast for her long life.

196
00:14:35,796 --> 00:14:37,526
She was really old?

197
00:14:37,631 --> 00:14:40,931
26. About 120 years old in human age.

198
00:14:41,034 --> 00:14:43,970
So she was with you since childhood?

199
00:14:44,471 --> 00:14:46,963
No. she was my aunt's cat.

200
00:14:47,975 --> 00:14:50,206
This house is also my aunt's.

201
00:14:53,313 --> 00:14:57,341
She offered me this place
to take care of Rabi...

202
00:14:57,918 --> 00:15:01,184
...when I was house hunting for college.

203
00:15:01,822 --> 00:15:03,723
Is beer okay?

204
00:15:05,359 --> 00:15:07,385
Rabi is the cat's name.

205
00:15:07,628 --> 00:15:09,256
You know Hana Yoshino?

206
00:15:09,563 --> 00:15:11,088
The writer?

207
00:15:12,833 --> 00:15:14,358
Never read it.

208
00:15:15,936 --> 00:15:17,165
That's my aunt.

209
00:15:18,839 --> 00:15:21,638
And this is my aunt's house.

210
00:15:21,975 --> 00:15:25,173
Because the cat lives with the house...

211
00:15:25,879 --> 00:15:29,281
...she left her here
when she moved to Kamakura.

212
00:15:29,383 --> 00:15:32,410
So she keeps this house for the cat.

213
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:34,886
Does she know of Rabi's death?

214
00:15:34,988 --> 00:15:39,358
Of course.
But I guess she has a deadline coming up.

215
00:15:39,726 --> 00:15:40,591
So sad.

216
00:15:40,694 --> 00:15:41,957
Tough for her.

217
00:15:42,463 --> 00:15:45,160
You're the sad one.

218
00:15:48,235 --> 00:15:49,464
Can I heat this?

219
00:15:49,570 --> 00:15:50,765
Sure, go ahead.

220
00:15:51,238 --> 00:15:55,505
This one became a movie.
"My Love Fell Off the Plane"

221
00:15:55,609 --> 00:15:56,633
You know it?

222
00:15:56,743 --> 00:15:58,644
Of course I do.

223
00:15:58,745 --> 00:16:02,546
She recently had like 2 bestsellers.

224
00:16:02,649 --> 00:16:06,848
You've got to see it. Makes you cry.

225
00:16:08,555 --> 00:16:11,548
Yeah. I called you guys up. Not enough.

226
00:16:11,892 --> 00:16:12,587
We'll pay.

227
00:16:12,693 --> 00:16:13,717
It's fine.

228
00:16:13,994 --> 00:16:15,428
No it's not.

229
00:16:20,767 --> 00:16:21,826
What does she write?

230
00:16:22,202 --> 00:16:26,970
Basically, something about
a loved one dying.

231
00:16:27,407 --> 00:16:28,705
Sounds like a seller.

232
00:16:28,942 --> 00:16:30,035
A seller?

233
00:16:47,461 --> 00:16:49,760
To Rabi in heaven.

234
00:16:49,863 --> 00:16:51,331
And to your marriage.

235
00:16:51,431 --> 00:16:54,560
Oh really? Congratulations!

236
00:16:56,803 --> 00:16:58,135
What.

237
00:17:00,908 --> 00:17:02,774
And to Takeshi's baby.

238
00:17:03,477 --> 00:17:06,641
Really? Congratulations on that, too!

239
00:17:07,748 --> 00:17:10,081
Anyways. toast to Rabi.

240
00:17:10,617 --> 00:17:14,577
Then. to the dead Rabi
and the baby on the way.

241
00:17:14,988 --> 00:17:16,513
...and the engagement.

242
00:17:18,926 --> 00:17:20,155
Cheers!

243
00:17:27,568 --> 00:17:29,366
Can I smoke?

244
00:17:30,904 --> 00:17:32,133
Didn't you quit?

245
00:18:54,588 --> 00:18:55,419
Can I smoke?

246
00:18:55,522 --> 00:18:57,013
Out on the balcony.

247
00:19:00,861 --> 00:19:02,261
Bring some beer.

248
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:07,665
Need help?

249
00:19:07,768 --> 00:19:09,236
It's fine.

250
00:19:10,237 --> 00:19:12,069
No. it's hot.

251
00:19:12,506 --> 00:19:14,065
Thanks.

252
00:19:21,448 --> 00:19:22,882
It's cold.

253
00:19:23,050 --> 00:19:24,780
Close it. it's cold.

254
00:19:34,795 --> 00:19:36,195
Congratulations.

255
00:19:36,663 --> 00:19:37,961
Thank you.

256
00:19:45,272 --> 00:19:46,467
Give me your hand.

257
00:19:46,573 --> 00:19:49,099
Palm reading? Oh no.

258
00:19:49,276 --> 00:19:50,574
Changes in 3 years?

259
00:19:50,677 --> 00:19:52,145
How scary.

260
00:19:57,050 --> 00:19:59,645
You should stop seeing that girl.

261
00:20:04,691 --> 00:20:06,887
And what about job changing?

262
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:10,758
Turned it down. Don't want to be too busy.

263
00:20:10,997 --> 00:20:12,863
My job now is fine.

264
00:20:15,202 --> 00:20:16,761
You know what?

265
00:20:17,204 --> 00:20:19,969
You've never really fell in love.

266
00:20:21,808 --> 00:20:23,333
What do you mean?

267
00:20:23,643 --> 00:20:28,843
When you really fall in love,
you'll feel the need for money.

268
00:20:28,949 --> 00:20:30,508
I just need enough.

269
00:20:30,617 --> 00:20:35,055
You'll want more
when you find that true love.

270
00:20:36,289 --> 00:20:38,315
You just don't get it.

271
00:20:40,527 --> 00:20:44,931
Emotion line used to stop here,
but it's longer now.

272
00:20:45,031 --> 00:20:46,294
You really remember?

273
00:20:46,833 --> 00:20:48,961
Not always, just yours.

274
00:20:52,172 --> 00:20:56,132
I think you've become more emotional.
am I right?

275
00:20:56,576 --> 00:20:58,511
...Weaker with age.

276
00:20:58,612 --> 00:21:00,308
No. not what I meant.

277
00:21:01,348 --> 00:21:05,376
Marriage line is hardly visible...
Maybe around 40.

278
00:21:05,485 --> 00:21:07,317
Seriously?

279
00:21:07,788 --> 00:21:09,620
Do you want to marry?

280
00:21:09,723 --> 00:21:10,850
But I want kids.

281
00:21:10,957 --> 00:21:14,223
Without a husband? How immoral.

282
00:21:14,561 --> 00:21:17,053
Look who's talking about morality.

283
00:21:24,471 --> 00:21:27,532
Hey, what about that deadline?

284
00:21:29,409 --> 00:21:31,969
I couldn't write until I saw Rabi.

285
00:21:32,512 --> 00:21:35,038
Buried nearby, take you tomorrow.

286
00:21:43,290 --> 00:21:45,225
Are you Kenichiro?

287
00:21:45,692 --> 00:21:47,388
Hey...

288
00:21:48,361 --> 00:21:51,854
No. Hana. Kenichiro isn't here.

289
00:21:51,965 --> 00:21:57,233
We were just toasting together
for Rabi's good life.

290
00:21:57,337 --> 00:21:58,270
Without me?

291
00:21:58,371 --> 00:22:01,000
Because I thought you had deadlines.

292
00:22:01,274 --> 00:22:04,039
Just join us and have a fun night.

293
00:22:04,277 --> 00:22:05,677
Alright?

294
00:22:25,732 --> 00:22:28,759
She was old enough to die any day...

295
00:22:31,238 --> 00:22:36,074
...but I thought
maybe she could be immortal.

296
00:22:36,710 --> 00:22:38,770
She really lived for long.

297
00:22:39,312 --> 00:22:40,610
Yeah.

298
00:22:42,015 --> 00:22:45,508
Rabi didn't really like me.

299
00:22:47,187 --> 00:22:49,315
Really liked Takako.

300
00:22:49,689 --> 00:22:52,591
Really? That's not really true.

301
00:22:54,327 --> 00:22:58,492
She wouldn't come to me
even when I got home.

302
00:22:58,665 --> 00:23:03,000
She didn't come to me, either.
Probably too old to move.

303
00:23:03,103 --> 00:23:05,299
Nope. I'm right.

304
00:23:05,939 --> 00:23:08,170
She just liked you better.

305
00:23:09,109 --> 00:23:13,843
Cats choose their favorites
differently than dogs do.

306
00:23:13,947 --> 00:23:15,108
You had cats?

307
00:23:15,215 --> 00:23:16,478
Both dog and cat.

308
00:23:17,550 --> 00:23:22,113
Dogs like authority,
so listens to the dad.

309
00:23:22,222 --> 00:23:24,418
Or mom in some households.

310
00:23:25,992 --> 00:23:30,453
But cats like to look after others.
they choose the most...

311
00:23:30,563 --> 00:23:33,362
...weak or lonely one in the house.

312
00:23:34,367 --> 00:23:39,567
I was always bullied by my sister
being the youngest one.

313
00:23:39,673 --> 00:23:45,112
The cat would come and lick me
when I was crying by myself.

314
00:23:46,546 --> 00:23:50,039
So Rabi probably stopped coming to you...

315
00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:52,813
...because you became stronger.

316
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:56,881
Or someone weaker came into this house.

317
00:23:57,257 --> 00:23:58,623
Talking about me?

318
00:24:00,927 --> 00:24:03,658
No. but cats are loyal...

319
00:24:03,763 --> 00:24:05,891
...and loyal to only one.

320
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:08,698
Thank you Takeshi.

321
00:24:09,536 --> 00:24:10,868
Sorry for hitting you.

322
00:24:10,971 --> 00:24:12,997
No. I'm really okay.

323
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:17,407
I just get so emotional sometimes.

324
00:24:18,712 --> 00:24:21,944
Just heard about a nasty guy before.

325
00:24:22,315 --> 00:24:24,341
How was he nasty?

326
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:31,385
A guy that can sleep with a girl
he doesn't even like.

327
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:35,624
You thought that was me?

328
00:24:35,729 --> 00:24:37,664
I really am sorry.

329
00:24:38,465 --> 00:24:41,264
But most guys are like that.

330
00:24:41,368 --> 00:24:44,065
Not every guy is like you.

331
00:24:44,170 --> 00:24:46,196
I'm not talking about me.

332
00:24:51,878 --> 00:24:53,005
Kenji

333
00:24:55,648 --> 00:24:58,083
Kenji, are you okay?

334
00:24:58,485 --> 00:25:01,319
Yes, I'm fine, really fine.

335
00:25:01,454 --> 00:25:03,855
He's really just a quiet guy.

336
00:25:06,693 --> 00:25:08,355
Anything else but beer?

337
00:25:09,896 --> 00:25:10,920
Need to buy some.

338
00:25:11,031 --> 00:25:12,363
I'll go get some.

339
00:25:13,066 --> 00:25:14,932
No. I'll go get some.

340
00:25:15,035 --> 00:25:16,401
What do you want?

341
00:25:17,704 --> 00:25:19,764
I want some red wine.

342
00:25:20,206 --> 00:25:21,799
Please.

343
00:25:22,409 --> 00:25:23,570
Store is far.

344
00:25:23,676 --> 00:25:24,939
I know.

345
00:25:28,014 --> 00:25:30,040
Going to get cigarettes.

346
00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:31,479
You. Takeshi?

347
00:25:31,751 --> 00:25:32,548
I'm okay.

348
00:25:33,553 --> 00:25:34,714
Only need some.

349
00:25:35,255 --> 00:25:37,486
Okay. we're going.

350
00:25:44,364 --> 00:25:45,889
Would you like one?

351
00:25:45,999 --> 00:25:47,968
Sure, thanks.

352
00:26:03,850 --> 00:26:04,909
Picking up?

353
00:26:05,018 --> 00:26:06,611
Not going to.

354
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:11,815
Some things just can't be done
or solved no matter what.

355
00:26:12,258 --> 00:26:13,783
Well, maybe.

356
00:26:13,993 --> 00:26:16,019
I can't figure out writers.

357
00:26:20,266 --> 00:26:21,825
Just a second please.

358
00:26:42,755 --> 00:26:43,848
Yes...

359
00:26:43,957 --> 00:26:45,516
Thank you.

360
00:26:50,130 --> 00:26:51,223
Thank you.

361
00:26:51,998 --> 00:26:53,364
It's raining a bit.

362
00:26:53,466 --> 00:26:54,991
Yeah...

363
00:27:13,019 --> 00:27:17,354
Can't you smoke inside if
this is your house?

364
00:27:17,790 --> 00:27:21,784
Don't want walls getting dirty
and it's a habit.

365
00:27:22,829 --> 00:27:25,731
Rabi hated cigarette smokes anyways.

366
00:27:26,166 --> 00:27:29,625
The house was for Rabi, you giving it up?

367
00:27:30,770 --> 00:27:33,239
Not immediately, and also.

368
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:36,568
...I have some memories here.

369
00:27:36,809 --> 00:27:39,142
Still smells of Rabi.

370
00:27:41,214 --> 00:27:43,877
And Takako would have nowhere to go.

371
00:27:48,488 --> 00:27:50,548
This house is the problem.

372
00:27:51,758 --> 00:27:52,953
What?

373
00:27:53,593 --> 00:27:58,588
I know that guy, Kenichiro.
that you were talking about.

374
00:27:59,599 --> 00:28:01,761
He's not at all a bad guy.

375
00:28:02,535 --> 00:28:06,666
But it's the girl
who gets hurt in those situations.

376
00:28:06,773 --> 00:28:08,605
Regardless of the age.

377
00:28:08,708 --> 00:28:10,233
Yes true...

378
00:28:11,311 --> 00:28:14,509
When I came to this house, I thought...

379
00:28:15,048 --> 00:28:19,452
...a girl without earnings shouldn't be
living here.

380
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:22,155
It's complicating.

381
00:28:24,190 --> 00:28:26,091
Maybe it is my fault...

382
00:28:27,727 --> 00:28:31,892
Though if someone offered
this house to me,

383
00:28:31,998 --> 00:28:36,060
...I'd definitely live here. So nice and big.

384
00:28:36,336 --> 00:28:37,668
What?

385
00:28:37,837 --> 00:28:39,499
It's funny.

386
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:49,112
Oh yeah.

387
00:28:49,616 --> 00:28:52,848
Can I come visit your office someday?

388
00:28:53,019 --> 00:28:54,214
The plant?

389
00:28:55,622 --> 00:28:57,454
Sure, it's fine.

390
00:28:57,557 --> 00:28:59,287
Hey, just a moment.

391
00:29:07,233 --> 00:29:09,099
Here you go.

392
00:29:10,036 --> 00:29:11,470
Thank you.

393
00:29:13,673 --> 00:29:18,407
Just tell give my name
and you can visit any time.

394
00:29:19,912 --> 00:29:25,874
But you won't find anything for your
love novels at a meat-packing plant.

395
00:29:26,919 --> 00:29:29,787
I don't always write about love.

396
00:29:30,123 --> 00:29:33,218
Besides, I just like plants.

397
00:29:33,926 --> 00:29:40,355
And I'm sure there's love going on
inside the meat-packing plant.

398
00:29:42,769 --> 00:29:44,362
Maybe part-timers?

399
00:29:45,571 --> 00:29:46,766
Yeah. with...

400
00:29:48,274 --> 00:29:49,833
...plant managers.

401
00:29:55,348 --> 00:29:58,614
To be honest, I've never read your books.

402
00:29:58,718 --> 00:30:00,277
Oh it's fine.

403
00:30:13,833 --> 00:30:15,995
Hurry up. Come on.

404
00:30:16,102 --> 00:30:17,627
Don't push.

405
00:30:22,342 --> 00:30:24,038
We're back.

406
00:30:25,745 --> 00:30:27,145
Hana?

407
00:30:27,246 --> 00:30:28,544
Takeshi?

408
00:30:37,557 --> 00:30:38,957
Not in the balcony.

409
00:30:49,969 --> 00:30:51,403
His cell is off.

410
00:30:51,504 --> 00:30:53,564
Sure, you turned it off.

411
00:30:55,208 --> 00:30:56,540
Look for them?

412
00:30:56,642 --> 00:30:57,268
No.

413
00:30:57,844 --> 00:31:01,713
They are mature adults,
so leave them alone.

414
00:31:10,723 --> 00:31:12,089
Takeshi

415
00:31:13,426 --> 00:31:14,951
Hana's gone.

416
00:31:15,061 --> 00:31:16,324
Oh.

417
00:31:16,429 --> 00:31:20,491
She wanted to write.
Said bye to you all.

418
00:31:20,933 --> 00:31:22,629
Busy person.

419
00:31:23,102 --> 00:31:25,333
She's such a free bird.

420
00:31:26,339 --> 00:31:27,807
Don't scare me.

421
00:31:28,174 --> 00:31:29,699
What?

422
00:31:36,282 --> 00:31:38,410
Oh, it's Hana's.

423
00:31:38,985 --> 00:31:40,749
Maybe it's her?

424
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:43,321
I don't think so.

425
00:32:42,114 --> 00:32:43,412
Hello?

426
00:32:44,417 --> 00:32:45,715
Hello?

427
00:32:48,154 --> 00:32:49,520
I'm sorry.

428
00:32:50,256 --> 00:32:53,021
I have to tell you something.

429
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:56,227
No. I'm outside now.

430
00:32:56,996 --> 00:32:58,555
Looking for you.

431
00:32:59,198 --> 00:33:02,430
I'll be a father soon.

432
00:33:02,635 --> 00:33:04,297
I'm married.

433
00:33:04,704 --> 00:33:06,332
That's why I left.

434
00:33:07,173 --> 00:33:09,870
Sorry if I hurt your feeling.

435
00:33:09,976 --> 00:33:11,342
But...

436
00:33:11,978 --> 00:33:15,176
...talking to you is very exciting.

437
00:33:15,915 --> 00:33:17,440
You're cute.

438
00:33:17,817 --> 00:33:19,410
You're wonderful.

439
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:22,579
You know that.

440
00:33:24,724 --> 00:33:28,183
You have my card? My number's there.

441
00:33:43,276 --> 00:33:45,040
Think they met?

442
00:33:45,278 --> 00:33:47,110
I guess so.

443
00:33:48,514 --> 00:33:51,143
He'll be a father soon.

444
00:33:52,518 --> 00:33:54,578
Are you disappointed?

445
00:33:56,255 --> 00:33:58,156
I don't expect anything.

446
00:33:58,257 --> 00:33:59,885
Can't reach him.

447
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:02,626
She's always like that.

448
00:34:03,062 --> 00:34:05,827
Free and reckless.

449
00:34:07,199 --> 00:34:09,566
You like that?

450
00:34:13,272 --> 00:34:17,209
Sure, it's attractive. She's charming.

451
00:34:17,343 --> 00:34:20,040
You like all charming women?

452
00:34:22,348 --> 00:34:25,546
Sure, I love charming women.

453
00:34:26,619 --> 00:34:28,144
You too. Takako.

454
00:34:28,821 --> 00:34:29,584
Thanks.

455
00:34:29,689 --> 00:34:31,021
You're welcome.

456
00:34:33,059 --> 00:34:33,617
And Kaho?

457
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:37,719
Sure, she's great. She is the one.

458
00:34:41,367 --> 00:34:42,460
Right?

459
00:34:44,136 --> 00:34:45,160
Sure.

460
00:34:49,175 --> 00:34:52,873
What's so good about her?

461
00:34:55,314 --> 00:34:56,805
Her chin.

462
00:34:59,051 --> 00:35:00,485
She's kind.

463
00:35:03,756 --> 00:35:05,918
Has beautiful skin.

464
00:35:07,627 --> 00:35:09,152
Earnest.

465
00:35:09,528 --> 00:35:11,258
Self-contained.

466
00:35:12,865 --> 00:35:14,197
Her ears.

467
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:16,728
Her nose and fingers.

468
00:35:17,203 --> 00:35:18,694
All about her looks.

469
00:35:18,971 --> 00:35:22,567
Her voice. I love listening to her voice.

470
00:35:23,242 --> 00:35:24,904
A good cook.

471
00:35:25,244 --> 00:35:26,109
That's good.

472
00:35:26,212 --> 00:35:27,874
Makes amazing food.

473
00:35:29,382 --> 00:35:31,442
She's honest.

474
00:35:33,653 --> 00:35:37,181
Is it different from earnest?

475
00:35:38,124 --> 00:35:39,251
Shoot.

476
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:43,295
She dates a guy like you...

477
00:35:43,929 --> 00:35:45,090
...and will marry.

478
00:35:48,234 --> 00:35:49,896
That hurts.

479
00:35:50,836 --> 00:35:52,862
I like you.

480
00:35:54,607 --> 00:35:57,202
I love Kaho more than you.

481
00:36:03,416 --> 00:36:08,445
Kenichiro doesn't know anything
about Kaho. That's why he wasn't good.

482
00:36:09,522 --> 00:36:12,082
Kenichiro is a bad person.

483
00:36:12,892 --> 00:36:14,588
Not as bad as you.

484
00:36:46,659 --> 00:36:48,093
Takeshi!

485
00:38:24,857 --> 00:38:26,155
Hey...

486
00:38:27,493 --> 00:38:29,860
Were you awake?

487
00:38:31,630 --> 00:38:33,189
What time is it?

488
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:36,330
Oh. It's about five.

489
00:38:44,543 --> 00:38:46,136
Where were you?

490
00:38:48,447 --> 00:38:49,881
Guess.

491
00:38:50,616 --> 00:38:53,450
I don't want to guess.

492
00:38:54,019 --> 00:38:56,181
Where do you think?

493
00:38:58,958 --> 00:39:01,587
Stay, I'm coming to bed.

494
00:39:01,694 --> 00:39:03,060
I'm thirsty.

495
00:39:21,347 --> 00:39:22,440
Hey.

496
00:39:22,848 --> 00:39:24,783
Just a cup of coffee.

497
00:39:24,884 --> 00:39:26,216
Thanks.

498
00:39:34,693 --> 00:39:36,355
I don't see the key.

499
00:39:37,930 --> 00:39:39,558
Locked out?

500
00:39:43,369 --> 00:39:44,860
How careless.

501
00:39:53,012 --> 00:39:53,741
Hey.

502
00:39:53,846 --> 00:39:55,371
Hey.

503
00:39:58,617 --> 00:39:59,607
Hi. Kenichiro.

504
00:40:00,085 --> 00:40:01,519
Were you awake?

505
00:40:02,087 --> 00:40:03,248
Waiting?

506
00:40:03,656 --> 00:40:05,488
I couldn't sleep.

507
00:40:05,591 --> 00:40:09,221
Don't you have school today?
Take a nap.

508
00:40:09,328 --> 00:40:14,062
No. I'm fine.
I can only sleep about an hour.

509
00:40:18,237 --> 00:40:20,797
We are having coffee. Want some?

510
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:23,336
Thanks for asking.

511
00:40:26,345 --> 00:40:27,870
Where were you?

512
00:40:29,281 --> 00:40:32,376
Bar, and then a book cafe.

513
00:40:32,952 --> 00:40:35,854
I called you once.

514
00:40:35,955 --> 00:40:37,446
It didn't have reception.

515
00:40:37,556 --> 00:40:39,149
Oh.

516
00:40:39,258 --> 00:40:41,124
I worried about you.

517
00:40:42,761 --> 00:40:44,024
What book?

518
00:40:44,129 --> 00:40:45,654
You wouldn't know.

519
00:40:45,764 --> 00:40:47,130
Like what?

520
00:40:47,499 --> 00:40:49,161
Fumi Yoshinaga.

521
00:40:49,735 --> 00:40:50,464
Don't know.

522
00:40:50,569 --> 00:40:51,161
See?

523
00:40:51,570 --> 00:40:53,004
Want coffee?

524
00:40:54,106 --> 00:40:55,574
Yeah.

525
00:40:56,108 --> 00:40:57,007
Thank you.

526
00:40:57,109 --> 00:40:58,509
Hold on.

527
00:41:00,813 --> 00:41:02,907
How about you, Kenichiro?

528
00:41:06,552 --> 00:41:09,681
You haven't had any sleep?

529
00:41:10,189 --> 00:41:11,521
Um...

530
00:41:12,124 --> 00:41:13,990
Just a little bit.

531
00:41:18,464 --> 00:41:19,727
Kaho

532
00:41:21,133 --> 00:41:21,896
Kaho

533
00:41:23,569 --> 00:41:24,298
Kaho

534
00:41:25,938 --> 00:41:28,430
Are you okay?

535
00:41:31,710 --> 00:41:33,303
Get some rest.

536
00:41:33,912 --> 00:41:38,373
I'm fine.
Today's the last class of the semester.

537
00:41:38,650 --> 00:41:40,084
You're fine?

538
00:41:40,285 --> 00:41:41,617
Yeah. Thanks.

539
00:41:41,754 --> 00:41:43,120
I'm fine.

540
00:42:02,374 --> 00:42:04,240
Okay. That's it.

541
00:42:05,044 --> 00:42:07,604
Collect papers from the back.

542
00:42:24,129 --> 00:42:28,066
The papers will be returned tomorrow.

543
00:42:28,267 --> 00:42:31,328
Review over the winter break.

544
00:42:33,705 --> 00:42:37,870
Give me a few minutes of your time.

545
00:42:39,912 --> 00:42:45,249
I won't ask who brought flowers for Togawa.

546
00:42:45,918 --> 00:42:47,546
Thank you.

547
00:42:50,456 --> 00:42:55,656
We don't know why Togawa
killed himself. But...

548
00:42:56,695 --> 00:43:00,063
...we don't commit suicide without a reason.

549
00:43:00,532 --> 00:43:03,331
I believe there was violence.

550
00:43:03,969 --> 00:43:08,065
That completely destroyed Togawa's life.

551
00:43:09,041 --> 00:43:12,500
Let's talk about violence.

552
00:43:13,011 --> 00:43:18,348
That leads us to think about
Togawa and our own lives.

553
00:43:20,552 --> 00:43:21,850
Tajima

554
00:43:22,454 --> 00:43:25,481
Have you ever used violence?

555
00:43:26,358 --> 00:43:27,951
I think so.

556
00:43:28,961 --> 00:43:30,452
Why did you do it?

557
00:43:31,063 --> 00:43:36,263
I don't remember, but I was irritated or
things didn't go right.

558
00:43:36,368 --> 00:43:38,098
Would you do it again?

559
00:43:38,203 --> 00:43:39,933
I don't want to.

560
00:43:41,106 --> 00:43:42,631
Why is that?

561
00:43:42,875 --> 00:43:44,002
Well...

562
00:43:44,476 --> 00:43:46,843
Violence is wrong.

563
00:43:46,945 --> 00:43:48,811
Why is it wrong?

564
00:43:49,281 --> 00:43:51,216
It hurts people.

565
00:43:51,617 --> 00:43:53,984
But you don't get hurt.

566
00:43:54,653 --> 00:43:57,054
But it might come back to me.

567
00:43:57,156 --> 00:44:02,788
So, you don't use violence
because you might get hurt?

568
00:44:03,896 --> 00:44:05,728
That's one side.

569
00:44:06,131 --> 00:44:11,365
Even if you don't use violence,
you might suddenly get hurt.

570
00:44:12,271 --> 00:44:14,604
What can I do?

571
00:44:14,706 --> 00:44:18,108
Can't help if I met a random killer.

572
00:44:18,243 --> 00:44:19,609
Hmm.

573
00:44:20,879 --> 00:44:24,816
Probably. there are two types of violence.

574
00:44:25,751 --> 00:44:28,277
What do you think. Yaguchi?

575
00:44:28,387 --> 00:44:32,290
Verbal violence and physical violence?

576
00:44:32,758 --> 00:44:36,217
Yes. It's a typical way to group.

577
00:44:36,762 --> 00:44:41,791
But, they're actually the same.
Anything else?

578
00:44:42,234 --> 00:44:44,328
Men's vs women's violence.

579
00:44:44,436 --> 00:44:46,302
How are they different?

580
00:44:46,838 --> 00:44:49,740
Like sexual harassment.

581
00:44:49,841 --> 00:44:53,903
Men's violence includes sexual harassment.

582
00:44:54,079 --> 00:44:57,208
But, women does the same.

583
00:44:58,450 --> 00:44:59,645
Anything else?

584
00:45:02,554 --> 00:45:04,989
As Tajima mentioned.

585
00:45:05,457 --> 00:45:09,827
...there are violence that comes
from and to ourselves.

586
00:45:11,363 --> 00:45:12,626
Kawaguchi

587
00:45:13,165 --> 00:45:15,066
Am I you?

588
00:45:15,467 --> 00:45:16,765
No.

589
00:45:16,868 --> 00:45:19,736
Can you see what I think?

590
00:45:19,838 --> 00:45:20,931
No.

591
00:45:21,039 --> 00:45:23,907
I can't see yours either.

592
00:45:24,009 --> 00:45:25,705
We are different.

593
00:45:27,079 --> 00:45:30,345
We can't see through each other.

594
00:45:34,219 --> 00:45:34,982
Sawada

595
00:45:35,654 --> 00:45:38,556
Do you think I will hit you?

596
00:45:39,024 --> 00:45:39,992
No.

597
00:45:40,092 --> 00:45:41,253
Why?

598
00:45:42,461 --> 00:45:43,690
There's no reason.

599
00:45:44,062 --> 00:45:46,258
Punishment isn't right.

600
00:45:46,498 --> 00:45:48,797
But I might hit you.

601
00:45:49,401 --> 00:45:53,532
I might have a reason to hit you.

602
00:45:57,376 --> 00:46:01,814
If I decide to hit you, you can't stop me.

603
00:46:03,348 --> 00:46:06,512
This violence comes from the outside.

604
00:46:07,319 --> 00:46:10,414
But for me, it comes from the inside.

605
00:46:11,323 --> 00:46:13,053
Now, you understand.

606
00:46:21,700 --> 00:46:23,066
<i>"I "</i>

607
00:46:24,736 --> 00:46:26,204
<i>"Sawada"</i>

608
00:46:31,943 --> 00:46:33,104
<i>"Violence"</i>

609
00:46:34,246 --> 00:46:38,547
This " I " happened to be me, Kaho Tanemura.

610
00:46:38,750 --> 00:46:41,276
But this " I " could be anyone.

611
00:46:41,687 --> 00:46:44,486
This "Sawada" could be replaced.

612
00:46:48,927 --> 00:46:49,826
<i>"Others"</i>

613
00:46:49,928 --> 00:46:53,729
It sounds obvious, but we are all " I ".

614
00:46:54,566 --> 00:46:57,502
But from others, we are all "Others".

615
00:46:58,003 --> 00:47:02,270
As I showed,
we can't stop violence from "Others".

616
00:47:04,476 --> 00:47:10,473
But, we all as " I " can stop
using violence to "Others".

617
00:47:13,652 --> 00:47:17,020
This "Others" can easily use violence.

618
00:47:17,389 --> 00:47:21,986
But I can decide not to use my violence.

619
00:47:22,661 --> 00:47:27,531
This is all we can do against violence.

620
00:47:28,166 --> 00:47:29,361
Ms. Tanemura

621
00:47:29,634 --> 00:47:30,727
Nagase

622
00:47:31,269 --> 00:47:34,433
Sawada could have stopped you.

623
00:47:34,539 --> 00:47:38,533
He could have hit you back in self-defense.

624
00:47:38,643 --> 00:47:39,440
Yes.

625
00:47:39,611 --> 00:47:40,943
He could.

626
00:47:41,046 --> 00:47:45,040
But it doesn't stop violence. Why?

627
00:47:47,953 --> 00:47:49,979
That's violence, too.

628
00:47:51,323 --> 00:47:52,552
That's right.

629
00:47:53,191 --> 00:47:54,625
Right, Hyogo.

630
00:47:56,762 --> 00:47:59,129
<i>" = Violence"</i>

631
00:47:59,698 --> 00:48:03,601
We can't respond violence to violence.

632
00:48:03,935 --> 00:48:06,404
If so. violence grows.

633
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:14,477
When violence balances, it seems peaceful.
And seems to disappear.

634
00:48:14,646 --> 00:48:19,641
However. violence is right next to us.

635
00:48:21,653 --> 00:48:23,679
" I " can only stop violence.

636
00:48:23,789 --> 00:48:28,022
So, we shouldn't use violence
even if we are used?

637
00:48:28,627 --> 00:48:29,356
Yes.

638
00:48:29,861 --> 00:48:34,356
That's not fair.
I don't like that idea.

639
00:48:34,499 --> 00:48:37,128
But you shouldn't use violence.

640
00:48:37,235 --> 00:48:39,761
So, just accept it?

641
00:48:40,138 --> 00:48:41,401
Yes.

642
00:48:44,543 --> 00:48:49,948
The only way to face violence is
to accept it.

643
00:48:50,882 --> 00:48:53,681
Forgive violence.

644
00:48:53,785 --> 00:48:55,344
Even get killed?

645
00:48:55,754 --> 00:48:56,778
Yes.

646
00:48:56,888 --> 00:48:59,187
How can you forgive that?

647
00:48:59,691 --> 00:49:03,321
Maybe to be killed is the way to forgive.

648
00:49:03,428 --> 00:49:07,889
I don't want to be killed.
I want to live.

649
00:49:08,333 --> 00:49:09,767
Me too.

650
00:49:10,268 --> 00:49:15,104
But you decide to live,
and choose to live.

651
00:49:16,475 --> 00:49:20,276
Killing takes away all that possibilities.

652
00:49:20,912 --> 00:49:23,279
Killing won't let us choose.

653
00:49:23,682 --> 00:49:26,709
It's the most heinous violence.

654
00:49:27,786 --> 00:49:30,381
It cannot happen.

655
00:49:30,522 --> 00:49:34,425
Then. what's the law for?

656
00:49:35,794 --> 00:49:37,922
Law gives punishment.

657
00:49:38,263 --> 00:49:44,032
Law is a form of violence.
It makes violence invisible.

658
00:49:44,302 --> 00:49:47,466
But violence don't disappear.

659
00:49:48,507 --> 00:49:52,842
We can only stand against violence
by accepting it.

660
00:49:53,979 --> 00:49:57,973
We each can choose to accept it.

661
00:50:00,085 --> 00:50:03,385
This is the only way to stop violence.

662
00:50:03,688 --> 00:50:04,246
Ms. Tanemura

663
00:50:05,123 --> 00:50:06,386
Choose?

664
00:50:06,491 --> 00:50:09,928
Yes. We get to choose because we have will.

665
00:50:11,329 --> 00:50:13,628
I hit Hyogo in the bathroom.

666
00:50:16,234 --> 00:50:17,600
Really?

667
00:50:20,105 --> 00:50:25,703
I didn't punch his face,
but kicked his stomach several times.

668
00:50:27,312 --> 00:50:29,679
There was no choice.

669
00:50:31,783 --> 00:50:33,081
Why?

670
00:50:33,318 --> 00:50:37,653
I don't know.
I just wanted to punch and kick him.

671
00:50:38,590 --> 00:50:40,525
It didn't have to be Hyogo.

672
00:50:44,829 --> 00:50:46,730
Like the chart you drew.

673
00:50:47,232 --> 00:50:50,327
No violence comes inside from us.

674
00:50:50,902 --> 00:50:53,337
Violence comes from outside.

675
00:50:53,872 --> 00:50:57,639
And. we don't get to choose that.

676
00:50:58,176 --> 00:51:00,168
Can you forgive me?

677
00:51:01,079 --> 00:51:03,378
Forgive me in front of Hyogo.

678
00:51:04,549 --> 00:51:07,041
Hyogo chooses to forgive.

679
00:51:07,319 --> 00:51:09,618
Hyogo. can you forgive me?

680
00:51:12,724 --> 00:51:14,022
Kasai

681
00:51:15,493 --> 00:51:17,724
You did the same to Togawa?

682
00:51:17,829 --> 00:51:18,922
Yes.

683
00:51:20,165 --> 00:51:21,861
I did the same.

684
00:51:22,867 --> 00:51:24,733
But it's not just me.

685
00:51:29,174 --> 00:51:32,042
Stand up if you've done
something to Togawa.

686
00:51:32,911 --> 00:51:34,402
He forgives us.

687
00:51:54,799 --> 00:51:56,495
There's more of us.

688
00:51:58,069 --> 00:52:00,868
Stand still.

689
00:52:01,906 --> 00:52:03,340
I'll be right back.

690
00:52:56,294 --> 00:52:57,387
Hey.

691
00:52:57,495 --> 00:52:58,986
Hey.

692
00:52:59,164 --> 00:53:00,962
You were late.

693
00:53:02,367 --> 00:53:03,596
Want pasta?

694
00:53:04,602 --> 00:53:05,968
What sauce?

695
00:53:06,071 --> 00:53:07,699
Meat sauce.

696
00:53:08,506 --> 00:53:09,906
I'll have some.

697
00:53:10,008 --> 00:53:11,670
Hold on.

698
00:53:11,776 --> 00:53:13,267
Thank you.

699
00:53:13,378 --> 00:53:14,778
Sure.

700
00:53:31,596 --> 00:53:32,996
Did tutoring?

701
00:53:34,365 --> 00:53:35,458
Yeah.

702
00:53:43,842 --> 00:53:45,333
What's wrong?

703
00:53:47,579 --> 00:53:49,810
Next week will be rough.

704
00:53:50,615 --> 00:53:52,516
It's going to be rough.

705
00:53:53,017 --> 00:53:56,181
Why? It's almost winter break.

706
00:53:58,189 --> 00:53:59,487
Tomoya

707
00:54:01,259 --> 00:54:03,592
Please stand by me.

708
00:54:04,095 --> 00:54:05,654
What happened?

709
00:54:06,831 --> 00:54:08,857
Too stupid to tell you.

710
00:54:10,001 --> 00:54:11,333
Okay.

711
00:54:15,206 --> 00:54:16,936
I want to quit.

712
00:54:19,110 --> 00:54:20,703
Seriously.

713
00:54:20,812 --> 00:54:22,041
Quit teaching?

714
00:54:22,680 --> 00:54:25,115
I don't see anything.

715
00:54:26,417 --> 00:54:30,616
Why don't you quit
if you really want to.

716
00:54:38,429 --> 00:54:40,022
Huh?

717
00:54:40,598 --> 00:54:42,123
I don't know.

718
00:54:42,801 --> 00:54:44,861
What do you want me to do?

719
00:54:46,604 --> 00:54:49,096
Just stay by my side.

720
00:54:51,576 --> 00:54:54,910
I want to, but I may not be able to.

721
00:54:55,947 --> 00:54:57,108
Why?

722
00:54:57,215 --> 00:55:01,414
Well,
I might have to move from Tokyo someday.

723
00:55:01,519 --> 00:55:03,545
I may not be in Japan.

724
00:55:04,355 --> 00:55:08,690
If you continue teaching,
I can't stay close to you.

725
00:55:09,127 --> 00:55:10,959
Although I want to.

726
00:55:11,062 --> 00:55:13,361
Then. I'll quit.

727
00:55:14,933 --> 00:55:19,098
To be honest, you shouldn't quit.

728
00:55:19,771 --> 00:55:21,364
Why? Money?

729
00:55:21,873 --> 00:55:26,811
That's one reason.
but women should work too.

730
00:55:26,945 --> 00:55:29,813
Women should be economically free.

731
00:55:30,215 --> 00:55:34,448
So that they can decide
when they have to.

732
00:55:39,123 --> 00:55:40,989
Talking about divorce?

733
00:55:41,659 --> 00:55:45,061
It's possible. We need tension.

734
00:55:45,163 --> 00:55:47,428
I want security.

735
00:55:47,732 --> 00:55:51,601
Then. I may not be the best match.

736
00:55:59,644 --> 00:56:01,169
What if

737
00:56:03,581 --> 00:56:08,485
I got raped or killed?
What would you do?

738
00:56:09,087 --> 00:56:11,147
That's a bizarre question.

739
00:56:11,256 --> 00:56:15,853
But it could happen. It can be reality.

740
00:56:21,933 --> 00:56:23,128
I'll kill him.

741
00:56:27,038 --> 00:56:32,033
I will find that person,
and torture and kill him.

742
00:56:39,584 --> 00:56:40,745
Hey.

743
00:56:41,052 --> 00:56:42,315
You alright?

744
00:56:43,254 --> 00:56:45,780
I don't know.

745
00:56:52,397 --> 00:56:56,300
I'm mentally and physically unbalanced.

746
00:58:01,833 --> 00:58:03,131
Tomoya

747
00:58:03,968 --> 00:58:07,336
I haven't heard the important word.

748
00:58:08,706 --> 00:58:10,436
Oh, yes.

749
00:58:15,613 --> 00:58:19,015
Please let me marry your daughter.

750
00:58:20,151 --> 00:58:23,610
Do you really want to marry her?

751
00:58:24,288 --> 00:58:25,551
Yes.

752
00:58:27,358 --> 00:58:30,920
I believe you better not.

753
00:58:33,031 --> 00:58:34,659
I'm not suitable?

754
00:58:35,867 --> 00:58:40,498
Well, I won't stop you
because you are both adults.

755
00:58:41,839 --> 00:58:43,273
Mom

756
00:58:44,942 --> 00:58:48,743
Is that because
I don't have much salary?

757
00:58:48,846 --> 00:58:51,042
That's not a big problem.

758
00:58:53,951 --> 00:58:56,750
Then is it about my personality?

759
00:58:57,221 --> 00:58:58,746
Well, yes.

760
00:59:00,258 --> 00:59:04,628
I guess I don't like you.

761
00:59:06,964 --> 00:59:12,369
I felt this way when I first met you.

762
00:59:12,603 --> 00:59:16,062
I should have said something then.

763
00:59:16,707 --> 00:59:19,643
Didn't expect it to last.

764
00:59:23,915 --> 00:59:25,508
You...

765
00:59:26,684 --> 00:59:31,054
...don't have sincerity.
I don't feel anything.

766
00:59:32,256 --> 00:59:33,952
Sincerity...

767
00:59:34,492 --> 00:59:36,256
Truth.

768
00:59:36,627 --> 00:59:39,153
You don't have the truth.

769
00:59:39,597 --> 00:59:42,260
I can't trust you.

770
00:59:42,366 --> 00:59:45,200
I've only met you once before.

771
00:59:45,369 --> 00:59:47,838
I can tell. It's obvious.

772
00:59:48,039 --> 00:59:53,068
Mom, I want to marry him.
I chose him.

773
00:59:53,444 --> 00:59:55,436
That's why I can't stop you.

774
00:59:57,348 --> 00:59:58,976
But, Tomoya

775
00:59:59,584 --> 01:00:03,077
Can you keep this relationship?

776
01:00:03,788 --> 01:00:08,658
If you marry her.
our relationship will continue forever.

777
01:00:09,260 --> 01:00:12,389
If you say more. I will never
see you again.

778
01:00:12,597 --> 01:00:14,429
You know your father.

779
01:00:14,532 --> 01:00:17,661
Don't overlap your mistake to us.

780
01:00:18,436 --> 01:00:22,874
Him and I are different people.

781
01:00:22,974 --> 01:00:26,274
Let me ask you again.

782
01:00:28,012 --> 01:00:30,675
Do you really want to marry her?

783
01:00:33,217 --> 01:00:36,710
Did you really choose her?

784
01:01:50,661 --> 01:01:52,357
Hey, what's up?

785
01:01:52,930 --> 01:01:53,727
Sorry.

786
01:01:55,433 --> 01:01:56,162
Is it okay?

787
01:01:56,801 --> 01:01:59,896
Why didn't you call? I have a guest.

788
01:02:01,539 --> 01:02:02,734
I'll leave.

789
01:02:03,941 --> 01:02:04,408
Bye.

790
01:02:04,508 --> 01:02:06,067
What's wrong?

791
01:02:09,847 --> 01:02:11,042
I...

792
01:02:11,582 --> 01:02:13,346
...wanted to see you.

793
01:02:16,921 --> 01:02:18,287
If it's okay.

794
01:02:18,556 --> 01:02:20,047
It's okay.

795
01:02:20,524 --> 01:02:21,958
Come in.

796
01:02:22,593 --> 01:02:23,356
Oh, no.

797
01:02:23,461 --> 01:02:24,724
It's Kenichiro.

798
01:02:35,573 --> 01:02:36,506
Hey.

799
01:02:39,610 --> 01:02:41,875
What are you doing here?

800
01:02:41,979 --> 01:02:45,780
Why? It's my friend's apartment.

801
01:02:46,984 --> 01:02:50,352
Don't disappoint Kaho. She only has you.

802
01:02:50,454 --> 01:02:54,585
I know, but it's none of your business.

803
01:02:55,726 --> 01:02:56,591
Leave now!

804
01:02:56,694 --> 01:03:00,995
Don't shout.
He's my guest and he was here first.

805
01:03:01,098 --> 01:03:04,193
Do you want to join us or leave?

806
01:03:06,570 --> 01:03:07,629
Then...

807
01:03:09,040 --> 01:03:10,508
...I'm going to Kaho's.

808
01:03:11,342 --> 01:03:13,538
Why didn't you do so?

809
01:03:14,712 --> 01:03:16,704
You should have gone.

810
01:03:18,716 --> 01:03:20,150
Kenichiro

811
01:03:20,251 --> 01:03:21,844
Leave.

812
01:03:22,753 --> 01:03:23,812
Don't come again.

813
01:03:27,058 --> 01:03:28,526
I won't.

814
01:03:33,597 --> 01:03:34,963
Good bye.

815
01:04:21,345 --> 01:04:22,313
Hey.

816
01:04:22,413 --> 01:04:23,711
Hey.

817
01:04:23,814 --> 01:04:25,146
Sorry.

818
01:04:25,816 --> 01:04:27,284
It's late.

819
01:04:27,985 --> 01:04:28,509
What?

820
01:04:28,719 --> 01:04:32,053
What a day. Do you want to come in?

821
01:04:32,156 --> 01:04:34,182
No. it's okay.

822
01:04:34,291 --> 01:04:35,782
Come here.

823
01:04:36,794 --> 01:04:37,887
Hey.

824
01:04:39,430 --> 01:04:40,557
What?

825
01:04:40,664 --> 01:04:41,791
Come in?

826
01:04:41,899 --> 01:04:44,698
No. Did Hana come to get her phone?

827
01:04:44,802 --> 01:04:47,704
Yes, this afternoon.

828
01:04:47,805 --> 01:04:48,431
Okay.

829
01:04:49,673 --> 01:04:52,438
Can you give me her number?

830
01:04:53,210 --> 01:04:54,337
Why?

831
01:04:54,545 --> 01:04:56,013
To apologize.

832
01:04:56,714 --> 01:05:00,207
Don't worry. She wasn't upset about you.

833
01:05:01,452 --> 01:05:03,819
Um. yeah.

834
01:05:04,321 --> 01:05:06,051
But I care.

835
01:05:06,991 --> 01:05:09,324
Send her a fan mail then.

836
01:05:10,995 --> 01:05:15,695
Anyway. I can't give her number so easily.
It's so strange.

837
01:05:15,800 --> 01:05:17,393
No. it's not.

838
01:05:17,668 --> 01:05:18,727
Come in.

839
01:05:18,903 --> 01:05:20,337
Why you say that?

840
01:05:20,438 --> 01:05:24,375
Now he sounds like him.
Don't keep talking there.

841
01:05:24,475 --> 01:05:26,444
Come. come in.

842
01:05:30,347 --> 01:05:31,815
Want some drink?

843
01:05:31,916 --> 01:05:33,544
No. I'll leave soon.

844
01:05:33,651 --> 01:05:34,880
To where?

845
01:05:35,453 --> 01:05:36,887
To my home.

846
01:05:36,987 --> 01:05:38,717
Had a place to go?

847
01:05:38,823 --> 01:05:40,348
I'm not you.

848
01:05:40,891 --> 01:05:42,621
You like Hana?

849
01:05:43,461 --> 01:05:44,861
I don't know.

850
01:05:45,196 --> 01:05:47,961
You better not. It happens a lot.

851
01:05:48,599 --> 01:05:51,296
I guess so, but I need to see her.

852
01:05:51,402 --> 01:05:52,529
Why?

853
01:05:53,103 --> 01:05:54,332
I want to know.

854
01:05:54,438 --> 01:05:55,428
Know what?

855
01:05:55,940 --> 01:05:56,407
Myself.

856
01:05:57,241 --> 01:05:59,233
You are such a fool.

857
01:05:59,343 --> 01:06:03,838
I know I sound absurd, but...

858
01:06:03,948 --> 01:06:06,110
...I'm a lot better than you.

859
01:06:06,217 --> 01:06:09,244
I've been sincere to one woman.

860
01:06:09,353 --> 01:06:12,790
I got married and will have a baby soon.

861
01:06:12,890 --> 01:06:15,655
I have a decent life than you do.

862
01:06:15,759 --> 01:06:17,625
Then. why are you here?

863
01:06:17,728 --> 01:06:21,995
I don't know. That's why I'm here.

864
01:06:22,099 --> 01:06:26,594
You might disagree,
but we both have a steady partner.

865
01:06:26,704 --> 01:06:28,673
But, came here for someone.

866
01:06:28,772 --> 01:06:31,264
Not someone. Want to see Hana.

867
01:06:31,375 --> 01:06:33,344
Nothing will happen.

868
01:06:34,678 --> 01:06:39,946
You missed the chance.
Once you miss it, it's over.

869
01:06:40,551 --> 01:06:41,883
You never know.

870
01:06:41,986 --> 01:06:47,050
Hana is over with you.
It's an embarrassing past.

871
01:06:47,491 --> 01:06:50,188
Yes, but you can give him her number.

872
01:06:50,294 --> 01:06:52,490
Who are you two?

873
01:06:52,863 --> 01:06:56,630
Don't look down on me.
I just met Kenichiro.

874
01:06:56,734 --> 01:07:02,674
I don't know what you were doing.
But, I'm different from you.

875
01:07:02,773 --> 01:07:04,036
Wait.

876
01:07:04,508 --> 01:07:09,412
None of your business, but
there's nothing between us.

877
01:07:09,680 --> 01:07:11,080
Kenichiro?

878
01:07:11,682 --> 01:07:15,380
We both don't have steady partners.

879
01:07:17,121 --> 01:07:18,555
But no love.

880
01:07:18,956 --> 01:07:20,948
That's the problem.

881
01:07:21,959 --> 01:07:23,450
Wait a minute.

882
01:07:24,061 --> 01:07:26,553
You came to know something.

883
01:07:27,431 --> 01:07:30,868
I got something I want to know. too.

884
01:07:30,968 --> 01:07:33,733
Stay here. I want you to be here.

885
01:08:02,600 --> 01:08:03,761
Drink.

886
01:08:05,836 --> 01:08:07,031
Come on.

887
01:08:16,780 --> 01:08:17,770
Give this.

888
01:08:22,519 --> 01:08:23,612
Drink this.

889
01:08:25,956 --> 01:08:27,185
Takeshi

890
01:08:28,359 --> 01:08:29,691
Why?

891
01:08:30,127 --> 01:08:31,925
Just drink this for me.

892
01:08:32,496 --> 01:08:33,623
Please.

893
01:08:55,653 --> 01:08:56,643
Good.

894
01:08:57,187 --> 01:08:58,553
Let's play a game.

895
01:08:58,922 --> 01:09:01,517
Let's talk honestly for an hour.

896
01:09:02,593 --> 01:09:06,325
There's a fountain in Mexico.

897
01:09:07,031 --> 01:09:12,800
It's called Fountain of Truth.
If you drink it, you can only say the truth.

898
01:09:13,137 --> 01:09:14,435
I had some, too.

899
01:09:15,139 --> 01:09:16,630
Doesn't work, then.

900
01:09:17,641 --> 01:09:21,772
But, we just had
the real Fountain of Truth.

901
01:09:24,314 --> 01:09:25,680
Are you okay?

902
01:09:26,850 --> 01:09:28,751
What do you want to do?

903
01:09:28,986 --> 01:09:33,048
I don't mean to reveal my secrets.

904
01:09:33,190 --> 01:09:36,058
Want to know who I really am.

905
01:09:38,796 --> 01:09:40,321
Is that fun?

906
01:09:41,231 --> 01:09:44,099
No. it's rather painful.

907
01:09:44,201 --> 01:09:47,365
Pain comes before fun.

908
01:09:47,638 --> 01:09:50,403
After an hour, we forget everything.

909
01:09:51,308 --> 01:09:53,539
Is there a winner?

910
01:09:55,045 --> 01:09:57,776
If you don't tell the truth.
you become looser.

911
01:09:57,981 --> 01:10:01,713
Help each other to find
new sides of everyone.

912
01:10:02,352 --> 01:10:03,684
How do we do it?

913
01:10:04,021 --> 01:10:06,320
Well...

914
01:10:12,796 --> 01:10:18,360
Someone tells the truth,
and then the person can ask a question.

915
01:10:18,602 --> 01:10:24,769
By answering that question honestly,
that person can ask something.

916
01:10:25,242 --> 01:10:27,643
Doesn't sound like it'll work.

917
01:10:28,512 --> 01:10:31,141
Don't care about your confessions.

918
01:10:31,248 --> 01:10:32,511
I don't either.

919
01:10:33,050 --> 01:10:35,576
I also don't want to confess.

920
01:10:35,686 --> 01:10:39,885
How would you know if I spoke honestly.

921
01:10:41,658 --> 01:10:43,627
Why are we doing this?

922
01:10:43,727 --> 01:10:46,925
You came here to know yourself, right?

923
01:10:47,030 --> 01:10:48,999
That's why we'll do this.

924
01:10:49,500 --> 01:10:53,437
It's to understand yourselves,
not me or her.

925
01:10:54,204 --> 01:10:58,801
It's about being honest to yourself.

926
01:10:59,543 --> 01:11:03,275
I know being honest is tough.

927
01:11:03,380 --> 01:11:04,746
But, we might....

928
01:11:04,848 --> 01:11:07,682
Whatever, ask.

929
01:11:10,621 --> 01:11:11,953
I'll confess.

930
01:11:12,589 --> 01:11:16,424
Then. ask a question.
Other rules will follow.

931
01:11:17,728 --> 01:11:20,163
We both answer the question?

932
01:11:20,264 --> 01:11:23,530
One. We fight for the right to ask.

933
01:11:23,634 --> 01:11:25,432
Just start.

934
01:11:28,338 --> 01:11:30,330
She lied about our relation.

935
01:11:31,441 --> 01:11:33,740
We did it three years ago.

936
01:11:35,379 --> 01:11:37,746
It's my latest affair.

937
01:11:40,184 --> 01:11:42,551
I thought we're not revealing.

938
01:11:42,653 --> 01:11:45,020
Had to say this to be honest.

939
01:11:46,456 --> 01:11:50,518
I just said we had an affair,
but it wasn't.

940
01:11:51,228 --> 01:11:52,355
I was serious.

941
01:11:53,197 --> 01:11:55,325
Wasn't afraid of anything.

942
01:11:56,466 --> 01:11:59,265
But she had something with Kenichiro.

943
01:12:00,470 --> 01:12:04,908
I think Takako loves Kenichiro.

944
01:12:07,411 --> 01:12:10,506
But Kenichiro loves Kaho.

945
01:12:11,548 --> 01:12:15,508
Kaho loves me and not interested
in Kenichiro.

946
01:12:16,920 --> 01:12:19,219
That's why we lasted.

947
01:12:19,857 --> 01:12:21,985
I avoided change.

948
01:12:22,626 --> 01:12:24,618
But I regret it now.

949
01:12:25,829 --> 01:12:27,798
Want to change it tonight.

950
01:12:28,732 --> 01:12:31,292
Is that what you wanted to say?

951
01:12:31,401 --> 01:12:33,063
Basically, yes.

952
01:12:33,170 --> 01:12:34,729
I'll forget soon.

953
01:12:36,540 --> 01:12:38,065
That's the rule.

954
01:12:38,175 --> 01:12:40,542
So, you join this game?

955
01:12:41,511 --> 01:12:42,911
Ask a question.

956
01:12:43,647 --> 01:12:45,548
Do you like Kenichiro?

957
01:12:48,418 --> 01:12:49,579
I don't.

958
01:12:49,686 --> 01:12:50,551
Why?

959
01:12:51,188 --> 01:12:52,212
I just answer. right?

960
01:12:52,322 --> 01:12:53,415
Sure

961
01:12:54,057 --> 01:12:57,858
But you're not honest.
so let me ask you again.

962
01:12:58,562 --> 01:13:00,793
What a vague rule...

963
01:13:01,164 --> 01:13:04,328
I don't think you hate him.

964
01:13:05,135 --> 01:13:06,728
Why don't you like him?

965
01:13:08,038 --> 01:13:09,233
So irresponsible.

966
01:13:09,339 --> 01:13:10,932
Is he?

967
01:13:12,542 --> 01:13:14,477
He sleeps without love.

968
01:13:15,045 --> 01:13:19,449
And that definitely hurts her.

969
01:13:19,549 --> 01:13:21,814
That's a tough question.

970
01:13:22,219 --> 01:13:25,883
Like you know. Kenichiro is really gentle.

971
01:13:26,323 --> 01:13:31,125
So, I think Takako wanted Kenichiro.

972
01:13:31,762 --> 01:13:32,855
Am I right?

973
01:13:33,897 --> 01:13:35,889
I don't need to answer.

974
01:13:35,999 --> 01:13:36,967
I see now.

975
01:13:37,067 --> 01:13:38,000
What?

976
01:13:38,101 --> 01:13:41,094
I don't like Kenichiro

977
01:13:42,472 --> 01:13:45,670
when he's with you. He spoils you.

978
01:13:46,777 --> 01:13:49,144
He should have stolen Kaho.

979
01:13:49,646 --> 01:13:51,672
That's the problem.

980
01:13:52,149 --> 01:13:53,845
So, you don't like me.

981
01:13:54,484 --> 01:13:56,385
I guess so.

982
01:13:58,055 --> 01:14:01,617
What don't you like about me?

983
01:14:01,892 --> 01:14:03,417
Can I ask?

984
01:14:03,527 --> 01:14:06,292
I don't like everything about you.

985
01:14:07,364 --> 01:14:09,458
Why are we even friends?

986
01:14:12,202 --> 01:14:15,536
You're immoral and insincere.

987
01:14:16,473 --> 01:14:18,738
I don't like your face.

988
01:14:19,509 --> 01:14:23,571
You think you're better than others.

989
01:14:23,680 --> 01:14:24,477
I don't.

990
01:14:24,581 --> 01:14:26,243
Hey.

991
01:14:26,984 --> 01:14:27,952
Be honest!

992
01:14:28,719 --> 01:14:32,349
Do you think you're better than others?

993
01:14:32,656 --> 01:14:34,215
You can answer this.

994
01:14:35,225 --> 01:14:39,094
You think you're smart? Huh?

995
01:14:39,863 --> 01:14:41,388
Let me answer.

996
01:14:42,299 --> 01:14:47,636
I do think I'm smart.
Sometimes others look stupid.

997
01:14:47,804 --> 01:14:50,569
But I know that's not true.

998
01:14:51,274 --> 01:14:55,211
People have something
that they're good at.

999
01:14:55,679 --> 01:14:58,547
You know better about factory line.

1000
01:14:59,583 --> 01:15:01,313
You're not fair.

1001
01:15:02,486 --> 01:15:04,785
I don't like that either.

1002
01:15:05,188 --> 01:15:11,150
You pretend to know your weakness,
and place yourself in safety zone.

1003
01:15:11,395 --> 01:15:14,263
You're not honest.

1004
01:15:14,364 --> 01:15:17,391
What do you think about me?

1005
01:15:17,501 --> 01:15:18,298
Your question is...

1006
01:15:18,402 --> 01:15:22,305
It's not over. You're not being honest.

1007
01:15:22,406 --> 01:15:23,567
Answer my question.

1008
01:15:23,673 --> 01:15:26,643
Like I said. You're stupid.

1009
01:15:26,777 --> 01:15:32,114
All you say makes me vomit.
You live in your small world.

1010
01:15:32,249 --> 01:15:36,243
The world you believe is all fake.

1011
01:15:37,220 --> 01:15:40,918
You love your wife?
Then why are you here?

1012
01:15:41,024 --> 01:15:44,825
You don't even know what you don't know.

1013
01:15:45,228 --> 01:15:48,892
But, I like you.

1014
01:15:49,499 --> 01:15:52,401
You can do what I can't do.

1015
01:15:52,536 --> 01:15:54,971
I sometimes wish I were you.

1016
01:15:55,072 --> 01:15:59,442
I said all this,
so that you can understand me.

1017
01:15:59,543 --> 01:16:01,944
I'm happy cause I'm stupid?

1018
01:16:02,045 --> 01:16:05,209
Who do you think you are!

1019
01:16:05,315 --> 01:16:09,150
You did and still do look happy.

1020
01:16:09,419 --> 01:16:11,911
But you'll eventually see.

1021
01:16:12,022 --> 01:16:16,187
You're not who you think you are.

1022
01:16:16,293 --> 01:16:19,320
Fine, but let me say this.

1023
01:16:19,729 --> 01:16:25,691
I don't know about academics,
but you can't live outside that world.

1024
01:16:26,203 --> 01:16:31,141
All you say is full of shit.
You are the one who's empty!

1025
01:16:39,649 --> 01:16:43,313
I've said my honest feelings. Can I ask?

1026
01:16:43,420 --> 01:16:44,945
We're still doing this?

1027
01:16:45,222 --> 01:16:48,420
This is just swearing. Let's stop.

1028
01:16:48,525 --> 01:16:49,356
No.

1029
01:16:50,327 --> 01:16:51,818
What do you think of me?

1030
01:16:53,463 --> 01:16:54,795
I've said it.

1031
01:17:03,707 --> 01:17:06,700
What if nobody answered?

1032
01:17:09,246 --> 01:17:14,207
If nobody answered less than a minute,
two people will answer.

1033
01:17:14,484 --> 01:17:16,953
Now it's more like a game.

1034
01:17:19,422 --> 01:17:20,981
Well, I think...

1035
01:17:21,391 --> 01:17:23,417
You are, um...

1036
01:17:26,096 --> 01:17:27,997
...a sad person.

1037
01:17:30,400 --> 01:17:33,063
You pretend to be something.

1038
01:17:33,170 --> 01:17:35,935
You want to look shallow.

1039
01:17:36,907 --> 01:17:41,777
You look painful to everyone,
and you know that too.

1040
01:17:42,546 --> 01:17:45,380
Why don't you be yourself?

1041
01:17:45,482 --> 01:17:49,544
You are a timid person.
Live a life like that.

1042
01:17:49,653 --> 01:17:51,246
Well, then why...

1043
01:17:51,888 --> 01:17:54,687
...did you sleep with me?

1044
01:17:55,492 --> 01:17:57,461
Cause you looked pitiful.

1045
01:17:57,561 --> 01:18:00,429
I'm not a volunteer.

1046
01:18:00,964 --> 01:18:02,057
Well...

1047
01:18:02,999 --> 01:18:05,969
...you do have some attractive parts.

1048
01:18:07,137 --> 01:18:08,503
What's so funny?

1049
01:18:09,739 --> 01:18:14,768
I mean. I like men.
It's nice to be asked out.

1050
01:18:15,212 --> 01:18:19,616
If I don't hate that person,
I can go beyond that.

1051
01:18:24,454 --> 01:18:28,221
But, now you don't want to do it with me.

1052
01:18:28,725 --> 01:18:30,819
I'm just tired.

1053
01:18:32,929 --> 01:18:36,297
I really don't like tiring stuff.

1054
01:18:36,733 --> 01:18:39,202
Today is the worst.

1055
01:18:39,803 --> 01:18:41,829
She is honest.

1056
01:18:42,872 --> 01:18:43,601
Okay.

1057
01:18:45,075 --> 01:18:48,045
But you asked Kenichiro. right?

1058
01:18:48,678 --> 01:18:51,375
That's a different story.

1059
01:18:51,781 --> 01:18:53,750
It's my turn to ask.

1060
01:18:56,186 --> 01:18:57,677
Come on.

1061
01:18:58,455 --> 01:19:00,924
A question...

1062
01:19:04,728 --> 01:19:08,859
What's the most embarrassing moment
of your life?

1063
01:19:08,965 --> 01:19:12,402
Confessing and being honest is different.

1064
01:19:12,502 --> 01:19:15,370
Fine, let me answer this.

1065
01:19:17,173 --> 01:19:21,201
I was a freshman in high school.

1066
01:19:22,012 --> 01:19:25,710
It happened when I got
my first girl friend.

1067
01:19:27,150 --> 01:19:28,550
We became intimate.

1068
01:19:35,325 --> 01:19:36,588
I know it's late.

1069
01:19:38,194 --> 01:19:39,924
Thought you'd be awake.

1070
01:19:44,901 --> 01:19:48,668
Tomoya is at another girl's place.
Won't come home.

1071
01:19:53,510 --> 01:19:54,808
Want to come out?

1072
01:19:55,078 --> 01:19:57,912
It's cold, but if you wore a coat.

1073
01:20:01,351 --> 01:20:04,219
Let me get my coat.

1074
01:20:26,376 --> 01:20:28,709
Funny. right?

1075
01:20:39,789 --> 01:20:41,155
No way.

1076
01:20:41,624 --> 01:20:43,786
Didn't she get mad?

1077
01:20:43,893 --> 01:20:46,055
Of course. she did.

1078
01:20:46,863 --> 01:20:49,890
It was her first, too.

1079
01:20:50,367 --> 01:20:52,768
That's hard for both.

1080
01:21:06,082 --> 01:21:07,675
Tell me about Hana.

1081
01:21:07,851 --> 01:21:09,752
I can't answer that.

1082
01:21:09,853 --> 01:21:11,879
What you like about her?

1083
01:21:12,756 --> 01:21:13,985
Don't know.

1084
01:21:14,090 --> 01:21:15,080
Her face?

1085
01:21:15,492 --> 01:21:16,187
No.

1086
01:21:16,292 --> 01:21:17,555
Personality?

1087
01:21:18,461 --> 01:21:21,056
Like you said. it was the timing.

1088
01:21:21,164 --> 01:21:23,998
Takeshi, ask a question again.

1089
01:21:29,606 --> 01:21:32,633
Have you ever loved a person?

1090
01:21:35,245 --> 01:21:36,543
Have you?

1091
01:21:36,646 --> 01:21:38,444
Answer the question first.

1092
01:21:38,548 --> 01:21:41,108
I haven't thought about it.

1093
01:21:42,218 --> 01:21:47,213
My wife means a lot to me.
I know that for sure.

1094
01:21:49,692 --> 01:21:51,593
I don't think I have.

1095
01:21:53,196 --> 01:21:55,222
I'm not sure.

1096
01:21:56,299 --> 01:22:00,236
I don't hate anyone.
I don't even hate Tomoya.

1097
01:22:01,204 --> 01:22:05,266
I just lack that ability.

1098
01:22:06,075 --> 01:22:10,877
It's like the ability to run
or the ability to catch.

1099
01:22:11,481 --> 01:22:12,779
I just don't care.

1100
01:22:13,516 --> 01:22:15,610
Want to love seriously?

1101
01:22:17,320 --> 01:22:19,482
It's my turn to ask.

1102
01:22:20,757 --> 01:22:22,953
I answered his question.

1103
01:22:23,059 --> 01:22:27,497
Not yet.
You weren't honest about Kenichiro.

1104
01:22:27,697 --> 01:22:30,030
Why do you ask that?

1105
01:22:30,133 --> 01:22:30,896
Well...

1106
01:22:31,668 --> 01:22:34,934
...sex isn't always fun.

1107
01:22:35,071 --> 01:22:38,769
It's sometimes a hassle. but you do it.

1108
01:22:39,108 --> 01:22:42,340
That's why I think you love Kenichiro.

1109
01:22:43,012 --> 01:22:46,847
You just don't want to realize that.

1110
01:22:47,250 --> 01:22:48,809
What do you mean?

1111
01:22:48,918 --> 01:22:51,854
Takako just doesn't know how to love.

1112
01:22:53,857 --> 01:22:56,850
And you're trying to teach me how?

1113
01:22:56,960 --> 01:23:00,829
I don't know either.
That's why we are alike.

1114
01:23:01,698 --> 01:23:06,227
I thought Kenichiro and I were similar.

1115
01:23:08,104 --> 01:23:13,566
We don't ask much from the other.
I felt relaxed with him.

1116
01:23:14,644 --> 01:23:20,379
I don't know if I liked him.
but I liked being around him.

1117
01:23:23,853 --> 01:23:25,014
Good enough?

1118
01:23:28,892 --> 01:23:30,417
Okay. You can ask.

1119
01:23:41,371 --> 01:23:46,776
What don't you like about your partner?

1120
01:23:48,244 --> 01:23:50,577
Why look for someone else?

1121
01:23:55,084 --> 01:23:55,915
No answer?

1122
01:23:57,887 --> 01:23:59,981
Then both have to answer.

1123
01:24:00,857 --> 01:24:03,452
I'm not unhappy with Kaho.

1124
01:24:04,360 --> 01:24:06,329
You have to be honest.

1125
01:24:06,429 --> 01:24:09,092
I don't have to say bad things.

1126
01:24:09,766 --> 01:24:12,099
You need to answer my question.

1127
01:24:15,705 --> 01:24:18,004
Small things.

1128
01:24:18,341 --> 01:24:22,403
She sometimes can't understand my feeling.

1129
01:24:22,745 --> 01:24:25,408
Of course. it's vice versa.

1130
01:24:26,049 --> 01:24:28,814
It happens to anyone.

1131
01:24:29,285 --> 01:24:32,813
And that's why it was never a big issue.

1132
01:24:34,190 --> 01:24:36,125
You think I'm different?

1133
01:24:36,259 --> 01:24:39,286
No. I think we're more different.

1134
01:24:39,529 --> 01:24:40,792
See, that's it.

1135
01:24:40,997 --> 01:24:46,493
It's better to communicate knowing
we are very different.

1136
01:24:50,206 --> 01:24:53,074
Kaho has nothing to do with this.

1137
01:24:54,577 --> 01:24:56,273
I'm simply attracted to you.

1138
01:24:58,414 --> 01:24:59,814
Thank you.

1139
01:25:00,850 --> 01:25:03,012
But I didn't ask that much.

1140
01:25:05,588 --> 01:25:07,352
Any questions?

1141
01:25:07,890 --> 01:25:09,654
That's real insensitive.

1142
01:25:10,627 --> 01:25:11,822
Me?

1143
01:25:12,095 --> 01:25:16,533
Sure this guy is like shit
but he is serious.

1144
01:25:16,766 --> 01:25:23,036
This game is just his excuse to get to
know you and each other more.

1145
01:25:23,139 --> 01:25:24,767
Give him a chance.

1146
01:25:24,874 --> 01:25:25,603
Takeshi

1147
01:25:25,708 --> 01:25:28,576
I'm just respecting this game.

1148
01:25:29,312 --> 01:25:30,610
Takeshi, it's fine.

1149
01:25:33,816 --> 01:25:35,307
Let me ask again.

1150
01:25:36,686 --> 01:25:38,120
Do you want true love?

1151
01:25:38,221 --> 01:25:40,690
It's not something to ask for.

1152
01:25:41,357 --> 01:25:45,795
Maybe when it happens,
but I don't know where to start.

1153
01:25:45,895 --> 01:25:46,954
So you're waiting.

1154
01:25:47,063 --> 01:25:50,761
I'm not waiting.
If it happens, it happens.

1155
01:25:51,267 --> 01:25:52,963
I'm not changing myself.

1156
01:25:53,069 --> 01:25:55,595
Nothing happens without desire.

1157
01:25:55,705 --> 01:25:56,695
I don't want change.

1158
01:25:56,806 --> 01:25:58,069
Fine, never mind.

1159
01:25:59,809 --> 01:26:01,869
I'm leaving. This is stupid.

1160
01:26:01,978 --> 01:26:03,105
What about Hana?

1161
01:26:03,212 --> 01:26:05,044
Just get it on without me.

1162
01:26:05,081 --> 01:26:06,208
I don't want that.

1163
01:26:06,315 --> 01:26:12,414
If you really want this woman, you've got
to start by understanding her.

1164
01:26:12,655 --> 01:26:15,386
She's not who you think she is.

1165
01:26:15,692 --> 01:26:18,753
It's faster to just hit her.

1166
01:26:19,328 --> 01:26:20,455
What are you saying?

1167
01:26:21,431 --> 01:26:22,990
Why don't you try?

1168
01:26:23,800 --> 01:26:25,325
Something could change.

1169
01:26:25,435 --> 01:26:27,028
Hitting will do nothing.

1170
01:26:27,136 --> 01:26:29,935
No. you could change.

1171
01:26:44,721 --> 01:26:46,053
Stop it!

1172
01:26:49,292 --> 01:26:51,887
Hey, stop that!

1173
01:26:53,863 --> 01:26:55,263
Takeshi, stop!

1174
01:26:55,431 --> 01:26:58,333
Hey, stop.

1175
01:27:00,369 --> 01:27:02,338
Takeshi, what's going on?

1176
01:27:02,638 --> 01:27:03,230
Takeshi!

1177
01:27:05,074 --> 01:27:06,167
What do you want?

1178
01:27:06,776 --> 01:27:08,642
Hey, Takeshi!

1179
01:27:11,347 --> 01:27:12,576
Takeshi!

1180
01:27:15,485 --> 01:27:18,512
Smile, go ahead and laugh!

1181
01:27:19,355 --> 01:27:19,845
Laugh!

1182
01:27:33,402 --> 01:27:34,597
What are you doing?

1183
01:27:46,048 --> 01:27:47,414
Takeshi, stop!

1184
01:28:41,571 --> 01:28:45,736
Has something ever happened to you that
was a miracle?

1185
01:28:46,742 --> 01:28:48,404
A miracle.

1186
01:28:49,478 --> 01:28:52,846
Not really. Has to be a miracle. right?

1187
01:28:52,949 --> 01:28:54,008
Yes.

1188
01:28:54,283 --> 01:28:57,879
Miracles are miracles. Do you have one?

1189
01:28:58,855 --> 01:29:02,383
My grandpa came back to life.

1190
01:29:02,558 --> 01:29:03,890
Really.

1191
01:29:04,894 --> 01:29:07,090
When I was about 5 years old.

1192
01:29:07,530 --> 01:29:12,400
He had died from a stroke.
and at his funeral I kept thinking...

1193
01:29:13,970 --> 01:29:16,667
...something just smells terrible.

1194
01:29:16,873 --> 01:29:20,105
And families sit close to the coffin.

1195
01:29:20,209 --> 01:29:21,609
Yeah they do.

1196
01:29:23,279 --> 01:29:24,975
You figure it out?

1197
01:29:26,682 --> 01:29:30,119
I think everyone smelt it.

1198
01:29:30,219 --> 01:29:35,624
Next to my father whose arms
were around me because I won't sit still...

1199
01:29:35,725 --> 01:29:37,421
...holding me down.

1200
01:29:37,960 --> 01:29:39,428
Sounds unlike you.

1201
01:29:39,862 --> 01:29:44,061
I kept on crying. "It's smelly, smelly!"

1202
01:29:45,635 --> 01:29:51,199
Then obviously people started reacting
because they all think it smells.

1203
01:29:51,807 --> 01:29:56,609
They took me to the bathroom thinking
it was me.

1204
01:29:56,946 --> 01:30:00,815
I'm the one crying. couldn't have been me.

1205
01:30:00,917 --> 01:30:02,249
That's true.

1206
01:30:03,119 --> 01:30:04,178
And then...

1207
01:30:04,820 --> 01:30:09,383
...when I came back he was taken out from
the coffin

1208
01:30:10,159 --> 01:30:13,288
...with a dirty bum.

1209
01:30:14,430 --> 01:30:17,525
Crowd just starts, "He's back to life!"

1210
01:30:18,534 --> 01:30:20,093
Kind of gross...

1211
01:30:20,703 --> 01:30:23,172
Maybe dirty for a miracle?

1212
01:30:24,206 --> 01:30:26,437
But I'm sure it happens.

1213
01:30:26,542 --> 01:30:31,571
I think so. but it was a real miracle
for the family.

1214
01:30:32,114 --> 01:30:34,140
Thanks to you.

1215
01:30:34,250 --> 01:30:36,515
They complimented me for a while.

1216
01:30:37,153 --> 01:30:39,247
It's like "The Emperor's New Clothes."

1217
01:30:40,790 --> 01:30:44,420
If I didn't cry out,
he could've been cremated.

1218
01:30:45,328 --> 01:30:49,925
But he never gained back
his consciousness...

1219
01:30:50,232 --> 01:30:53,259
...passed away after 3 years in bed.

1220
01:30:54,770 --> 01:30:57,535
My mom was also a teacher but...

1221
01:30:58,140 --> 01:31:01,577
...had to quit to take care of him.

1222
01:31:02,645 --> 01:31:07,310
About 6 months after his death, my parents
got a divorce.

1223
01:31:09,952 --> 01:31:11,887
I guess you just never know.

1224
01:31:13,522 --> 01:31:16,321
Though I got compliments, I didn't know.

1225
01:31:18,194 --> 01:31:24,532
If I'd kept quiet, grandpa would've died
but my family could have stayed happy...

1226
01:31:26,736 --> 01:31:29,831
Not your fault. It really smelled, right?

1227
01:31:31,040 --> 01:31:31,973
Yeah.

1228
01:31:32,074 --> 01:31:33,872
See, not your fault.

1229
01:31:36,278 --> 01:31:39,680
I thought about it again in junior high.

1230
01:31:40,549 --> 01:31:44,350
That it really was a miracle.

1231
01:31:46,389 --> 01:31:51,020
Or, not just the coming back to life,
but all of it.

1232
01:31:52,161 --> 01:31:56,428
My parents' divorce and my grandpa
dying twice.

1233
01:32:00,669 --> 01:32:04,231
Even if something didn't happen
in the world...

1234
01:32:04,640 --> 01:32:10,443
...everything is part of the miracle,
and if a miracle happened...

1235
01:32:11,213 --> 01:32:15,617
...I could prove that this world itself
is a miracle.

1236
01:32:18,621 --> 01:32:21,557
Then. everything just became clear.

1237
01:32:22,758 --> 01:32:27,958
As if I traveled back to the beginning
of the universe.

1238
01:32:31,400 --> 01:32:35,132
After that. I was okay with anything.

1239
01:32:37,873 --> 01:32:39,637
...That's not true.

1240
01:32:40,176 --> 01:32:43,146
And your words don't mean anything.

1241
01:32:43,446 --> 01:32:48,680
If everything is a miracle, then nothing
is a miracle. Meaningless.

1242
01:32:48,784 --> 01:32:51,253
I'm always like that.

1243
01:32:52,088 --> 01:32:56,116
I think so much. but it's all meaningless.

1244
01:32:57,159 --> 01:33:01,426
You should really sort out,
what's good and what's bad.

1245
01:33:01,997 --> 01:33:06,901
Saying all is a miracle is the same as
giving up thinking.

1246
01:33:07,002 --> 01:33:08,368
Yes, but...

1247
01:33:09,205 --> 01:33:11,765
...when I think everything is a miracle...

1248
01:33:12,274 --> 01:33:17,372
I realized I should just take care of what
is meaningful to me.

1249
01:33:18,180 --> 01:33:22,880
Even if it's all meaningful, you can't
choose it all.

1250
01:33:23,819 --> 01:33:29,190
I can only take care of things that
is valuable to me.

1251
01:33:33,462 --> 01:33:36,990
Why don't you wake up...to face reality?

1252
01:33:37,233 --> 01:33:41,170
It's clear that you're just hiding
from negatives.

1253
01:33:41,270 --> 01:33:46,732
Tomoya doesn't love you. probably won't.
and will keep hurting you.

1254
01:33:47,309 --> 01:33:49,471
Everyone but you knows this.

1255
01:33:49,578 --> 01:33:53,106
If I don't know, then it's okay, right?

1256
01:33:54,116 --> 01:33:55,778
He's with another woman right now.

1257
01:33:55,885 --> 01:33:57,581
He'll be back in morning.

1258
01:33:57,686 --> 01:34:02,124
And that's the problem.
It's simple if he just left you.

1259
01:34:02,224 --> 01:34:07,686
He could ruin your life.
Choosing him means hurting your future.

1260
01:34:12,401 --> 01:34:13,528
You know...

1261
01:34:16,005 --> 01:34:18,565
...I really do like you.

1262
01:34:20,543 --> 01:34:22,307
Tomoya probably does, too.

1263
01:34:23,812 --> 01:34:24,745
So...

1264
01:34:25,714 --> 01:34:30,675
...it would make me so happy if you would
just celebrate us.

1265
01:34:42,598 --> 01:34:45,659
I know I like you so much more.

1266
01:34:45,868 --> 01:34:48,895
Thanks for being so considerate.

1267
01:34:49,305 --> 01:34:51,035
Why can't it be me?

1268
01:34:51,140 --> 01:34:53,268
It's not that it can't be.

1269
01:34:53,976 --> 01:34:55,706
You're being mean.

1270
01:35:05,955 --> 01:35:09,983
Give me 3 minutes to tell you
what I like about you.

1271
01:35:18,167 --> 01:35:19,658
Your pretty eyes.

1272
01:35:22,671 --> 01:35:24,640
Cute facial hair on forehead.

1273
01:35:28,310 --> 01:35:30,040
You have a pretty chin.

1274
01:35:31,113 --> 01:35:33,446
Your ears...ears are...

1275
01:35:34,516 --> 01:35:36,280
...sticking out cute.

1276
01:35:37,253 --> 01:35:38,778
Kind of like a monkey.

1277
01:35:46,762 --> 01:35:51,063
I've always loved your pretty long fingers
and nails.

1278
01:35:59,975 --> 01:36:01,603
Beautiful hair.

1279
01:36:04,013 --> 01:36:07,211
It's hidden now, but your neck is nice.

1280
01:36:16,125 --> 01:36:17,753
You're a kind lady.

1281
01:36:29,471 --> 01:36:30,905
You smell nice.

1282
01:36:32,241 --> 01:36:33,641
Didn't know that.

1283
01:36:49,124 --> 01:36:51,116
You have a weird nose.

1284
01:36:52,594 --> 01:36:53,721
Different.

1285
01:36:55,364 --> 01:36:57,196
But I really love that.

1286
01:36:58,600 --> 01:37:00,330
Small lips, but...

1287
01:37:02,371 --> 01:37:04,772
...gets real wide when you smile.

1288
01:37:13,949 --> 01:37:15,645
Your cheek is cold.

1289
01:37:45,848 --> 01:37:50,149
I've never been told pretty and cute this
much before...

1290
01:37:52,388 --> 01:37:54,084
That's sad...

1291
01:38:28,724 --> 01:38:30,158
Just wait here.

1292
01:38:41,870 --> 01:38:45,466
Hey!! It's morning!!

1293
01:38:45,874 --> 01:38:48,400
Time to get up!!

1294
01:39:17,639 --> 01:39:18,698
I'm sorry.

1295
01:39:24,112 --> 01:39:26,547
I wish I could've chosen you.

1296
01:39:28,617 --> 01:39:30,245
I tried...

1297
01:39:31,086 --> 01:39:32,315
...but I just can't.

1298
01:42:02,804 --> 01:42:04,136
I'm home.

1299
01:42:04,539 --> 01:42:05,666
Hey.

1300
01:42:06,642 --> 01:42:09,305
I was just with Kenichiro.

1301
01:42:09,544 --> 01:42:10,409
Yeah.

1302
01:42:11,413 --> 01:42:12,847
You knew?

1303
01:42:13,649 --> 01:42:14,912
Kind of guessed.

1304
01:42:17,019 --> 01:42:18,817
He told me he liked me.

1305
01:42:19,655 --> 01:42:20,645
Yeah.

1306
01:42:26,294 --> 01:42:27,728
We kissed.

1307
01:42:31,667 --> 01:42:33,226
But I ran away.

1308
01:42:35,270 --> 01:42:36,533
That was mean.

1309
01:42:39,174 --> 01:42:40,335
I was?

1310
01:42:41,443 --> 01:42:42,467
Yes.

1311
01:42:47,549 --> 01:42:51,850
Yeah. I guess that was very mean.

1312
01:42:55,157 --> 01:42:58,616
But I have something meaner to say to you.

1313
01:43:01,863 --> 01:43:02,796
I like someone else.

1314
01:43:09,304 --> 01:43:11,170
...You want to break up?

1315
01:43:13,475 --> 01:43:14,465
Yes.

1316
01:43:30,392 --> 01:43:33,988
Does that person like you?

1317
01:43:34,730 --> 01:43:35,823
No.

1318
01:43:37,032 --> 01:43:39,797
She thinks nothing of me.

1319
01:43:40,569 --> 01:43:42,800
I learned that clearly today.

1320
01:43:43,705 --> 01:43:45,799
I was just at her house.

1321
01:43:47,175 --> 01:43:49,770
But you still want to break up with me?

1322
01:43:50,212 --> 01:43:52,374
I can't be with you anymore...

1323
01:43:52,581 --> 01:43:56,177
...because I like this person. I'm sorry.

1324
01:43:57,786 --> 01:43:59,550
Even if I don't mind?

1325
01:43:59,654 --> 01:44:03,557
Don't say that. You're too good for that.

1326
01:44:06,094 --> 01:44:08,256
Don't make me an excuse.

1327
01:44:12,634 --> 01:44:14,330
I don't love you anymore.

1328
01:44:16,304 --> 01:44:17,499
Not one bit?

1329
01:44:18,406 --> 01:44:21,604
It's not about the amount of love.

1330
01:44:22,377 --> 01:44:25,211
I didn't know that until yesterday.

1331
01:44:25,814 --> 01:44:28,443
And so I thought I could be with you.

1332
01:44:29,151 --> 01:44:30,881
But it doesn't work like that.

1333
01:44:35,857 --> 01:44:39,555
What's different about me compared to her?

1334
01:44:42,063 --> 01:44:43,793
I didn't compare you.

1335
01:44:45,500 --> 01:44:47,992
I just want to be with her right now.

1336
01:44:49,471 --> 01:44:51,667
For everything that I've got now.

1337
01:45:16,631 --> 01:45:17,792
Sorry.

1338
01:45:24,206 --> 01:45:25,333
I'm so sorry.

1339
01:45:28,443 --> 01:45:29,638
Don't be.

1340
01:45:34,049 --> 01:45:35,244
I'm happy.

1341
01:45:38,887 --> 01:45:41,550
Was going to tell you when I got home.

1342
01:45:45,026 --> 01:45:47,689
To really fall in love with me.

1343
01:45:50,365 --> 01:45:54,894
Until now. I never thought
it really mattered because...

1344
01:45:56,471 --> 01:46:00,408
...I was scared you would leave me
if I said it.

1345
01:46:04,279 --> 01:46:05,975
But I was just worried.

1346
01:46:07,048 --> 01:46:10,780
That maybe I was ruining your life.

1347
01:46:13,555 --> 01:46:14,853
Because you're kind.

1348
01:46:14,956 --> 01:46:16,356
What are you saying?

1349
01:46:26,635 --> 01:46:30,367
Life with no one to love is meaningless,
right?

1350
01:46:32,440 --> 01:46:36,309
I need you, Tomoya. to fall in love
with me but...

1351
01:46:37,178 --> 01:46:38,510
...couldn't do it.

1352
01:46:43,952 --> 01:46:45,011
But...

1353
01:46:46,154 --> 01:46:48,953
...I came home thinking that's wrong.

1354
01:46:51,559 --> 01:46:54,324
...I wanted to make you change.

1355
01:46:57,132 --> 01:47:00,261
I wanted to be responsible for your life.

1356
01:47:07,342 --> 01:47:08,742
But...

1357
01:47:10,078 --> 01:47:12,570
...there's no need for that now.

1358
01:47:17,018 --> 01:47:21,388
To leave me for someone you could love
on your own...

1359
01:47:21,990 --> 01:47:23,959
...is really the best way.

1360
01:47:26,428 --> 01:47:28,192
So I'm happy for you.

1361
01:47:31,900 --> 01:47:35,735
Though it's very sad that I couldn't make
you change.

1362
01:47:44,846 --> 01:47:45,973
Hey.

1363
01:47:48,383 --> 01:47:51,785
Did you ever...like me?

1364
01:47:53,121 --> 01:47:54,589
I did like you.

1365
01:47:54,956 --> 01:47:56,390
I always have.

1366
01:47:57,625 --> 01:47:59,423
What did you like about me?

1367
01:48:02,630 --> 01:48:03,928
...Your pretty eyes.

1368
01:48:05,166 --> 01:48:06,896
You have a pretty chin.

1369
01:48:08,636 --> 01:48:11,435
Weird ears and nose, but so cute.

1370
01:48:12,807 --> 01:48:15,606
Beautiful neck and pretty voice.

1371
01:48:15,944 --> 01:48:17,572
Your lips are cute.

1372
01:48:18,980 --> 01:48:21,074
I've always loved your fingers.

1373
01:48:25,353 --> 01:48:27,379
I'm not just saying this.

1374
01:48:29,224 --> 01:48:30,522
Thank you.

1375
01:48:35,230 --> 01:48:38,792
Did you ever have fun with me?

1376
01:48:39,634 --> 01:48:41,569
Most worried about that.

1377
01:48:42,637 --> 01:48:44,071
It was fun.

1378
01:48:45,073 --> 01:48:47,304
What was the most fun?

1379
01:48:49,411 --> 01:48:50,970
There's a lot of things...

1380
01:48:56,284 --> 01:48:58,116
Remember our trip to Mexico?

1381
01:49:01,256 --> 01:49:02,315
Yes.

1382
01:49:02,724 --> 01:49:05,284
Rode bicycles through Mexico City.

1383
01:49:05,794 --> 01:49:10,061
You scared me because you kept on riding
facing backwards.

1384
01:49:10,865 --> 01:49:13,096
Was worried you were right behind me.

1385
01:49:13,201 --> 01:49:15,932
You could have just slowed down.

1386
01:49:16,571 --> 01:49:17,834
That's true.

1387
01:49:25,213 --> 01:49:29,082
Remember the water of Fountain of Truth?

1388
01:49:34,155 --> 01:49:36,181
Really didn't work.

1389
01:49:39,427 --> 01:49:41,658
Maybe it's working now.

1390
01:49:45,533 --> 01:49:46,762
...I have to go.

1391
01:49:49,003 --> 01:49:50,198
Where?

1392
01:49:51,272 --> 01:49:54,606
I left everything I need for class
at her house.

1393
01:49:54,976 --> 01:49:56,535
Have to go get it.

1394
01:49:57,545 --> 01:49:58,774
I see.

1395
01:49:59,314 --> 01:50:03,217
I will come get my stuff
during winter holidays.

1396
01:50:03,785 --> 01:50:04,912
Okay.

1397
01:50:10,058 --> 01:50:11,583
Thanks for everything.

1398
01:50:14,562 --> 01:50:17,930
No. thank you for everything.

1399
01:50:20,435 --> 01:50:21,733
Don't force yourself.

1400
01:50:22,737 --> 01:50:23,898
I'm fine.

1401
01:50:28,877 --> 01:50:30,106
Good bye.

1402
01:50:30,945 --> 01:50:32,277
Bye.

1403
01:51:15,823 --> 01:51:17,155
Please forgive me.

1404
01:51:24,732 --> 01:51:26,633
Give me one more chance.

1405
01:51:27,902 --> 01:51:29,097
Please.
