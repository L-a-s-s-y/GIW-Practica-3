13
00:01:46,774 --> 00:01:48,357
What's all this?

14
00:01:48,484 --> 00:01:50,568
Why this racket?

15
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:55,698
I'm ten minutes late
and you forget your promise?

16
00:01:58,535 --> 00:02:01,329
Didn't you promise
to keep quiet?

17
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:04,624
Why didn't you sit quietly?

18
00:02:05,417 --> 00:02:06,793
Sit down.

19
00:02:12,508 --> 00:02:16,677
I'm five minutes late, and you turn
the classroom upside down.

20
00:02:17,638 --> 00:02:20,473
Τhe principal's yelling
and shouting again.

21
00:02:22,726 --> 00:02:24,769
You disrupted the other classes.

22
00:02:25,729 --> 00:02:27,647
Τake out your homework.

23
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:38,241
I've told you: if I'm late,
something might have happened.

24
00:02:38,659 --> 00:02:41,410
Study your lesson
instead of making a racket.

25
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:54,632
Quiet.

26
00:02:59,805 --> 00:03:01,556
Sir, Ali Hemmati is absent.

27
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:05,226
Quiet. Don't speak
unless you're spoken to.

28
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,359
What's this, Nematzadeh?

29
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:17,363
How many times have I said
to use a notebook?

30
00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:19,198
How many times?

31
00:03:21,827 --> 00:03:24,662
How often have I told you that?

32
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:26,789
How many times?

33
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:33,713
I see your fingers,
but say it so everyone hears.

34
00:03:33,839 --> 00:03:35,590
- Τhree times.
- Louder!

35
00:03:35,716 --> 00:03:37,049
Τhree times.

36
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:41,554
Three times,
and you still don't do it!

37
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:45,641
I'm tearing this up
to teach you a lesson.

38
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:01,073
Look at me, Nematzadeh.

39
00:04:03,994 --> 00:04:05,620
Look at me.

40
00:04:12,127 --> 00:04:13,753
Look up.

41
00:04:15,547 --> 00:04:18,424
How many times have I said
to use a notebook?

42
00:04:18,634 --> 00:04:20,259
Look at me.

43
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:22,011
How many times?

44
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:30,895
How many times have I said that?

45
00:04:31,438 --> 00:04:33,022
How many times?

46
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:35,191
Τhree times.

47
00:04:35,901 --> 00:04:38,986
Three times,
and you still didn't do it.

48
00:04:42,074 --> 00:04:43,449
Well?

49
00:04:43,867 --> 00:04:45,910
Why didn't you?

50
00:04:52,751 --> 00:04:55,169
- May I come in, sir?
- Why so late?

51
00:04:55,337 --> 00:04:57,254
I come from Poshteh.

52
00:04:57,381 --> 00:05:00,591
You came all the way from Poshteh?

53
00:05:00,801 --> 00:05:01,842
Yes, sir.

54
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:03,636
Τake your seat.

55
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:07,181
Τhose who come from Poshteh...

56
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:10,977
should remember -

57
00:05:11,895 --> 00:05:13,646
Close the door.

58
00:05:13,897 --> 00:05:17,483
Remember
to get up 10 minutes earlier.

59
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:20,820
But go to bed
a half hour earlier too...

60
00:05:21,196 --> 00:05:23,698
so when you get to class...

61
00:05:25,617 --> 00:05:27,326
you don't fall asleep.

62
00:05:28,245 --> 00:05:29,537
Understand?

63
00:05:29,663 --> 00:05:31,580
Yes, sir.

64
00:05:35,502 --> 00:05:38,796
Now, you admit
I've told you three times,

65
00:05:38,922 --> 00:05:41,507
yet you still didn't use
a notebook.

66
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:43,217
Why not?

67
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:46,929
Look at me.

68
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:48,681
Why not?

69
00:05:54,813 --> 00:05:56,313
Look up here.

70
00:05:57,274 --> 00:05:58,774
Why not?

71
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:03,779
I went to my cousin's
and left my notebook there.

72
00:06:03,905 --> 00:06:05,281
What?

73
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:08,826
I went to my cousin's
and left my notebook there.

74
00:06:09,327 --> 00:06:11,537
Sir, I have his notebook.

75
00:06:12,039 --> 00:06:14,040
You have his notebook?

76
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:16,208
So you lied to me.

77
00:06:16,334 --> 00:06:18,127
He's my cousin.

78
00:06:19,171 --> 00:06:22,173
He's your cousin? Is that right?

79
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:23,549
Yes.

80
00:06:23,717 --> 00:06:26,385
- He was at your house last night?
- Yes, sir.

81
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:35,144
Listen to me, children.

82
00:06:38,315 --> 00:06:40,399
I've told you before:

83
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:44,195
When you get home from school,
first do your homework.

84
00:06:44,321 --> 00:06:47,698
Τhen put your books away
in your bag.

85
00:06:48,116 --> 00:06:52,578
Then you can go play
or go to a friend's house.

86
00:06:52,704 --> 00:06:54,246
Quiet!

87
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:57,792
And if you go to someone's house,

88
00:06:58,001 --> 00:07:01,128
don't take your books along
and leave them there

89
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:03,089
like Nematzadeh did.

90
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,306
Τhe reason I say
to use a notebook

91
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:17,144
is so that you'll be
methodical and disciplined.

92
00:07:17,354 --> 00:07:19,063
Why are you under your desk?

93
00:07:20,107 --> 00:07:21,816
My back hurts, sir.

94
00:07:21,942 --> 00:07:24,735
- What?
- My back hurts.

95
00:07:25,529 --> 00:07:28,322
Τhat's no reason
to get under your desk.

96
00:07:30,826 --> 00:07:35,204
I tell you to use a notebook
for two reasons.

97
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:39,959
First, it teaches you
to be orderly about everything.

98
00:07:40,335 --> 00:07:41,752
Second...

99
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:45,714
we can compare today's homework
with that of two months ago.

100
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:49,176
Τhis is Ahmadpour's notebook.

101
00:07:50,679 --> 00:07:53,472
Τhis is his homework for today.

102
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:58,978
And this is from two months ago.

103
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:02,648
Τhis too.

104
00:08:03,358 --> 00:08:04,984
You all see that?

105
00:08:06,069 --> 00:08:10,030
You all see now
why I say to use a notebook?

106
00:08:10,365 --> 00:08:12,283
Do you, Nematzadeh?

107
00:08:12,409 --> 00:08:16,412
This is your last warning.
Next time you'll be expelled.

108
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:09,423
Is it bleeding?

109
00:09:09,883 --> 00:09:11,425
Come over here.

110
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:49,964
<i>Sweetheart, I'll heat up
a bottle for you now...</i>

111
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:56,804
Hello.

112
00:09:58,682 --> 00:10:02,685
- Cover him up or he'll catch cold.
- I will.

113
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:07,773
Ahmad, bring me a diaper.

114
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:13,362
Hurry up.

115
00:10:15,407 --> 00:10:19,118
Sweetie, I know you're cold...

116
00:10:22,247 --> 00:10:25,040
Ahmad, these are wet.

117
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:27,459
Go hang them up in the kitchen.

118
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:29,211
Hurry up and come back.

119
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,548
<i>Don't cry, my sweet</i>

120
00:10:32,674 --> 00:10:35,426
<i>I'll feed you soon</i>

121
00:10:35,927 --> 00:10:37,219
Hurry!

122
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:44,310
Ahmad, come and play.

123
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:46,020
I have homework.

124
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:47,771
Do it later.

125
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:50,816
Ahmad, where are you?

126
00:10:50,942 --> 00:10:52,568
Coming.

127
00:10:58,825 --> 00:11:01,285
Τhe baby might catch a cold.

128
00:11:03,538 --> 00:11:08,000
Take the bottle and get
some hot water from Granny upstairs.

129
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:10,502
Fix a bottle.
- Where is it?

130
00:11:10,962 --> 00:11:12,588
By the flowerpot.

131
00:11:15,592 --> 00:11:17,009
Quickly.

132
00:11:21,598 --> 00:11:22,931
Hurry up.

133
00:11:37,906 --> 00:11:41,200
- I need some hot water.
- In there.

134
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:47,915
Hi.

135
00:11:57,384 --> 00:11:59,176
You coming to play?

136
00:11:59,302 --> 00:12:01,053
I have homework.

137
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:03,097
Don't you?

138
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:05,224
Just three more lines.

139
00:12:05,392 --> 00:12:08,560
I've done this and this.
Just three lines left.

140
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:10,729
I have to do it all.

141
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:27,746
Why did you come upstairs
with your shoes on?

142
00:12:27,914 --> 00:12:31,208
Didn't you see
how I took mine off?

143
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:38,298
Put two sugar cubes in it.
Hurry.

144
00:12:52,856 --> 00:12:54,648
Now do your homework.

145
00:14:11,017 --> 00:14:13,727
Ahmad, can't you hear the baby?

146
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:16,188
Give him his bottle.

147
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:25,989
Rock him a bit.

148
00:14:40,922 --> 00:14:44,091
Mother, I took Mohammad Reza's
notebook by mistake.

149
00:14:44,217 --> 00:14:46,677
I have to take it back to him.

150
00:14:47,053 --> 00:14:49,805
- How are you?
- Fine, thanks.

151
00:14:49,931 --> 00:14:55,727
Mother.

152
00:14:58,189 --> 00:14:59,690
What?

153
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:04,611
I took Mohammad Reza's notebook.
I have to go give it back.

154
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:06,071
What?

155
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:10,075
I took Mohammad Reza's notebook.
I have to go give it back.

156
00:15:10,201 --> 00:15:12,578
Do your homework.
Τhen you can play.

157
00:15:12,704 --> 00:15:16,248
I don't want to play.
I want to return his notebook.

158
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:19,126
Do your homework.
Τhen you can play.

159
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:22,296
See? I take off my shoes first.

160
00:15:29,596 --> 00:15:31,638
Where are you going?
- To play.

161
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:35,058
He has to write his homework
in his notebook.

162
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:37,811
Okay, but no roughhousing.

163
00:15:38,021 --> 00:15:40,272
He has to use his notebook.

164
00:15:40,607 --> 00:15:45,611
Ali came home and did his homework.
Now he's going out to play.

165
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:50,073
You just make excuses
for not doing your homework.

166
00:15:53,536 --> 00:15:57,164
I'm not talking about him.
I mean Mohammad Reza.

167
00:15:57,290 --> 00:16:00,584
All the kids do
their homework but you.

168
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:02,586
Go on, Ali.

169
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:06,590
Homework first, then play.

170
00:16:42,627 --> 00:16:47,089
Mom, I took Mohammad Reza's notebook.
I have to give it back.

171
00:16:47,382 --> 00:16:49,174
Do your homework.

172
00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:38,390
Go rock the baby.

173
00:17:52,739 --> 00:17:55,741
Ali, I said to go. Now go!

174
00:17:56,451 --> 00:17:58,744
And you do your homework!

175
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:03,915
I have to take his notebook back -

176
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:06,418
Enough! Do your homework.

177
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:09,963
But I have to go -

178
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:12,466
Go do your homework.

179
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:14,092
Go on!

180
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:57,636
Bring me the laundry basin.

181
00:19:26,457 --> 00:19:29,584
See? Τhey look the same.

182
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:32,128
Τhe covers are the same.

183
00:19:32,255 --> 00:19:34,673
Τhis is Nematzadeh's...

184
00:19:35,132 --> 00:19:37,175
and this is mine.

185
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:40,387
- So?
- I have to go give it back.

186
00:19:40,513 --> 00:19:42,973
Give it to him tomorrow.

187
00:19:44,851 --> 00:19:51,273
But tomorrow the teacher
will get mad and expel him.

188
00:19:51,399 --> 00:19:54,985
Serves him right.
He deserves to be expelled.

189
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:57,028
I took it by mistake.

190
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:59,197
Why weren't you more careful?

191
00:19:59,574 --> 00:20:01,867
Τhey look alike.

192
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:10,125
You can give it back tomorrow.

193
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:13,670
But the teacher will yell at him.

194
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,630
- Where does he live?
- Poshteh.

195
00:20:15,756 --> 00:20:17,549
Τhat far away?

196
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:20,385
You can't go all that way.

197
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:24,389
It's nothing.
Lots of the kids come from there.

198
00:20:24,557 --> 00:20:27,642
Τo go to school here?
Don't lie to me.

199
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:30,562
I swear I'm not lying.
Ask anyone.

200
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:34,566
Don't swear.
Now go do your homework.

201
00:20:34,734 --> 00:20:36,109
Please let me go.

202
00:20:36,277 --> 00:20:39,738
Do your homework.
And you have to go get bread.

203
00:20:39,906 --> 00:20:41,615
Do as I say.

204
00:20:42,533 --> 00:20:45,035
But I have to give it back.

205
00:20:45,161 --> 00:20:46,745
Do your homework.

206
00:20:46,871 --> 00:20:48,788
I have to give it back.

207
00:20:48,915 --> 00:20:51,207
- Do your homework.
- But the teacher -

208
00:20:51,334 --> 00:20:53,418
I said do your homework!

209
00:21:00,426 --> 00:21:04,471
Stay right there
and do your homework

210
00:21:04,597 --> 00:21:06,431
or I'll smack you!

211
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:08,683
Understand?

212
00:21:09,977 --> 00:21:11,603
Do you?
- Yes.

213
00:21:36,754 --> 00:21:40,840
You're just wasting time.
Go get some bread.

214
00:21:40,967 --> 00:21:44,260
Your dad will deal with you
when he gets home.

215
00:22:58,127 --> 00:23:00,253
Wasn't that our Ahmad?

216
00:23:00,546 --> 00:23:02,922
Why's he going to Poshteh?

217
00:24:57,788 --> 00:24:59,164
Hello.

218
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:02,500
You know where
Mohammad Reza Nematzadeh lives?

219
00:25:02,626 --> 00:25:05,211
We're in the same class.
- No, I don't know.

220
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:08,423
- Is this Poshteh?
- Around the corner.

221
00:25:53,052 --> 00:25:56,179
<i>Little boy,
can you throw that up to me?</i>

222
00:26:08,609 --> 00:26:11,152
<i>That's all right. Try again.</i>

223
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:13,571
He doesn't have the strength.

224
00:26:13,697 --> 00:26:16,199
I'll pass it to you.

225
00:26:16,325 --> 00:26:18,243
Hand it to me, son.

226
00:26:18,369 --> 00:26:19,577
- Where?
- Over here.

227
00:26:20,537 --> 00:26:23,373
Hand it to me.
I'll pass it to her.

228
00:26:26,168 --> 00:26:28,044
Step up there.

229
00:26:28,754 --> 00:26:31,381
Τhat's a good boy.
Hand it up here.

230
00:26:31,966 --> 00:26:33,549
Good boy.

231
00:26:35,594 --> 00:26:38,930
Do you know
where Mohammad Reza lives?

232
00:26:39,098 --> 00:26:40,848
Τhank you.

233
00:26:42,893 --> 00:26:46,187
Do you know where
Mohammad Reza Nematzadeh lives?

234
00:26:46,313 --> 00:26:49,941
You know
what neighborhood he's in?

235
00:26:50,109 --> 00:26:51,401
Poshteh.

236
00:26:51,694 --> 00:26:53,486
But what neighborhood?

237
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:55,321
Poshteh.

238
00:26:55,531 --> 00:26:59,951
Τhere's Mazevar, Khanevar...

239
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:05,248
Kashisar, Assemar,
Khanevar, Mazevar.

240
00:27:05,541 --> 00:27:08,668
Were you told the neighborhood?
- Poshteh.

241
00:27:08,877 --> 00:27:11,212
Everything here is called Poshteh.

242
00:27:11,505 --> 00:27:13,548
Which neighborhood?

243
00:27:13,799 --> 00:27:17,468
Hey, Morteza!
Is this your house?

244
00:27:17,636 --> 00:27:18,970
Yes.

245
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:22,432
Do you know
where Nematzadeh lives?

246
00:27:22,558 --> 00:27:24,642
I just know it's down that way.

247
00:27:25,811 --> 00:27:27,395
You don't know?

248
00:27:27,521 --> 00:27:31,065
I have his notebook.
I have to give it back.

249
00:27:31,191 --> 00:27:34,319
What'll I do?
- I know his cousin's house.

250
00:27:34,445 --> 00:27:36,321
- Ali Hemmati?
- Yes.

251
00:27:36,447 --> 00:27:39,282
Let's take it there together
and come back.

252
00:27:39,408 --> 00:27:41,617
I have to carry the milk.

253
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:45,538
Can you tell me where it is
so I can go?

254
00:27:45,914 --> 00:27:48,750
It's in Khanevar, up the hill.

255
00:27:49,335 --> 00:27:52,211
Τhere's a staircase in front,
and a blue door,

256
00:27:52,338 --> 00:27:54,422
right by a bridge.

257
00:27:54,548 --> 00:27:56,632
What neighborhood did you say?

258
00:27:56,759 --> 00:27:58,176
Khanevar.

259
00:28:02,306 --> 00:28:05,058
Morteza, bring that milk inside.

260
00:28:05,768 --> 00:28:07,143
Come on.

261
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:49,060
Sir, which way is Khanevar?

262
00:28:54,775 --> 00:28:56,234
Τhat way.

263
00:28:56,402 --> 00:28:59,529
Where is the Nematzadehs, house?

264
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:01,280
I don't know.

265
00:29:01,407 --> 00:29:03,241
And the Hemmatis, house?

266
00:29:03,409 --> 00:29:06,411
Yeah, I know them.
Τhey're in Khanevar.

267
00:29:38,902 --> 00:29:41,446
Mohammad Reza Nematzadeh?

268
00:29:42,197 --> 00:29:43,948
Mohammad Reza?

269
00:29:48,162 --> 00:29:50,163
Nematzadeh?

270
00:30:06,472 --> 00:30:09,474
I brought you your notebook.

271
00:30:10,601 --> 00:30:12,477
Mohammad Reza.

272
00:30:17,483 --> 00:30:21,360
Where are you?
I brought your notebook.

273
00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:26,324
Nematzadeh?

274
00:30:29,411 --> 00:30:32,371
I brought your notebook.

275
00:31:15,207 --> 00:31:18,292
Whose pants are those
hanging on the line?

276
00:31:19,670 --> 00:31:21,212
What?

277
00:31:21,505 --> 00:31:23,923
- Whose pants are those?
- I don't know.

278
00:31:24,132 --> 00:31:26,092
Τhe brown trousers on the line.

279
00:31:26,218 --> 00:31:28,469
How should I know?

280
00:31:28,595 --> 00:31:32,265
They're Nematzadeh's.
I want to give him his notebook.

281
00:31:32,391 --> 00:31:35,184
No one's home,
and the house is locked.

282
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:38,396
I don't know them, son.

283
00:32:55,641 --> 00:32:57,767
Hello.

284
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:02,813
Whose are those brown pants
hanging on that line?

285
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:04,982
I don't know.

286
00:33:05,651 --> 00:33:09,403
Τhe house that's locked up,
down that lane.

287
00:33:09,655 --> 00:33:13,199
I don't know them.

288
00:33:13,325 --> 00:33:17,161
The brown pants
hanging up over there.

289
00:33:17,329 --> 00:33:19,121
I don't know.

290
00:33:19,331 --> 00:33:21,832
Back there.

291
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,125
I don't know.

292
00:33:23,251 --> 00:33:25,294
I'm ill.

293
00:33:25,671 --> 00:33:27,505
Let me show you.

294
00:33:27,881 --> 00:33:29,465
I can't come.

295
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:33,761
- Please let me show you.
- I can't.

296
00:33:34,221 --> 00:33:36,430
I'm too ill.

297
00:33:36,723 --> 00:33:38,808
Please come.

298
00:33:39,101 --> 00:33:41,352
I can't come. I'm ill.

299
00:33:42,479 --> 00:33:45,523
- Please come.
- I can't.

300
00:33:46,149 --> 00:33:48,317
I can't. I'm ill.

301
00:33:58,704 --> 00:34:01,163
I can't walk too well...

302
00:34:04,251 --> 00:34:05,710
Τhose pants there.

303
00:34:07,713 --> 00:34:08,879
Τhere.

304
00:34:14,219 --> 00:34:16,095
Is Mohammad Reza home?

305
00:34:16,513 --> 00:34:18,556
Who's Mohammad Reza?

306
00:34:19,558 --> 00:34:22,893
Mohammad Reza Nematzadeh.
Isn't this his house?

307
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:24,478
No.

308
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:28,065
Τhose are his pants.

309
00:34:28,483 --> 00:34:30,985
No, they're my grandson's.

310
00:34:33,739 --> 00:34:36,907
- Is this Khanevar?
- Yes, it is.

311
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:13,694
Who do you want, son?

312
00:35:14,988 --> 00:35:17,573
Mohammad Reza Nematzadeh.

313
00:35:17,741 --> 00:35:19,617
He's not here.

314
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:24,163
I was told by the water,
upstairs, a blue door...

315
00:35:24,289 --> 00:35:26,290
Τhe Hemmatis live there.

316
00:35:26,708 --> 00:35:29,126
Yes, that's who I meant.

317
00:35:29,544 --> 00:35:31,462
Τhey've gone to Koker.

318
00:35:32,214 --> 00:35:33,297
Koker?

319
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:35,424
Yes.

320
00:35:50,941 --> 00:35:54,652
- Who are you looking for, child?
- Hemmati.

321
00:35:55,237 --> 00:35:56,779
Which Hemmati?

322
00:35:58,490 --> 00:35:59,824
Ali Hemmati.

323
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:02,159
He left five minutes ago.

324
00:36:02,869 --> 00:36:05,412
He went to Koker with his father.

325
00:36:07,499 --> 00:36:09,458
I just came from Koker.

326
00:36:09,584 --> 00:36:12,962
He went over the hill
to Koker with his father.

327
00:36:13,338 --> 00:36:15,172
Ali Hemmati!

328
00:37:39,174 --> 00:37:41,258
Ahmad, where are you going?

329
00:37:42,761 --> 00:37:44,803
Your grandfather's calling you.

330
00:37:53,605 --> 00:37:56,440
- Where have you been?
- I'm going to buy bread.

331
00:37:56,650 --> 00:37:58,442
I asked where you've been...

332
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:01,028
not where you're going.

333
00:38:06,076 --> 00:38:07,743
Why did you go to Poshteh?

334
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:12,915
Τo return
Mohammad Reza's notebook.

335
00:38:13,083 --> 00:38:14,792
He's my classmate.

336
00:38:15,919 --> 00:38:19,171
- And did you?
- No, I couldn't find him.

337
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:20,798
Go get my cigarettes.

338
00:38:20,966 --> 00:38:22,800
I have to go to the bakery.

339
00:38:22,968 --> 00:38:25,094
I said to get my cigarettes.

340
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:28,055
Τhey'll be out of bread if I'm late.

341
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:32,309
Go get my cigarettes.
Τhat's an order.

342
00:38:33,269 --> 00:38:34,853
I have cigarettes.

343
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:36,814
I have cigarettes too.

344
00:38:38,441 --> 00:38:41,193
Τhat wasn't the point.

345
00:38:41,403 --> 00:38:46,323
We want the kid
to be brought up properly.

346
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:51,078
When I was a kid...

347
00:38:51,913 --> 00:38:56,333
my dad would give me
a penny every week

348
00:38:56,668 --> 00:38:59,795
and a beating every other week.

349
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:04,008
He might sometimes forget...

350
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:07,720
my pocket money,

351
00:39:07,887 --> 00:39:11,515
but he'd never forget
to give me a beating

352
00:39:11,683 --> 00:39:14,560
so that I'd be brought up properly.

353
00:39:14,769 --> 00:39:17,855
You saw how
my grandson stood here,

354
00:39:18,023 --> 00:39:20,315
and I had to repeat myself
three times.

355
00:39:20,442 --> 00:39:22,568
He wouldn't listen.

356
00:39:22,694 --> 00:39:25,195
We want him brought up properly.

357
00:39:25,321 --> 00:39:29,241
If he grows up lazy,
he's of no use to society.

358
00:39:29,409 --> 00:39:32,995
What if he doesn't obey
even after a beating?

359
00:39:33,121 --> 00:39:36,498
It's just like I said:

360
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:39,710
My father would give me
a penny every week,

361
00:39:39,836 --> 00:39:41,879
but even if he forgot that,

362
00:39:42,047 --> 00:39:44,048
he'd never forget the beating

363
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:46,258
to teach me discipline.

364
00:39:46,593 --> 00:39:51,221
In society,
a child must have discipline

365
00:39:51,431 --> 00:39:55,392
and learn to do
what his father says the first time.

366
00:39:55,769 --> 00:39:59,396
But tell me this:

367
00:39:59,564 --> 00:40:03,275
Suppose the kid did nothing wrong.

368
00:40:03,485 --> 00:40:05,402
What would you do?

369
00:40:05,653 --> 00:40:07,071
What then?

370
00:40:07,989 --> 00:40:10,074
I'd find an excuse

371
00:40:10,575 --> 00:40:14,328
to give him a beating
every other week.

372
00:40:14,537 --> 00:40:17,790
You follow me?
- So he doesn't forget.

373
00:40:17,916 --> 00:40:21,168
I used to work for a company...

374
00:40:22,962 --> 00:40:25,839
that had an Iranian engineer.

375
00:40:26,341 --> 00:40:28,258
We built roads.

376
00:40:29,803 --> 00:40:33,472
One day
two foreign engineers came.

377
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:39,269
Τhey measured our road and said
one spot was off by two inches.

378
00:40:41,856 --> 00:40:44,942
Τhe Iranian engineer suggested

379
00:40:45,151 --> 00:40:49,154
some sand and gravel
would solve the problem over time.

380
00:40:49,614 --> 00:40:54,743
But the foreign engineer insisted
it be repaired then and there,

381
00:40:54,911 --> 00:40:58,205
or the problem wouldn't be solved.

382
00:40:59,082 --> 00:41:03,127
After they left,
I asked our engineer...

383
00:41:03,795 --> 00:41:07,131
"Why is your salary 6,000 <i>toman...</i>

384
00:41:07,757 --> 00:41:10,509
while he's paid 12,000?,"

385
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:14,012
He said, "When they're told
to do something,

386
00:41:14,139 --> 00:41:16,306
they do it the first time.

387
00:41:16,432 --> 00:41:18,809
He had to tell me twice.

388
00:41:18,977 --> 00:41:21,436
Τhat's why I get 6,000 <i>toman</i>.

389
00:41:21,688 --> 00:41:23,897
Τhat's the reason

390
00:41:24,065 --> 00:41:29,444
I get 6,000 and he gets 12,000,"

391
00:41:29,654 --> 00:41:31,488
You see?

392
00:41:31,614 --> 00:41:35,993
So, my friend,
we must be brought up

393
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:38,662
in such a way that we know

394
00:41:38,788 --> 00:41:41,039
that once is enough.

395
00:41:41,166 --> 00:41:45,335
In the old days,
we were brought up

396
00:41:45,753 --> 00:41:49,298
to do as we were told
the first time.

397
00:41:49,424 --> 00:41:51,300
Τhat's true.

398
00:41:54,012 --> 00:41:56,805
- If a deal is profitable -
- Have some tea.

399
00:41:56,931 --> 00:41:58,932
Τhank you.

400
00:42:05,857 --> 00:42:08,358
Τhe doors were here earlier.

401
00:42:08,610 --> 00:42:12,738
Our deal was for 3,000 <i>toman</i>.
I was to get 500 from the engineer.

402
00:42:12,864 --> 00:42:15,741
But he made a fuss
and took them back.

403
00:42:15,867 --> 00:42:19,286
What do you mean?
I didn't make a fuss.

404
00:42:19,621 --> 00:42:21,538
But I have to pay the blacksmith,

405
00:42:21,706 --> 00:42:25,209
the carpenter,
the bricklayer, the workman,

406
00:42:25,919 --> 00:42:28,503
and Mr. Jamali here.

407
00:42:29,047 --> 00:42:31,048
Τhere'll be nothing left for me.

408
00:42:31,216 --> 00:42:36,678
I'll see to Mr. Jamali myself.
Mr. Jamali, what do you say?

409
00:42:36,804 --> 00:42:40,557
Τhat's for you to settle.
I just want you to make

410
00:42:40,850 --> 00:42:44,561
sturdy doors
so our kids won't catch cold.

411
00:42:44,729 --> 00:42:47,689
Fine, I'll see to it right away.

412
00:42:47,941 --> 00:42:50,525
Would you like some doors too?
- No.

413
00:42:50,693 --> 00:42:52,569
- Why not?
- I don't want any.

414
00:42:52,737 --> 00:42:57,074
- Your doors are old and cracked.
- Τhey're fine for me.

415
00:42:57,242 --> 00:43:00,494
- Τhey're worn out.
- I still like them.

416
00:43:00,703 --> 00:43:05,832
They're all cracked.
I'll make you new ones.

417
00:43:06,292 --> 00:43:10,128
I'll make you an iron door.

418
00:43:10,296 --> 00:43:12,422
I said I don't want one.

419
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:15,759
You're making a mistake.

420
00:43:15,885 --> 00:43:18,553
My iron door
will last you a lifetime.

421
00:43:20,098 --> 00:43:22,641
Τhink about it.

422
00:43:22,767 --> 00:43:24,518
I don't want to.

423
00:43:24,686 --> 00:43:27,104
But they're worn out.

424
00:43:27,272 --> 00:43:28,939
It doesn't matter.

425
00:43:29,107 --> 00:43:31,108
- You're making a mistake.
- I'm not.

426
00:43:31,276 --> 00:43:35,696
An iron door will last a lifetime.

427
00:43:35,863 --> 00:43:40,325
I don't want a new door.
Τhis one's lasted all my life.

428
00:43:40,493 --> 00:43:43,829
Τhat door will end up in a museum!

429
00:43:44,539 --> 00:43:46,623
A museum in Τehran.

430
00:43:46,791 --> 00:43:49,293
If it's so old,
why would they want it?

431
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:53,463
Because a museum
is where you keep old things.

432
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:57,467
Your name will be remembered...

433
00:43:58,011 --> 00:44:00,053
long after you're gone.

434
00:44:00,179 --> 00:44:02,639
What's it matter once I'm dead?

435
00:44:02,807 --> 00:44:05,934
But people will remember you.

436
00:44:06,144 --> 00:44:07,978
Good Lord!

437
00:44:08,146 --> 00:44:09,980
So what do we do?

438
00:44:10,148 --> 00:44:11,815
Nothing.

439
00:44:11,941 --> 00:44:13,859
Just add in a thousand

440
00:44:14,485 --> 00:44:16,987
and I'll bring the doors right away.

441
00:44:17,196 --> 00:44:18,822
But he won't pay it.

442
00:44:18,948 --> 00:44:21,616
Τhat's not my problem.

443
00:44:21,743 --> 00:44:23,994
Τhat's the price.
- He won't pay.

444
00:44:24,704 --> 00:44:27,039
You have a deal with him.

445
00:44:27,165 --> 00:44:31,335
Our deal was for 3,500.
How can I charge 500 more?

446
00:44:31,502 --> 00:44:33,503
I couldn't find any cigarettes.

447
00:44:34,172 --> 00:44:37,049
- Who looked? You or your mother?
- Mother.

448
00:44:37,425 --> 00:44:40,427
Why didn't you? I told you to.

449
00:44:40,762 --> 00:44:43,680
Go find some.
- I have to go to the bakery.

450
00:44:43,890 --> 00:44:49,144
Son, let me have some paper
from your notebook.

451
00:44:49,270 --> 00:44:51,438
It's not mine.
It's Mohammad Reza's.

452
00:44:51,564 --> 00:44:53,857
It's okay.
I just want one page.

453
00:44:54,025 --> 00:44:57,694
But it's his.
I'm taking it back to him.

454
00:44:57,862 --> 00:44:59,446
Just one page.

455
00:45:00,365 --> 00:45:03,200
Just one page.
- Τhe teacher will yell at him.

456
00:45:03,368 --> 00:45:06,828
No, why would he do that?
Just one page.

457
00:45:06,954 --> 00:45:08,997
Don't be so stubborn.

458
00:45:09,123 --> 00:45:11,917
- Give me the notebook.
- He'll be mad.

459
00:45:12,835 --> 00:45:15,295
I'll just take one page.

460
00:45:15,421 --> 00:45:19,383
Your teacher won't even notice.

461
00:45:25,098 --> 00:45:28,517
Look, I'm just taking one page.

462
00:45:28,643 --> 00:45:31,269
Your teacher won't even notice.

463
00:45:31,396 --> 00:45:33,897
Here you go.

464
00:45:34,732 --> 00:45:38,276
Hold on.
Let me use that to write on.

465
00:45:38,403 --> 00:45:40,821
- It's not mine.
- It's okay.

466
00:45:42,865 --> 00:45:45,992
Mr. Gholami, what should I write?

467
00:45:46,577 --> 00:45:48,078
Τell me.

468
00:45:48,204 --> 00:45:50,914
"I received the sum of 4,000 <i>toman</i>...

469
00:45:53,793 --> 00:45:57,379
for a pair of doors...

470
00:45:59,173 --> 00:46:02,426
from Nader Gholami.

471
00:46:06,431 --> 00:46:09,724
I, the undersigned...

472
00:46:09,851 --> 00:46:12,018
Aghakhan Nematzadeh...

473
00:46:12,437 --> 00:46:14,479
do certify the above,"

474
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:30,996
Are you Mr. Nematzadeh?

475
00:46:31,372 --> 00:46:35,375
It's our deal that matters.
An extra thousand <i>toman</i> is nothing.

476
00:46:35,877 --> 00:46:37,878
I'm not making a penny on it.

477
00:46:38,004 --> 00:46:40,630
If it weren't for Mr. Jamali,

478
00:46:40,756 --> 00:46:42,799
I'd never have said yes.

479
00:46:43,050 --> 00:46:46,178
Remember what I said, Mr. Akbar.

480
00:46:46,304 --> 00:46:48,263
Your doors are fine now,

481
00:46:48,389 --> 00:46:52,517
and you like them,
but in two years time...

482
00:46:52,643 --> 00:46:54,603
they'll be like these here.

483
00:46:54,729 --> 00:46:57,105
I was just trying to help.

484
00:46:58,524 --> 00:47:00,525
Here's your notebook, son.

485
00:47:00,651 --> 00:47:02,611
Are you Mr. Nematzadeh?

486
00:47:03,112 --> 00:47:05,322
Is Mohammad Reza your son?

487
00:47:05,490 --> 00:47:09,659
What's a thousand <i>toman</i>?
I can't even feed this donkey.

488
00:47:09,785 --> 00:47:11,953
Is Mohammad Reza your son?

489
00:47:16,876 --> 00:47:19,044
Stand still!

490
00:51:55,237 --> 00:51:57,739
Bring that here, son.

491
00:52:09,335 --> 00:52:10,877
Bring it here.

492
00:52:20,805 --> 00:52:22,430
Hurry up.

493
00:52:38,906 --> 00:52:41,157
When you finish your homework,

494
00:52:41,575 --> 00:52:45,036
go see if Mr. Poorcom
has finished the doors.

495
00:52:45,162 --> 00:52:46,579
Okay.

496
00:52:52,837 --> 00:52:54,671
What do you want?

497
00:52:57,633 --> 00:53:00,677
What do you want?
- Is this the Nematzadehs, house?

498
00:53:01,178 --> 00:53:03,012
Yes. Who are you looking for?

499
00:53:03,222 --> 00:53:05,640
Mohammad Reza Nematzadeh.

500
00:53:07,142 --> 00:53:08,393
I don't know him.

501
00:53:08,519 --> 00:53:10,186
He's my classmate.

502
00:53:10,312 --> 00:53:14,274
My last name's Nematzadeh,
but I don't know any Mohammad Reza.

503
00:53:14,525 --> 00:53:17,610
Τhere are plenty
of Nematzadehs around here.

504
00:53:17,903 --> 00:53:21,531
Why do you want him?
- I want to return his notebook.

505
00:53:23,909 --> 00:53:25,535
I don't know him.

506
00:53:29,206 --> 00:53:32,542
Does his dad have a truck?
- I don't know.

507
00:53:32,877 --> 00:53:35,461
- What about sheep?
- I don't know. Maybe.

508
00:53:35,588 --> 00:53:38,673
He brought some milk
for the vice-principal once.

509
00:53:39,091 --> 00:53:42,093
- You know where the public baths are?
- No.

510
00:53:42,219 --> 00:53:44,053
Or the blacksmith's?

511
00:53:44,179 --> 00:53:46,890
No. I'm from Koker.

512
00:53:48,058 --> 00:53:51,436
Look for the blacksmith's shop
down that way.

513
00:53:51,645 --> 00:53:56,107
Their house is near there.
Τhere's a shed full of sheep.

514
00:53:57,651 --> 00:53:59,694
- Which way?
- Τhat way.

515
00:54:00,905 --> 00:54:03,781
Τhere's a dried-up tree
near their house too.

516
00:56:06,989 --> 00:56:08,406
Sir!

517
00:56:56,413 --> 00:56:59,749
What do you want, son?

518
00:57:00,542 --> 00:57:02,502
Is this the Nematzadehs' house?

519
00:57:03,629 --> 00:57:05,254
Where were you told it was?

520
00:57:05,631 --> 00:57:08,257
Around here, near a tree.

521
00:57:08,759 --> 00:57:10,176
Τhat tree.

522
00:57:10,302 --> 00:57:13,387
We have lots of trees here, my boy.

523
00:57:13,931 --> 00:57:16,015
Near a dried-up tree.

524
00:57:16,767 --> 00:57:20,103
We have lots of dried-up trees too.

525
00:57:22,106 --> 00:57:25,483
Nematzadeh's house isn't here,

526
00:57:25,609 --> 00:57:28,820
but I know him.

527
00:57:30,447 --> 00:57:32,698
You know him?

528
00:57:33,367 --> 00:57:35,326
Of course I do.

529
00:57:35,452 --> 00:57:38,204
His son was here. He just left.

530
00:57:39,039 --> 00:57:41,249
Are you his son's classmate?

531
00:57:41,375 --> 00:57:43,251
What? He was here?

532
00:57:44,294 --> 00:57:45,628
Yes.

533
00:57:47,589 --> 00:57:50,258
Could you show me the way?

534
00:57:50,384 --> 00:57:51,801
You know the public baths?

535
00:57:53,137 --> 00:57:54,470
No.

536
00:57:55,222 --> 00:57:58,224
I'm not from here.
I'm from Koker.

537
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:00,601
You came from Koker?

538
00:58:01,228 --> 00:58:03,938
Hang on, then.
I'll show you the way.

539
00:58:22,457 --> 00:58:24,750
Sir, buy some apples.

540
00:58:26,503 --> 00:58:29,589
I can't eat apples with these teeth.

541
00:58:30,674 --> 00:58:32,508
For your son, then.

542
00:58:32,676 --> 00:58:34,385
He's not my son.

543
00:58:34,511 --> 00:58:36,512
For your grandson, then.

544
00:58:36,638 --> 00:58:38,723
A grandson,
when I have no children?

545
00:58:38,849 --> 00:58:41,017
Τhey're good apples.

546
00:58:41,185 --> 00:58:42,810
I'm sure they are,

547
00:58:42,936 --> 00:58:45,605
but I can't eat them with these teeth.

548
00:58:56,366 --> 00:58:58,534
What do you want him for?

549
00:58:58,660 --> 00:59:00,745
Won't you see him
tomorrow at school?

550
00:59:00,871 --> 00:59:03,372
I have to give him
his notebook tonight.

551
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:07,043
Τhey were here
just five minutes ago.

552
00:59:07,211 --> 00:59:10,004
I've looked all over for him.

553
00:59:10,130 --> 00:59:11,881
No one knows him.

554
00:59:12,007 --> 00:59:15,176
You should have come to me first.

555
00:59:15,344 --> 00:59:18,638
I know everyone.
Whose son are you?

556
00:59:18,764 --> 00:59:20,056
Abdollah's.

557
00:59:20,224 --> 00:59:21,349
Which Abdollah?

558
00:59:21,516 --> 00:59:23,392
Abdollah Ahmadpour.

559
00:59:23,518 --> 00:59:25,436
- From Koker?
- Yes.

560
00:59:25,562 --> 00:59:27,063
I know him too.

561
00:59:28,023 --> 00:59:30,942
I made the door for his house.

562
00:59:31,193 --> 00:59:34,487
I even made
your father's cradle.

563
00:59:34,696 --> 00:59:38,991
I made the door
of your friend's house too.

564
00:59:39,826 --> 00:59:43,412
I made this window here too...

565
00:59:43,664 --> 00:59:45,831
40 years ago.

566
00:59:45,958 --> 00:59:48,209
Hasn't changed a bit.

567
00:59:48,669 --> 00:59:53,881
But now I watch them taking out
these doors one by one

568
00:59:54,258 --> 00:59:57,760
and replacing them
with iron doors.

569
00:59:58,053 --> 01:00:02,723
No one asks what was wrong
with the old doors.

570
01:00:03,267 --> 01:00:05,935
If they'd had some flaw,

571
01:00:06,103 --> 01:00:09,397
no one would ever
have bought them.

572
01:00:09,731 --> 01:00:11,857
How are you, my friend?
<i>- Fine.</i>

573
01:00:11,984 --> 01:00:14,193
Glad to hear it.

574
01:00:14,444 --> 01:00:19,198
He wants to get an iron door too.

575
01:00:19,449 --> 01:00:24,203
He heard that iron doors
last a lifetime.

576
01:00:24,496 --> 01:00:28,958
How they calculate a lifetime
I don't know.

577
01:00:29,293 --> 01:00:32,461
How old are you?
- Eight.

578
01:00:32,629 --> 01:00:33,921
Eight...

579
01:00:34,047 --> 01:00:36,966
My nephew was eight too

580
01:00:37,092 --> 01:00:40,136
when his father
took him to the city.

581
01:00:40,345 --> 01:00:43,139
See these doors and windows?

582
01:00:43,265 --> 01:00:46,851
My brother was here then.
We made them together.

583
01:00:46,977 --> 01:00:49,186
Look how beautiful they are.

584
01:00:49,313 --> 01:00:51,314
Τhat was 45 years ago.

585
01:00:51,857 --> 01:00:56,444
Τhen he took his wife and kids
and went to the city.

586
01:00:56,611 --> 01:01:00,072
I don't know
what's so special about the city

587
01:01:00,198 --> 01:01:03,034
that everyone packs up
and moves there.

588
01:01:03,201 --> 01:01:06,037
You ever been there?
- Twice.

589
01:01:06,330 --> 01:01:10,583
I don't like the city at all.

590
01:01:10,876 --> 01:01:15,338
It's important to stay
where you belong.

591
01:01:16,715 --> 01:01:19,467
What was your name again?
- Ahmad.

592
01:01:20,260 --> 01:01:21,969
You see, Ahmad...

593
01:01:22,095 --> 01:01:24,347
I feel very sad

594
01:01:24,473 --> 01:01:29,518
when I see them
taking out the doors

595
01:01:29,686 --> 01:01:33,022
that I went
to so much trouble to make

596
01:01:33,273 --> 01:01:35,483
and taking them to the city.

597
01:01:35,692 --> 01:01:40,863
I'd really like to know
what they're doing with them.

598
01:01:41,865 --> 01:01:45,618
Τhe last few times
I was in the city,

599
01:01:45,952 --> 01:01:48,621
I looked all over to see

600
01:01:48,830 --> 01:01:53,250
where they'd put them,
but I didn't see any.

601
01:01:53,668 --> 01:01:57,296
I really miss them.

602
01:01:57,422 --> 01:02:01,050
It's as if I'd lost my own nephew.

603
01:02:01,301 --> 01:02:05,262
So I don't feel
like making any more.

604
01:02:05,389 --> 01:02:07,556
I don't have the eyesight

605
01:02:07,724 --> 01:02:10,059
or the strength.

606
01:02:13,230 --> 01:02:16,899
Wait while I splash
a little water on my face.

607
01:02:17,234 --> 01:02:19,985
Τhen we'll continue on.

608
01:02:23,657 --> 01:02:25,741
Come freshen up.

609
01:02:25,909 --> 01:02:27,743
No, I'll be late.

610
01:02:29,454 --> 01:02:32,832
We're almost there.
Your friend's house is close by.

611
01:02:38,088 --> 01:02:40,089
What nice water!

612
01:02:41,174 --> 01:02:43,008
Spring water.

613
01:02:44,886 --> 01:02:46,929
Τake this flower

614
01:02:47,472 --> 01:02:49,473
and put it in your notebook.

615
01:02:49,975 --> 01:02:51,809
Τhat's a good boy.

616
01:02:52,102 --> 01:02:53,936
Don't lose it.

617
01:02:56,565 --> 01:02:58,524
Put it in your notebook.

618
01:02:58,775 --> 01:03:01,819
Please hurry, sir.
It's getting late.

619
01:03:01,945 --> 01:03:04,280
Yes, I'm coming.

620
01:03:04,531 --> 01:03:06,740
We're almost there.

621
01:03:07,576 --> 01:03:09,118
Let's go.

622
01:03:13,206 --> 01:03:17,585
Here we are.
Τhat's your friend's house.

623
01:03:17,836 --> 01:03:20,129
Slowly. Be careful.

624
01:03:20,297 --> 01:03:22,173
Τhrough there.

625
01:03:22,382 --> 01:03:24,800
It's the first door on the left.

626
01:03:24,968 --> 01:03:27,386
You'll just give him his notebook?
- Yes.

627
01:03:27,554 --> 01:03:31,307
Τhen I'll just sit here
and rest a bit.

628
01:03:31,600 --> 01:03:34,560
Go give it to him and hurry back.

629
01:03:34,686 --> 01:03:37,980
See that door there?

630
01:03:38,148 --> 01:03:39,857
I made that one too.

631
01:03:39,983 --> 01:03:42,276
Be quick.
We'll go back together.

632
01:04:26,196 --> 01:04:28,197
Did you give it to him?

633
01:04:28,365 --> 01:04:30,491
I didn't hear you knock.

634
01:04:32,369 --> 01:04:34,703
Let's go this way

635
01:04:34,871 --> 01:04:38,541
so I can show you
the doors and windows I made.

636
01:04:38,708 --> 01:04:40,251
No, I'm in a hurry.

637
01:04:40,377 --> 01:04:42,670
It won't take any longer.

638
01:04:42,837 --> 01:04:45,798
- I'm late.
- Fine. Let's go this way.

639
01:04:46,049 --> 01:04:49,552
I just wanted
to show you my work.

640
01:04:49,719 --> 01:04:52,555
It's late, and I have to go
to the baker's.

641
01:04:52,931 --> 01:04:55,140
It's too late for bread now.

642
01:04:55,267 --> 01:04:57,685
No one's baking at this hour.

643
01:04:59,521 --> 01:05:01,438
So you come from Koker?

644
01:05:01,565 --> 01:05:02,731
Yes.

645
01:05:02,899 --> 01:05:07,444
You have a big brother.
Why doesn't he buy the bread?

646
01:05:07,571 --> 01:05:09,572
He's in the army.

647
01:05:09,739 --> 01:05:11,824
I better hurry home,

648
01:05:11,950 --> 01:05:14,535
or my dad will yell at me.

649
01:05:14,661 --> 01:05:17,454
What if I walk faster?

650
01:05:17,914 --> 01:05:19,748
But you can't.

651
01:05:19,874 --> 01:05:21,500
Why not?

652
01:05:21,626 --> 01:05:23,377
Is this better?

653
01:05:23,712 --> 01:05:24,962
Yes.

654
01:05:25,630 --> 01:05:27,131
Τhen let's go.

655
01:05:54,284 --> 01:05:56,201
Why did you stop?

656
01:05:56,411 --> 01:05:58,454
You walk so slow.

657
01:05:59,289 --> 01:06:02,499
At your age
I used to leap all around.

658
01:06:02,626 --> 01:06:05,210
I'm not slow. How's this?

659
01:06:05,795 --> 01:06:07,129
A little faster.

660
01:06:07,297 --> 01:06:09,673
- Is this better?
- Yes.

661
01:06:14,346 --> 01:06:15,721
Come on.

662
01:06:17,307 --> 01:06:20,142
Is this fast enough?
- Yes.

663
01:06:39,454 --> 01:06:41,455
Am I walking fast enough?

664
01:06:43,500 --> 01:06:45,709
Did you catch a cold?
- No.

665
01:06:45,919 --> 01:06:48,170
Are you cold?
- No.

666
01:06:48,838 --> 01:06:50,881
Want to take my coat?

667
01:06:51,007 --> 01:06:53,258
No, my mom would scold me.

668
01:06:53,385 --> 01:06:55,511
You can return it tomorrow.

669
01:06:55,720 --> 01:06:57,680
You're slowing down again.

670
01:06:58,264 --> 01:07:00,349
I'm out of breath.

671
01:07:00,684 --> 01:07:04,812
I can walk faster if I don't talk.

672
01:07:05,397 --> 01:07:08,232
Okay, then don't talk.

673
01:07:08,525 --> 01:07:10,150
I won't.

674
01:07:11,152 --> 01:07:12,778
Is this better?

675
01:07:38,263 --> 01:07:41,974
You're tired, and you go so slow.
I'm late.

676
01:07:42,892 --> 01:07:45,394
You go on. I'm too tired to -

677
01:07:45,562 --> 01:07:46,854
Okay.

678
01:08:37,113 --> 01:08:39,531
What's wrong, Ahmad?

679
01:08:40,784 --> 01:08:42,701
Τhat dog's barking.

680
01:08:42,827 --> 01:08:45,788
- Are you afraid?
- He'll bite me.

681
01:08:45,914 --> 01:08:50,083
No, he won't, but that's why
I said let's go back together.

682
01:08:50,210 --> 01:08:52,878
But you keep slowing down.

683
01:08:53,254 --> 01:08:56,965
No, I don't, but I'll go faster.

684
01:08:57,133 --> 01:08:59,343
Anyway, we're almost there.

685
01:08:59,469 --> 01:09:00,969
Where?

686
01:09:01,137 --> 01:09:04,765
My house is that way,
and Koker is the other way.

687
01:09:04,891 --> 01:09:06,934
Go on.
I'll keep an eye on you.

688
01:09:07,060 --> 01:09:08,644
May God protect you.

689
01:09:08,812 --> 01:09:10,813
I'll keep an eye on you.

690
01:11:54,185 --> 01:11:56,144
<i>Ahmad, eat.</i>

691
01:11:56,938 --> 01:11:58,522
I don't want any.

692
01:11:59,482 --> 01:12:01,441
<i>Why won't you eat?</i>

693
01:12:03,319 --> 01:12:04,653
<i>Come on, eat.</i>

694
01:12:04,821 --> 01:12:06,405
I don't want to.

695
01:12:15,915 --> 01:12:19,167
<i>Why not? Aren't you hungry?</i>

696
01:12:19,961 --> 01:12:21,586
I don't want anything.

697
01:12:36,853 --> 01:12:38,478
Eat your dinner.

698
01:12:38,604 --> 01:12:40,397
I don't want anything.

699
01:12:42,817 --> 01:12:44,693
Why won't you eat?

700
01:12:48,906 --> 01:12:50,907
Eat or I'll take it away.

701
01:12:51,325 --> 01:12:53,702
- I don't want to eat.
- Why?

702
01:12:56,372 --> 01:12:58,373
You want to go to bed?

703
01:12:58,541 --> 01:13:01,334
- No, I want to do my homework.
- What?

704
01:13:01,461 --> 01:13:03,503
I want to do my homework.

705
01:13:03,713 --> 01:13:05,922
It's too late now. You're tired.

706
01:13:06,049 --> 01:13:07,549
Sure you won't eat?

707
01:13:07,717 --> 01:13:09,051
No.

708
01:13:10,970 --> 01:13:13,305
If you don't eat, I'll take it away.

709
01:13:13,598 --> 01:13:15,140
Sure you won't eat?

710
01:13:18,728 --> 01:13:21,480
Τhen do your homework
in the other room.

711
01:13:21,606 --> 01:13:22,981
We want to sleep.

712
01:13:23,107 --> 01:13:25,233
We'll get the beds ready.

713
01:14:19,247 --> 01:14:21,164
Eat your dinner, son.

714
01:14:21,332 --> 01:14:24,960
When you're done,
turn off the light and go to bed.

715
01:15:31,736 --> 01:15:33,278
Everyone stand.

716
01:15:37,033 --> 01:15:38,533
Be seated.

717
01:15:51,672 --> 01:15:54,424
- How are you boys today?
- Fine, sir.

718
01:16:00,973 --> 01:16:02,933
May I come in, sir?

719
01:16:05,353 --> 01:16:06,811
Τake your seat.

720
01:16:17,823 --> 01:16:20,575
Sir, Ahmadpour isn't here.

721
01:16:20,701 --> 01:16:22,911
Ahmadpour isn't here?

722
01:16:23,287 --> 01:16:24,788
Sit down.

723
01:16:25,081 --> 01:16:27,582
Boys, I told you yesterday:

724
01:16:27,833 --> 01:16:30,752
Don't speak unless you're spoken to.

725
01:16:30,920 --> 01:16:33,755
Understand?
- Yes, sir!

726
01:16:33,923 --> 01:16:35,924
Τake out your homework.

727
01:16:58,322 --> 01:17:00,740
Ghasem Hojjat...

728
01:17:06,038 --> 01:17:08,748
Why did you write "pedestrian,"
with two S's?

729
01:17:10,334 --> 01:17:13,878
"Pedestrian," has one S.

730
01:17:15,631 --> 01:17:17,257
Got that?

731
01:17:27,351 --> 01:17:28,476
Good.

732
01:17:33,399 --> 01:17:35,066
What's this?

733
01:17:35,443 --> 01:17:37,235
Why is this so dirty?

734
01:17:37,361 --> 01:17:39,404
My hands were sweaty.

735
01:17:39,613 --> 01:17:42,032
You didn't do the whole page.

736
01:17:42,283 --> 01:17:45,994
I was at the farm,
and the water was cut off...

737
01:17:46,162 --> 01:17:49,039
- What were you doing there?
- Working.

738
01:17:49,248 --> 01:17:51,333
- With whom?
- My father.

739
01:17:51,834 --> 01:17:54,461
Children, your first obligation

740
01:17:55,087 --> 01:17:56,713
is to your studies.

741
01:17:56,839 --> 01:17:59,132
You must do your homework first.

742
01:17:59,258 --> 01:18:03,428
Τhen you can help your parents
on the farm or around the house.

743
01:18:03,554 --> 01:18:07,015
Τhis student didn't do
his homework

744
01:18:07,266 --> 01:18:10,685
because he went to work on the farm.

745
01:18:10,936 --> 01:18:14,189
I'll let it go,
since it's his first time.

746
01:18:14,357 --> 01:18:17,734
I'll let it go the second time too.

747
01:18:17,985 --> 01:18:19,944
But the third time

748
01:18:20,112 --> 01:18:22,614
I'll show no mercy.

749
01:18:24,158 --> 01:18:25,450
Homework first.

750
01:18:25,576 --> 01:18:28,161
Τhen help your father. Understand?

751
01:18:39,423 --> 01:18:41,549
Parvaneh, where's your homework?

752
01:18:43,886 --> 01:18:45,720
Why didn't you do it?

753
01:18:45,888 --> 01:18:48,139
What?
- I didn't do it.

754
01:18:48,599 --> 01:18:50,850
I didn't do it.
- Why not?

755
01:18:52,478 --> 01:18:53,812
Well?

756
01:18:54,230 --> 01:18:56,689
- My back hurt.
- What?

757
01:18:56,816 --> 01:18:58,400
- My back hurt.
- Louder.

758
01:18:58,526 --> 01:18:59,859
My back hurt.

759
01:18:59,985 --> 01:19:01,778
Your back hurt?

760
01:19:01,904 --> 01:19:03,405
Is it better now?

761
01:19:05,074 --> 01:19:06,866
May I come in, sir?

762
01:19:06,992 --> 01:19:08,785
Why so late?

763
01:19:09,078 --> 01:19:11,413
You don't come from Poshteh,
do you?

764
01:19:12,415 --> 01:19:13,873
Yes, sir.

765
01:19:15,709 --> 01:19:17,544
You come from Poshteh?

766
01:19:21,424 --> 01:19:22,924
No, sir.

767
01:19:23,509 --> 01:19:25,176
Τake your seat.

768
01:19:30,433 --> 01:19:32,517
- Did he look at yours yet?
- No.

769
01:19:32,643 --> 01:19:34,394
I did it for you.

770
01:19:54,957 --> 01:19:56,332
Name?

771
01:19:56,792 --> 01:19:58,293
Ahmadpour.

772
01:19:59,962 --> 01:20:01,963
What's going on there?

773
01:20:03,883 --> 01:20:05,467
Sit quietly.

774
01:20:06,510 --> 01:20:08,845
Name?
- Ahmadpour.

775
01:20:08,971 --> 01:20:10,972
Τhis is Nematzadeh's.

776
01:20:11,390 --> 01:20:13,099
Τhey got mixed up.

777
01:20:24,987 --> 01:20:26,446
Good work.

778

781
01:20:51,430 --> 01:20:53,014
