1
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,703
One less mirror bird to watch over Jasper.

2
00:04:03,745 --> 00:04:06,035
Murdered like the others were.

3
00:04:06,036 --> 00:04:07,993
Who did it?
And why?

4
00:04:07,994 --> 00:04:10,370
To keep us from learning what
threatens us.

5
00:04:11,037 --> 00:04:12,620
Without the eyes of the mirror birds,

6
00:04:12,621 --> 00:04:15,828
we can't see what's happening
at the borders of our land.

7
00:04:16,161 --> 00:04:22,828
I have been warning you about this. But no
one would care for technology at Gandahar...

8
00:04:22,829 --> 00:04:26,744
It's a great pride of our civilization
that we prefer birds to machines!

9
00:04:26,745 --> 00:04:30,078
And natural order to technical solutions...
Sure...

10
00:04:30,161 --> 00:04:34,244
But it seems that we may have to pay too
dearly for this preference... and too soon...

11
00:04:34,245 --> 00:04:39,119
Given the urgency of the situation, the Council
has chosen our best agent to investigate.

12
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,495
Which one?

13
00:04:41,786 --> 00:04:43,036
Sylvain.

14
00:04:43,078 --> 00:04:47,412
Syl?!
But he is not experienced enough!

15
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:50,202
I've taught him,
and I am quite certain about it.

16
00:04:50,203 --> 00:04:52,536
He is very capable.

17
00:04:52,537 --> 00:04:54,245
Surely there are more experienced...

18
00:04:54,246 --> 00:04:56,411
and more capable agents than he is.

19
00:04:56,453 --> 00:04:59,078
The Council has ruled
and you cannot change their decision.

20
00:04:59,079 --> 00:05:00,829
We've already summoned.

21
00:05:04,537 --> 00:05:09,161
Agent Sylvain, Syl, as friends call you.

22
00:05:10,829 --> 00:05:16,702
The Council of Women has chosen you for a most
important, difficult and dangerous mission.

23
00:05:16,703 --> 00:05:17,745
I would give my life...

24
00:05:17,746 --> 00:05:22,746
We don't want you to die,
but to return and inform us.

25
00:05:40,537 --> 00:05:43,452
An unknown enemy menaces Gandahar.

26
00:05:43,453 --> 00:05:45,910
You must discover where this enemy is,

27
00:05:45,911 --> 00:05:47,620
who this enemy is,

28
00:05:47,621 --> 00:05:50,869
determine its power, its
weaponry and its methods.

29
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:54,744
And, if you can, probe into its secrets,

30
00:05:54,745 --> 00:05:58,870
find its weakness... if it has any.

31
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:18,662
It's not without doubts
that I am sending you.

32
00:06:18,703 --> 00:06:22,827
It's too dangerous.
But we did have to send our best agent.

33
00:06:22,828 --> 00:06:25,121
Exactly where are you sending me?

34
00:06:25,329 --> 00:06:30,037
Your target is vast.
The Circumscribing Ocean.

35
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:32,911
That's where most of the mirror birds
have been killed.

36
00:06:32,912 --> 00:06:35,994
However, one bird saw something.
Possibly, one of the invaders.

37
00:06:35,995 --> 00:06:37,827
Here is the image it was able
to transmit before it died.

38
00:06:37,828 --> 00:06:39,537
I can't tell anything from this image!

39
00:06:40,745 --> 00:06:42,495
Can we replay it more slowly?

40
00:06:43,662 --> 00:06:45,870
I've also hoped to identify
the source of aggression.

41
00:06:45,871 --> 00:06:48,245
But with these metallic reflexions...

42
00:06:50,287 --> 00:06:54,036
It has been foolish of us to expect that
our present happiness should last forever.

43
00:06:54,037 --> 00:06:57,453
We've indulged in our
sweet life at Gandahar.

44
00:06:57,703 --> 00:07:01,496
And it has been lasting so long
that we've forgotten how to fight.

45
00:10:17,995 --> 00:10:22,287
No doubt about it.
He was will be from Gandahar.

46
00:10:23,496 --> 00:10:26,703
Impossible! I have never seen a being
who looks like this...

47
00:10:26,704 --> 00:10:28,745
Gandahar, I tell you.

48
00:10:29,412 --> 00:10:31,954
Gandahar, but before...

49
00:10:32,454 --> 00:10:34,996
Unbelievable!

50
00:10:43,287 --> 00:10:47,162
He was will be alive... but very weak.

51
00:11:09,079 --> 00:11:12,120
He was will be very careless
to fly so far from the capital.

52
00:11:12,121 --> 00:11:16,121
No, not careless... courageous!

53
00:11:16,787 --> 00:11:19,079
Maybe he was sent from Jasper.

54
00:11:19,787 --> 00:11:23,121
Do you think those in the capital
have finally wakened to the danger?

55
00:12:22,245 --> 00:12:23,163
Who were you?

56
00:12:23,164 --> 00:12:24,413
I am!

57
00:12:25,871 --> 00:12:28,079
I am Sylvain of Gandahar!

58
00:12:28,496 --> 00:12:29,954
A soldier.

59
00:12:31,371 --> 00:12:33,411
And a prisoner of the enemy.

60
00:12:33,412 --> 00:12:35,079
Enemy?

61
00:12:35,663 --> 00:12:37,204
Where do you come from?

62
00:12:37,746 --> 00:12:39,496
From Jasper!

63
00:12:39,579 --> 00:12:42,662
Were they will always be so smug in Jasper.

64
00:12:42,704 --> 00:12:45,036
They certainly were when
they did this to us...

65
00:12:45,037 --> 00:12:46,579
Keep quiet!

66
00:12:48,246 --> 00:12:51,578
Now, do you really believe we're the enemy?

67
00:12:51,579 --> 00:12:53,036
I do!

68
00:12:53,038 --> 00:12:55,246
Ready to attack you?

69
00:12:55,412 --> 00:12:56,954
Yes.

70
00:12:57,037 --> 00:12:59,120
Capable of defeating you?

71
00:12:59,245 --> 00:13:00,663
No!

72
00:13:01,038 --> 00:13:03,496
Can you guess who we are?

73
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:05,121
With these bodies...

74
00:13:05,163 --> 00:13:09,912
these heads, these misshapen limbs
assembled without care.

75
00:13:11,287 --> 00:13:13,620
The Deformed?

76
00:13:13,621 --> 00:13:16,537
Those who Gandahar calls the Deformed!

77
00:13:16,538 --> 00:13:20,578
- Not the deformed, the wrongly formed.
- The result of mostrous errors.

78
00:13:20,579 --> 00:13:24,412
- From the games of chance.
- The wretched mutants!

79
00:13:25,663 --> 00:13:32,037
Sylvain, we also came from Gandahar.
Once, you and me were alike.

80
00:13:32,746 --> 00:13:38,080
But we were will be the victims of your
scientific research in the field of genetics.

81
00:13:39,205 --> 00:13:40,954
How would I imagine?

82
00:13:42,329 --> 00:13:46,828
We became an embarrassment,
and you banished us underground.

83
00:13:46,829 --> 00:13:50,371
You buried us, as you would do with
so many of your other failures.

84
00:13:51,705 --> 00:13:56,286
As a child, I heard stories,
but I would never imagine...

85
00:13:56,287 --> 00:13:57,704
Of course!

86
00:13:57,746 --> 00:14:00,412
No one would imagine!

87
00:14:03,746 --> 00:14:05,121
Forgive me for having taken you...

88
00:14:05,163 --> 00:14:07,621
for the enemies you're trying to find?

89
00:14:08,538 --> 00:14:12,079
I forgive... and understand.

90
00:14:14,621 --> 00:14:18,954
The real enemy has never been seen.
Never.

91
00:14:19,329 --> 00:14:24,037
But we've been listening to them
through these tunnels.

92
00:14:24,912 --> 00:14:26,830
The Ears of the Earth.

93
00:14:34,579 --> 00:14:35,870
Shayol!

94
00:14:35,871 --> 00:14:37,912
I was will be at your command!

95
00:14:39,038 --> 00:14:45,996
I have chosen you to lead Sylvain out
there, until you reach the noise.

96
00:14:46,579 --> 00:14:48,787
I was will be at your command!

97
00:15:27,079 --> 00:15:30,413
Why do you say "was will be"
instead of simply "I am"?

98
00:15:30,955 --> 00:15:33,663
The Deformed are terrified of the present.

99
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:35,704
Why is it?

100
00:15:36,204 --> 00:15:38,454
Perhaps it's an atavism.

101
00:15:38,871 --> 00:15:40,955
We keep degrading.

102
00:15:40,997 --> 00:15:45,704
At the time of the first generic errors,
we had the gift of foresight.

103
00:15:46,579 --> 00:15:48,788
Unfortunately, we've lost it.

104
00:15:48,829 --> 00:15:53,663
There is nothing left other than
a double prophecy, doubly obscure.

105
00:15:53,830 --> 00:15:57,663
"In a thousand years, Gandahar was
destroyed and all of its people killed."

106
00:15:57,705 --> 00:16:01,038
"A thousand years ago, Gandahar will be
saved, and what can't be avoided will be."

107
00:16:01,079 --> 00:16:04,162
In a thousand years,
Gandahar was destroyed?

108
00:16:04,871 --> 00:16:08,080
A thousand years ago,
Gandahar will be saved?

109
00:16:08,663 --> 00:16:11,162
Past in future, and future in past?

110
00:16:11,163 --> 00:16:12,996
But what does it mean?

111
00:16:13,204 --> 00:16:17,579
We don't understand it any better than you,
but it has become our nature,

112
00:16:17,621 --> 00:16:21,955
and past-future our way
of speaking and believing.

113
00:17:44,121 --> 00:17:45,372
Shayol!

114
00:17:46,622 --> 00:17:49,038
Are these women and children dead?

115
00:17:50,038 --> 00:17:51,788
Petrified on the spot?

116
00:17:52,621 --> 00:17:54,496
Annihilated?!

117
00:19:13,663 --> 00:19:17,205
No! Don't turn me to stone!

118
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:21,246
Don't turn me to stone!

119
00:19:21,288 --> 00:19:22,912
Don't steal my body!

120
00:19:22,913 --> 00:19:25,287
It's not something I would do!

121
00:19:25,288 --> 00:19:28,995
I've seen them, Ambisextra.

122
00:19:28,996 --> 00:19:32,663
They are made of metal... of metal.

123
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:38,413
Airelle...

124
00:19:39,455 --> 00:19:41,205
Your name is as beautiful as you are!

125
00:19:41,206 --> 00:19:43,121
And what is your name?

126
00:19:43,621 --> 00:19:45,954
Sylvain, friends call me Syl.

127
00:19:46,079 --> 00:19:47,079
I am an agent.

128
00:19:47,121 --> 00:19:48,539
Of Ambisextra's?

129
00:19:49,205 --> 00:19:50,705
How do you know?

130
00:19:57,829 --> 00:20:00,204
I've never seen you in Jasper!

131
00:20:00,288 --> 00:20:03,455
I live far away from the capital,

132
00:20:03,747 --> 00:20:05,955
in a fishermen's village.

133
00:20:06,247 --> 00:20:08,412
I would show it to you,

134
00:20:08,413 --> 00:20:10,871
if we get out of this prison.

135
00:20:19,538 --> 00:20:21,870
I was carelessly playing flute.

136
00:20:21,871 --> 00:20:22,953
Flute?

137
00:20:22,955 --> 00:20:24,870
Yeah, do you want to learn it?

138
00:20:24,871 --> 00:20:26,039
If we get a chance...

139
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:28,122
When they shot me,
I didn't feel any pain.

140
00:20:28,123 --> 00:20:30,872
My heart became hard and insensitive.

141
00:20:30,913 --> 00:20:35,163
I lost my consiousness, and woke up here,
together with you.

142
00:20:58,038 --> 00:21:00,205
What is it?

143
00:21:00,371 --> 00:21:02,705
What's happening?

144
00:21:15,789 --> 00:21:17,664
How quiet all of a sudden...

145
00:21:24,496 --> 00:21:29,121
Syl! Syl, help, it's turning!

146
00:21:29,122 --> 00:21:32,247
Don't hold to it, slide!

147
00:21:37,038 --> 00:21:41,330
I have a gun.
With one last charge.

148
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:57,329
Syl, what is it?

149
00:21:57,330 --> 00:21:58,622
I hope it works!

150
00:22:15,871 --> 00:22:17,789
What a monster!

151
00:22:18,164 --> 00:22:19,830
Sorn?

152
00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:22,205
It's impossible...

153
00:22:22,705 --> 00:22:25,871
This species has been extinct
from our planet for a long time.

154
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:38,496
Don't be afraid.
Sorns are not carnivores.

155
00:22:39,788 --> 00:22:41,456
Why is it not leaving then?

156
00:22:55,747 --> 00:22:57,872
You are so beautiful, Airelle!

157
00:22:58,289 --> 00:22:59,955
So are you!

158
00:23:04,913 --> 00:23:06,539
How do sorns reproduce?

159
00:23:06,789 --> 00:23:07,997
They lay eggs.

160
00:23:08,039 --> 00:23:09,954
Our sorn is a lady.

161
00:23:09,955 --> 00:23:14,079
A lady? How would you know
the sex of that sorn.

162
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:22,413
It's intuition... She took our prison
for an egg, and us for the hatchlings.

163
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:23,997
That explains it.

164
00:23:23,998 --> 00:23:25,372
Of course, it does.

165
00:23:26,413 --> 00:23:31,622
That's why sorn was fighting with the metal men.
Because she took our cell for her egg.

166
00:23:32,081 --> 00:23:36,371
Which leads us to the conclusion that
she thought of us as her own children.

167
00:23:36,372 --> 00:23:39,955
That's why she groomed us
and built the nest.

168
00:23:40,330 --> 00:23:44,122
Poor Syl the brave soldier.

169
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:51,830
Mysterious metal men attack my village,
and you're sent from Jasper to investigate.

170
00:23:51,872 --> 00:23:59,122
We're both captured, and put in the same
cell, and then freed by a lady sorn.

171
00:23:59,664 --> 00:24:03,455
And, after all this, it looks like
I am falling in love with you.

172
00:24:31,038 --> 00:24:35,456
I used to be stupid
and way too self-confident.

173
00:24:36,122 --> 00:24:40,330
And I expected this to be
just another reconaissance mission.

174
00:24:41,413 --> 00:24:44,080
But it has been a little
too much for me.

175
00:24:45,289 --> 00:24:49,122
I am afraid, Airelle.
Yes... afraid.

176
00:24:50,539 --> 00:24:52,997
If I fail, Gandahar will die.

177
00:24:53,663 --> 00:24:57,831
The metal men are strong,
but they are very stupid.

178
00:24:58,622 --> 00:25:00,539
They cannot win!

179
00:25:00,581 --> 00:25:01,872
And I would not like to lose!

180
00:25:01,873 --> 00:25:04,455
It's not easy to lose with me,
you'll see.

181
00:25:04,497 --> 00:25:08,455
No, I don't want to see that.
You'll be nice and wait for me, OK?

182
00:25:08,497 --> 00:25:12,413
Syl, let's not argue,
I'll go where you go.

183
00:25:12,414 --> 00:25:15,164
You're just imagining it,
I'll go on my own!

184
00:25:15,747 --> 00:25:17,829
There is no point arguing.

185
00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:23,122
Those who are meant to be together
will stay together.

186
00:25:35,997 --> 00:25:37,581
Empty!

187
00:25:38,081 --> 00:25:40,414
Totally empty!

188
00:25:41,205 --> 00:25:43,622
No flesh, no scheleton.

189
00:25:45,163 --> 00:25:48,997
Nothing living, nothing mechanical!
No gears, no circuits, no nothing.

190
00:25:51,164 --> 00:25:54,538
And yet they are capable of moving
and of fighting. Of using weapons.

191
00:25:54,539 --> 00:25:56,622
What about their heads?

192
00:25:57,413 --> 00:25:58,955
Look!

193
00:26:21,913 --> 00:26:23,205
Syl!

194
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:48,789
It's a real army!

195
00:26:52,581 --> 00:26:55,080
I didn't know they were so well equipped.

196
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:58,372
So well organized for the purpose
of destroying us.

197
00:26:59,455 --> 00:27:01,955
It's terrifying how bad our chances are.

198
00:27:01,956 --> 00:27:03,997
We've got a real advantage.

199
00:27:04,081 --> 00:27:08,497
They are empty.
Without brains, without hearts.

200
00:27:51,456 --> 00:27:53,497
That's how it happened.

201
00:27:54,039 --> 00:27:58,747
I must have been carried
by one of them...

202
00:28:09,206 --> 00:28:11,622
It's great that the sorn liberated us!

203
00:29:01,747 --> 00:29:04,122
I don't like this door.

204
00:29:07,498 --> 00:29:14,289
No lock, no key, and they disappear
as they go through it.

205
00:29:14,497 --> 00:29:17,039
It's very strange.
There must be an explanation.

206
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:18,664
We should try to find it.

207
00:29:27,247 --> 00:29:29,456
Oh, it's terrible!

208
00:29:29,498 --> 00:29:33,373
The petrified statues went in,
and the metal men are coming out.

209
00:29:35,581 --> 00:29:41,289
This door transforms the people of Gandahar
into the robots who kill them.

210
00:30:06,414 --> 00:30:10,081
Men of metal!
Men of metal!

211
00:30:10,373 --> 00:30:13,456
Our mission has been a success.

212
00:30:13,622 --> 00:30:18,621
Our losses do not matter. Those metal men who
were destroyed had served a worthy cause.

213
00:30:18,622 --> 00:30:22,247
Death only has meaning for
contemptible beings.

214
00:30:22,248 --> 00:30:24,373
Beings in love with the individual self.

215
00:30:24,414 --> 00:30:26,913
The "I" does not exist!

216
00:30:26,914 --> 00:30:29,538
THE "I" DOES NOT EXIST!

217
00:30:29,539 --> 00:30:34,747
I am you, you are us, us are Him.

218
00:30:34,748 --> 00:30:39,621
I AM YOU, YOU ARE US, US ARE HIM!

219
00:30:39,622 --> 00:30:47,331
The Great Procreator, the source of our
energy, and soon the master of the world.

220
00:30:47,373 --> 00:30:50,872
The day is near when the civilization
of Gandahar will be destroyed.

221
00:30:51,206 --> 00:30:58,580
This civilization of pleasure,
this kingdom of waste and licence.

222
00:30:58,581 --> 00:31:04,871
The Great Procreator will destroy Gandahar.
Before the final annihilation,

223
00:31:04,872 --> 00:31:07,455
our delegates will travel over
the Circumscribing Ocean...

224
00:31:07,456 --> 00:31:10,497
to prove our complete submission.

225
00:31:10,498 --> 00:31:13,914
Contact with the Master will renew
our power and our strength!

226
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:22,872
Hear me! Hear me! Tonight you must
stay disconnected until we embark.

227
00:31:22,873 --> 00:31:25,747
Long live the Great Procreator!

228
00:31:25,748 --> 00:31:29,497
LONG LIVE THE GREAT PROCREATOR!

229
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:35,747
The Great Procreator?

230
00:31:35,748 --> 00:31:37,706
Total annihilation?

231
00:31:37,831 --> 00:31:38,955
It's insane.

232
00:31:38,956 --> 00:31:40,706
He sounds quite serious.

233
00:31:41,164 --> 00:31:42,831
It sounds like an imminent disaster.

234
00:31:42,832 --> 00:31:46,081
The Great Procreator...
sounds like it's their master.

235
00:31:46,206 --> 00:31:49,413
And he is somewhere in
the Circumscribing Ocean.

236
00:31:49,414 --> 00:31:51,623
We must go with them!

237
00:32:21,164 --> 00:32:23,081
Unbelievable!

238
00:32:23,956 --> 00:32:26,123
It has been unbelievable
since the very beginning.

239
00:32:26,124 --> 00:32:28,998
They've taken their heads off?

240
00:32:29,873 --> 00:32:32,289
They've been told to disconnect,
they just obey.

241
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:49,123
Would you be able to swim that far?

242
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:51,498
I'll be there first!

243
00:33:49,290 --> 00:33:50,998
You're so much at home
in the sea.

244
00:33:52,956 --> 00:33:56,789
- And you swim like a siren.
- A siren?

245
00:33:57,331 --> 00:34:01,623
It's a creature from
the terresrial mythology.

246
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:06,290
An irresistable creature.

247
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:41,748
You whose will we obey,
whose orders we serve.

248
00:35:42,248 --> 00:35:45,539
Gandahar will become what
you want it to be.

249
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:48,456
Our attacks have been successful.

250
00:35:48,498 --> 00:35:53,622
Many Gandaharians have been transformed,
as you have ordered us.

251
00:35:53,623 --> 00:35:57,540
Soon the civilization of wasteful pleasure
will disappear forever.

252
00:35:57,623 --> 00:36:04,706
And now, men of metal, be ready to draw strength
from the substance of the Great Procreator.

253
00:36:05,081 --> 00:36:08,290
LONG LIVE THE GREAT PROCREATOR.

254
00:36:08,748 --> 00:36:11,123
Why doesn't the Great
Procreator say anything?

255
00:36:11,581 --> 00:36:13,623
Gods rarely respond.

256
00:36:13,665 --> 00:36:15,831
That's because they do not exist.

257
00:36:19,290 --> 00:36:22,415
These things...
They can take us too...

258
00:36:23,498 --> 00:36:25,206
They will catch us!

259
00:36:33,498 --> 00:36:35,040
Sylvain!

260
00:37:12,915 --> 00:37:17,080
The body that contains us
doesn't know ours.

261
00:37:17,081 --> 00:37:19,247
Those, who inhabit us,
are inhabited in turn.

262
00:37:19,248 --> 00:37:25,415
And all these bodies, one inside another,
are the body of Eternity.

263
00:37:25,790 --> 00:37:27,456
What is it?

264
00:37:27,873 --> 00:37:30,498
A terrestrial poem
that I like a lot.

265
00:38:03,790 --> 00:38:05,665
Hello Sylvain!

266
00:38:05,706 --> 00:38:07,664
Who is speaking?

267
00:38:08,081 --> 00:38:09,749
You know very well.

268
00:38:09,915 --> 00:38:14,498
Is it you, the boss, the god of the metalic
carcasses who worship you?

269
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:17,497
Neither boss, not god,
even though it's true...

270
00:38:17,498 --> 00:38:20,580
that they worship me as a god,
whereas I am only a...

271
00:38:20,581 --> 00:38:21,915
Murderer!

272
00:38:23,165 --> 00:38:27,290
If I were what you think I am,
how would you still be alive?

273
00:38:27,623 --> 00:38:29,623
Think about it.

274
00:38:29,998 --> 00:38:35,957
I know what you're after,
and yet I allowed you to approach me,

275
00:38:35,999 --> 00:38:39,956
and even to insult me.
Don't you find it a bit odd?

276
00:38:39,957 --> 00:38:41,998
Are you or are you not
the master of the metal men?

277
00:38:41,999 --> 00:38:43,455
That's what they think.

278
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:46,331
Are they obeing your orders?

279
00:38:46,332 --> 00:38:50,415
They think they have received them, and
sometimes I even believe I've given them.

280
00:38:51,623 --> 00:38:55,039
Who are you with in this war
of extermination?

281
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:58,915
It would be physically unpleasant for me,
should the men of metal fail.

282
00:38:58,957 --> 00:39:02,082
And yet I would not like
to see Gandahar die.

283
00:39:02,124 --> 00:39:04,413
It must be on account of
my sentimental disposition.

284
00:39:04,414 --> 00:39:05,457
That's admirable.

285
00:39:05,458 --> 00:39:12,290
Yes, children of Jasper! We're cousins,
in a sense. I am the Metamorphis.

286
00:39:16,290 --> 00:39:17,623
"Who are you?"

287
00:39:17,873 --> 00:39:19,123
"Airelle."

288
00:39:20,123 --> 00:39:22,123
"Your name is as beautiful as you are."

289
00:39:22,914 --> 00:39:25,832
"And you? What's your name?"

290
00:39:26,207 --> 00:39:28,165
"What's your name?"

291
00:39:30,332 --> 00:39:32,206
"You are so much at home
in the sea."

292
00:39:33,498 --> 00:39:35,414
"And you swim like a siren."

293
00:39:35,416 --> 00:39:36,832
"A siren?"

294
00:39:37,415 --> 00:39:39,956
"An irresistible creature."

295
00:39:39,957 --> 00:39:42,039
"No... Syl!"

296
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:43,830
"Don't touch it, Airelle!"

297
00:39:43,832 --> 00:39:48,789
I've just looked in her dreams.
It seems she only dreams of you.

298
00:39:48,790 --> 00:39:51,374
That's something that a brain
would have a hard time understanding.

299
00:39:51,749 --> 00:39:54,123
You are just a brain, Metamorphis,
aren't you?

300
00:39:55,123 --> 00:39:57,331
One that regrets to be living...

301
00:39:57,456 --> 00:40:00,123
If you're saying you yourself
have been born in Gandahar,

302
00:40:00,124 --> 00:40:04,373
why would you not help us? We wouldn't
manage on our own against the men of metal.

303
00:40:04,374 --> 00:40:06,832
With all the power you have, you wouldn't
be spending your effort in vain!

304
00:40:06,833 --> 00:40:08,665
In vain!

305
00:40:09,248 --> 00:40:13,790
Sylvain!.. That's how it may seem.

306
00:40:13,874 --> 00:40:19,123
But I must first understand
this connection between me and them!

307
00:40:20,290 --> 00:40:22,914
The connection that would make
their failure physically unpleasant.

308
00:40:22,915 --> 00:40:24,916
I told you that I have to think!

309
00:40:32,248 --> 00:40:34,872
He didn't promise anything,
only told us that he has to think.

310
00:40:34,873 --> 00:40:38,873
But it's already unbelievable
that he didn't kill us.

311
00:40:38,874 --> 00:40:42,665
And let us go back to Jasper,
and even helped us with it.

312
00:42:23,957 --> 00:42:26,748
The wings are getting
less and less stretched.

313
00:42:26,790 --> 00:42:28,541
And less and less like wings.

314
00:42:47,457 --> 00:42:48,999
Look!

315
00:42:49,373 --> 00:42:52,040
Gandaharians flee from their homes.

316
00:42:52,998 --> 00:42:55,249
They hope to find refuge at Jasper.

317
00:43:00,249 --> 00:43:02,873
Syl! A mirror bird!

318
00:43:04,915 --> 00:43:07,124
It will spread the news of our arrival.

319
00:43:28,915 --> 00:43:31,083
This time, it's done for...

320
00:43:32,499 --> 00:43:34,832
Bye-bye, amorphous Metamorphis!

321
00:43:54,540 --> 00:43:55,707
And so?

322
00:43:55,708 --> 00:43:57,082
Far be it from me to say
I told you so...

323
00:43:57,084 --> 00:44:03,415
But the flying beast and the brain of
the metal men are of the same nature.

324
00:44:03,874 --> 00:44:07,373
The only difference is
the age of the cells.

325
00:44:07,958 --> 00:44:11,623
It's a huge difference,
incomrehensible.

326
00:44:11,624 --> 00:44:13,999
And Metamorphis pretended he
didn't know anything.

327
00:44:14,165 --> 00:44:16,415
"I must find the relation."

328
00:44:16,874 --> 00:44:20,166
And here it is for you,
Metamorphis:

329
00:44:20,333 --> 00:44:22,124
These killers...

330
00:44:22,166 --> 00:44:24,291
these metallic beasts
are born of you.

331
00:47:20,291 --> 00:47:25,082
Nothing would stop them,
not even death.

332
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:31,706
"PRIORITY, PRIORITY...
AMBISEXTRA AND THE COUNCIL...

333
00:47:31,707 --> 00:47:35,374
TO THE CENTRAL LABORATORY..."

334
00:47:35,415 --> 00:47:41,083
"PRIORITY, PRIORITY...
AMBISEXTRA AND THE COUNCIL"

335
00:47:45,291 --> 00:47:47,539
Well, Blaminhor, any news?

336
00:47:47,541 --> 00:47:49,290
Perhaps I've figured it out...

337
00:47:49,332 --> 00:47:50,708
Have a look!

338
00:47:55,374 --> 00:48:00,082
"Jasper Department of Research."

339
00:48:00,665 --> 00:48:03,208
"Experiment: Biotype."

340
00:48:03,958 --> 00:48:06,958
"Code name: Metamorphis."

341
00:48:07,833 --> 00:48:11,707
"An experimental brain characterized
by extremely rapid growth."

342
00:48:12,332 --> 00:48:16,125
"During the experiment, its volume
doubled within a few days."

343
00:48:16,875 --> 00:48:20,999
"Originally, it had a capacity inferior
to the ordinary brain."

344
00:48:21,957 --> 00:48:24,374
"Due to its rapid growth,
Metamorphis had to be transferred...

345
00:48:24,375 --> 00:48:28,416
from the laboratory to a special platform
in the Circumscribing Ocean."

346
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:32,208
"The brain experienced profound changes."

347
00:48:33,291 --> 00:48:41,624
"It acquired its proper senses:
Vision, touch and others,"

348
00:48:42,708 --> 00:48:45,708
"of the kind unknown to us."

349
00:48:45,916 --> 00:48:47,541
Monstrous!

350
00:48:47,791 --> 00:48:52,750
"For reasons of security,
it was decided to stop the experiment."

351
00:48:53,250 --> 00:48:56,041
"But would it be possible
to destroy Metamorphis?"

352
00:48:57,374 --> 00:48:59,166
In the end...

353
00:48:59,749 --> 00:49:02,416
it was Metamorphis who
destroyed his creators.

354
00:49:02,666 --> 00:49:05,541
Jasper disengaged from
this kind of experiments,

355
00:49:05,666 --> 00:49:08,582
and the monster was abandoned
in the Circumscribing Ocean...

356
00:49:08,583 --> 00:49:10,124
Abandoned!

357
00:49:10,499 --> 00:49:15,165
And his cells continued to proliferate,
and formed the brains of the metal men.

358
00:49:15,166 --> 00:49:21,499
Thus, Gandahar produced
its own mortal enemy.

359
00:49:51,124 --> 00:49:53,624
They disconnect at night.

360
00:49:53,749 --> 00:49:57,540
It's of no use.
Sylvain, you must kill Metamorphis!

361
00:49:57,541 --> 00:50:01,208
Wait. Metamorphis let us
go back to Jasper,

362
00:50:02,124 --> 00:50:06,417
It's a proof that he does not support the
metal men, and is not looking to our demise.

363
00:50:07,375 --> 00:50:10,333
We must talk to him.

364
00:50:10,375 --> 00:50:12,041
And if he doesn't listen?

365
00:50:12,791 --> 00:50:14,124
I'll kill him.

366
00:50:14,333 --> 00:50:15,415
How?

367
00:50:15,416 --> 00:50:17,624
I've been working on this problem.

368
00:50:20,166 --> 00:50:21,583
It seems I've solved it.

369
00:50:23,208 --> 00:50:25,833
One injection must suffice.

370
00:51:51,874 --> 00:51:53,249
I've been waiting for you.

371
00:51:53,291 --> 00:51:56,582
Monster... liar!

372
00:51:57,708 --> 00:51:59,083
You know that the metal men are...

373
00:51:59,084 --> 00:52:05,041
I know what you want to say:
That the men of metal are my tools.

374
00:52:05,083 --> 00:52:07,291
I also know something that you don't.

375
00:52:07,499 --> 00:52:09,416
They come from the future!

376
00:52:09,582 --> 00:52:13,207
I've seen them in action.
They petrify everything living,

377
00:52:13,208 --> 00:52:16,498
imprison it in cells, and
convert it into faceless monsters.

378
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:18,999
You must understand something.

379
00:52:19,666 --> 00:52:21,457
Do you want to save Jasper?

380
00:52:22,124 --> 00:52:23,625
Do you want to kill me?

381
00:52:23,792 --> 00:52:26,500
Leave that ridiculous syringe alone
and listen.

382
00:52:26,875 --> 00:52:31,416
I repeat:
This invasion is coming from the future.

383
00:52:31,499 --> 00:52:33,540
It's absurd!
Unbelievable!

384
00:52:33,541 --> 00:52:37,082
What do you know of time,
of its continuity,

385
00:52:37,083 --> 00:52:43,208
its traps, its false perspectives, its
apparent paradoxes, its relation to space!

386
00:52:44,124 --> 00:52:47,000
So Jasper is a victim of an invasion
that has not yet occured.

387
00:52:47,292 --> 00:52:49,125
It's nonsense!

388
00:52:49,292 --> 00:52:56,041
That's our logic. The invasion has occured even
though it might be coming from the future.

389
00:52:56,416 --> 00:52:58,415
- And how?
- Through a door.

390
00:52:58,416 --> 00:52:59,957
A door?

391
00:52:59,958 --> 00:53:02,042
The Door of Time!

392
00:53:02,333 --> 00:53:05,000
You've seen it,
yet you didn't understand it.

393
00:53:05,750 --> 00:53:09,290
Can you go both ways through
this Door of Time?

394
00:53:09,291 --> 00:53:10,999
As with any door...

395
00:53:11,750 --> 00:53:14,333
So the cells with the prisoners
are carried into the future.

396
00:53:15,042 --> 00:53:16,333
Why, Metamorphis?

397
00:53:16,334 --> 00:53:18,332
I don't know it yet.

398
00:53:18,333 --> 00:53:19,916
Give me a proof of your good will!

399
00:53:19,958 --> 00:53:24,125
A proof? You there,
you're alive.

400
00:53:25,167 --> 00:53:27,582
I could destroy you the moment you came!

401
00:53:27,583 --> 00:53:30,750
But the truth is I've been looking
for this encounter as much as you did.

402
00:53:31,291 --> 00:53:32,375
Is it a new trap?

403
00:53:32,416 --> 00:53:34,915
It's not a trap yet, Syl.

404
00:53:34,916 --> 00:53:39,999
But it will become one,
and I would not like to be caught in it.

405
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:44,374
I do not want to become an insane tyrant
ruling over an army of killers.

406
00:53:44,375 --> 00:53:50,167
I want you, Sylvain, to overcome me
in a thousand years!

407
00:53:50,750 --> 00:53:51,999
Why not now?

408
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:56,916
Because I do not want it,
and you're not capable of it.

409
00:53:57,083 --> 00:53:59,083
I am not vulnerable.

410
00:53:59,583 --> 00:54:01,209
Not yet.

411
00:54:01,959 --> 00:54:03,833
We'll see in a thousand years.

412
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,999
It's imposible. I'll be dead!

413
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,541
Over these thousand years,
you'll be neither dead nor alive,

414
00:54:08,542 --> 00:54:11,499
but hibernating
at the bottom of the ocean.

415
00:54:11,999 --> 00:54:14,584
On the appointed day,
on the appointed hour,

416
00:54:14,625 --> 00:54:18,457
you'll awake, just as you're now:
Young, strong, determined.

417
00:54:18,458 --> 00:54:23,708
You will try to overcome the old
Metamorphis and his army of metal men.

418
00:54:24,166 --> 00:54:28,250
If you succeed, Jasper will be saved!

419
00:54:28,833 --> 00:54:31,208
And I will stay a prisoner of the future.

420
00:54:31,833 --> 00:54:36,623
Exiled from my time,
away from those I love.

421
00:54:36,624 --> 00:54:39,459
A mere professional risk,
I would say.

422
00:54:39,917 --> 00:54:43,625
But you still have a chance
to return to the present.

423
00:54:44,042 --> 00:54:46,458
The Door of Time.

424
00:54:47,083 --> 00:54:49,458
The Door of Time.

425
00:55:20,917 --> 00:55:22,916
No news from Sylvain?

426
00:55:22,958 --> 00:55:24,540
We've completely lost contact.

427
00:55:24,541 --> 00:55:27,624
The Council considers Sylvain's mission
to have failed.

428
00:55:27,666 --> 00:55:28,792
For what reason?

429
00:55:28,793 --> 00:55:31,750
We can't afford waiting longer,
there is no hope.

430
00:55:31,792 --> 00:55:33,125
Wait!

431
00:55:33,833 --> 00:55:35,624
Wait a bit longer.

432
00:55:35,625 --> 00:55:37,999
How do you know that Syl
has failed.

433
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:41,041
If he did succeed, the metal men
would have stopped killing.

434
00:55:41,042 --> 00:55:42,917
It doesn't have to be so simple.

435
00:55:46,458 --> 00:55:53,459
Syl... Hurry up, my darling,
please hurry up...

436
00:56:03,916 --> 00:56:08,708
Are the Deformed going to resign
to being destroyed by the metal men?

437
00:56:08,833 --> 00:56:11,957
We were will be capable
of fighting and winning...

438
00:56:11,958 --> 00:56:15,125
Winning?
Winning what?

439
00:56:15,166 --> 00:56:20,541
For us, the war is going on inside
of our bodies, forever, without victory.

440
00:56:20,542 --> 00:56:23,332
Then it was will be death without struggle?

441
00:56:23,333 --> 00:56:29,166
No Shayol, no.
Here is our struggle!

442
00:57:48,167 --> 00:57:52,167
We have succeeded,
but not for long.

443
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:57,834
Our power has its limits.

444
00:57:57,875 --> 00:57:59,917
We could use this power to help Jasper.

445
00:57:59,918 --> 00:58:02,167
They never helped us.

446
00:58:03,542 --> 00:58:09,334
They have never acknowledged our existence,
never until now.

447
00:58:11,125 --> 00:58:14,625
In the face of deadly menace,
everything changes quickly.

448
00:58:15,250 --> 00:58:19,541
Gandahar must remember that
the Deformed are its own children.

449
01:01:53,626 --> 01:01:58,625
Oh, mirror birds, the guarding birds,
the birds of vision,

450
01:01:59,250 --> 01:02:02,375
deliver us from the
impending destruction.

451
01:02:02,708 --> 01:02:05,209
Take Jasper away from the ground.

452
01:02:06,084 --> 01:02:09,459
Farewell, Gandahar!
We've been so happy living here.

453
01:02:59,959 --> 01:03:07,209
In a thousand years, Gandahar was
destroyed, and all its people killed.

454
01:03:08,126 --> 01:03:15,292
A thousand years ago, Gandahar will be
saved, and what can't be avoided will be.

455
01:03:16,042 --> 01:03:23,542
IN A THOUSAND YEARS, GANDAHAR WAS
DESTROYED, AND ALL ITS PEOPLE KILLED.

456
01:03:23,834 --> 01:03:31,709
A THOUSAND YEARS AGO, GANDAHAR WILL BE
SAVED, AND WHAT CAN'T BE AVOIDED WILL BE.

457
01:04:43,292 --> 01:04:45,210
Here I am, Metamorphis.

458
01:04:46,251 --> 01:04:48,126
The thousand years have passed.

459
01:04:49,209 --> 01:04:52,917
I awoke on the appointed day
on the appointed hour, as you wanted.

460
01:04:52,959 --> 01:04:55,667
And I will now do what you wanted.

461
01:06:00,710 --> 01:06:05,084
Who are you?
Were you will be from Gandahar?

462
01:06:05,126 --> 01:06:08,792
I were will be. And you were
will be my friends.

463
01:06:08,959 --> 01:06:13,042
Syl, the warrior, I know you!

464
01:06:13,043 --> 01:06:15,001
I know you too!

465
01:06:15,543 --> 01:06:20,042
We met during my first mission,
a thousand years ago.

466
01:06:24,585 --> 01:06:28,917
A thousand years or one day...

467
01:06:28,918 --> 01:06:32,501
it doesn't matter once you've
passed through the Door of Time.

468
01:06:33,292 --> 01:06:38,418
Turned into stone, imprisoned inside
a cell, brought into the future.

469
01:06:39,210 --> 01:06:42,459
Then converted into something else
altogether.

470
01:06:42,709 --> 01:06:44,751
They sorted us when we arrived...

471
01:06:45,501 --> 01:06:49,084
the normal to one side,
the monstrous to the other.

472
01:06:49,085 --> 01:06:55,376
We monstrous ones, the lucky ones,
were found unusable, unrecoverable.

473
01:06:55,626 --> 01:07:00,250
They relegated us to the underworld,
just like at Jasper.

474
01:07:10,126 --> 01:07:11,626
And the others?

475
01:07:11,667 --> 01:07:14,793
The Gandaharians with beautiful faces
and perfect bodies?

476
01:07:14,835 --> 01:07:16,418
Yes, those who looked like me.

477
01:07:17,293 --> 01:07:20,751
For once they had to regret
they didn't look like us.

478
01:07:21,001 --> 01:07:22,459
Were they systematically
exterminated?

479
01:07:22,501 --> 01:07:25,875
Worse than that,
you'd better not know about it.

480
01:07:25,876 --> 01:07:27,460
But I have to know!

481
01:07:29,335 --> 01:07:31,751
I have to understand,
so that I can stop these horrors.

482
01:07:31,793 --> 01:07:36,376
Soldier, no one doubts
your courage and your qualities.

483
01:07:36,667 --> 01:07:39,210
But how would you overcome such power?

484
01:07:50,502 --> 01:07:52,126
Where are we?

485
01:07:52,335 --> 01:07:55,043
In the city of the metal men!

486
01:07:55,584 --> 01:07:57,376
Don't you recognize it?

487
01:07:57,668 --> 01:08:01,917
Nothing existed around Metamorpus
except the Circumscribing Ocean.

488
01:08:02,668 --> 01:08:04,043
Now it is all covered by metal.

489
01:08:04,085 --> 01:08:06,585
Other than the Door of Time,
everything has changed.

490
01:08:20,251 --> 01:08:22,793
Still more prisoners.

491
01:08:23,418 --> 01:08:26,501
The machine draws all life away from them.

492
01:08:29,043 --> 01:08:30,918
I must see them.

493
01:08:49,542 --> 01:08:52,001
How can you imagine such horror.

494
01:08:52,002 --> 01:08:53,834
And such absurdity!

495
01:08:53,835 --> 01:08:57,251
Such a complicated system of
extermination.

496
01:08:57,376 --> 01:08:59,751
On the contrary,
it's terrifyingly logical.

497
01:09:00,543 --> 01:09:02,292
A thousand years have passed.

498
01:09:02,751 --> 01:09:05,877
Metamorphis has become very old,
and his cells no longer reproduce.

499
01:09:07,001 --> 01:09:10,750
To continue living,
he needs new cells.

500
01:09:10,751 --> 01:09:14,458
Then, all the petrification, the egg-shaped
prisons, the Door of Time are necessary...

501
01:09:14,459 --> 01:09:17,043
to deliver the precious substance
and keep it intact.

502
01:09:17,044 --> 01:09:19,626
Intact, until it is needed.

503
01:09:38,043 --> 01:09:42,709
The invasion of metal men who ravaged
the planet, it comes from Metamorphis.

504
01:09:42,710 --> 01:09:48,085
And what if Metamorphis has changed into
metal, as everything that surrounds us?

505
01:09:48,168 --> 01:09:51,542
It used to be something else...

506
01:09:51,543 --> 01:09:54,918
We can show it to you!

507
01:10:03,376 --> 01:10:09,918
Dead cells... aglomerated...
fossilized.

508
01:10:11,668 --> 01:10:14,708
Degenerate cells of Metamorphis...
what could have happened to them?

509
01:10:14,709 --> 01:10:16,168
We don't know much about it.

510
01:10:16,169 --> 01:10:20,627
Other than that they metallize
with aging.

511
01:10:22,293 --> 01:10:24,793
Metamorphis is afraid of what's happening.

512
01:10:25,626 --> 01:10:27,293
That's why he wants me to kill him.

513
01:10:27,294 --> 01:10:29,001
He wanted!

514
01:10:29,084 --> 01:10:32,168
How do you know he would still honor
your agreement from a thosand years ago?

515
01:10:32,169 --> 01:10:33,668
I'll take the risk...

516
01:10:34,085 --> 01:10:35,251
I have no other choice.

517
01:10:35,253 --> 01:10:37,626
You have allies...

518
01:10:37,751 --> 01:10:40,375
We'll be able to help you.
We'll attack...

519
01:10:40,376 --> 01:10:44,668
the highest priority reservoir,
which feeds Metamorphis.

520
01:10:44,877 --> 01:10:47,127
Once disconnected,
Metamorphis will quickly loose strength.

521
01:10:47,128 --> 01:10:49,376
We must also free the prisoners.

522
01:10:51,001 --> 01:10:57,502
But let's first take care
of the metal men.

523
01:13:55,252 --> 01:13:59,709
You can now leave me.
It's a personal appointment.

524
01:13:59,710 --> 01:14:01,960
- I'll go with you.
- No.

525
01:14:02,752 --> 01:14:04,335
It's personal.

526
01:16:18,961 --> 01:16:21,085
It's the beginning of the end,
Metamorphis.

527
01:16:21,502 --> 01:16:23,877
Don't try to bury me too soon,
soldier...

528
01:16:24,085 --> 01:16:30,210
Those cells keep falling off like scales,
leaving me a way to recover.

529
01:16:30,211 --> 01:16:34,669
And they are replaced by new ones
all the way to infinity.

530
01:16:35,169 --> 01:16:37,335
It's an infinity of killing.

531
01:16:38,585 --> 01:16:40,875
This substance is the substance
of your victims.

532
01:16:40,876 --> 01:16:42,044
It's a very practical system!

533
01:16:42,045 --> 01:16:46,209
You asked me to kill you
in a thousand years.

534
01:16:46,210 --> 01:16:48,876
I've never proposed anything
so ridiculous!

535
01:16:48,877 --> 01:16:50,335
It looks like your memory
weakened with age!

536
01:16:50,336 --> 01:16:54,127
I haven't aged...
I'll never age!

537
01:16:54,586 --> 01:16:57,334
- And you've come to kill me?
- Yes, I've come to kill you!

538
01:16:57,336 --> 01:17:00,127
As I was asked by the Metamorphis,
when he was still in his right mind.

539
01:17:01,668 --> 01:17:06,001
Looks like the sages of Jasper
put all their wisdom into one syringe...

540
01:17:06,085 --> 01:17:08,085
The ultimate weapon!

541
01:17:08,086 --> 01:17:11,960
Why don't we test it?
On you, for example.

542
01:17:25,294 --> 01:17:27,085
The reservoir is out!

543
01:17:27,877 --> 01:17:29,585
I am losing the left hemisphere.

544
01:17:29,835 --> 01:17:31,461
Alarm for all posts!

545
01:17:32,002 --> 01:17:33,419
Double security!

546
01:17:33,711 --> 01:17:36,502
Mobilize the reserves!

547
01:17:37,377 --> 01:17:39,793
I am calling to all posts!

548
01:17:45,794 --> 01:17:47,919
How quiet...

549
01:17:49,127 --> 01:17:51,502
silence...

550
01:17:53,377 --> 01:17:56,086
complete silence...

551
01:17:57,669 --> 01:18:01,209
why is the sun black this morning?

552
01:18:01,210 --> 01:18:06,001
the snow is falling,
it covers the ground...

553
01:18:06,002 --> 01:18:08,211
it covers everything...

554
01:18:08,336 --> 01:18:10,335
the pain subsides...

555
01:18:10,336 --> 01:18:12,669
and the fatigue...

556
01:18:15,669 --> 01:18:18,335
that dream...

557
01:18:20,043 --> 01:18:23,127
the dream of explosion...

558
01:18:23,419 --> 01:18:26,669
of a roaring explosion.

559
01:18:35,044 --> 01:18:36,960
Men of Metal, obey my orders!

560
01:18:36,961 --> 01:18:40,127
Destroy the Door of Time!

561
01:18:40,877 --> 01:18:44,335
Who opened the back doors
of my memory?

562
01:18:44,877 --> 01:18:49,794
Everything is mixed...
Everything is in disorder...

563
01:18:50,877 --> 01:18:55,002
why did you do it to me?

564
01:18:55,127 --> 01:18:58,878
Sylvain, Sylvain...

565
01:19:01,169 --> 01:19:04,794
it's too late for the present...

566
01:19:06,419 --> 01:19:11,794
no... no... not alone
in this freezing ocean...

567
01:19:13,794 --> 01:19:15,876
I am also a child of Gandahar...

568
01:19:15,877 --> 01:19:18,752
wait for me,
wait for me...

569
01:20:30,836 --> 01:20:33,376
Why did we then have to kill
the Metamorphis?

570
01:20:33,377 --> 01:20:35,044
Gandahar is in ruins.

571
01:20:35,085 --> 01:20:40,503
Jasper is decapitated, and its people are
petrified or lost somewhere in the future.

572
01:20:41,044 --> 01:20:43,211
We can find them.

573
01:20:43,711 --> 01:20:46,127
When?
In a thousand years?

574
01:20:46,877 --> 01:20:48,460
Mirror bird!

575
01:20:55,169 --> 01:20:57,127
Jasper has been saved?!
