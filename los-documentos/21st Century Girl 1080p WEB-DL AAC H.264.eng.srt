00:00:09,046 --> 00:00:13,751
"<i>Defiant short films
dedicated to girls in the 21st century</i>"

2
00:00:24,125 --> 00:00:29,083
"<i>Each must bring up some issue regarding
sexuality or gender</i>"

3
00:01:02,375 --> 00:01:03,765
You know what?

4
00:01:04,125 --> 00:01:07,125
Watch out for guys with David's profile.

5
00:01:07,585 --> 00:01:10,918
And bald men and men growing their hair.

6
00:01:11,656 --> 00:01:13,893
They think women like DV.

7
00:01:13,918 --> 00:01:15,417
They make me sick.

8
00:01:15,542 --> 00:01:17,584
They should just die.

9
00:01:17,747 --> 00:01:19,523
All of them!

10
00:01:25,209 --> 00:01:31,109
(Anytime, Anywhere)

11
00:01:31,134 --> 00:01:33,201
Please, Mom Ling Xiao!

12
00:01:33,225 --> 00:01:36,389
Don't bring such a scary thing in here.

13
00:01:36,782 --> 00:01:38,554
Oh sorry, Tenko.

14
00:01:40,031 --> 00:01:43,601
Hey, Motoshi is telling me that...

15
00:01:43,626 --> 00:01:47,514
as a woman my body has to be always clean.

16
00:01:47,539 --> 00:01:50,623
So I take a bath twice a day.

17
00:01:51,349 --> 00:01:53,318
My body is so spongy now.

18
00:01:54,304 --> 00:01:56,820
Is your brother in Fukei?

19
00:01:57,265 --> 00:01:59,045
He's already out.

20
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:01,537
Mommy, what is "Fukei"?

21
00:02:01,562 --> 00:02:05,578
It's a big and cool looking prison in Tokyo.

22
00:02:05,951 --> 00:02:06,898
I want to go!

23
00:02:07,937 --> 00:02:11,967
As freshmen, some friends stayed at my place.

24
00:02:11,991 --> 00:02:14,302
Taki was sleeping next to me.

25
00:02:14,327 --> 00:02:16,607
He touched my boobs.

26
00:02:16,632 --> 00:02:22,771
I've never experienced groping,
but that kind of thing happens sometimes.

27
00:02:22,796 --> 00:02:28,892
After Taki, it was Hijiri, Shindo,
Funaki, and a co-worker.

28
00:02:28,917 --> 00:02:30,584
And Taki again.

29
00:02:30,609 --> 00:02:35,804
I have small tits, so my boyfriend
doesn't touch mine even during sex.

30
00:02:36,976 --> 00:02:39,280
You don't need to name everyone.

31
00:02:39,304 --> 00:02:42,912
If you wanna say you're popular,
just say it.

32
00:02:43,625 --> 00:02:48,625
It's just some regular guys
happened to be close to your boobs.

33
00:02:49,347 --> 00:02:52,445
Say "My boobs are my identify."

34
00:02:53,218 --> 00:02:56,898
I hope Taki won't leave yours
in the future.

35
00:02:57,179 --> 00:02:59,058
For you, mommy.

36
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:03,326
If a guy doesn't touch small boobs...

37
00:03:03,351 --> 00:03:05,914
he just wanna ejaculate.

38
00:03:06,414 --> 00:03:07,248
Is that fine?

39
00:03:07,273 --> 00:03:08,357
Is that fine?

40
00:03:09,849 --> 00:03:13,312
Of course I feel empty.

41
00:03:14,979 --> 00:03:18,750
When he's pumping hard,
he is looking at space.

42
00:03:19,938 --> 00:03:24,257
Not at me. Near climax,
he is completely in space.

43
00:03:25,122 --> 00:03:28,156
When he comes, he goes beyond it.

44
00:03:28,453 --> 00:03:31,851
A black hole sucks him.
I just look at it.

45
00:03:32,156 --> 00:03:34,732
Space is far away, mommy.

46
00:03:34,757 --> 00:03:36,273
Yes, it is.

47
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:38,398
It is.

48
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:44,416
Itsuka, does your BF give you tissue
after sex?

49
00:03:45,242 --> 00:03:50,343
My BF, Kato, only wipes his
and sleeps as soon as he's done.

50
00:03:50,875 --> 00:03:56,546
I normally play online games and wait
till I feel sleepy. About an hour.

51
00:03:57,562 --> 00:04:00,671
Because it gets dry out while playing game,

52
00:04:01,304 --> 00:04:03,937
I don't need tissue. Ecological.

53
00:04:05,867 --> 00:04:09,559
Tissue paper issue.
Mine used to give some.

54
00:04:09,867 --> 00:04:13,203
I only go out with guys who clean my body.

55
00:04:14,085 --> 00:04:15,875
I'd rather do it myself.

56
00:04:16,445 --> 00:04:17,531
Every guy does.

57
00:04:18,065 --> 00:04:19,914
What is tissue paper issue?

58
00:04:20,986 --> 00:04:25,210
Whether you can get tissue paper
from a guy after sex.

59
00:04:26,078 --> 00:04:28,648
I don't. Do you all get some?

60
00:04:29,078 --> 00:04:31,701
If not, I don't feel I'm loved.

61
00:04:31,992 --> 00:04:36,426
Many stupid men don't think
women need tissue paper.

62
00:04:36,857 --> 00:04:37,984
Love...

63
00:04:40,068 --> 00:04:41,484
Mommy Shiino?

64
00:04:41,625 --> 00:04:43,453
What?

65
00:04:44,187 --> 00:04:46,437
Do you get tissue or get wiped?

66
00:04:46,865 --> 00:04:49,203
Yeah, I do.

67
00:04:53,573 --> 00:04:56,484
I heard Americans don't use tissue.

68
00:04:56,828 --> 00:04:58,748
What do they do?

69
00:04:58,773 --> 00:04:59,898
Just leave it?

70
00:05:01,714 --> 00:05:03,789
They don't find it sexy.

71
00:05:03,982 --> 00:05:05,665
Men and women?

72
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:07,046
I think so.

73
00:05:14,757 --> 00:05:20,251
Has anyone suddenly felt
like crying at night?

74
00:05:20,276 --> 00:05:21,250
No.

75
00:05:21,929 --> 00:05:22,901
Yeah.

76
00:05:22,926 --> 00:05:24,687
Yeah.

77
00:05:24,712 --> 00:05:26,398
Absolutely yeah.

78
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:28,421
I don't know.

79
00:05:29,893 --> 00:05:32,225
No, nothing is absolute.

80
00:05:33,589 --> 00:05:35,859
We all die at the end for sure.

81
00:05:36,515 --> 00:05:37,820
We die alone.

82
00:05:39,171 --> 00:05:44,250
Only that is absolute...
The word "absolute" is only for that.

83
00:05:45,364 --> 00:05:47,289
Absolute exists only for that.

84
00:06:02,344 --> 00:06:05,203
Mothers, don't you eat chicken?

85
00:07:00,821 --> 00:07:04,164
She is sleeping again. Look, Shiino.

86
00:07:05,628 --> 00:07:08,628
She again fell asleep while eating.

87
00:07:10,421 --> 00:07:15,523
Pigeons will poke your face.
You're drooling.

88
00:07:15,899 --> 00:07:18,039
So true.

89
00:07:25,644 --> 00:07:26,687
Here it is.

90
00:07:29,595 --> 00:07:31,178
Tastes good.

91
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:38,829
What time did you sleep last night?
You slept late.

92
00:07:40,247 --> 00:07:43,179
You rolled your eyes up sometimes.

93
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,137
Morning.

94
00:07:45,162 --> 00:07:46,867
Chinese muffin.

95
00:07:47,957 --> 00:07:49,140
Muffin?

96
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:51,500
What are you saying?

97
00:08:03,585 --> 00:08:08,460
(Anytime, Anywhere)

98
00:08:16,414 --> 00:08:21,203
(Anytime, Anywhere)

99
00:09:02,086 --> 00:09:07,273
<i>Mucous Membrane covers a hollow organ

100
00:09:32,271 --> 00:09:33,355
Excuse me.

101
00:09:34,834 --> 00:09:36,210
Can I have a light?

102
00:10:14,425 --> 00:10:21,092
(Mucous Membrane)

103
00:10:42,512 --> 00:10:44,875
Don't fall asleep during work.

104
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:47,725
I didn't get any sleep.

105
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:49,484
You had a guy over, right?

106
00:10:50,053 --> 00:10:53,617
I didn't have one
and couldn't sleep at night.

107
00:10:53,810 --> 00:10:54,695
I see.

108
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:59,000
I went for a walk and found one.

109
00:10:59,696 --> 00:11:03,242
Tohko, you'll lose a lot some day.

110
00:11:03,789 --> 00:11:05,195
I won't.

111
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:08,453
It's stupid to lose something just for sex.

112
00:11:09,683 --> 00:11:10,687
Maybe.

113
00:11:13,356 --> 00:11:19,492
Hey, have you counted the number of hair
on a guy's toes?

114
00:11:21,985 --> 00:11:23,390
Why would I?

115
00:11:24,296 --> 00:11:29,656
I do whenever I get a new boyfriend.

116
00:11:30,058 --> 00:11:31,195
Why?

117
00:11:32,563 --> 00:11:34,000
I feel relieved.

118
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:39,131
I feel relieved to think
I'm the only one...

119
00:11:39,156 --> 00:11:42,976
that know the number of hair
on this guy's toes.

120
00:11:44,026 --> 00:11:49,086
I know that much,
but I've forgot how to have sex.

121
00:11:56,743 --> 00:11:59,218
Look, Aoba. Here's a snail.

122
00:12:00,295 --> 00:12:02,664
Wow. I hadn't seen one for a while.

123
00:12:05,906 --> 00:12:08,281
Is the whole body its erogenous zone?

124
00:12:09,264 --> 00:12:10,632
Maybe.

125
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:27,210
Oh, you are home.

126
00:12:27,636 --> 00:12:28,570
Hi.

127
00:12:31,221 --> 00:12:33,643
I bought our dinner.

128
00:12:33,668 --> 00:12:35,585
This is good for me.

129
00:12:43,646 --> 00:12:45,242
Don't worry.

130
00:12:47,403 --> 00:12:48,436
You know what?

131
00:12:49,492 --> 00:12:52,781
I wanna be a snail now.

132
00:12:55,765 --> 00:12:57,578
What? That's gross.

133
00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:39,812
What?

134
00:13:51,467 --> 00:13:53,625
Don't say that it's gross.

135
00:14:12,956 --> 00:14:14,187
I quit.

136
00:14:30,602 --> 00:14:32,226
I'm hungry.

137
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:36,000
Let's go have breakfast.

138
00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:42,679
I don't do that kind of thing.

139
00:14:46,412 --> 00:14:50,164
You are really different.

140
00:14:52,306 --> 00:14:56,117
No, I'm same as you.

141
00:14:58,613 --> 00:14:59,624
I'm off now.

142
00:15:38,946 --> 00:15:39,795
Hey.

143
00:15:42,169 --> 00:15:43,545
Can I call you again?

144
00:15:45,782 --> 00:15:46,537
No.

145
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:50,717
I will when I want it.

00:19:06,589 --> 00:19:09,984
Nobody will.
I shoot her movie instead.

170
00:19:10,009 --> 00:19:14,402
Don't. Don't post it on internet.
Give it to me.

171
00:19:39,003 --> 00:19:40,402
I'll be your cameraman.

172
00:19:54,102 --> 00:19:57,488
(We are extremely intimate.)

173

174
00:20:08,526 --> 00:20:10,152
After stripping underwears...

175
00:20:11,425 --> 00:20:16,105
she's indivisual, and I want to
touch her through photos.

176
00:20:23,218 --> 00:20:25,175
Tuck your hair behind the ear.

177
00:20:26,863 --> 00:20:28,011
Left.

178
00:20:36,685 --> 00:20:38,230
Look this way.

179
00:20:48,211 --> 00:20:50,339
Kanako, you are beautiful.

180
00:21:26,964 --> 00:21:28,152
Stand there.

181
00:21:41,547 --> 00:21:43,217
It's warm.

182
00:23:25,248 --> 00:23:29,334
That's the owner of Ikoi.
Didn't know he plays sports.

183
00:23:30,056 --> 00:23:30,936
Ikoi?

184
00:23:33,054 --> 00:23:35,045
It's a café I often go to.

185
00:23:48,529 --> 00:23:53,529

188
00:25:10,469 --> 00:25:13,740
Really? YES!!

189
00:25:46,492 --> 00:25:49,123
This is so nice.

190
00:25:49,148 --> 00:25:54,217
I had been waiting for this.

191
00:26:01,485 --> 00:26:02,842
<i>Something's wrong.</i>

192
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,061

00:26:07,789 --> 00:26:09,373
<i>Something's wrong.</i>

194
00:26:18,867 --> 00:26:20,842
Is romance like this?

195
00:26:20,867 --> 00:26:24,492
Mentally men are 7 years younger
than women.

196
00:26:24,517 --> 00:26:26,909
That's why men are immature.

197
00:26:26,934 --> 00:26:29,998
Aren't men maturer, smarter and stronger?

198
00:26:31,318 --> 00:26:32,411
I don't know.

199
00:26:32,436 --> 00:26:35,279
Isn't love more visible and valuable?

200
00:26:35,764 --> 00:26:41,272
It's just a way to kill time.
People label themselves and play with it.

201
00:26:41,887 --> 00:26:43,396
And what is value?

202
00:26:47,242 --> 00:26:48,623
I reckon that you're virgin.

203
00:26:53,259 --> 00:26:54,838
Had I expected too much?

204
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:56,170
Quick. Eat.

205
00:26:56,194 --> 00:26:57,355
Noodles are getting soggy.

206
00:26:57,569 --> 00:26:58,585
Quick.

207
00:27:00,803 --> 00:27:03,076
It doesn't suit you.

208

215
00:29:16,824 --> 00:29:17,803
No.

216

Thanks.

217

219

00:32:26,903 --> 00:32:29,188
Lara, are you up?

227
00:32:36,129 --> 00:32:38,563
I hate myself.

228
00:32:39,114 --> 00:32:41,149
I can't graduate.

229
00:32:42,476 --> 00:32:44,055
I can't finish it.

230
00:32:47,445 --> 00:32:50,107
(Out of Fashion)

231
00:32:50,132 --> 00:32:51,797
You are being sloppy.

232
00:32:52,414 --> 00:32:54,301
Look at yourself.

233
00:32:54,326 --> 00:32:56,201
I know. I'm sorry.

234
00:32:56,226 --> 00:33:01,742
"I know"? Nobody expects a charismatic
model to be this sloppy.

235
00:33:01,767 --> 00:33:03,350
They expect a lot.

236
00:33:03,375 --> 00:33:08,297
When are you getting a boyfriend?
You'll get old soon.

237
00:33:10,137 --> 00:33:11,305
You suck.

238
00:33:11,330 --> 00:33:13,058
Forget about "him."

239
00:33:13,083 --> 00:33:17,203
I want a guy who thinks I'm cute as I am.

240
00:33:19,263 --> 00:33:22,024
Is it a guy? It can't be.

241
00:33:22,461 --> 00:33:24,501
Why don't you wear a Zara?

242
00:33:30,801 --> 00:33:32,158
Modeling job?

243
00:33:32,183 --> 00:33:34,485
Yep, until the last train.

244
00:33:34,809 --> 00:33:37,922
You can't be sleeping. Drool!

245
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:40,434
Oh no.

246
00:33:42,617 --> 00:33:45,414
Oh? Weren't you making something pink?

247
00:33:46,899 --> 00:33:48,945
I tore it.

248
00:33:49,414 --> 00:33:51,248
It started to look uncool.

249
00:33:51,273 --> 00:33:53,102
Can you make it in time?

250
00:33:55,564 --> 00:33:57,352
Do you need me again?

251
00:33:59,489 --> 00:34:03,735
I'll marry you.
I'll try hard, so don't leave.

252
00:34:07,375 --> 00:34:09,473
You just announced your marrige,

253
00:34:09,793 --> 00:34:12,332
but your prince is here.

254
00:34:12,830 --> 00:34:15,055
What? Mr. Morita?

255
00:34:17,453 --> 00:34:20,336
<i>You are too generous to her.</i>

256
00:34:20,969 --> 00:34:23,467
<i>She'll get lost after graduating.</i>

257
00:34:23,984 --> 00:34:25,141
<i>I know.</i>

258
00:34:25,446 --> 00:34:28,864
<i>But I love the clothes she makes.</i>

259
00:34:29,659 --> 00:34:33,535
<i>She's like that,
but one day she'll be recognized.</i>

260
00:34:35,531 --> 00:34:38,836
You look totally different. I'm surprised.

261
00:34:40,789 --> 00:34:43,164
I'm not a student anymore.

262
00:34:44,063 --> 00:34:45,709
You're modelling now, right?

263
00:34:45,734 --> 00:34:46,875
Only a bit.

264
00:34:47,070 --> 00:34:48,406
Wanna go pro?

265
00:34:49,047 --> 00:34:50,367
Oh no. Never.

266
00:34:50,914 --> 00:34:53,789
I wanna build a brand with Miyu.

267
00:34:54,575 --> 00:34:56,727
Open to being an Influencer?

268
00:34:56,940 --> 00:35:00,489
You're popular, so I'll give you work.

269
00:35:01,951 --> 00:35:05,739
You can't be a designer,
graduating from this school.

270
00:35:09,147 --> 00:35:10,371
Is that so?

271
00:35:10,864 --> 00:35:16,364
Now I'm an e-commerce app designer,
influencer, influencer adviser,

272
00:35:16,389 --> 00:35:18,397
and brand producer.

273
00:35:19,413 --> 00:35:21,498
Thank God I noticed it.

274
00:35:22,507 --> 00:35:24,483
Schools are business too, anyway.

275
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:31,134
Few can land the dream job as designer
after paying high tuition fees.

276
00:35:31,159 --> 00:35:35,692
You should make connections
and start something new.

277
00:35:35,717 --> 00:35:38,759
Those who consider themselves cute...

278
00:35:38,784 --> 00:35:43,300
are not for making clothes
in the first place.

279
00:35:43,325 --> 00:35:45,850
You need to notice harsh reality.

280
00:35:46,684 --> 00:35:52,118
And girls who keep thinking like
students miss getting married.

281
00:35:52,151 --> 00:35:53,944
<i>Words are important.</i>

282
00:35:55,096 --> 00:35:57,569
<i>Your words can hurt me...</i>

283
00:35:58,684 --> 00:36:02,351
<i>or make me happy.
They could ruin my life.</i>

284
00:36:06,116 --> 00:36:08,421
He told me to go pro as a model.

285
00:36:09,171 --> 00:36:11,632
Then he'll give me work and clients.

286
00:36:12,467 --> 00:36:13,522
That's great.

287
00:36:13,803 --> 00:36:15,374
No. I turned it down.

288
00:36:15,673 --> 00:36:17,061
What? Why?

289
00:36:17,694 --> 00:36:19,585
I'm quitting modelling.

290
00:36:20,134 --> 00:36:23,734
I get hurt whenever somebody says
I'm ugly.

291
00:36:23,759 --> 00:36:27,569
And Mr. Morita has become soooo boring.

292
00:36:28,718 --> 00:36:33,093
He used to be so cool,
but today he kept preaching.

293
00:36:33,647 --> 00:36:35,733
It's just that he gave up.

294
00:36:36,559 --> 00:36:42,976
I again thought I should try my best
with you even if it's hard.

295
00:36:44,982 --> 00:36:46,327
You know what?

296
00:36:47,304 --> 00:36:50,913
I've been meaning to
tell you that I got a job.

297
00:36:53,213 --> 00:36:54,202
You got a job?

298
00:36:55,851 --> 00:36:57,811
You said we should build a brand.

299
00:36:59,554 --> 00:37:02,132
That's why I'm not looking for a job.

300
00:37:04,948 --> 00:37:06,983
Did you really wanna do it with me?

301
00:37:09,038 --> 00:37:12,996
Yes, of course, because...

302
00:37:13,021 --> 00:37:14,639
You can do it alone.

303
00:37:15,491 --> 00:37:19,384
You are charismatic and loved by everyone.

304
00:37:19,899 --> 00:37:22,577
You have your own way of winning.

305
00:37:23,330 --> 00:37:26,889
It's your talent
that you are blessed and loved.

306
00:37:29,523 --> 00:37:33,303
<i>Each has each speed of living...</i>

307
00:37:33,632 --> 00:37:36,960
<i>and balance of crash and prudence.</i>

308
00:37:36,985 --> 00:37:41,293
<i>The percentage of meeting
one soul is so low.</i>

309
00:37:41,318 --> 00:37:43,693
My Muse has been you.

310
00:37:43,718 --> 00:37:47,397
<i>I'm so bad at keeping balance.</i>

311
00:37:47,975 --> 00:37:51,671
<i>I might have ruined my own opportunities.</i>

312
00:37:52,311 --> 00:37:55,218
<i>I don't have reasons for my dreams.</i>

313
00:37:56,210 --> 00:37:59,678
<i>I just wanted to
live selfishly like kids.</i>

314
00:38:00,335 --> 00:38:06,718
<i>I don't wanna be given a time limit
for being a child.</i>

315
00:38:07,131 --> 00:38:11,194
<i>Instead, I'll be responsible for
my dreams.</i>

316
00:38:11,796 --> 00:38:13,702
<i>I had nothing from the start.</i>

317
00:38:14,637 --> 00:38:21,006
<i>I'm not smart enough to protect my pride
I've had, being ignorant.</i>

318
00:38:22,077 --> 00:38:24,944
<i>I kept forgetting what I'd decided.</i>

319
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:29,171
<i>I see spring flashing in front of me.</i>

320
00:38:30,991 --> 00:38:36,139
<i>I don't wanna forfeit love anymore,
so I won't tell anyone.</i>

321
00:38:48,061 --> 00:38:53,288
I got it. I was asked by Mr. Morita
to give this to Lara...

322
00:38:53,616 --> 00:38:55,792
to work as an influencer.

323
00:38:55,817 --> 00:38:58,775
We haven't seen her prince awhile.

324
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:02,800
She had lots going on
and didn't win any awards.

325
00:39:03,489 --> 00:39:05,031
Is she disappointed?

326
00:39:06,748 --> 00:39:08,233
Didn't seem like that.

327
00:39:08,715 --> 00:39:10,116
When did you see her?

328
00:39:14,992 --> 00:39:17,200
What?

329
00:39:19,147 --> 00:39:20,581
Well, Lara's...

330
00:39:20,606 --> 00:39:23,147
She made me buy this as an investment.

331
00:39:25,026 --> 00:39:27,366
So she won't do modeling job anymore?

332
00:39:28,148 --> 00:39:30,335
She can't help making something.

333
00:39:33,328 --> 00:39:35,328
I think so too.

334
00:39:39,637 --> 00:39:40,569
Hang in there.

335
00:39:42,818 --> 00:39:45,764
(Fashion Design College Entrance Ceremony)

336
00:41:29,804 --> 00:41:31,507
Morning.

337
00:41:36,257 --> 00:41:37,833
Don't eat that.

338
00:41:38,928 --> 00:41:40,654
Isn't it a big one?

339
00:41:40,679 --> 00:41:41,913
I'm just taking a small bite.

340
00:41:46,871 --> 00:41:48,171
I can't open this.

341
00:42:24,965 --> 00:42:26,139
I'm home.

342
00:42:37,077 --> 00:42:37,960
Saho.

343
00:42:42,343 --> 00:42:43,296
Saho.

344
00:43:56,829 --> 00:43:57,771
What's wrong?

345
00:48:08,470 --> 00:48:13,208
(Your Sheet)

346
00:48:25,482 --> 00:48:29,404
<i>Framed by the silver borders,
I simply stare.</i>

347
00:48:30,125 --> 00:48:31,919
<i>I project what it is...</i>

348
00:48:32,709 --> 00:48:36,005
<i>without agreeing with or denying it.</i>

349
00:48:36,117 --> 00:48:37,161
Stand up.

350
00:48:39,167 --> 00:48:40,263
Turn around.

351
00:48:44,459 --> 00:48:46,536
<i>I am not cruel.</i>

354
00:49:35,622 --> 00:49:37,435
Wasn't it from today?

355
00:49:40,084 --> 00:49:41,474
From tomorrow.

356
00:49:47,893 --> 00:49:48,958
Done for today.

357
00:49:50,833 --> 00:49:52,583
I wanted to hear your opinions.

358
00:49:53,295 --> 00:49:54,154
Tell me.

359
00:49:54,844 --> 00:49:55,818
I don't know.

360
00:49:56,949 --> 00:49:58,224
Come on.

361
00:49:58,810 --> 00:50:01,396
Give me some feedback.
Aren't you a teacher?

362
00:50:02,089 --> 00:50:05,779
Even students meet deadlines.
You should too, first.

363
00:50:09,299 --> 00:50:12,482
I am thinking about putting this there.

364
00:50:13,742 --> 00:50:16,388
You know I won't tell you my opinions.

365
00:50:18,068 --> 00:50:19,396
But you came here.

366
00:50:23,435 --> 00:50:24,529
It's been a while.

367
00:50:31,114 --> 00:50:32,365
Can we meet tomorrow?

368
00:50:34,549 --> 00:50:35,240
Yes.

369
00:50:36,521 --> 00:50:39,755
Let's have dinner together at my place.

370
00:50:46,577 --> 00:50:47,528
Your attitude.

371
00:50:50,250 --> 00:50:51,216
What?

372
00:50:55,010 --> 00:50:57,208
Are you seeing her?

373
00:50:58,202 --> 00:50:59,888
Why do you care?

374
00:51:02,815 --> 00:51:05,154
You wanted to hear my opinions.

375
00:51:08,403 --> 00:51:10,622
Your relationship is superficial.

376
00:51:12,305 --> 00:51:15,240
You are just pressing the button.

377
00:51:17,372 --> 00:51:19,122
You should remove this photo.

378
00:51:21,892 --> 00:51:23,646
Are you talking about us?

379
00:51:24,338 --> 00:51:30,372
No. I came here to tell you if you
are imitating the past, throw it away.

380
00:51:36,669 --> 00:51:38,482
Can I take your photos now?

381
00:51:38,970 --> 00:51:41,661
Before and After. How sensational.

382
00:51:42,593 --> 00:51:46,216
No photo has satisfied me since then.

383
00:51:50,013 --> 00:51:53,161
I need your help, Ayumu.

384
00:51:57,162 --> 00:52:01,427
<i>As you go close to water,
my face appears on it...</i>

385
00:52:01,862 --> 00:52:04,982
<i>saying you're only seeing yourself.</i>

386
00:52:19,491 --> 00:52:22,255
I told you about the poem.

387
00:52:30,076 --> 00:52:31,849
Look, I like it.

388
00:52:33,168 --> 00:52:34,472
This isn't me.

389
00:52:34,497 --> 00:52:35,497
It's you.

390
00:52:35,896 --> 00:52:37,177
You just hate me.

391
00:52:37,341 --> 00:52:37,949
No.

392
00:52:37,974 --> 00:52:39,075
You do.

393
00:52:39,100 --> 00:52:42,193
I didn't make our relationship clear.

394
00:52:42,431 --> 00:52:44,568
I don't care now.

395
00:52:51,357 --> 00:52:53,646
That must have caused problems.

396
00:52:53,912 --> 00:52:59,271
It still does. All of my students
know about you, too.

397
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:03,458
But I'm not blaming you.

398
00:53:04,675 --> 00:53:07,568
Because I did love you. It is true.

399
00:53:09,916 --> 00:53:11,279
Then what's this face?

400
00:53:13,109 --> 00:53:14,747
I'm feeling pity.

401
00:53:16,907 --> 00:53:20,661
Is this "projecting as it is"?

402
00:53:23,270 --> 00:53:24,318
I know.

403
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:26,169
It's short-sighted.

404
00:53:27,931 --> 00:53:33,090
But this is what people like,
what they want from me.

405
00:53:34,230 --> 00:53:36,226
Lesbian photographer.

406
00:53:37,901 --> 00:53:39,624
They aren't my words.

407
00:53:39,831 --> 00:53:42,483
You're taking advantage by not denying it.

408
00:53:43,289 --> 00:53:45,929
Have you ever truly loved anyone?

409
00:53:49,091 --> 00:53:51,765
For us, relationship came first.

410
00:53:52,031 --> 00:53:55,241
But you are seeing them for your photos.

411
00:53:56,577 --> 00:53:59,577
You can't take the real photos of me.

412
00:54:32,437 --> 00:54:33,710
I know.

413
00:54:42,026 --> 00:54:43,554
I loved you, Ayumu.

414
00:54:44,927 --> 00:54:47,991
I knew my photos tell that I'm lesbian.

415
00:54:49,572 --> 00:54:51,343
But what they see is everything,

416
00:54:52,015 --> 00:54:53,827
so I don't deny it.

417
00:54:55,765 --> 00:54:58,163
I did the same to be recognized.

418
00:54:59,750 --> 00:55:01,804
But no photo satisfies me now.

419
00:55:12,481 --> 00:55:13,343
I don't know.

420
00:55:17,450 --> 00:55:22,522
It's not that I love women, only you.

421
00:55:26,250 --> 00:55:27,366
What am I?

422
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:48,147
I'm not lying.

423
00:55:54,065 --> 00:55:55,163
Poor Nagisa.

424
00:55:57,120 --> 00:55:59,374
You cannot love anyone.

425
00:56:31,279 --> 00:56:33,077
It was very good tea.

426
00:56:41,240 --> 00:56:42,413
What is this?

427
00:56:44,392 --> 00:56:47,433
(Sex-less, Sex-friends)

428
00:56:53,489 --> 00:56:57,960
<i>We started with sex.</i>

429
00:56:59,434 --> 00:57:04,311
<i>But it's been 4 months
since we became sexless.</i>

430
00:57:05,017 --> 00:57:10,858
<i>I don't know what to call us.</i>

431
00:57:21,892 --> 00:57:23,819
Then how about this?

432
00:57:24,802 --> 00:57:26,827
You said you liked it before.

433
00:57:42,809 --> 00:57:44,030
No?

434
00:57:44,991 --> 00:57:46,014
I don't know.

435
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:50,343
It's before the start of period,
so it should feel better.

436
00:57:50,827 --> 00:57:52,194
No need to do it.

437
00:57:52,559 --> 00:57:54,909
But it's been a while.

438
00:57:54,934 --> 00:57:56,796
But you don't feel good.

439
00:57:57,429 --> 00:57:58,934
If you do, I'm OK.

440
00:57:58,959 --> 00:58:00,725
No, no, no.

441
00:58:01,685 --> 00:58:03,700
We used to come so much.

442
00:58:03,725 --> 00:58:06,819
It was insane.

443
00:58:27,600 --> 00:58:28,647
It went out of the line.

444
00:58:30,184 --> 00:58:31,272
Shut up.

445
00:58:35,392 --> 00:58:36,366
Let me.

446
00:58:37,434 --> 00:58:38,866
Oh? Have you done it?

447
00:58:39,434 --> 00:58:40,366
I have.

448
00:58:41,350 --> 00:58:42,499
What?

449
00:58:43,796 --> 00:58:44,983
For your girfriend?

450
00:58:45,454 --> 00:58:46,382
For my sister.

451
00:58:57,538 --> 00:59:01,460
Can this nail breathe?

452
00:59:03,850 --> 00:59:08,405
I don't know. Maybe not.

453
00:59:09,043 --> 00:59:10,834
That's not good.

454
00:59:15,272 --> 00:59:16,272
What?

455
00:59:17,683 --> 00:59:20,647
Help. Help.

456
00:59:21,905 --> 00:59:24,825
Creepy. What's that?

457
00:59:24,850 --> 00:59:26,100
This is nail.

458
00:59:26,399 --> 00:59:29,202
Oh nail? Nail's voice?

459
00:59:31,776 --> 00:59:33,835
Stop it.

460
00:59:44,683 --> 00:59:45,741
Is it good?

461
00:59:46,935 --> 00:59:47,757
This one?

462
00:59:48,843 --> 00:59:50,014
Not much.

463
00:59:52,776 --> 00:59:53,991
You should quit it.

464
00:59:56,683 --> 00:59:59,059
It's not good but can't quit.

465
01:00:01,322 --> 01:00:02,436
It's like us.

466
01:00:04,337 --> 01:00:05,460
What do you mean?

467
01:00:06,601 --> 01:00:08,436
We are sexless fuck budies.

468
01:00:10,067 --> 01:00:12,624
Well, that's true.

469
01:00:16,855 --> 01:00:18,084
Need something?

470
01:00:19,361 --> 01:00:20,452
Nope.

471
01:00:33,012 --> 01:00:34,452
You should quit.

472
01:00:37,051 --> 01:00:37,882
Quit what?

473
01:00:45,363 --> 01:00:46,389
Shall we quit?

474
01:01:06,975 --> 01:01:09,059
Eww.

475
01:01:16,939 --> 01:01:17,685
I...

476
01:01:19,912 --> 01:01:21,318
broke up with her.

477
01:01:23,248 --> 01:01:24,013
What?

478
01:01:25,060 --> 01:01:25,919
When?

479
01:01:26,668 --> 01:01:28,021
Last month.

480
01:01:30,582 --> 01:01:31,427
Why?

481
01:01:34,222 --> 01:01:36,514
What? Why would you ask that?

482
01:02:04,421 --> 01:02:06,786
You are unfair.

483
01:02:08,729 --> 01:02:09,763
I'm sorry.

484
01:02:23,587 --> 01:02:27,521
You know I started feeling nothing, right?

485
01:02:28,657 --> 01:02:29,482
I'm sorry.

486
01:02:30,554 --> 01:02:31,919
At first...

487
01:02:33,415 --> 01:02:37,099
it was all about being sexually
compatible. But...

488
01:02:40,043 --> 01:02:42,333
I started thinking...

489
01:02:47,134 --> 01:02:48,943
you have a girlfriend...

490
01:02:50,100 --> 01:02:53,505
I'm just a fuck buddy
and that it will end.

491
01:02:55,741 --> 01:02:57,283
Things like that.

492
01:03:04,542 --> 01:03:06,224
So I started feeling nothing.

493
01:03:17,233 --> 01:03:18,224
What?

494
01:03:27,195 --> 01:03:28,747
It's you who are unfair.

495
01:03:34,247 --> 01:03:34,755
Hey.

496
01:03:36,419 --> 01:03:36,927
What?

497
01:03:50,006 --> 01:03:51,310
Why don't we do it again?

498
01:03:54,551 --> 01:03:55,669
From the start.

499
01:04:29,349 --> 01:04:32,372
Excuese me. Can I use your phone?

500
01:04:34,068 --> 01:04:36,317
Can I use your phone?

501
01:04:38,489 --> 01:04:40,786
So mean. Why am I doing this?

502
01:04:49,997 --> 01:04:56,013
<i>It was in late May that I met Mitsuko.</i>

503
01:04:56,622 --> 01:04:59,318
Earlier you mentioned Mitsuko.

504
01:04:59,614 --> 01:05:03,794
When she goes out to drink without me...

505
01:05:04,113 --> 01:05:06,074
she comes home with scars.

506
01:05:06,099 --> 01:05:07,302
The other day...

507
01:05:08,333 --> 01:05:10,646
she argued with a stranger.

508
01:05:11,083 --> 01:05:16,685
And his wife joined them
and it turned into a mess.

509
01:05:18,052 --> 01:05:22,879
Hey, you two, please ask me about my novel.

510
01:05:22,904 --> 01:05:25,922
It's about your novel as she's your muse.

511
01:05:27,844 --> 01:05:32,739
<i>My muse, huh? Without her, I wouldn't
have been able to write novels.</i>

512
01:05:38,457 --> 01:05:39,708
Can I take your photos?

513
01:05:55,742 --> 01:05:59,271
You talked about me again
that I'm crazy?

514
01:06:00,387 --> 01:06:01,591
I didn't.

515
01:06:04,877 --> 01:06:06,357
Well, I did a bit.

516
01:06:06,581 --> 01:06:08,599
Dumb-ass.

517
01:06:13,318 --> 01:06:16,044
<i>We started to see each other a lot.</i>

518
01:06:17,388 --> 01:06:19,458
You can be relaxed.

519
01:06:31,579 --> 01:06:33,829
<i>I taught myself photography.</i>

520
01:06:35,794 --> 01:06:38,451
<i>I want to study abroad some day.</i>

521
01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:40,638
<i>Sounds amazing.</i>

522
01:06:43,868 --> 01:06:46,685
<i>I wanted to be with her always.</i>

523
01:07:06,527 --> 01:07:10,161
(His wife ex-model gets disorderly)

524
01:07:26,574 --> 01:07:31,347
When we met for the first time,
you thought I'm a fool, right?

525
01:07:38,874 --> 01:07:40,933
Is that why you wanted me as model?

526
01:07:46,255 --> 01:07:49,394
You looked pretty, kind...

527
01:07:51,404 --> 01:07:55,652
sensitive and smart.

528
01:08:49,591 --> 01:08:51,832
My husband is a novelist.

529
01:08:54,957 --> 01:08:58,363
<i>That's when I learned that.</i>

530
01:08:58,756 --> 01:09:00,105
Really?

531
01:09:00,339 --> 01:09:03,433
Most of the women in his novels...

532
01:09:04,375 --> 01:09:07,418
commit suicide when they are young.

533
01:09:09,381 --> 01:09:11,918
Don't you think it's guys' fantasy?

534
01:09:17,256 --> 01:09:18,152
I think...

535
01:09:21,817 --> 01:09:24,808
I'll go missing in the near future.

536
01:09:36,196 --> 01:09:37,839
I'm always in the dark.

537
01:09:40,151 --> 01:09:45,847
In life, we have to keep
moving forward, right?

538
01:09:55,425 --> 01:09:59,714
There's some point in every life
when we can't move forward.

539
01:10:08,326 --> 01:10:13,855
<i>Mitsuko died in an accident.</i>

540
01:10:33,347 --> 01:10:34,332
Ms. Sonoko.

541
01:10:39,601 --> 01:10:41,698
Do you doubt it was an accident?

542
01:10:49,544 --> 01:10:50,582
I'm sorry.

543
01:10:52,558 --> 01:10:53,605
I'm off now.

544
01:10:54,394 --> 01:10:58,246
Please tell me.
I'm not coinvined. I beg you.

545
01:10:58,391 --> 01:10:59,941
Oh, sorry.

546
01:11:09,509 --> 01:11:10,824
You are a novelist, so...

547
01:11:12,825 --> 01:11:15,050
you might find the accident ordinary.

548
01:11:19,280 --> 01:11:21,066
But Mitsuko told me...

549
01:11:23,963 --> 01:11:28,839
The stories about women comitting
suicides are fantasy.

550
01:11:29,701 --> 01:11:33,183
So I don't think she did.

551
01:11:36,380 --> 01:11:37,425
Bye.

552
01:11:59,215 --> 01:12:01,457
Why don't we take a trip?

553
01:12:03,387 --> 01:12:06,535
It'll be fun. We can take lots of photos.

554
01:12:19,849 --> 01:12:23,113
<i>I realized I had been in love.</i>

555
01:12:51,652 --> 01:12:53,097
You have time to cry?

556
01:12:57,753 --> 01:13:01,875
I'm asking if you have time to cry.

557
01:13:01,900 --> 01:13:03,347
I'm thinking.

558
01:13:03,372 --> 01:13:06,488
Okay. Then start writing.

559
01:13:07,959 --> 01:13:10,434
It's the setting you decided.

560
01:13:10,459 --> 01:13:12,550
It is.

561
01:13:12,834 --> 01:13:16,863
I thought this is the best setting
to be engaged in.

562
01:13:17,542 --> 01:13:20,542
Story about an actress and a director.

563
01:13:21,261 --> 01:13:24,035
I'm sorry I can't write,

564
01:13:24,059 --> 01:13:26,917
but actresses play
the parts already written.

565
01:13:26,942 --> 01:13:28,550
And you're a writer.

566
01:13:28,949 --> 01:13:32,809
You're looking down
on those who can't write.

567
01:13:32,857 --> 01:13:38,823
I'm not saying that. Just because
our positions are different...

568
01:13:39,425 --> 01:13:41,550
I want you to write something unique.

569
01:13:42,277 --> 01:13:44,371
I want to shoot the film.

570
01:13:44,667 --> 01:13:47,557
What's something unique?

571
01:13:47,582 --> 01:13:49,184
Something unseen.

572
01:13:49,363 --> 01:13:52,816
But you will fall for its actress anyway.

573
01:13:53,917 --> 01:13:54,629
I will.

574
01:14:00,818 --> 01:14:04,449
It will ruin everything.

575
01:14:14,472 --> 01:14:17,213
You can change the setting.

576
01:14:17,238 --> 01:14:18,898
I don't have time.

577
01:14:18,923 --> 01:14:20,461
Manage it.

578
01:14:20,486 --> 01:14:22,879
I can't sleep then.

579
01:14:23,117 --> 01:14:26,201
You don't know what creators are.

580
01:14:26,226 --> 01:14:29,855
I can't write without sleeping.

581
01:14:30,691 --> 01:14:32,230
Yesterday, I...

582
01:14:33,027 --> 01:14:37,879
slept only for 20 to 30 minutes like this.

583
01:14:37,904 --> 01:14:39,574
I was sleeping then.

584
01:14:52,673 --> 01:14:57,355
Stop having a cigarette break.

585
01:15:00,004 --> 01:15:06,245
At restaurants, whenever we are asked
if we smoke, you say we do.

586
01:15:06,270 --> 01:15:09,371
But I don't. I don't smoke.

587
01:15:09,848 --> 01:15:14,896
You are so crazy for putting
non-smokers in a smoking area.

588
01:15:14,921 --> 01:15:16,285
I'm not a drinker.

589
01:15:26,718 --> 01:15:28,051
Look at this.

590
01:15:29,601 --> 01:15:31,105
This is it.

591
01:15:32,645 --> 01:15:36,473
It's just amazing.

592
01:15:42,800 --> 01:15:44,801
I love what you write.

593
01:15:50,904 --> 01:15:52,121
Finish it soon.

594
01:15:57,457 --> 01:15:59,457
I don't have money.

595
01:15:59,481 --> 01:16:02,113
How are you gonna pay for this fine room?"

596
01:16:03,019 --> 01:16:04,074
Fine room?

597
01:16:04,488 --> 01:16:08,309
I'll pay as long as you can keep writing.

598
01:16:11,087 --> 01:16:17,227
You sound as if you weren't stingy
with money regarding arts. But you...

599
01:16:17,915 --> 01:16:21,337
haven't paid for the ticket for the play.

600
01:16:21,696 --> 01:16:26,925
You disappeared saying you'd smoke,
and I paid for two.

601
01:16:26,950 --> 01:16:28,899
I didn't disappear.

602
01:16:28,924 --> 01:16:31,258
Wasn't that play so good?

603
01:16:31,283 --> 01:16:34,507
You said you'd pay for me.

604
01:16:34,532 --> 01:16:37,055
I didn't. I was sorry for...

605
01:16:37,563 --> 01:16:41,313
inviting you for a play in a remote area.

606
01:16:41,338 --> 01:16:44,254
So I said I'd pay for travel cost.

607
01:16:44,279 --> 01:16:47,267
You didn't mention "for travel cost.

608
01:16:47,292 --> 01:16:51,693
But you didn't reply. You just nodded.

609
01:16:51,718 --> 01:16:57,618
And I meant I'd pay
if the play wasn't interesting.

610
01:16:57,643 --> 01:16:59,060
I couldn't tell.

611
01:16:59,085 --> 01:17:02,952
Wasn't the play great? We cried a lot.

612
01:17:02,977 --> 01:17:05,446
It serves as reference.

613
01:17:05,471 --> 01:17:07,858
It was great, so pay for it.

614
01:17:07,883 --> 01:17:11,900
Whichever pays for it, they don't care.

615
01:17:11,925 --> 01:17:12,800
I know.

616
01:17:12,825 --> 01:17:16,477
I just want anything paid
by others if it can be.

617
01:17:47,191 --> 01:17:48,427
Mr. Fujimura.

618
01:17:53,528 --> 01:17:57,909
I wanna go out with you
even just for one day.

619
01:17:59,066 --> 01:18:01,256
It can be a day trip.

620
01:18:02,184 --> 01:18:06,233
It can be anywhere
like Kamakura or Disneyland.

621
01:18:07,547 --> 01:18:11,156
I wanna have fun without
talking about the film.

622
01:18:13,169 --> 01:18:14,609
It'll be fun.

623
01:18:16,117 --> 01:18:19,062
Without business, we get along well.

624
01:18:19,087 --> 01:18:21,234
You can go with some other guy.

625
01:18:22,711 --> 01:18:27,437
I've been saying I wanna go with you.
Just for once.

626
01:18:28,906 --> 01:18:30,694
Is something wrong?

627
01:18:30,719 --> 01:18:36,515
I've been saying I can't.
Do I have to say it clearly?

628
01:18:39,980 --> 01:18:41,023
Why don't you?

629
01:18:44,640 --> 01:18:49,398
I could go if I try
ignoring time or our positions.

630
01:18:49,937 --> 01:18:52,242
We could go out for one day.

631
01:18:53,714 --> 01:18:55,375
I don't know since when...

632
01:18:56,883 --> 01:19:01,601
but after graduating from college
and leaving my house...

633
01:19:02,601 --> 01:19:07,367
everything is for making films.

634
01:19:11,502 --> 01:19:14,625
Stories used to be extraordinary experience.

635
01:19:15,672 --> 01:19:18,695
They used to take me far.

636
01:19:20,208 --> 01:19:21,828
Now stories are everything.

637
01:19:22,437 --> 01:19:24,359
I've been in extraordinary world,

638
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:27,128
so I can't be detached.

639
01:19:27,153 --> 01:19:28,453
I don't understand.

640
01:19:30,132 --> 01:19:32,726
I don't understand about you.

641
01:19:34,280 --> 01:19:36,299
Why can't you do it?

642
01:19:37,550 --> 01:19:38,414
I can't.

643
01:19:41,203 --> 01:19:43,789
But there's nothing wrong with you.

644
01:19:45,704 --> 01:19:47,383
Of course.

645
01:19:52,160 --> 01:19:53,969
Why don't you start writing?

646
01:19:55,609 --> 01:19:57,422
I'll write something good.

647
01:19:58,817 --> 01:19:59,922
I will.

648
01:20:00,547 --> 01:20:02,328
I'll write something good.

649
01:20:03,319 --> 01:20:05,219
I'll write something good.

650
01:20:06,026 --> 01:20:09,073
I will. I'll write something good.

651
01:20:09,097 --> 01:20:12,682
I'll write something good. I will.

652
01:20:16,167 --> 01:20:31,260
(I wanna be your cat)

653
01:20:46,549 --> 01:20:47,940
<i>At that time,</i>

654
01:20:47,964 --> 01:20:51,237
<i>our lives were revolving around him.</i>

655
01:20:52,106 --> 01:20:54,908
<i>That I will recall some day.</i>

656
01:20:56,095 --> 01:20:59,455
<i>I hope his secret won't be revealed
by anyone.</i>

657
01:21:00,626 --> 01:21:04,807
<i>I don't want him to be an adult
without my knowing it.</i>

658
01:21:05,783 --> 01:21:07,471
<i>I want to hide right now.</i>

659
01:21:07,854 --> 01:21:12,709
(Spring-ing)

660
01:21:12,734 --> 01:21:15,373
What's Kyushu like? Is it warm?

661
01:21:15,398 --> 01:21:16,776
It's just great.

662
01:21:23,751 --> 01:21:25,158
You glad to move there?

663
01:21:25,619 --> 01:21:27,385
I'll miss this place,

664
01:21:28,416 --> 01:21:31,253
but I'll get to see sweet viburnum.

665
01:21:32,904 --> 01:21:34,994
Its flowers look like snow.

666
01:21:37,375 --> 01:21:40,471
First I'll go to college
from grandma's house.

667
01:21:50,901 --> 01:21:52,799
I asked Rio to come to Kyushu.

668
01:21:54,292 --> 01:21:55,190
Why?

669
01:21:56,221 --> 01:22:00,612
Because he said he won't go on to college.

670
01:22:32,014 --> 01:22:33,940
Are you going to Kyushu?

671
01:22:36,148 --> 01:22:38,885
Haru, are you writing a novel these days?

672
01:22:41,612 --> 01:22:43,252
Do you still love Yumi?

673
01:22:45,187 --> 01:22:49,096
Haru, you want Yumi to be gone
as soon as possible.

674
01:22:53,877 --> 01:22:57,346
You two pretend to be getting along well.

675
01:23:00,401 --> 01:23:04,104
When I'm with Yumi,
I can feel I'm a boy.

676
01:23:05,549 --> 01:23:06,690
But when I'm with you,

677
01:23:07,675 --> 01:23:09,831
I feel as if I were a girl.

678
01:23:12,713 --> 01:23:14,088
What do you mean?

679
01:23:16,261 --> 01:23:21,315
Rio, I'm offended. Why can't it be me?

680
01:23:26,977 --> 01:23:30,908
Are you going to keep wearing it?

681
01:23:39,099 --> 01:23:42,994
But I'll get to see sweet viburnum.

682
01:23:44,549 --> 01:23:47,096
Its flowers look like snow.

683
01:23:51,275 --> 01:23:52,463
You heard them, right?

684
01:24:20,206 --> 01:24:22,033
Where are you going?

685
01:24:24,036 --> 01:24:25,237
To see cherry blossoms.

686
01:24:27,785 --> 01:24:29,291
I don't like cherry blossoms.

687
01:24:42,947 --> 01:24:45,221
I've read Haru's novel.

688
01:24:46,464 --> 01:24:48,752
I envy her for being able to write.

689
01:24:49,671 --> 01:24:50,510
Yeah.

690
01:24:55,404 --> 01:24:58,901
Rio, what do you wanna be in the future?

691
01:24:59,760 --> 01:25:01,409
What are you gonna do from now?"

692
01:25:02,729 --> 01:25:04,799
I don't have a specific dream,

693
01:25:05,268 --> 01:25:06,752
but I want to save money.

694
01:25:07,666 --> 01:25:08,713
What about you?

695
01:25:17,810 --> 01:25:22,424
I wish I could write novels like Haru.

696
01:25:23,990 --> 01:25:25,260
But now...

697
01:25:27,202 --> 01:25:33,049
I wanna be a journalist because I wanna
be words myself, traveling abroad.

698
01:25:35,737 --> 01:25:40,455
I didn't think you'd really come today.

699
01:25:42,607 --> 01:25:43,768
Because...

700
01:25:45,474 --> 01:25:46,509
I'm...

701
01:25:48,289 --> 01:25:49,502
in a relationship.

702
01:25:55,749 --> 01:25:57,455
Close your eyes, Rio.

703
01:26:40,710 --> 01:26:44,666
<i>If I could choose,
I'd rather not be either of them.</i>

704
01:26:46,196 --> 01:26:50,776
<i>Half of my heart is not here.</i>

705
01:26:53,788 --> 01:26:59,016
<i>Half of my heart is somewhere
other than here.</i>

706
01:27:02,028 --> 01:27:04,026
<i>Ever since I was born,</i>

707
01:27:04,721 --> 01:27:07,377
I've lived only with half of myself.

708
01:27:15,630 --> 01:27:17,838
<i>It's not that I want to be loved.</i>

709
01:27:20,858 --> 01:27:22,463
I wanted something good.

710
01:27:24,316 --> 01:27:27,674
<i>I'm just me.</i>

711
01:27:36,918 --> 01:27:40,751
Aoi, stop tickling me.

712
01:27:40,776 --> 01:27:43,533
Don't you ever look this way.

713
01:27:45,851 --> 01:27:49,002
Okay. But you are acting weird.

714
01:27:51,423 --> 01:27:55,415
We couldn't finish watching the film
again last night.

715
01:27:57,018 --> 01:27:58,440
I don't remember much.

716
01:28:02,188 --> 01:28:08,252
I got the feeling that we should have
finished watching the film last night.

717
01:28:16,814 --> 01:28:17,994
Hey, Riku.

718
01:28:19,921 --> 01:28:22,377
Have you thought about dying?

719
01:28:26,283 --> 01:28:27,557
I don't know.

720
01:28:29,442 --> 01:28:32,307
When I said so,
my mom laughed at me.

721
01:28:35,709 --> 01:28:41,416
My mom loves me and I love her. But...

722
01:28:42,520 --> 01:28:44,455
there are things we can't understand.

723
01:28:52,213 --> 01:28:55,518
<i>As if you were touching ice...</i>

724
01:28:57,580 --> 01:28:59,401
<i>the two of us get burned at night.</i>

725
01:29:00,484 --> 01:29:01,901
<i>We are getting burned.</i>

726
01:29:04,146 --> 01:29:06,526
We can't wait until the film ends.

727
01:29:10,073 --> 01:29:12,893
And morning like daydream comes.

728
01:29:15,985 --> 01:29:18,791
That's how we get it through.

729
01:29:42,646 --> 01:29:47,146
<i>Half of my heart is in the sea.</i>

730
01:29:49,365 --> 01:29:51,893
<i>In the sea of this ceiling...</i>

731
01:29:55,395 --> 01:30:00,330
<i>Silver fish is swimming, glittering.</i>

732
01:30:02,767 --> 01:30:04,737
<i>When I get away from you...</i>

733
01:30:05,846 --> 01:30:08,963
<i>I'm just myself.</i>

734
01:30:19,751 --> 01:30:23,818
(I wish you would break.)

735
01:30:23,843 --> 01:30:26,065
<i>I wish Riku would break.</i>

736
01:30:27,893 --> 01:30:29,869
That's how I feel sometimes.

737
01:30:33,102 --> 01:30:38,541
There must be something wrong with it.

738
01:30:40,773 --> 01:30:42,100
It's not wrong.

739
01:30:44,641 --> 01:30:46,303
It happens in romance.

740
01:30:47,303 --> 01:30:50,826
No matter how you try to break me,
I'll be back.

741
01:30:53,647 --> 01:30:55,373
What are you saying?

742
01:30:55,921 --> 01:30:57,318
Do break down.

743
01:30:58,966 --> 01:31:01,170
I really want to break you.

744
01:31:02,415 --> 01:31:05,707
I always feel there's something missing.

745
01:31:08,592 --> 01:31:10,803
I don't have big hands

746
01:31:11,506 --> 01:31:13,162
or a big back like Riku.

747
01:31:13,739 --> 01:31:15,850
I can never stand against you.

748
01:31:20,052 --> 01:31:21,147
But...

749
01:31:23,745 --> 01:31:26,186
would you cry if I do something awful?

750
01:31:28,822 --> 01:31:30,608
Would you be hurt by me?

751
01:31:34,377 --> 01:31:36,037
Would you really break down?

752
01:31:39,237 --> 01:31:40,295
I'll cry.

753
01:31:41,490 --> 01:31:42,608
I'll break down for sure.

754
01:31:44,640 --> 01:31:46,014
I'll get hurt for sure.

755
01:31:55,968 --> 01:32:02,272
I really think it's fine if I break down,
being with you.

756
01:32:04,635 --> 01:32:08,233
Let's live together
at the risk of our lives.

757
01:32:10,968 --> 01:32:12,186
You are crazy.

758
01:32:19,890 --> 01:32:22,639
There are many things I want to try.

759
01:32:26,307 --> 01:32:29,514
But I always hear a voice from behind

760
01:32:31,947 --> 01:32:33,256
Saying, “You are too young.

761
01:32:35,140 --> 01:32:36,162
Grow up.”

762
01:32:37,662 --> 01:32:41,825
Everyone tells me to face reality
and save money.

763
01:32:41,850 --> 01:32:43,248
I don't wanna hear it.

764
01:32:43,749 --> 01:32:45,029
There must be...

765
01:32:46,740 --> 01:32:49,451
something extraordinary in this world.

766
01:32:52,846 --> 01:32:54,771
Can't we keep looking for it?

767
01:32:56,850 --> 01:32:57,740
Two of us.

768
01:33:10,615 --> 01:33:15,217
I understand you more than
anyone else does.

769
01:33:18,138 --> 01:33:19,451
I understand you...

770
01:33:21,754 --> 01:33:23,100
more than anyone else.

771
01:33:56,002 --> 01:34:00,967
<i>Half of my heart is in the sea.</i>

772
01:34:16,647 --> 01:34:21,662
(reborn)

773
01:34:35,539 --> 01:34:36,592
I won't read it.

774
01:34:39,779 --> 01:34:41,451
Do you know how I feel?

775
01:34:42,365 --> 01:34:43,693
If I open it

776
01:34:44,748 --> 01:34:47,249
and I don't find my name written...

777
01:34:48,092 --> 01:34:50,076
do you know how sad I'm going to be?

778
01:34:52,545 --> 01:34:56,350
If you love somebody,
it's not right nor wrong, right?

779
01:34:59,217 --> 01:35:03,201
I love myself the most.

780
01:35:03,967 --> 01:35:06,553
And I love Hiroto for loving me.

781
01:35:08,735 --> 01:35:10,615
When I was with him...

782
01:35:11,906 --> 01:35:13,678
I was really happy.

783
01:35:14,397 --> 01:35:17,318
I must have been the cutest in the world.

784
01:35:19,529 --> 01:35:20,928
I was sparkling.

785
01:35:22,521 --> 01:35:23,834
(Sparkle)

786
01:35:27,134 --> 01:35:28,295
Are you crying?

787
01:35:30,271 --> 01:35:33,037
<i>Why do people cry?</i>

788
01:35:35,384 --> 01:35:38,873
<i>The moment we sparkle most
in our lives...</i>

789
01:35:39,123 --> 01:35:43,514
<i>could be when a girl gets a boyfriend
for the first time,</i>

790
01:35:43,936 --> 01:35:50,514
<i>or when a girl kisses or holds hands
with a guy she loves for the first time.</i>

791
01:35:51,170 --> 01:35:53,904
More than friends, but not lovers.

792
01:35:54,225 --> 01:35:58,006
Half of the word "FRIENDS" is fading,
right?

793
01:35:59,375 --> 01:36:00,358
That's why.

794
01:36:01,506 --> 01:36:04,709
<i>Is there any princess without a prince?</i>

795
01:36:05,342 --> 01:36:08,217
<i>My prince is Hiroto without doubt.</i>

796
01:36:08,678 --> 01:36:11,429
<i>He made me a princess.</i>

797
01:36:12,898 --> 01:36:17,150
<i>When I was with him, I was sparkling
every moment.</i>

798
01:36:17,175 --> 01:36:19,218
<i>Hiroto was everything to me.</i>

799
01:36:20,786 --> 01:36:24,570
<i>But suddenly he disappeared.</i>

800
01:36:25,008 --> 01:36:25,983
(Search)

801
01:36:26,008 --> 01:36:27,867
<i>I've been steeped in darkness.</i>

802
01:36:30,613 --> 01:36:34,254
He was like a little animal as my teacher.

803
01:36:34,472 --> 01:36:36,651
He was my flatmate.

804
01:36:36,676 --> 01:36:40,799
He was addicted to cigarette
and smartphone...

805
01:36:40,824 --> 01:36:42,682
bubbly and adorable.

806
01:36:42,707 --> 01:36:44,293
He got lonely easily.

807
01:36:44,473 --> 01:36:47,254
We have different impressions, huh?

808
01:36:47,696 --> 01:36:50,863
Chikako, how did you know him?

809
01:36:53,707 --> 01:36:57,660
He was a trainee teacher
when I was a senior.

810
01:36:58,334 --> 01:37:03,082
Since graduating from high school,
I'd been with him.

811
01:37:03,803 --> 01:37:05,285
He suddenly disappeared.

812
01:37:14,632 --> 01:37:15,831
With a guy?

813
01:37:20,269 --> 01:37:24,254
I thought this could be the reason.

814
01:37:27,595 --> 01:37:29,129
What are you gonna do?

815
01:37:31,696 --> 01:37:32,894
I want to see him again.

816
01:37:33,512 --> 01:37:35,605
Do you have any clue?"

817
01:37:41,763 --> 01:37:43,269
That time capsule.

818
01:37:44,043 --> 01:37:48,574
Each wrote a letter to the one we love,
and we buried them.

819
01:37:49,175 --> 01:37:50,292
So did Mr. Hiroto.

820
01:37:51,386 --> 01:37:55,730
We said it'd be nice if we
keep loving the same person...

821
01:37:56,543 --> 01:37:58,011
even when we get old.

822
01:37:58,442 --> 01:38:00,109
<i>Love Letter</i>

823
01:38:00,134 --> 01:38:01,355
(Hiroto Tai)

824
01:38:01,379 --> 01:38:05,129
<i>How many love letters exist
in this world?</i>

825
01:38:05,675 --> 01:38:09,604
<i>Some are discarded.
Others are treasured.</i>

826
01:38:09,629 --> 01:38:11,908
<i>I love you. I miss you.</i>

827
01:38:11,933 --> 01:38:16,121
<i>The words written on paper
evolve to someone's feelings.</i>

828
01:38:18,785 --> 01:38:19,996
Hiroto.

829
01:38:23,777 --> 01:38:25,434
You're too excited.

830
01:38:25,459 --> 01:38:27,854
It's coming-of-age ceremony.

831
01:38:27,879 --> 01:38:29,386
What are you doing?

832
01:38:30,332 --> 01:38:31,947
Writing a love note.

833
01:38:31,972 --> 01:38:34,025
What? Let me see!

834
01:38:34,050 --> 01:38:35,683
Why not?

835
01:38:35,708 --> 01:38:36,769
No.

836
01:38:38,379 --> 01:38:39,775
Stop.

837
01:38:39,800 --> 01:38:41,027
Bang.

838
01:38:45,160 --> 01:38:47,285
Ouch.

839
01:38:47,894 --> 01:38:52,620
<i>It couldn't hurt.
Whenever he did something sweet...</i>

840
01:38:53,019 --> 01:38:56,714
<i>my heart warmed up and started pounding.</i>

841
01:38:57,117 --> 01:38:57,964
(Time Capsule)

842
01:38:57,989 --> 01:39:00,067
<i>But now...</i>

843
01:39:05,988 --> 01:39:07,174
Found it.

844
01:39:07,199 --> 01:39:09,109
We did it.

845
01:39:09,134 --> 01:39:11,651
Let's take it to the gym. Go.

846
01:39:11,676 --> 01:39:12,900
Wow.

847
01:39:12,925 --> 01:39:14,640
I'm exhausted.

848
01:39:20,547 --> 01:39:21,463
What is this?

849
01:39:22,662 --> 01:39:26,500
They must be having a play
at the culture fest.

850
01:39:29,181 --> 01:39:31,820
I'm opening it.

851
01:39:38,596 --> 01:39:44,163
Let's stop it. It's not good to peek at
love letters. It's not.

852
01:39:45,701 --> 01:39:47,488
No way. You can't say that.

853
01:39:48,589 --> 01:39:51,424
<i>As much as I love him,</i>

854
01:39:51,449 --> 01:39:53,230
<i>he loves somebody else.</i>

855
01:39:53,805 --> 01:39:55,906
<i>The object is not me.</i>

856
01:39:56,335 --> 01:40:02,259
<i>I'm not mature enough to get over the fact.</i>

857
01:40:01,050 --> 01:40:02,259
(Fate of Love)

858
01:40:06,195 --> 01:40:09,162
No. Please don't read mine.

859
01:40:09,187 --> 01:40:14,099
<i>I want him to turn around,
look at me and say I'm cute.</i>

860
01:40:14,124 --> 01:40:18,984
<i>I want him to say he loves me.
I want him to be mine.</i>

861
01:40:20,188 --> 01:40:23,101
Chikako must have found his.

862
01:40:24,193 --> 01:40:27,773
What does it say, Chikako?

863
01:40:28,883 --> 01:40:31,835
(Fantasy)

864
01:40:31,860 --> 01:40:32,921
I...

865
01:40:34,327 --> 01:40:36,069
I love myself most.

866
01:40:36,570 --> 01:40:39,067
And I love Hiroto for loving me.

867
01:40:39,389 --> 01:40:43,038
<i>My feelings kept drifting inside myself.</i>

868
01:40:43,890 --> 01:40:46,007
<i>I couldn't accept the fact.</i>

869
01:40:46,616 --> 01:40:51,827
<i>I just kept drifting with pains
in my heart.</i>

870
01:40:52,123 --> 01:40:53,530
I was sparkling.

871
01:40:56,696 --> 01:40:57,616
But...

872
01:40:59,937 --> 01:41:04,280
Without Hiroto, I can't sparkle.

873
01:41:04,943 --> 01:41:08,062
My body and my heart..

874
01:41:09,485 --> 01:41:11,741
Yearn for him now.

875
01:41:15,185 --> 01:41:17,288
Even if it's fantasy...

876
01:41:20,218 --> 01:41:21,913
I need him.

877
01:41:22,819 --> 01:41:25,187
(Parting)

878
01:41:27,312 --> 01:41:30,718
<i>There's no princess without a prince.</i>

879
01:41:32,827 --> 01:41:36,627
<i>When Hiroto was around,
I was a princess.</i>

880
01:41:37,051 --> 01:41:39,647
<i>My world was sparkling.</i>

881
01:41:40,476 --> 01:41:46,759
<i>But what's the point in keeping
sparkling in fantasy?</i>

882
01:41:49,071 --> 01:41:51,382
<i>The tear I shed disappear,</i>

883
01:41:51,773 --> 01:41:53,718
<i>and I meet somebody else.</i>

884
01:41:54,331 --> 01:41:56,937
<i>I might completely forget about him.</i>

885
01:41:58,109 --> 01:42:01,467
<i>But I know I'll remember him.</i>

886
01:42:02,343 --> 01:42:06,288
<i>The feelings I had spending time
with him then.</i>

887
01:42:07,226 --> 01:42:10,156
<i>The sparkle.</i>

888
01:42:12,555 --> 01:42:14,263
Are you crying?

889
01:42:19,198 --> 01:42:21,163
It's not the tears of sorrow...

890
01:42:25,929 --> 01:42:27,327
tears of joy.

891
01:42:27,352 --> 01:42:30,671
(My love won't go anywhere)

892
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:47,599
(For Lonesome Blossoms)

893
01:42:47,624 --> 01:42:50,091
Since we've tread this garden

894
01:42:50,116 --> 01:42:51,442
we know of our end.

895
01:42:51,467 --> 01:42:54,312
We are blossoming daughters.

896
01:42:54,337 --> 01:42:56,587
That's right, when the flowers...

897
01:42:57,312 --> 01:42:59,401
We must soon leave this garden.

898
01:42:59,426 --> 01:43:00,920
Yes, soon.

899
01:43:00,945 --> 01:43:04,984
We're in a secret garden
loved by momentary seasons.

900
01:43:05,401 --> 01:43:08,437
We are girls in blossoming prime.

901
01:43:10,421 --> 01:43:12,177
Even laughing, I'd rather cry.

902
01:43:12,202 --> 01:43:14,726
Memories of becoming myself.

903
01:43:14,751 --> 01:43:17,657
We'll forget these days.

904
01:43:17,682 --> 01:43:19,876
We'll forget this time.

905
01:43:19,901 --> 01:43:21,534
This time.

906
01:43:28,046 --> 01:43:29,046
It's over.

907
01:43:29,071 --> 01:43:32,237
Even if it's my first time

908
01:43:33,651 --> 01:43:35,401
I know this garden will end.

909
01:43:35,426 --> 01:43:37,084
(A Record of My First Love and I)

910
01:43:37,109 --> 01:43:38,268
First time in love.

911
01:43:38,293 --> 01:43:39,318
First love.

912
01:43:39,343 --> 01:43:40,219
My star.

913
01:43:40,244 --> 01:43:42,458
My star, called first love.

914
01:43:42,483 --> 01:43:44,019
Light my path.

915
01:43:44,550 --> 01:43:46,557
My first love dies, I grow old.

916
01:43:46,582 --> 01:43:48,274
And I watch my youth goes cold.

917
01:43:48,299 --> 01:43:50,692
Just like the flowers wilt, we grow old.

918
01:43:50,717 --> 01:43:51,592
We grow old.

919
01:43:51,617 --> 01:43:53,299
Only women have to grow old.

920
01:43:53,559 --> 01:43:55,323
That's okay.

921
01:43:55,348 --> 01:43:57,598
I'm okay as a girl forever.

922
01:43:57,623 --> 01:44:00,198
Even if they say, "you're no girl"

923
01:44:00,223 --> 01:44:03,417
and for eternity, we'll always
be just our mother's baby girl.

924
01:44:03,442 --> 01:44:04,276
For eternity.

925
01:44:04,301 --> 01:44:06,735
All life is born from women.

926
01:44:06,760 --> 01:44:07,567
For eternity.

927
01:44:07,592 --> 01:44:10,088
Everyone starts their journey as a girl.

928
01:44:10,113 --> 01:44:12,377
Whether a boy or a girl,
you're your mother's baby.

929
01:44:12,402 --> 01:44:15,134
That's right,
I am my mother's baby girl.

930
01:44:15,159 --> 01:44:17,692
Be a girl, from now on...

931
01:44:17,717 --> 01:44:19,252
There is still no life.

932
01:44:19,277 --> 01:44:21,315
Then we're still in a previous world.

933
01:44:22,198 --> 01:44:24,948
And soon we're born on earth.

934
01:44:26,318 --> 01:44:28,650
(And soon we're born on earth.)

935
01:44:29,964 --> 01:44:30,980
How strange.

936
01:44:31,005 --> 01:44:33,353
We can't return from earth!

937
01:44:33,378 --> 01:44:34,886
Where should we go?

938
01:44:34,911 --> 01:44:36,394
I'll walk my path.

939
01:44:36,956 --> 01:44:38,285
(A Story of My Mother)

940
01:44:38,775 --> 01:44:41,066
We speak as the earth's surface moves.

941
01:44:41,091 --> 01:44:42,246
My shadow moves.

942
01:44:42,271 --> 01:44:44,152
Your stomach trembles.

943
01:44:45,830 --> 01:44:47,347
(A Story of My "Mother")

944
01:44:47,372 --> 01:44:48,792
That's not enough.

945
01:44:48,817 --> 01:44:50,347
Mother, look here.

946
01:44:50,372 --> 01:44:52,753
Not enough. I need more love.

947
01:44:52,778 --> 01:44:54,818
I'm a wild monster.

948
01:44:54,843 --> 01:44:57,292
Seeking love is not shameful.

949
01:44:57,317 --> 01:44:59,086
What a pity to do that.

950
01:44:59,111 --> 01:45:02,324
I know that intensity.
I feel sorry for mom.

951
01:45:02,349 --> 01:45:05,628
Her life is sacrificed
for silly me, for love.

952
01:45:05,653 --> 01:45:09,667
I've never known real love.
It's a fake, to me.

953
01:45:09,692 --> 01:45:10,550
Love is an illusion.

954
01:45:10,575 --> 01:45:11,375
Love is a dream.

955
01:45:11,400 --> 01:45:14,589
So no matter what,
we create the love we can.

956
01:45:15,160 --> 01:45:16,402
Love never ceases.

957
01:45:16,427 --> 01:45:17,334
Love is a lie.

958
01:45:17,359 --> 01:45:20,709
We can live within limitless love.

959
01:45:20,734 --> 01:45:22,458
We reach for love.

960
01:45:22,483 --> 01:45:24,667
If that's the same as sadness

961
01:45:24,692 --> 01:45:27,785
because love can never be divided.

962
01:45:34,067 --> 01:45:36,251
No, no! Don't go in!

963
01:45:36,276 --> 01:45:38,910
You love me so deeply and still hurt me?

964
01:45:38,935 --> 01:45:42,500
You can't speak to my heart only in bed.

965
01:45:42,525 --> 01:45:46,097
You will never truly know me,
no matter how deep you go.

966
01:45:46,122 --> 01:45:49,417
And no matter how I may look for you.

967
01:45:49,442 --> 01:45:51,442
You'll never know.

968
01:45:51,467 --> 01:45:54,400
Am I born from that pain?

969
01:45:54,525 --> 01:45:56,001
I will be a free mother.

970
01:45:56,026 --> 01:45:57,609
Rise from her bondage.

971
01:45:57,634 --> 01:46:01,863
No. I will be free to embrace bondage.

972
01:46:03,715 --> 01:46:07,267
I can't return anything to my mother.

973
01:46:07,292 --> 01:46:09,084
How much I love her.

974
01:46:09,109 --> 01:46:11,834
I know. No matter how I'm loved.

975
01:46:11,859 --> 01:46:15,525
All I can do to give back
to my mother is act.

976
01:46:15,550 --> 01:46:16,519
Is it possible?

977
01:46:16,544 --> 01:46:17,535
Don't look back!

978
01:46:17,560 --> 01:46:18,338
Don't look back!

979
01:46:18,363 --> 01:46:21,500
Surely, if we go to earth, surely...

980
01:46:21,532 --> 01:46:25,933
We pledge for birth,
to improve this born world.

981
01:46:26,541 --> 01:46:29,375
How do you best improve the earth?

982
01:46:29,400 --> 01:46:32,566
Ensure future children are free and happy.

983
01:46:32,591 --> 01:46:33,547
For that?

984
01:46:33,572 --> 01:46:38,458
If she loves and gives birth,
she should be free and happy.

985
01:46:38,483 --> 01:46:42,126
Would any girl refuse
a free and happy mother?

986
01:46:42,151 --> 01:46:46,750
Then, free and happy children
will spread across the world.

987
01:46:46,775 --> 01:46:50,542
We were born seeing a mother
free and happy.

988
01:46:50,567 --> 01:46:51,804
Mother, I beg you!

989
01:46:51,829 --> 01:46:54,584
Make me a girl from a mother
with big dreams.

990
01:46:54,609 --> 01:46:56,792
If I could look just like you...

991
01:46:56,817 --> 01:46:59,126
If I could look like any place...

992
01:46:59,151 --> 01:47:01,542
Your distorted meat and bones.

993
01:47:01,567 --> 01:47:03,293
Because I love you.

994
01:47:03,318 --> 01:47:04,917
I am perfectly born to you.

995
01:47:04,942 --> 01:47:07,167
Maybe I look nothing like you.

996
01:47:07,192 --> 01:47:10,709
If I looked like you
when you can't love yourself,

997
01:47:10,734 --> 01:47:13,293
would I find myself too scary
to be loved?

998
01:47:13,318 --> 01:47:19,667
We're too similar, it's scary.
Take a bit from those you love.

999
01:47:19,692 --> 01:47:23,617
And if you love him,
I'll know right away.

1000
01:47:23,642 --> 01:47:27,859
At the end of this maddening love,
come find me.

1001
01:47:27,884 --> 01:47:31,353
Look at me, with those who care for you.

1002
01:47:35,709 --> 01:47:39,165
Mother, grandmother, great-grandmother...

1003
01:47:39,197 --> 01:47:41,783
Back one or two hundred years ago...

1004
01:47:41,808 --> 01:47:45,328
I want to live for the pains of
generations of mothers.

1005
01:47:45,353 --> 01:47:48,625
I will show mother a real girl's shape.

1006
01:47:48,650 --> 01:47:51,251
120 years since cinema's birth.

1007
01:47:51,276 --> 01:47:53,900
In other words, one woman's life.

1008
01:47:53,925 --> 01:47:56,626
In the 21st century, we mourn her life.

1009
01:47:56,651 --> 01:47:58,959
Can a true cinema be born...?

1010
01:47:58,984 --> 01:48:02,775
We are 21st century girls...

1011
01:48:07,796 --> 01:48:11,216
Pour the 3 primary colors
into the 21st century.

1012
01:48:11,249 --> 01:48:14,236
21 plus 3 equals 24.

1013
01:48:14,261 --> 01:48:17,486
Perfect, the art of the lie
24 frames per second.

1014
01:48:17,511 --> 01:48:20,312
Return the three colors of life
into cinema.

1015
01:48:20,337 --> 01:48:22,166
Let's make multi-varied lies.

1016
01:48:22,191 --> 01:48:25,517
And for the first time, those working in
black shadows appear.

1017
01:48:26,296 --> 01:48:27,951
(And for the first time, those working in
black shadows appear...)

1018
01:48:27,976 --> 01:48:29,630
In the shadows is full of color.

1019
01:48:30,311 --> 01:48:32,036
They gather and it blackens.

1020
01:48:32,061 --> 01:48:33,641
Ah, it turns dark.

1021
01:48:33,666 --> 01:48:35,417
My fingertips turn black.

1022
01:48:35,442 --> 01:48:37,709
In this dark world, loneliness.

1023
01:48:37,734 --> 01:48:40,760
Only the lonely can change the world.

1024
01:48:40,785 --> 01:48:43,891
So we must become even more alone.

1025
01:48:43,916 --> 01:48:46,758
You're still alone, even with someone.

1026
01:48:46,783 --> 01:48:51,633
Not just alone, but loneliness
among others... it's ephemeral.

1027
01:48:51,658 --> 01:48:56,719
Finding love in shared loneliness,
it's the most precious.

1028
01:48:56,744 --> 01:49:00,008
In that case, I'll become a blossom,
all alone in the world.

1029
01:49:00,033 --> 01:49:01,399
I'm not a swarm?

1030
01:49:01,424 --> 01:49:02,813
I don't forgive others?

1031
01:49:02,838 --> 01:49:06,039
You don't get it.
I'm so lonely, knowing you.

1032
01:49:06,064 --> 01:49:09,703
Even if we help each other,
I feel so lonely.

1033
01:49:09,728 --> 01:49:11,680
I want to be more alone than anyone.

1034
01:49:11,705 --> 01:49:13,914
Bring me greater loneliness on earth.

1035
01:49:13,939 --> 01:49:15,555
Wherever I may be born.

1036
01:49:15,580 --> 01:49:18,703
I will make art to encompass the world.

1037
01:49:18,728 --> 01:49:21,102
Combine love, language, religion, politics.

1038
01:49:21,127 --> 01:49:22,641
Search out beauty.

1039
01:49:22,666 --> 01:49:23,596
Combined art.

1040
01:49:23,621 --> 01:49:24,676
The seventh art.

1041
01:49:24,701 --> 01:49:26,432
Create the ultimate art.

1042
01:49:26,457 --> 01:49:28,432
Even if it's my first time

1043
01:49:28,457 --> 01:49:30,783
I know this garden will end.

1044
01:49:30,808 --> 01:49:32,634
And a new Spring comes.

1045
01:49:32,659 --> 01:49:33,939
Ah, the wind!

1046
01:49:33,964 --> 01:49:35,067
And we're lonesome.

1047
01:49:35,092 --> 01:49:37,242
Since we've tread this garden

1048
01:49:37,267 --> 01:49:39,057
we know of our end.

1049
01:49:39,082 --> 01:49:40,986
When I leapt from this garden

1050
01:49:41,011 --> 01:49:42,697
will we know how it starts.

1051
01:49:42,722 --> 01:49:44,307
For lonesome blossoms.

1052
01:49:44,332 --> 01:49:45,783
For lonesome blossoms.

1053
01:49:45,808 --> 01:49:47,252
For lonesome blossoms.

1054
01:49:47,277 --> 01:49:49,049
Let's walk the path of loneliness.

1055
01:49:49,074 --> 01:49:51,142
Let's feel more loneliness than anyone.

1056
01:49:51,167 --> 01:49:53,033
Let's find a flower more alone than me.

1057
01:49:53,058 --> 01:49:55,478
And we'll discover that
all of us are alone.

1058
01:49:55,503 --> 01:49:57,486
Born into the 21st century.

1059
01:49:57,511 --> 01:49:58,885
And we can see the light.

1060
01:49:58,910 --> 01:49:59,985
(On the screen)

1061
01:50:00,009 --> 01:50:01,484
Ah, it's time! Time to be born.

1062
01:50:01,509 --> 01:50:02,961
Time to be born on the earth.

1063
01:50:02,986 --> 01:50:04,564
We must become life.

1064
01:50:04,589 --> 01:50:06,197
We must head to our mother.

1065
01:50:06,222 --> 01:50:08,858
I feel like... I'm forgetting something.

1066
01:50:08,883 --> 01:50:10,939
One time, one time, to be forgotten.

1067
01:50:10,964 --> 01:50:12,211
One time, one time, to be remembered.

1068
01:50:12,236 --> 01:50:15,228
And as beautiful as what we can
remember, however many times.

1069
01:50:15,253 --> 01:50:16,828
However many times life is born.

1070
01:50:16,853 --> 01:50:18,142
Ah, to be born.

1071
01:50:18,167 --> 01:50:19,564
Ah, to be born so soon!

1072
01:50:19,589 --> 01:50:21,164
Ah, to be born right now!

1073
01:50:21,189 --> 01:50:23,050
Being born into the world now!

1074
01:50:23,075 --> 01:50:24,344
When I'm born onto the earth

1075
01:50:24,369 --> 01:50:25,057
surely

1076
01:50:25,082 --> 01:50:27,313
I'll make a new film.

1077
01:50:27,338 --> 01:50:29,182
Dedicated to my one and only mother.

1078
01:50:29,207 --> 01:50:31,275
Delivered to my one and only girl.

1079
01:50:31,820 --> 01:50:34,510
Make a film for 21st century girls.

1080
01:50:35,974 --> 01:50:38,602
(For Lonesome Blossoms)

1081
01:50:43,867 --> 01:50:47,031
<i>"Make a film for 21st century girls!"</i>
