1
00:00:37,083 --> 00:00:38,667
Are you really moving tomorrow?

2
00:00:38,709 --> 00:00:40,834
Yes, early tomorrow.

3
00:00:40,876 --> 00:00:43,918
Don't forget to call and
let us know your number.

4
00:00:43,959 --> 00:00:45,249
Sure.

5
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:47,459
You're lucky,
getting accepted at "Mater".

6
00:00:47,501 --> 00:00:49,667
Many others get accepted.

7
00:00:50,083 --> 00:00:51,667
But I'm not.

8
00:00:54,584 --> 00:01:01,750
My daddy said my new school
was the football champ.

9
00:01:01,751 --> 00:01:04,500
They're here since kindergarten,

10
00:01:04,501 --> 00:01:06,341
what make you decide
to have them transferred?

11
00:01:06,918 --> 00:01:09,078
We'd like them to be
in the school closer to our home.

12
00:01:09,501 --> 00:01:12,626
Isn't here close enough?

13
00:01:13,125 --> 00:01:16,834
We're moving to a new home.

14
00:01:16,876 --> 00:01:18,501
Okay.

15
00:01:23,709 --> 00:01:25,125
Here, it's all done.

16
00:01:26,125 --> 00:01:29,374
Thank you, I have to say goodbye.

17
00:01:29,375 --> 00:01:30,167
Good luck.

18
00:01:30,209 --> 00:01:31,125
Thank you.

19
00:01:35,918 --> 00:01:36,834
Let's go ONN.

20
00:01:37,918 --> 00:01:39,751
OHH, bring your brother.

21
00:01:40,292 --> 00:01:41,667
I've got to go.

22
00:01:41,751 --> 00:01:42,667
I've got to go.

23
00:01:42,668 --> 00:01:44,292
Don't forget the number.

24
00:01:44,375 --> 00:01:45,667
Bye.

25
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:49,584
Goodbye.

26
00:01:50,167 --> 00:01:50,959
Let's go.

27
00:01:56,459 --> 00:01:58,792
We'll stop by at the supermarket.

28
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,792
I'll prepare a special meal.

29
00:02:00,834 --> 00:02:02,875
Let's celebrate a farewell
to our old home, okay?

30
00:02:02,876 --> 00:02:04,209
Okay.

31
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:06,918
Don't forget my favourite.

32
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:10,709
Definitely, everybody's favourites.

33
00:02:16,292 --> 00:02:16,876
It's from mom.

34
00:02:16,877 --> 00:02:18,667
Come on dad, let me.

35
00:02:19,292 --> 00:02:22,792
"Will be late tonight"...
late again.

36
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:29,542
"Remind OHH to pack
and take care of the baby"

37
00:02:29,584 --> 00:02:31,083
Go dad.

38
00:02:31,792 --> 00:02:34,751
Watch out.
I'm going to get you now.

39
00:02:34,792 --> 00:02:36,792
Come on UMM. Let's go.

40
00:02:43,334 --> 00:02:45,375
OHH, be careful!

41
00:02:46,792 --> 00:02:48,708
How's it UMM, having fun?
It's no big deal.

42
00:02:48,709 --> 00:02:49,751
Nothing to be afraid of.

43
00:02:49,792 --> 00:02:50,792
Come here, give him to me.

44
00:02:50,834 --> 00:02:55,751
If it were you, and daddy pushed it
as fast, how about it?

45
00:02:55,792 --> 00:02:59,667
How about what?
Come, race with me.

46
00:02:59,709 --> 00:03:00,584
Okay.

47
00:03:03,501 --> 00:03:06,667
Be careful.
Watch out for the car.

48
00:03:19,751 --> 00:03:22,500
Then, the prince and his horse
are going to rescue the princess

49
00:03:22,501 --> 00:03:26,042
and the kids from the witch castle.

50
00:03:35,834 --> 00:03:38,459
But that wicked witch came back

51
00:03:42,584 --> 00:03:47,876
and flies right in front of the prince,
princess, and children.

52
00:03:50,042 --> 00:03:55,000
You are very good getting
in my castle.

53
00:03:55,167 --> 00:04:00,501
But no one ever lives to tell.

54
00:04:09,501 --> 00:04:13,334
In a meantime, the witch said.

55
00:04:14,417 --> 00:04:17,292
Hmm.. What's it call.

56
00:04:17,709 --> 00:04:19,542
That one-eyed giant.

57
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:26,501
Yes, she called for the
one-eyed giant from the pit.

58
00:04:35,209 --> 00:04:36,959
All of a sudden,

59
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,042
the witch used her power
to darken the sky,

60
00:04:40,083 --> 00:04:41,643
so dark that no one could see anything.

61
00:04:45,042 --> 00:04:49,334
The prince then swung
his magic sword around,

62
00:04:51,042 --> 00:04:54,584
to bring back the sparkling stars
to the sky.

63
00:04:54,709 --> 00:04:56,459
So they could see the trail.

64
00:05:12,751 --> 00:05:14,876
Mommy's home.

65
00:05:21,083 --> 00:05:22,417
Have you eaten yet?

66
00:05:22,459 --> 00:05:23,626
I did.

67
00:05:24,667 --> 00:05:26,167
Why's the house so dark?

68
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:28,542
Daddy's telling us a fairy tale.

69
00:05:33,417 --> 00:05:35,918
Daddy, let's continue.
It's really a fun.

70
00:05:35,959 --> 00:05:37,209
Aww..ONN.

71
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:39,459
Come on daddy.

72
00:05:47,209 --> 00:05:50,000
Did you pack your stuff yet?

73
00:05:50,584 --> 00:05:51,999
Not yet.

74
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,626
Haven't I told you to?

75
00:05:53,959 --> 00:05:55,459
And still up so late.

76
00:05:55,501 --> 00:05:57,626
It's okay, I'll help her pack.

77
00:05:57,792 --> 00:05:59,032
Come on guys, let's get to bed.

78
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:03,083
But it's not ended yet.

79
00:06:03,709 --> 00:06:04,584
Don't complain.

80
00:06:04,626 --> 00:06:05,917
You've listened to it
so many times already.

81
00:06:05,918 --> 00:06:07,584
But it's still fun.

82
00:06:08,751 --> 00:06:10,583
Some other time, okay?

83
00:06:10,584 --> 00:06:13,583
Hey, who do you want to be,
prince or princess?

84
00:06:13,584 --> 00:06:14,667
May be the horse?

85
00:06:14,709 --> 00:06:15,709
I want to be the prince.

86
00:06:17,417 --> 00:06:19,501
How about being a witch?

87
00:06:23,667 --> 00:06:26,918
Dad, how's our new home?

88
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:29,542
It's an apartment.

89
00:06:29,792 --> 00:06:32,500
They don't have a yard
like ours then.

90
00:06:32,501 --> 00:06:33,791
They should,

91
00:06:33,792 --> 00:06:37,709
every large apartment usually has one.

92
00:06:38,167 --> 00:06:40,709
They might even have a playground.

93
00:06:40,751 --> 00:06:43,209
What? You've never been there?

94
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:45,459
No, I've never been there.

95
00:06:52,709 --> 00:06:55,250
Come on, flight.

96
00:06:55,667 --> 00:06:59,042
- Get it, that one-eyed giant.
- Again.

97
00:07:14,751 --> 00:07:17,751
You too, better sleep now,
so you can get up early.

98
00:07:23,792 --> 00:07:27,292
Strange, why haven't you been there?

99
00:07:28,125 --> 00:07:29,209
Sleep.

100
00:08:26,417 --> 00:08:27,375
Thanks.

101
00:08:28,042 --> 00:08:28,959
Give me a hand.

102
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:29,751
Easy...Easy.

103
00:08:29,792 --> 00:08:33,792
Be careful, it belonged
to my great grandfather.

104
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,417
Higher, be careful.

105
00:08:37,751 --> 00:08:39,959
Oh, my god.

106
00:08:40,292 --> 00:08:41,959
I'm sorry.

107
00:08:47,292 --> 00:08:48,167
What?

108
00:08:48,459 --> 00:08:50,375
- Help!
- What is it? NID.

109
00:08:52,751 --> 00:08:55,375
- What?
- A turtle! Help me!

110
00:08:55,417 --> 00:08:57,626
Oh, just a turtle.
What a scream.

111
00:08:57,667 --> 00:08:58,959
ONN, come out here.

112
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,417
Bring your NINJA out too.

113
00:09:02,834 --> 00:09:03,626
Didn't I tell you?

114
00:09:03,667 --> 00:09:05,626
I don't allow you
to bring NINJA along.

115
00:09:06,083 --> 00:09:09,082
If he's here alone,
who will take care of him?

116
00:09:09,083 --> 00:09:11,250
Who will feed him?

117
00:09:11,292 --> 00:09:13,417
Enough. It'll find its way to survive.

118
00:09:13,751 --> 00:09:14,751
Take it back to the pond. Now.

119
00:09:14,752 --> 00:09:17,125
- But he'll die.
- Now!

120
00:09:31,334 --> 00:09:34,000
Are you throwing this away?

121
00:09:34,042 --> 00:09:36,834
We'll keep them.
They're daddy's fairy tales.

122
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:43,501
Go, get down to your pond.

123
00:09:53,626 --> 00:09:55,626
I don't want the children
to have any problem.

124
00:09:55,667 --> 00:09:56,791
At least,
during the first six months,

125
00:09:56,792 --> 00:09:58,417
you shouldn't make any contact.

126
00:09:58,667 --> 00:10:00,685
Give them a chance to learn
about what's happening.

127
00:10:00,709 --> 00:10:03,751
After that,
you may visit them sometime.

128
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,166
But not too often.

129
00:10:05,167 --> 00:10:06,417
They're also my children.

130
00:10:06,459 --> 00:10:07,834
We've already agreed on this.

131
00:10:08,125 --> 00:10:10,709
Would you think it over?

132
00:10:10,751 --> 00:10:12,833
It's not only giving me a chance,

133
00:10:12,834 --> 00:10:14,667
but the children's too.

134
00:10:15,083 --> 00:10:17,125
It's over. It's already over.

135
00:10:17,167 --> 00:10:18,000
PHA.

136
00:10:39,042 --> 00:10:40,000
Get in the car.

137
00:10:43,959 --> 00:10:45,042
OHH

138
00:10:46,834 --> 00:10:49,375
OHH...We'll be leaving now.

139
00:10:54,876 --> 00:10:56,417
Get in the car.

140
00:10:56,792 --> 00:10:58,083
What about dad?

141
00:10:58,292 --> 00:11:00,125
Why isn't he coming with us?

142
00:11:00,792 --> 00:11:02,209
He'll come.

143
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:03,959
He has some work to finish.
He'll join us later.

144
00:11:04,209 --> 00:11:05,959
What about his stuff?

145
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,501
Why none of his thing
is coming with us?

146
00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:11,000
They're all still in the room.

147
00:11:11,209 --> 00:11:13,501
Get in the car now, OHH.

148
00:11:13,584 --> 00:11:15,292
I said he'll come.

149
00:11:16,042 --> 00:11:18,459
ONN, daddy's not going.

150
00:11:18,501 --> 00:11:21,082
Mommy lies,
daddy won't live with us.

151
00:11:21,083 --> 00:11:22,876
Mom and dad won't live
together anymore.

152
00:11:22,918 --> 00:11:24,042
That's enough!

153
00:11:24,292 --> 00:11:27,124
You lie, I'm not going,
I'll stay with daddy.

154
00:11:27,125 --> 00:11:27,918
OHH.

155
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:32,918
OHH, listen to me. Please.

156
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:35,999
I don't want to go.
I want to live here.

157
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:36,834
OHH.

158
00:11:36,876 --> 00:11:39,167
- Daddy please, don't get divorced.
- OHH.

159
00:11:39,209 --> 00:11:41,249
- Let's stay together please.
- Wait, ONN.

160
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:43,542
Please, I beg you.

161
00:11:43,834 --> 00:11:47,167
- Don't cry baby. Listen to me.
- OHH.

162
00:11:48,751 --> 00:11:50,918
This separation will just be temporary.

163
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:52,541
Everybody should have some problems.

164
00:11:52,542 --> 00:11:54,334
And there is one between mom and dad.

165
00:11:54,918 --> 00:11:58,834
But trust me,
we shall work it out,

166
00:11:59,459 --> 00:12:00,999
and we'll be together again.

167
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,125
I'll stay with you.

168
00:12:03,167 --> 00:12:04,375
Please, let me stay with you.

169
00:12:04,417 --> 00:12:05,792
No, you can't.

170
00:12:06,375 --> 00:12:08,542
I've got lots of work to do.

171
00:12:09,125 --> 00:12:11,250
I don't have time
to take care of you all.

172
00:12:11,626 --> 00:12:14,375
Go stay with your mom, okay?

173
00:12:14,459 --> 00:12:15,918
I won't.

174
00:12:15,959 --> 00:12:17,626
Me too.

175
00:12:17,667 --> 00:12:20,667
Come on, do as I told,
go with your mom,

176
00:12:21,417 --> 00:12:22,584
and I'll come to see you.

177
00:12:22,626 --> 00:12:25,375
Come, OHH, ONN.
It's time to go now.

178
00:12:25,626 --> 00:12:26,501
Come on.

179
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:28,626
If you don't go,

180
00:12:29,375 --> 00:12:31,695
Me and him are not going
to talk to each other ever again.

181
00:12:37,167 --> 00:12:38,167
Go.

182
00:12:39,417 --> 00:12:40,834
Come, ONN.

183
00:12:56,459 --> 00:12:57,876
Let's get going.

184
00:13:21,375 --> 00:13:24,626
When is daddy gonna come to see us?

185
00:13:25,626 --> 00:13:27,334
I don't know.

186
00:14:08,501 --> 00:14:10,501
Excuse me, PHA.

187
00:14:24,209 --> 00:14:29,334
OHH, ONN, come here,
come see your room.

188
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:37,417
This is your room, ONN.

189
00:14:39,375 --> 00:14:40,959
Do you like it?

190
00:14:41,083 --> 00:14:42,709
I also bought you this new desk.

191
00:14:46,501 --> 00:14:48,621
Okay, put your things in place.
I'll be back to help.

192
00:14:50,918 --> 00:14:52,083
Come, OHH.

193
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:56,751
Your room, like it?

194
00:14:57,334 --> 00:14:59,334
Why don't ONN and I stay
in the same room?

195
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,459
You're not that young anymore,

196
00:15:03,501 --> 00:15:06,125
and should have a little privacy.

197
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:09,459
Okay? I have to go help ONN unpack.

198
00:15:37,792 --> 00:15:40,042
It's very convenient here.

199
00:15:40,709 --> 00:15:45,667
The store downstair opens 24 hrs.

200
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,083
Your school is only 10 mins.

201
00:15:50,542 --> 00:15:53,250
Away by bus, and my office
is just a little bit further.

202
00:15:54,083 --> 00:15:55,709
I can drive you to school everyday.

203
00:15:57,751 --> 00:15:59,083
What about UMM?

204
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:01,459
I'll put him in the nursery downstair.

205
00:16:01,501 --> 00:16:03,501
See? It's very convenient.

206
00:16:03,709 --> 00:16:05,167
Okay, let's eat.

207
00:16:07,709 --> 00:16:11,167
Here's yours, UMM.

208
00:16:12,125 --> 00:16:24,042
Come on, sweetie. Come on.

209
00:16:24,667 --> 00:16:28,375
Here, take it.
It tastes really good.

210
00:16:28,417 --> 00:16:31,417
Doesn't taste good at all,
daddy can do much better.

211
00:16:45,584 --> 00:16:54,626
Come on, UMM, take more.

212
00:16:57,626 --> 00:17:00,709
Come on, open your mount.

213
00:17:41,626 --> 00:17:43,751
Sleep, close your eyes now.

214
00:18:04,167 --> 00:18:06,292
How're you doing, Ninja?

215
00:18:09,667 --> 00:18:11,792
Here, eat this.

216
00:18:43,209 --> 00:18:44,626
I want to go home.

217
00:18:44,834 --> 00:18:50,542
Let's go back to our old home.

218
00:18:51,167 --> 00:18:53,000
Please mom,

219
00:18:53,417 --> 00:18:55,751
you don't have to be good to daddy.

220
00:18:56,584 --> 00:18:58,918
You don't even have to talk to him.

221
00:18:59,792 --> 00:19:01,792
But let's live together again.

222
00:19:03,334 --> 00:19:04,918
Try to understand me,

223
00:19:05,792 --> 00:19:07,459
give me some time.

224
00:19:08,501 --> 00:19:12,584
It's too painful for a child
at your age to feel.

225
00:19:14,209 --> 00:19:19,375
I can't stand living
with him anymore.

226
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,250
What's so painful?

227
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,918
You're a woman like I am.

228
00:19:29,459 --> 00:19:32,334
When you grow up,
you will understand.

229
00:19:39,876 --> 00:19:40,959
Go to sleep.

230
00:19:44,959 --> 00:19:46,417
Just don't think too much,

231
00:19:46,918 --> 00:19:48,625
give me a chance,

232
00:19:48,626 --> 00:19:49,918
give me some time.

233
00:20:14,834 --> 00:20:18,959
Oh dear.. Oh my.. NINJA. NINJA.

234
00:20:20,417 --> 00:20:22,042
Help! OHH! ONN!

235
00:20:22,083 --> 00:20:23,501
It's NINJA, hurry up!

236
00:20:25,501 --> 00:20:26,750
What's it, mom?

237
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:27,959
NINJA! It's right there.

238
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,751
Take him away. Throw him out.

239
00:20:30,751 --> 00:20:32,584
OHH, don't!

240
00:20:32,876 --> 00:20:34,556
Haven't I told you,
not to bring him here.

241
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,292
There're food in the refrigerator,
warm it up yourself.

242
00:20:55,334 --> 00:20:56,560
I have an appointment,
got to be hurry.

243
00:20:56,584 --> 00:20:58,375
Save sandwitches for lunch,

244
00:20:58,417 --> 00:21:01,459
or you may buy anything
from the store downstair,

245
00:21:01,501 --> 00:21:03,584
I've left some money
in the drawer in my room.

246
00:21:05,125 --> 00:21:07,000
Oh, one other thing,

247
00:21:07,042 --> 00:21:07,959
it would be good
if you will stop by sometime,

248
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,800
to see your brother
at the nursery downstair.

249
00:21:10,667 --> 00:21:11,501
Let's go.

250
00:21:19,584 --> 00:21:21,375
Are you hungry?

251
00:21:22,042 --> 00:21:23,918
I'll warm something for you to eat.

252
00:21:24,167 --> 00:21:25,876
I'm not hungry,
I'm not gonna eat.

253
00:21:28,626 --> 00:21:31,834
What we'll have
for breakfast look delicious.

254
00:21:32,501 --> 00:21:34,167
I won't eat.

255
00:21:38,125 --> 00:21:39,792
Come on, try a little.

256
00:21:41,709 --> 00:21:43,000
NINJA.

257
00:21:43,042 --> 00:21:44,542
OHH...

258
00:21:47,042 --> 00:21:49,500
I love you.

259
00:21:49,501 --> 00:21:51,959
What if Mr. NIRUN wouldn't go for it?

260
00:21:52,042 --> 00:21:53,709
We've got to find someone else then.

261
00:21:54,167 --> 00:21:56,834
But if finally this doesn't work.

262
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:58,834
Then, everyone for themselves.

263
00:21:58,959 --> 00:22:02,000
Really, having to meet
with Mr.NIRUN for just few times,

264
00:22:02,042 --> 00:22:04,059
I've already used nearly every bit
of my endurance,

265
00:22:04,083 --> 00:22:07,250
and if it's not for a tiny chance
of success I saw,

266
00:22:07,375 --> 00:22:09,000
I would have lost my patient by now.

267
00:22:11,542 --> 00:22:13,042
Wait for me.

268
00:22:28,083 --> 00:22:31,000
Where do you think our house is?

269
00:22:31,667 --> 00:22:35,000
There, may be,
over the horizon there.

270
00:22:36,667 --> 00:22:37,918
That's very far.

271
00:22:39,125 --> 00:22:41,459
I wonder what's daddy doing?

272
00:22:46,125 --> 00:22:49,125
He must be very lonely.

273
00:22:51,667 --> 00:22:52,792
Let's get back inside.

274
00:23:05,584 --> 00:23:07,083
Here's your brother.

275
00:23:07,209 --> 00:23:08,250
What a baby

276
00:23:08,292 --> 00:23:10,125
how annoying.

277
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,876
Oh baby, don't cry.

278
00:23:12,959 --> 00:23:13,751
Whoa!

279
00:23:14,501 --> 00:23:16,250
Your mother called,
she'll be late,

280
00:23:16,292 --> 00:23:17,935
she asked me to bring
your brother up here.

281
00:23:17,959 --> 00:23:19,059
Now if he's still crying like this,

282
00:23:19,083 --> 00:23:20,584
we might not take him anymore.

283
00:23:20,626 --> 00:23:25,042
Quiet, please, don't cry.

284
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:40,459
The prince burnt
the witch's castle down,

285
00:23:40,501 --> 00:23:43,834
and all her magical power
was destroyed,

286
00:23:44,125 --> 00:23:50,042
the witch became an old
and helpless woman.

287
00:23:50,459 --> 00:23:54,292
The prince and the princess

288
00:23:54,334 --> 00:23:56,167
then got married,

289
00:23:56,209 --> 00:23:59,751
and lived happily everafter

290
00:23:59,834 --> 00:24:00,667
that's the end.

291
00:24:00,668 --> 00:24:03,083
Why so soon?

292
00:24:03,125 --> 00:24:06,083
There're still some of witch's troops?

293
00:24:06,584 --> 00:24:08,250
Just forget about them, would you?

294
00:24:08,292 --> 00:24:12,834
Your story was not fun,
daddy's was better.

295
00:24:18,083 --> 00:24:19,375
You're already drunk,

296
00:24:19,501 --> 00:24:20,792
better go home, please,

297
00:24:20,834 --> 00:24:21,918
it's very late.

298
00:24:21,959 --> 00:24:23,501
I'm just drunk of you.

299
00:24:23,542 --> 00:24:26,709
Don't be kidding, please go.

300
00:24:26,751 --> 00:24:29,000
I'm very tired, please.

301
00:24:29,334 --> 00:24:30,876
Okay, I'll go.

302
00:24:30,918 --> 00:24:33,083
But you should wait
for me again tomorrow.

303
00:24:33,167 --> 00:24:34,501
I'll pick you up.

304
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,250
But we already had two meals
together today.

305
00:24:37,751 --> 00:24:40,667
Every meal everyday
with you will be fine for me.

306
00:24:40,709 --> 00:24:41,959
Here you go again.

307
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,417
Just drive carefully.

308
00:24:44,626 --> 00:24:47,792
And please don't forget,
you had promised,

309
00:24:47,834 --> 00:24:49,792
you'd arrange for me a meeting
with Mr.CHATREE.

310
00:24:50,292 --> 00:24:52,042
I won't forget,

311
00:24:52,083 --> 00:24:53,334
be seeing you.

312
00:25:01,125 --> 00:25:02,292
Why don't you go?

313
00:25:02,792 --> 00:25:04,876
Gentleman's duty,

314
00:25:04,918 --> 00:25:06,791
Gotta see you in,

315
00:25:06,792 --> 00:25:07,792
Okay.

316
00:25:11,334 --> 00:25:12,334
OHH!

317
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,334
Hi kid.

318
00:25:16,834 --> 00:25:17,876
Good night.

319
00:25:30,083 --> 00:25:32,667
My god, what's going om?

320
00:25:32,709 --> 00:25:33,792
Why're you not in bed?

321
00:25:33,834 --> 00:25:36,834
Sis told us daddy's fairy tale.

322
00:25:38,459 --> 00:25:40,584
I told you to put your brothers
to bed early?

323
00:25:41,083 --> 00:25:44,083
Is your daddy's tale more important
than my order?

324
00:25:44,417 --> 00:25:46,626
Look at this, what a mess?

325
00:25:46,959 --> 00:25:47,918
I've been very tired through the day,

326
00:25:47,959 --> 00:25:49,959
and still I have to clean up
all this mess.

327
00:25:51,375 --> 00:25:52,876
This should be finished,

328
00:25:52,918 --> 00:25:55,125
there'll be no more
of this stupid fairy tale.

329
00:25:55,167 --> 00:25:57,292
If you throw it away,
I will not live here.

330
00:25:58,292 --> 00:25:59,292
What did you say?

331
00:25:59,293 --> 00:26:00,416
I won't live here.

332
00:26:00,417 --> 00:26:02,459
Now I know, you hate daddy,

333
00:26:02,501 --> 00:26:03,751
you have a new boyfriend.

334
00:26:03,834 --> 00:26:04,918
What?

335
00:26:04,959 --> 00:26:06,810
You divorced because you want
to have an affair.

336
00:26:06,834 --> 00:26:07,959
Stop it!

337
00:26:08,876 --> 00:26:11,375
I hate you...I hate you.

338
00:26:11,876 --> 00:26:12,792
OHH.

339
00:26:15,709 --> 00:26:16,709
OHH.

340
00:26:17,626 --> 00:26:20,167
Listen to me, I'm sorry.

341
00:26:21,334 --> 00:26:23,083
You don't understand,

342
00:26:23,125 --> 00:26:24,501
you were wrong about me.

343
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:27,876
OHH. OHH.

344
00:26:31,167 --> 00:26:32,000
ONN.

345
00:26:40,501 --> 00:26:41,791
OHH.

346
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:43,751
There's nothing between me
and Mr.NIRUN.

347
00:26:44,834 --> 00:26:45,959
UMM, quiet.

348
00:26:46,501 --> 00:26:48,501
I try to be good to him,

349
00:26:48,542 --> 00:26:52,125
because I want him
to help finance my magazine.

350
00:26:52,167 --> 00:26:54,000
Otherwise I wouldn't make it.

351
00:26:55,167 --> 00:26:57,167
OHH, open the door.

352
00:26:58,250 --> 00:26:59,042
OHH.

353
00:27:00,792 --> 00:27:01,667
OHH.

354
00:27:39,792 --> 00:27:40,792
OHH.

355
00:27:42,959 --> 00:27:46,501
OHH, would you come out
and talk to me?

356
00:27:46,751 --> 00:27:48,209
I've got to go to work.

357
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:52,083
I'll have to finish up the magazine
for the printing house.

358
00:28:03,375 --> 00:28:04,459
OHH.

359
00:28:10,626 --> 00:28:14,167
Okay, if you don't want to talk now.

360
00:28:14,792 --> 00:28:16,125
Just take care of your brothers.

361
00:28:16,459 --> 00:28:18,375
We'll talk when I get back.

362
00:28:18,584 --> 00:28:20,144
I've already warm up
some food for you.

363
00:28:29,125 --> 00:28:31,918
ONN, be good,

364
00:28:32,042 --> 00:28:33,375
take care of your sister.

365
00:28:34,459 --> 00:28:36,417
I'll cook chicken-musmun
for our dinner.

366
00:29:08,959 --> 00:29:10,834
Mom said nothing's going on.

367
00:29:11,042 --> 00:29:12,209
Do you believe her?

368
00:29:25,167 --> 00:29:27,041
Oh, my goodness, good morning.

369
00:29:27,042 --> 00:29:32,334
Hello UMM, Hi.

370
00:29:33,501 --> 00:29:34,541
It's strange,

371
00:29:34,542 --> 00:29:37,292
he always cries once he's in here.

372
00:29:37,334 --> 00:29:38,334
Come on, dear.

373
00:29:39,334 --> 00:29:42,334
Kids are all like this,

374
00:29:42,375 --> 00:29:43,709
he'll be quiet soon.

375
00:29:43,834 --> 00:29:46,000
Come, come to me.

376
00:29:47,459 --> 00:29:51,501
Especially him, he's very cute,

377
00:29:51,542 --> 00:29:53,334
easy to take care of,
always in good mood.

378
00:29:53,375 --> 00:29:55,416
Just don't worry.

379
00:29:55,417 --> 00:29:57,709
He's already begun to love us here.

380
00:29:57,834 --> 00:29:58,999
I must go, it's getting late.

381
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,375
Yes.

382
00:30:07,250 --> 00:30:08,501
I'm sorry.

383
00:30:44,042 --> 00:30:46,375
OHH, where're you going?

384
00:30:48,501 --> 00:30:50,709
I'll go to see dad,
I'll live with him.

385
00:30:50,959 --> 00:30:53,167
Let me go with you.

386
00:30:53,250 --> 00:30:54,918
I'll get my stuff.

387
00:30:55,959 --> 00:30:57,167
Don't bring too much.

388
00:31:18,375 --> 00:31:20,542
Let's go home, NINJA.

389
00:31:36,209 --> 00:31:37,334
Hurry up, ONN.

390
00:31:52,042 --> 00:31:54,125
You're stealing mom's money.

391
00:31:54,834 --> 00:31:56,459
We need to have some money,

392
00:31:56,501 --> 00:31:58,334
otherwise, how can we go to see dad?

393
00:32:08,292 --> 00:32:09,459
Come on, ONN.

394
00:32:24,501 --> 00:32:27,083
OHH, Let's take dad's story with us.

395
00:32:28,709 --> 00:32:29,501
Go.

396
00:32:36,501 --> 00:32:38,166
Hey, wait.

397
00:32:38,167 --> 00:32:39,518
Going down the elevator
with the backpack like this,

398
00:32:39,542 --> 00:32:41,167
wanna get caught or what?

399
00:32:41,209 --> 00:32:42,584
Then how can we get out of here?

400
00:32:42,667 --> 00:32:44,167
There, the fire escape.

401
00:32:45,876 --> 00:32:46,834
Come, ONN.

402
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,042
What about UMM?

403
00:32:48,083 --> 00:32:50,292
Are we going to leave him
here with mom?

404
00:32:50,334 --> 00:32:52,574
It would be a very hard time
for him before he grows up.

405
00:32:54,250 --> 00:32:55,876
We'll take him with us.

406
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:56,584
Let's go.

407
00:33:00,751 --> 00:33:04,792
Miss, is the English teacher
of room 702 in?

408
00:33:19,167 --> 00:33:21,417
Just wait for me here,
I'll go get UMM.

409
00:33:22,709 --> 00:33:23,834
Let's do it.

410
00:33:31,751 --> 00:33:34,291
Could you just sleep?

411
00:33:34,292 --> 00:33:36,249
Here, your brother is really
what people can't stand,

412
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:37,291
crying all the time.

413
00:33:37,292 --> 00:33:38,501
Doesn't he know how to sleep?

414
00:33:39,042 --> 00:33:40,459
So let me take him to my apartment.

415
00:33:40,501 --> 00:33:42,709
Your mother's gonna ask
for a return then.

416
00:33:43,209 --> 00:33:44,768
Here. If you want to take care of him,
it's got to be here.

417
00:33:44,792 --> 00:33:45,834
Oh my.

418
00:33:45,876 --> 00:33:47,709
If we knew he's such annoying,

419
00:33:47,751 --> 00:33:50,834
- we wouldn't have taken him.
- Definitely, how boring.

420
00:33:51,751 --> 00:33:54,501
UMM, don't cry,

421
00:33:54,542 --> 00:33:56,459
I'll take you to see daddy.

422
00:34:10,959 --> 00:34:11,751
There he is.

423
00:34:11,792 --> 00:34:12,792
Oh shit, cops. Let's go.

424
00:34:12,793 --> 00:34:13,913
Hey boy, where're you going?

425
00:34:14,250 --> 00:34:15,792
Hey, stop!

426
00:34:22,292 --> 00:34:22,792
What shall we do?

427
00:34:22,876 --> 00:34:23,626
Take the stairs.

428
00:34:25,834 --> 00:34:26,959
Don't shoot, they're kids.

429
00:34:35,417 --> 00:34:36,918
Guard! Stop those kids!

430
00:34:36,959 --> 00:34:38,834
Don't shoot.

431
00:34:41,834 --> 00:34:44,291
Stop the kids!

432
00:34:44,292 --> 00:34:46,000
Don't let them go!

433
00:34:46,125 --> 00:34:47,334
Security! Stop the kids!

434
00:34:47,375 --> 00:34:49,125
We're police.

435
00:34:49,167 --> 00:34:49,751
Cops.

436
00:34:53,250 --> 00:34:55,792
- What's going on? What?
- Stop!

437
00:34:57,542 --> 00:35:01,375
Hey! Hey, What're you doing?

438
00:35:04,667 --> 00:35:06,959
Stop the kids! Quick!

439
00:35:07,542 --> 00:35:08,542
The stuff is with them!

440
00:35:11,292 --> 00:35:11,876
Where are they?

441
00:35:11,877 --> 00:35:14,167
That way, they went that way.

442
00:35:15,334 --> 00:35:17,417
What happened?

443
00:35:17,459 --> 00:35:19,626
There, over there.
There're police everywhere.

444
00:35:19,667 --> 00:35:20,876
Where? Let's take a look.

445
00:35:43,918 --> 00:35:44,999
What happened?

446
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,918
- The kids, they ran that way.
- Who?

447
00:36:00,375 --> 00:36:03,250
Hey BAN, cops are after us.

448
00:36:03,375 --> 00:36:06,417
Quick, they're comimg.

449
00:36:06,459 --> 00:36:07,250
You two go with DEN,

450
00:36:07,250 --> 00:36:08,250
I'll handle them.

451
00:36:08,918 --> 00:36:10,751
Get out of the way! Police!

452
00:36:14,667 --> 00:36:15,375
Follow me.

453
00:36:15,709 --> 00:36:16,709
Out of the way please!

454
00:36:24,959 --> 00:36:27,501
Out of the way please!

455
00:36:42,042 --> 00:36:42,792
Stop!

456
00:36:45,751 --> 00:36:46,876
Come on, hurry up.

457
00:36:48,292 --> 00:36:50,125
Quick! Don't be afraid.

458
00:36:52,292 --> 00:36:54,292
Damn! This is mine.

459
00:36:54,501 --> 00:36:56,876
We're police, sorry.

460
00:36:57,959 --> 00:37:00,417
- Be careful, it's very high.
- Hurry up!

461
00:37:06,542 --> 00:37:07,667
Here's one of them.

462
00:37:08,042 --> 00:37:09,124
Take him.

463
00:37:09,125 --> 00:37:10,125
Excuse me.

464
00:37:10,667 --> 00:37:12,000
One of you, That way! Go!

465
00:37:13,334 --> 00:37:13,918
Come on.

466
00:37:14,667 --> 00:37:15,876
They're still after us.

467
00:37:18,125 --> 00:37:19,542
Jump!

468
00:37:21,876 --> 00:37:22,667
Where's my brother?

469
00:37:22,668 --> 00:37:24,125
Where're you going?

470
00:37:24,501 --> 00:37:25,667
I've got to see my brother.

471
00:37:25,918 --> 00:37:26,542
Let go of me!

472
00:37:26,751 --> 00:37:27,751
The police's got him.

473
00:37:27,876 --> 00:37:28,876
I've got to see him.

474
00:37:29,709 --> 00:37:32,334
Do you want to get caught
like your brother? Idiot!

475
00:37:32,876 --> 00:37:34,292
Hey, they're here!

476
00:37:34,501 --> 00:37:35,542
Follow me, idiot!

477
00:37:35,584 --> 00:37:36,125
Where's the stuff?

478
00:37:36,167 --> 00:37:38,527
I've already had it hidden.
We'll go back and get it later.

479
00:37:51,209 --> 00:37:52,417
Where are you going?

480
00:37:52,501 --> 00:37:53,501
We're going home.

481
00:37:53,542 --> 00:37:54,751
Let's go.

482
00:38:37,959 --> 00:38:39,751
Just don't worry,

483
00:38:39,792 --> 00:38:41,501
he doesn't have the stuff,

484
00:38:41,542 --> 00:38:43,083
they're gonna release him.

485
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,125
Come on, let's get our stuff.

486
00:39:01,167 --> 00:39:02,542
Damn it.

487
00:39:02,959 --> 00:39:04,417
Where the hell...

488
00:39:09,751 --> 00:39:10,959
Damn it.

489
00:39:11,751 --> 00:39:12,751
It's gone.

490
00:39:13,042 --> 00:39:15,209
The basket where
I hid the dope was gone.

491
00:39:24,083 --> 00:39:25,626
Did you look all over?

492
00:39:25,792 --> 00:39:27,459
Did you mistake it
for another basket?

493
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,459
Did I mistake it?

494
00:39:30,125 --> 00:39:32,751
It's a ratten basket at this size.

495
00:39:33,250 --> 00:39:34,584
But it's gone.

496
00:39:35,209 --> 00:39:38,000
The BOSS's gonna kill us.

497
00:39:38,792 --> 00:39:41,083
Children nowadays really scare me,

498
00:39:41,125 --> 00:39:42,667
pushing dope is one thing.

499
00:39:42,709 --> 00:39:43,918
Hey, quiet.

500
00:39:44,918 --> 00:39:46,458
Did you read the paper,
the other day?

501
00:39:46,459 --> 00:39:50,666
A boy at 11 raped a woman.

502
00:39:50,667 --> 00:39:55,708
This day, every boy up from nine,
they're already dangerous.

503
00:39:55,709 --> 00:39:58,167
Hey! Where's the boy
from 10th floor.

504
00:40:05,626 --> 00:40:08,000
Hey kids! Open the door!

505
00:40:08,459 --> 00:40:09,250
Daddy.

506
00:40:17,667 --> 00:40:19,292
- Dad.
- Daddy.

507
00:40:29,083 --> 00:40:30,167
Daddy.

508
00:40:31,167 --> 00:40:32,334
Dad!

509
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,334
Daddy!

510
00:40:48,083 --> 00:40:50,501
Where's daddy?

511
00:40:50,667 --> 00:40:52,167
He probably went out.

512
00:40:56,542 --> 00:40:58,792
We'll wait, he'll be home soon.

513
00:41:03,375 --> 00:41:07,208
Hey, OHH, ONN, UMM.

514
00:41:07,209 --> 00:41:09,083
You're all here.

515
00:41:09,125 --> 00:41:10,292
How did you get here?

516
00:41:15,876 --> 00:41:17,542
Where is your mom?

517
00:41:17,751 --> 00:41:19,751
She went to the market.

518
00:41:19,834 --> 00:41:22,125
Do you know where's my father?

519
00:41:22,250 --> 00:41:24,751
He moved. He's moved to Chiangmai.

520
00:41:25,083 --> 00:41:27,751
He's moved to Chiangmai?

521
00:41:39,792 --> 00:41:41,792
ARPHA Publishing.

522
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:45,209
She's not here.

523
00:41:48,542 --> 00:41:49,667
When?

524
00:41:53,125 --> 00:41:54,583
Are you sure?

525
00:41:54,584 --> 00:41:55,791
Did you look all over?

526
00:41:55,792 --> 00:41:57,792
Did you ask the maid to
check inside the apartment?

527
00:41:59,709 --> 00:42:01,292
Stay here, Ninja.

528
00:42:01,375 --> 00:42:03,792
It's better than staying
at the apartment.

529
00:42:06,167 --> 00:42:07,751
Hey, where's the bottle?

530
00:42:13,918 --> 00:42:15,375
Oh.. Here it is.

531
00:42:18,751 --> 00:42:20,918
What's this?

532
00:42:27,167 --> 00:42:30,083
Something to ent?

533
00:42:30,125 --> 00:42:31,626
Baby powder may be.

534
00:42:31,667 --> 00:42:33,209
Torefill the empty can.

535
00:42:34,375 --> 00:42:37,334
Oh year, this brand?

536
00:42:41,334 --> 00:42:43,209
Would you get me some hot water?

537
00:42:43,250 --> 00:42:45,209
Why not.

538
00:42:47,918 --> 00:42:48,918
Hurry please.

539
00:42:50,042 --> 00:42:52,125
Don't cry UMM.

540
00:42:52,167 --> 00:42:54,334
I'll make you some

541
00:42:54,375 --> 00:42:57,042
just take some water.

542
00:42:58,417 --> 00:43:00,626
How'd you know
my daunght stole her brother?

543
00:43:00,667 --> 00:43:01,667
Any witness?

544
00:43:01,668 --> 00:43:03,501
It needs no witness.

545
00:43:03,626 --> 00:43:04,976
It's your dauhter who come in here

546
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,626
and asked to take care of the baby.

547
00:43:06,667 --> 00:43:07,876
You can say anything you want.

548
00:43:07,918 --> 00:43:09,709
But you have to take
full responsibility.

549
00:43:09,751 --> 00:43:11,667
A baby just disappeared from here.

550
00:43:11,751 --> 00:43:13,667
Do you think you can deny
your responsibility.

551
00:43:13,709 --> 00:43:15,999
We should discuss this
at the police station.

552
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,333
Don't threaten me!

553
00:43:17,334 --> 00:43:18,334
I'm not afraid.

554
00:43:18,335 --> 00:43:20,775
I'm in this business for many years,
and never had a problem.

555
00:43:20,876 --> 00:43:22,876
Once I took in your kid,
it's all kind of trouble.

556
00:43:22,959 --> 00:43:23,999
I'll refund your money.

557
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,375
Refund? That's too easy.

558
00:43:27,042 --> 00:43:27,834
Shut up!

559
00:43:36,709 --> 00:43:37,709
You son of a bitch!

560
00:43:38,167 --> 00:43:39,833
Do you know how I trusted you?

561
00:43:39,834 --> 00:43:41,458
I had you handle it.

562
00:43:41,459 --> 00:43:43,542
Did you know how much
that's gonna cost me?

563
00:43:44,042 --> 00:43:48,334
You dumb shit!

564
00:43:48,375 --> 00:43:51,792
Get him here.

565
00:43:53,709 --> 00:43:59,083
You too!

566
00:43:59,125 --> 00:44:00,083
Untie them.

567
00:44:00,834 --> 00:44:04,542
If you can't get my srufff buck.

568
00:44:04,876 --> 00:44:06,250
I'm gonna sell you to the farm,

569
00:44:06,959 --> 00:44:08,000
understand?

570
00:44:08,501 --> 00:44:13,042
Get the hell out!

571
00:44:13,876 --> 00:44:15,751
What're you looking at?

572
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,542
You're careless,

573
00:44:17,584 --> 00:44:19,750
that's why he's really pissed.

574
00:44:19,751 --> 00:44:22,125
What a skin here.

575
00:44:23,083 --> 00:44:25,834
Don't cry, you deserve it.

576
00:44:26,209 --> 00:44:27,292
SUAY.

577
00:44:27,334 --> 00:44:29,000
The agent is bringing
in some new kids.

578
00:44:29,459 --> 00:44:30,417
Let's take a look.

579
00:44:30,459 --> 00:44:32,709
Let's see how new they are.

580
00:44:38,083 --> 00:44:41,501
Follow me.

581
00:44:43,459 --> 00:44:44,918
Hey, you there, stop crying.

582
00:44:44,959 --> 00:44:46,459
Come on. Nobody's gonna kill you.

583
00:44:47,959 --> 00:44:49,124
- Are they new?
- I want to go home.

584
00:44:49,125 --> 00:44:50,042
Home? How?

585
00:44:50,083 --> 00:44:52,000
Your parents had you come with us.

586
00:44:52,584 --> 00:44:54,249
Are you going to disappoint them?

587
00:44:54,250 --> 00:44:57,751
This is how your parents got the money

588
00:44:57,792 --> 00:45:00,250
to repair your home,
don't you know that?

589
00:45:00,292 --> 00:45:02,333
Come on, come down here.

590
00:45:02,334 --> 00:45:04,042
This one is really new.

591
00:45:04,083 --> 00:45:06,125
Don't you want to get hurt?

592
00:45:06,417 --> 00:45:07,459
Now don't cry.

593
00:45:07,626 --> 00:45:08,751
This is something easy,

594
00:45:08,792 --> 00:45:10,125
soon you'll be going home.

595
00:45:10,584 --> 00:45:12,876
Take her to see MOM.

596
00:45:18,209 --> 00:45:20,792
Have you heard anything about Eurng?

597
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,249
Still missed her?

598
00:45:23,250 --> 00:45:24,500
No one can be cured
from that dicease,

599
00:45:24,501 --> 00:45:28,667
that's why MOM get
to get rid of her.

600
00:45:28,959 --> 00:45:32,334
What apity, she's still so young.

601
00:45:33,042 --> 00:45:35,167
Here, go get me something to eat.

602
00:45:35,292 --> 00:45:37,042
You can keep the change.

603
00:45:43,375 --> 00:45:45,083
Nothing at all?

604
00:45:46,584 --> 00:45:49,959
Please let me know, it she calls.

605
00:45:52,042 --> 00:45:53,167
Thanks.

606
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,334
Shouldn't you call their father?

607
00:46:08,417 --> 00:46:10,292
May be he can do something.

608
00:46:18,167 --> 00:46:20,542
Where's the wing?

609
00:46:21,209 --> 00:46:22,834
Come on.

610
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,417
Don't just stick to the right.

611
00:46:26,459 --> 00:46:27,709
Switch this side, come on.

612
00:46:28,417 --> 00:46:29,417
Switch to the left!

613
00:46:32,417 --> 00:46:33,417
Coach.

614
00:46:33,834 --> 00:46:35,083
It's your phone.

615
00:46:39,209 --> 00:46:40,292
Take 10.

616
00:46:40,334 --> 00:46:41,334
We'll try again later.

617
00:46:52,167 --> 00:46:53,667
Hollo, Damrong here.

618
00:47:03,250 --> 00:47:04,167
Hello.

619
00:47:06,334 --> 00:47:09,375
This is PHA.

620
00:47:12,459 --> 00:47:14,334
What happened?

621
00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:17,709
Our children are gone.

622
00:47:18,709 --> 00:47:21,000
OHH took her brothers
back to the house.

623
00:47:21,542 --> 00:47:23,751
Once they learned you weren't there,

624
00:47:23,876 --> 00:47:25,459
they all disappeared.

625
00:47:29,250 --> 00:47:31,042
I've already reported to the police.

626
00:47:31,459 --> 00:47:33,751
I also called all OHH a friends.

627
00:47:34,375 --> 00:47:35,501
But nobody sees them.

628
00:47:41,167 --> 00:47:44,250
I can't think of anything right now.

629
00:47:44,292 --> 00:47:46,751
I'll fly to Bangkok rightaway.

630
00:47:47,501 --> 00:47:50,250
Why don't you try it again?

631
00:47:50,292 --> 00:47:51,709
How can I?

632
00:47:52,167 --> 00:47:55,959
- They already recognize us.
- You guys want to help, or what?

633
00:47:56,083 --> 00:47:58,709
Okay, it's okay.

634
00:47:58,959 --> 00:48:00,918
Just remember,

635
00:48:00,959 --> 00:48:04,375
it's a round rattan basket,

636
00:48:04,542 --> 00:48:06,292
with a yellow sheet.

637
00:48:06,334 --> 00:48:07,416
What if we can't find it?

638
00:48:07,417 --> 00:48:10,166
The BOSS would kill us both.

639
00:48:10,167 --> 00:48:12,459
I won't be around for him to kill.

640
00:48:12,501 --> 00:48:13,999
I'll take off to Pataya.

641
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,417
I"ll be with BOSS KIANG.

642
00:48:15,459 --> 00:48:17,125
Hey, let us go with you.

643
00:48:17,626 --> 00:48:19,334
I'm gonna take sun bath everyday.

644
00:48:19,375 --> 00:48:20,959
You bastard,

645
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,375
aren't you dark enough?

646
00:48:23,417 --> 00:48:26,250
You blackie, black.

647
00:48:26,292 --> 00:48:28,250
Let's get something to eat.

648
00:48:37,209 --> 00:48:39,750
Wait for me right here,

649
00:48:39,751 --> 00:48:40,834
and watch your brother.

650
00:49:03,209 --> 00:49:05,125
- Hey, I'm going out.
- See you later.

651
00:49:05,167 --> 00:49:05,667
Okay.

652
00:49:05,709 --> 00:49:06,709
Is that Phonelink?

653
00:49:07,542 --> 00:49:10,876
I have a message for 177099.

654
00:49:11,375 --> 00:49:12,375
Here.

655
00:49:18,626 --> 00:49:19,792
An ending Please,

656
00:49:20,792 --> 00:49:22,417
"I love you doddy."

657
00:49:23,876 --> 00:49:25,000
Thank you.

658
00:49:34,250 --> 00:49:35,250
Let's go.

659
00:49:44,292 --> 00:49:45,626
I'll be damn.

660
00:49:53,459 --> 00:49:54,375
Hole it.

661
00:49:54,417 --> 00:49:56,059
NOKLAE. Where the heck do
you think you're going?

662
00:49:56,083 --> 00:49:57,584
You can't get in there.

663
00:49:57,626 --> 00:49:58,667
See some relative off.

664
00:49:58,709 --> 00:50:00,292
Since when did you have a relative?

665
00:50:01,876 --> 00:50:02,918
Who cares.

666
00:50:06,792 --> 00:50:07,667
You...

667
00:50:20,292 --> 00:50:22,249
Hey THONG!

668
00:50:22,250 --> 00:50:23,458
Go tell the BOSS,

669
00:50:23,459 --> 00:50:24,666
I've found the basket.

670
00:50:24,667 --> 00:50:26,143
It's on 7 o'clock train to Chiangmai.

671
00:50:26,167 --> 00:50:27,375
It's leaving.

672
00:50:27,417 --> 00:50:28,459
I'll follow them.

673
00:50:29,292 --> 00:50:31,501
Tell him to pick me up.

674
00:50:31,542 --> 00:50:32,542
Pick you up, where?

675
00:50:32,792 --> 00:50:33,918
Where the hell does it stop?

676
00:50:33,959 --> 00:50:38,083
Lopburi, koraj,
Kampangpetch, Machongsorn,

677
00:50:38,125 --> 00:50:39,226
- those are where it stops.
- Lopbburi.

678
00:50:39,250 --> 00:50:40,666
Pick me up at Lopburi.

679
00:50:40,667 --> 00:50:42,876
You're bullshitting, smart ass.

680
00:51:39,125 --> 00:51:41,292
PHA...listem,

681
00:51:41,334 --> 00:51:43,416
I've just got a page from OHH,

682
00:51:43,417 --> 00:51:45,500
they're taking 7 o'clock train,

683
00:51:45,501 --> 00:51:48,417
bound for Chiangmai to see me.

684
00:51:48,459 --> 00:51:50,208
I think you'd better go
to the Bangkok Station

685
00:51:50,209 --> 00:51:52,167
to see if there's anything

686
00:51:52,209 --> 00:51:53,918
we can do.

687
00:51:53,959 --> 00:51:55,792
I'll be waiting for them here.

688
00:51:55,834 --> 00:51:57,000
Okay, let's make it this way.

689
00:51:57,042 --> 00:51:59,042
I'll catch this train in lampang.

690
00:51:59,167 --> 00:52:00,834
From lampang to Chiangmai,

691
00:52:00,876 --> 00:52:03,167
I'll surely find them on that train.

692
00:52:03,292 --> 00:52:04,375
Okay?

693
00:52:05,292 --> 00:52:06,459
What?

694
00:52:11,042 --> 00:52:12,626
Not finish yet?

695
00:52:12,834 --> 00:52:13,542
Not yet.

696
00:52:13,584 --> 00:52:15,250
Anybody out for the parts?

697
00:52:15,292 --> 00:52:17,501
Yes, they'll be here tomorrow.

698
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,334
BOSS! BOSS!

699
00:52:22,375 --> 00:52:23,292
What's up?

700
00:52:23,334 --> 00:52:24,750
NOKLAE has found the stuff?

701
00:52:24,751 --> 00:52:25,501
My stuff?

702
00:52:25,542 --> 00:52:27,458
Whoever got it is
on the 7 o'clock train.

703
00:52:27,459 --> 00:52:28,539
NOKLAK is going after them.

704
00:52:28,959 --> 00:52:29,876
The train just took off.

705
00:52:29,918 --> 00:52:30,999
That train?

706
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,209
He wants you to pick him up.

707
00:52:32,584 --> 00:52:34,249
Quick! Get the car.

708
00:52:34,250 --> 00:52:35,959
Where does he want me pick him up?

709
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:36,709
Lopburi.

710
00:52:36,751 --> 00:52:38,351
That's dumb,
why all the way to Lopburi.

711
00:53:17,918 --> 00:53:18,751
ONN.

712
00:53:26,959 --> 00:53:28,334
No, that can't be done.

713
00:53:28,542 --> 00:53:31,667
I don't have the authority
to stop the whole train,

714
00:53:31,834 --> 00:53:34,125
Just to search for the children

715
00:53:34,250 --> 00:53:36,501
who want to go to Chiangmai
to see their father.

716
00:53:36,542 --> 00:53:38,542
But they are runaway children.

717
00:53:38,834 --> 00:53:41,042
If they'd already connected
your husband

718
00:53:41,083 --> 00:53:43,416
to pick them up
at the Chiangmai station,

719
00:53:43,417 --> 00:53:45,959
it didn't seem to be
any problem at all.

720
00:53:48,459 --> 00:53:49,292
Thank you.

721
00:53:55,125 --> 00:53:59,000
UMM, quiet...don't cry.

722
00:53:59,042 --> 00:53:59,834
He may be hungry.

723
00:54:00,667 --> 00:54:02,584
Yes, he must be hungry.

724
00:54:03,792 --> 00:54:05,375
Oh no...no more hot water.

725
00:54:05,417 --> 00:54:06,792
I forgot again.

726
00:54:07,292 --> 00:54:09,792
You have to get it
from the dining car.

727
00:54:13,167 --> 00:54:15,417
ONN, watch your brother,
I'll make him some milk.

728
00:54:21,083 --> 00:54:22,292
Where is the dining car?

729
00:54:22,334 --> 00:54:24,667
There, two cars that way.

730
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,417
Keep your eyes on your brother.

731
00:54:32,334 --> 00:54:33,534
Where're you guys heading for?

732
00:54:33,584 --> 00:54:34,792
To see our dad.

733
00:54:34,876 --> 00:54:35,834
Where?

734
00:54:35,835 --> 00:54:37,042
Chiangmai.

735
00:54:37,209 --> 00:54:38,501
Chiangmai.

736
00:54:38,751 --> 00:54:41,083
Hey, my home is also in Chiangmai,

737
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:44,501
first time on train, right?

738
00:54:44,584 --> 00:54:46,459
You live in Chiangmai,

739
00:54:46,501 --> 00:54:49,667
do you know where my father is.

740
00:54:49,709 --> 00:54:51,167
His name is DAMRONG.

741
00:54:51,209 --> 00:54:53,876
He's a football coach there.

742
00:54:53,918 --> 00:54:55,501
Let me think.

743
00:54:56,083 --> 00:55:00,584
I should know...

744
00:55:00,626 --> 00:55:02,083
a football coach,

745
00:55:02,667 --> 00:55:03,918
his name is DAMRONG, right?

746
00:55:03,959 --> 00:55:04,918
Right.

747
00:55:05,042 --> 00:55:08,999
I know all football players
in Chiangmai.

748
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,250
Your father shouldn'be hard to find.

749
00:55:11,334 --> 00:55:12,167
Ticket...

750
00:55:14,501 --> 00:55:15,876
tichket please.

751
00:55:16,083 --> 00:55:17,209
Where are you going?

752
00:55:39,417 --> 00:55:40,459
Can't make it BOSS,

753
00:55:40,501 --> 00:55:41,894
by the time we get to this station,

754
00:55:41,918 --> 00:55:42,751
they'll be gone.

755
00:55:42,752 --> 00:55:43,959
Go for Lopburi then.

756
00:56:31,792 --> 00:56:33,167
Where have you been?

757
00:56:33,834 --> 00:56:35,501
I went for a walk.

758
00:56:36,501 --> 00:56:39,542
OHH, he's from Chiangmai.

759
00:56:39,626 --> 00:56:41,834
If daddy doesn't pick us up,

760
00:56:41,876 --> 00:56:44,626
he'll take us to him.

761
00:56:44,876 --> 00:56:45,876
Be quiet,

762
00:56:48,042 --> 00:56:49,482
dad will pick us up,
no matter what.

763
00:56:50,834 --> 00:56:54,292
Sleep...

764
00:57:03,667 --> 00:57:06,083
If you keep crying,
I won't take you to see daddy.

765
00:57:06,834 --> 00:57:11,083
Better tell him father's tale,
he likes it.

766
00:57:11,125 --> 00:57:12,542
That's right.

767
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
Get me that box.

768
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,042
You lay down here, okay?

769
00:57:30,292 --> 00:57:39,751
Here it is, see?

770
00:57:40,125 --> 00:57:43,918
Once upon a time,

771
00:57:43,959 --> 00:57:46,209
there are children living
in a village.

772
00:57:46,250 --> 00:57:49,125
Those children run away from home,

773
00:57:49,167 --> 00:57:52,876
to play in the garden near a castle...

774
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:59,751
The cat started crying,

775
00:57:59,918 --> 00:58:01,667
and the dog was crying too.

776
00:58:02,125 --> 00:58:03,560
The elephant was larger
than other animals

777
00:58:03,584 --> 00:58:04,626
and he could talk,

778
00:58:04,667 --> 00:58:07,250
so he told the Prince
about what had happened.

779
00:58:08,042 --> 00:58:10,249
The Prince was very pity on them,

780
00:58:10,250 --> 00:58:12,292
therefore he promised that

781
00:58:12,334 --> 00:58:15,709
he would take the children
back to their family.

782
00:59:02,334 --> 00:59:04,626
Check it out. Did he get off?

783
00:59:12,876 --> 00:59:13,709
There he is.

784
00:59:14,209 --> 00:59:14,834
Let's go.

785
00:59:18,042 --> 00:59:19,375
- Hey, NOKLAE.
- It's not him.

786
00:59:20,250 --> 00:59:22,417
What the hell is he?

787
00:59:23,250 --> 00:59:25,834
Did he say Lopburi?

788
00:59:25,959 --> 00:59:26,792
He might catch another train.

789
00:59:26,793 --> 00:59:28,501
What another one? Go find him.

790
00:59:28,626 --> 00:59:29,250
Stop complaining.

791
00:59:29,250 --> 00:59:30,000
Yes.

792
00:59:32,667 --> 00:59:33,751
Check all the cars.

793
00:59:41,667 --> 00:59:42,875
He's here, BOSS.

794
00:59:42,876 --> 00:59:45,334
- Hey, NOKLAE!
- NOKLAE, you son of a bitch.

795
00:59:45,375 --> 00:59:49,667
NOKLAE, wake up!

796
00:59:50,125 --> 00:59:51,667
Son of a bitch!

797
01:00:49,292 --> 01:00:51,042
Pardon me.

798
01:00:51,083 --> 01:00:53,876
Is the 7 o'clock train
to Chiangmai here yet?

799
01:00:54,125 --> 01:00:55,209
Coming in right now.

800
01:01:01,501 --> 01:01:03,416
Will they make a stop here?

801
01:01:03,417 --> 01:01:05,417
No mam, still a long way.

802
01:02:01,417 --> 01:02:03,792
Mister, how many more stopa
before we get to Lopburi.

803
01:02:04,042 --> 01:02:05,501
It's almost 3 o'clock,

804
01:02:05,542 --> 01:02:07,209
we passed lopburi long time ago.

805
01:02:08,375 --> 01:02:10,834
Oh yeah?

806
01:02:11,459 --> 01:02:13,459
He'll kill me for sure.

807
01:03:39,125 --> 01:03:39,751
Hurry up.

808
01:03:42,542 --> 01:03:44,542
Get on the train
and bring him down here.

809
01:03:44,959 --> 01:03:46,459
Make sure you get my stuff back.

810
01:03:54,250 --> 01:03:55,167
Excuse me...

811
01:04:04,584 --> 01:04:05,501
OHH.

812
01:04:06,167 --> 01:04:07,042
ONN.

813
01:04:07,918 --> 01:04:08,918
OHH.

814
01:04:09,751 --> 01:04:10,501
ONN.

815
01:04:10,501 --> 01:04:11,209
PHA.

816
01:04:13,042 --> 01:04:14,416
What a hell?

817
01:04:14,417 --> 01:04:15,584
Where's the stuff?

818
01:04:15,751 --> 01:04:16,584
In the basket...

819
01:04:16,626 --> 01:04:18,375
I can't get to it.
It's under the baby.

820
01:04:19,167 --> 01:04:21,459
- What're you doing?
- Quick! The train is moving.

821
01:04:21,501 --> 01:04:24,708
OHH!

822
01:04:24,709 --> 01:04:27,042
Help! Somebody help!

823
01:04:27,083 --> 01:04:28,125
Just don't worry,

824
01:04:28,167 --> 01:04:29,918
I've searched from the 1st car.

825
01:04:29,959 --> 01:04:31,709
Before reaching Chiangmai.
We'll find them.

826
01:04:34,417 --> 01:04:41,375
- Kidnapper! Stop the train!
- Help! My brother!

827
01:04:41,626 --> 01:04:43,584
I want my brother back.

828
01:04:43,709 --> 01:04:44,876
OHH

829
01:04:47,626 --> 01:04:48,709
Are you ok?

830
01:04:48,751 --> 01:04:50,167
They took my brother.

831
01:04:51,250 --> 01:04:51,959
Hurry up!

832
01:04:52,292 --> 01:04:55,292
Don't take my brother!

833
01:05:00,751 --> 01:05:02,375
Help!

834
01:05:02,417 --> 01:05:03,250
OHH!

835
01:05:03,334 --> 01:05:05,167
OHH...

836
01:05:05,209 --> 01:05:06,929
Someone call the police!
Hey kid, don't go.

837
01:05:06,959 --> 01:05:09,501
Stupid! What's the baby for?

838
01:05:09,542 --> 01:05:10,542
Help!

839
01:05:11,459 --> 01:05:15,042
- OHH.
- Help...that's my child!

840
01:05:15,083 --> 01:05:16,042
Help!

841
01:05:16,083 --> 01:05:17,000
Where's the stuff?

842
01:05:17,042 --> 01:05:18,185
No time BOSS, let's go first.

843
01:05:18,209 --> 01:05:19,959
The stuff's in here.

844
01:05:20,834 --> 01:05:22,584
OHH

845
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:25,375
Don't take my brother!

846
01:05:25,542 --> 01:05:28,042
NOKLAE, take the baby.

847
01:05:29,751 --> 01:05:35,542
Police's here, take her in.

848
01:05:36,459 --> 01:05:38,751
Come on...Help get her in!

849
01:05:39,417 --> 01:05:40,167
Hurry up!

850
01:05:40,709 --> 01:05:44,000
Let go my sister.

851
01:05:55,709 --> 01:05:56,709
Where's the car?

852
01:05:57,125 --> 01:05:57,876
Over there!

853
01:05:59,042 --> 01:05:59,792
Get the car!

854
01:06:01,250 --> 01:06:04,584
Lampang 143 calling kelang.

855
01:06:05,042 --> 01:06:06,626
The key.

856
01:06:33,250 --> 01:06:34,626
Shut up!

857
01:06:34,876 --> 01:06:37,291
Where's my stuff? Let me see it.

858
01:06:37,292 --> 01:06:38,751
Quick, NOKLAE.

859
01:06:41,042 --> 01:06:42,125
Come on...Hey.

860
01:06:42,626 --> 01:06:44,834
It's all torned,

861
01:06:44,876 --> 01:06:46,167
he also pee on it.

862
01:06:46,250 --> 01:06:47,083
Here's what left.

863
01:06:50,209 --> 01:06:52,375
Goddamn it!

864
01:06:52,709 --> 01:06:55,292
I'm gonna kill you!

865
01:07:04,792 --> 01:07:06,209
We came the wrong way.

866
01:07:06,501 --> 01:07:07,666
I know.

867
01:07:07,667 --> 01:07:09,375
Do something then.

868
01:07:09,417 --> 01:07:10,751
Don't raise your voice at me.

869
01:07:10,792 --> 01:07:12,417
I'm not the one who started all this.

870
01:07:12,459 --> 01:07:14,667
Is this how you take care
of the children?

871
01:07:16,918 --> 01:07:18,626
How much? 20,000?

872
01:07:18,876 --> 01:07:20,250
You bitch.

873
01:07:20,792 --> 01:07:23,249
She's a brand new piece,

874
01:07:23,250 --> 01:07:24,959
She even smell new
and not from the north.

875
01:07:25,083 --> 01:07:26,167
No more than thirteen.

876
01:07:27,209 --> 01:07:28,501
A vergin.

877
01:07:29,250 --> 01:07:30,918
I want 40,000.

878
01:07:33,792 --> 01:07:35,501
Okay! 30,000 you bitch.

879
01:07:35,876 --> 01:07:37,375
Only cash!

880
01:07:38,125 --> 01:07:40,334
I'll bring her in,
no later than tomorrow.

881
01:07:59,834 --> 01:08:02,917
Hey Jua, I got one for you.

882
01:08:02,918 --> 01:08:04,167
Not even a year old.

883
01:08:05,292 --> 01:08:07,542
Sure, I'll send it over

884
01:08:07,584 --> 01:08:08,876
before we talk the price.

885
01:08:09,834 --> 01:08:11,792
Hey, how about a 5 years old?

886
01:08:14,709 --> 01:08:16,876
I know he's too old.

887
01:08:18,626 --> 01:08:19,501
If no one in Malaysia would want him.

888
01:08:19,542 --> 01:08:21,375
Why not sending him into the Factory?

889
01:08:24,417 --> 01:08:25,250
Come on, cheap Price.

890
01:08:25,334 --> 01:08:26,852
I'll let you have him
with chenp price.

891
01:08:26,876 --> 01:08:28,876
Damn it!

892
01:08:34,417 --> 01:08:35,666
Nothing here.

893
01:08:35,667 --> 01:08:36,626
Come on, hurry up.

894
01:08:36,667 --> 01:08:39,042
Put the girl and the baby in the car.

895
01:08:39,417 --> 01:08:41,209
I've already sold them.

896
01:08:41,250 --> 01:08:43,334
I'm gonna get my money back.

897
01:08:43,375 --> 01:08:44,959
BOSS, aren't you gonna let them go?

898
01:08:45,501 --> 01:08:46,000
What?

899
01:08:46,042 --> 01:08:48,242
With all the trouble you brought,
still you had a ward?

900
01:08:48,417 --> 01:08:49,292
Open the door.

901
01:08:50,542 --> 01:08:53,834
Let me go!

902
01:08:53,876 --> 01:08:57,918
Let her go!

903
01:08:57,959 --> 01:08:59,250
Boss, what about him?

904
01:08:59,334 --> 01:09:00,541
Leave him here,

905
01:09:00,542 --> 01:09:02,876
he's not even old enough
for the Factory.

906
01:09:02,959 --> 01:09:03,918
What a mess!

907
01:09:05,709 --> 01:09:07,667
This is real stink.

908
01:09:09,083 --> 01:09:11,000
Take this too.

909
01:09:11,417 --> 01:09:13,209
It's for the baby.

910
01:09:14,584 --> 01:09:15,667
Take good care of him,

911
01:09:15,709 --> 01:09:17,375
he's bringing a fortune to us.

912
01:09:17,834 --> 01:09:20,250
I'm sending his sister
to CHALAO's whore house.

913
01:09:20,292 --> 01:09:21,709
I asked for 40,000

914
01:09:21,751 --> 01:09:24,584
but that bitch only agreed on 30,000.

915
01:09:24,626 --> 01:09:25,709
BOSS, I'm coming too.

916
01:09:25,959 --> 01:09:26,876
OHH.

917
01:09:28,209 --> 01:09:31,292
OHH...

918
01:09:31,501 --> 01:09:33,751
ONN...

919
01:09:33,792 --> 01:09:42,583
OHH...

920
01:09:42,584 --> 01:09:44,751
BOSS, are you really selling them away?

921
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:46,876
Don't sell them, BOSS.

922
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:48,958
I'll work to pay you back,

923
01:09:48,959 --> 01:09:50,250
anything you want me to do.

924
01:09:52,918 --> 01:09:54,959
Get the hell out of here! Get lost!

925
01:10:02,292 --> 01:10:04,751
OHH...

926
01:10:14,667 --> 01:10:16,751
I want my brother
and my sister back.

927
01:10:23,292 --> 01:10:24,334
What do you hit me for?

928
01:10:24,542 --> 01:10:27,751
Don't you see he cause I was trying
to help your brother and sister.

929
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,626
Why are they taking them away?

930
01:10:30,834 --> 01:10:32,333
Just keep your mouth shut.

931
01:10:32,334 --> 01:10:34,292
Come on, let's pick up the things,

932
01:10:34,334 --> 01:10:35,774
we have to find our way out of here.

933
01:10:37,792 --> 01:10:39,584
Or do you want to stay here?

934
01:10:41,667 --> 01:10:43,000
Now what? Are you coming?

935
01:11:00,501 --> 01:11:02,042
So this is your parents?

936
01:11:06,083 --> 01:11:08,209
Why keeping those?
They're only paper.

937
01:11:08,918 --> 01:11:10,167
They're my dod's fairy tale.

938
01:11:21,542 --> 01:11:23,918
Pardon me, is there any news?

939
01:11:24,125 --> 01:11:25,000
Not at all mam.

940
01:11:25,042 --> 01:11:26,042
Excuse me.

941
01:11:46,667 --> 01:11:47,501
PHA...

942
01:11:54,083 --> 01:11:56,626
Does this belong to your children?

943
01:11:58,083 --> 01:11:59,167
Where are they?

944
01:11:59,834 --> 01:12:02,250
We found this paper doll
by the road heading for Bangkok.

945
01:12:02,375 --> 01:12:03,959
They try to avoid the main highway.

946
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:07,542
I've already notified the authority
along the route

947
01:12:07,584 --> 01:12:08,792
all the way to Bangkok.

948
01:12:09,417 --> 01:12:11,416
You could wait here.

949
01:12:11,417 --> 01:12:12,626
But I think it'd be better,

950
01:12:12,667 --> 01:12:14,948
if you will go back and wait
for any progress in Bangkok.

951
01:12:15,959 --> 01:12:19,125
Here's a name of
the case's officer in Bangkok.

952
01:12:35,417 --> 01:12:36,667
SAKE, watch the baby.

953
01:12:37,083 --> 01:12:38,209
Come on girl, get down!

954
01:12:38,250 --> 01:12:39,709
Drag her out!

955
01:12:39,751 --> 01:12:43,292
No! Let me go! Let me go!

956
01:12:43,417 --> 01:12:44,834
I'll take care of her.

957
01:12:44,876 --> 01:12:46,417
- Come! Down here!
- Let me go!

958
01:12:46,918 --> 01:12:48,250
You dare?

959
01:12:48,709 --> 01:12:49,667
Let me go!

960
01:12:49,668 --> 01:12:50,917
Shut up!

961
01:12:50,918 --> 01:12:52,292
Otherwise I'll kill your brother.

962
01:12:52,417 --> 01:12:53,685
Go ahead, take the baby
out and bury him.

963
01:12:53,709 --> 01:12:54,209
No! Don't!

964
01:12:54,210 --> 01:12:56,124
UMM...

965
01:12:56,125 --> 01:12:58,167
Shut up! Or I'll do it.

966
01:12:59,083 --> 01:13:00,959
Keep the baby quiet!

967
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:01,501
UMM..

968
01:13:01,542 --> 01:13:03,000
Come here.

969
01:13:03,459 --> 01:13:04,917
It you don't want your brother to die,

970
01:13:04,918 --> 01:13:06,791
you must stay here.

971
01:13:06,792 --> 01:13:09,751
But if you refuse
or make any trouble,

972
01:13:09,792 --> 01:13:11,500
I'm gonna kill your brother.

973
01:13:11,501 --> 01:13:12,000
UMM...

974
01:13:12,001 --> 01:13:13,918
Go! Keep going!

975
01:13:14,250 --> 01:13:15,167
CHALAO!

976
01:13:15,167 --> 01:13:16,167
I've brought the girl.

977
01:13:19,792 --> 01:13:21,125
Okay? Nice?

978
01:13:24,751 --> 01:13:25,834
Not bad.

979
01:13:25,876 --> 01:13:27,125
Give me the money.

980
01:13:28,042 --> 01:13:28,959
Half.

981
01:13:29,125 --> 01:13:30,709
What do you mean, half?

982
01:13:31,083 --> 01:13:32,709
That's all I got today.

983
01:13:32,751 --> 01:13:33,959
If she's really brand new,

984
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:35,918
by the day she does her first trick,

985
01:13:35,959 --> 01:13:37,250
you'll get the other half.

986
01:13:40,626 --> 01:13:43,667
All right, but don't screw me.

987
01:13:44,250 --> 01:13:45,250
Come on.

988
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,667
Here, let's go...my lock.

989
01:14:17,083 --> 01:14:18,834
Hey, wake up.

990
01:14:19,709 --> 01:14:20,918
Here, it's Rongmueng.

991
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,751
Did you know which part of Rongmueng

992
01:14:28,042 --> 01:14:29,167
your parents live?

993
01:14:29,209 --> 01:14:30,667
How are you going to find them?

994
01:14:40,167 --> 01:14:41,250
We're home.

995
01:14:41,709 --> 01:14:42,834
It's stink.

996
01:14:43,417 --> 01:14:45,083
Stink is better than having no home,

997
01:14:45,125 --> 01:14:46,250
no place to sleep.

998
01:14:56,584 --> 01:14:59,125
Hey, wake up!
It's my bet, get up!

999
01:15:02,167 --> 01:15:04,417
The BOSS is really pissed at you.

1000
01:15:04,542 --> 01:15:05,751
Screw him.

1001
01:15:08,959 --> 01:15:10,834
Come, get some sleep.

1002
01:15:11,334 --> 01:15:14,125
Keep your mouth shut and don't cry.

1003
01:15:15,042 --> 01:15:17,876
I'll help get his brother
and sister out.

1004
01:15:18,292 --> 01:15:19,792
I'll handle the BOSS

1005
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:21,751
that bastard kicked me
out of the car.

1006
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:24,375
You're asking for trouble.

1007
01:15:47,834 --> 01:15:49,375
I'll spend the night at Somsak's.

1008
01:15:49,417 --> 01:15:52,417
If there is anything, just page me.

1009
01:15:52,459 --> 01:15:55,375
It not, them I'll be here
early tomorrow.

1010
01:15:57,375 --> 01:15:59,042
You may spend the night here.

1011
01:16:06,876 --> 01:16:07,792
Come on in.

1012
01:16:09,083 --> 01:16:10,083
It's beautiful.

1013
01:16:11,292 --> 01:16:13,334
I don't have anything
for you to change.

1014
01:16:13,375 --> 01:16:15,375
It's okay, it's fine with this.

1015
01:16:15,792 --> 01:16:17,000
I'll find my way tomorrow.

1016
01:16:27,876 --> 01:16:28,792
ONN's room.

1017
01:16:30,792 --> 01:16:31,876
That one is OHH's.

1018
01:16:33,250 --> 01:16:34,792
You may take any room you want.

1019
01:17:23,042 --> 01:17:25,167
Wake up! Everybody out!

1020
01:17:25,209 --> 01:17:27,750
It's time for you to move out.

1021
01:17:27,751 --> 01:17:31,082
The BOSS wants me
to take over everything,

1022
01:17:31,083 --> 01:17:33,208
including your delivery job.

1023
01:17:33,209 --> 01:17:34,083
Like you?

1024
01:17:34,125 --> 01:17:35,876
I'm not bullshitting.

1025
01:17:35,918 --> 01:17:39,542
Look at these, see? How's it?

1026
01:17:39,751 --> 01:17:43,584
And this money, he gave it to me.

1027
01:17:43,959 --> 01:17:48,125
This house too, he give it to us.

1028
01:17:48,167 --> 01:17:50,208
You guys'd better get back
to the street,

1029
01:17:50,209 --> 01:17:51,875
and find some other place.

1030
01:17:51,876 --> 01:17:52,751
I'm not going...

1031
01:17:53,250 --> 01:17:56,876
any problem?

1032
01:18:03,584 --> 01:18:04,959
You'll see,

1033
01:18:05,083 --> 01:18:07,417
I'll tell the BOSS to get you.

1034
01:18:07,459 --> 01:18:09,167
Go ahead, I'll be waiting for him.

1035
01:18:13,959 --> 01:18:15,751
How should we do, NOKLAE?

1036
01:18:15,792 --> 01:18:17,458
The BOSS will get us for sure.

1037
01:18:17,459 --> 01:18:19,792
He will never find us, don't worry.

1038
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:21,167
We'll go to the Condo.

1039
01:18:21,334 --> 01:18:22,792
Let's move, get your stuff.

1040
01:18:24,334 --> 01:18:25,834
We'll be starving there.

1041
01:18:27,417 --> 01:18:29,959
Still worry about that?

1042
01:18:40,501 --> 01:18:42,333
See mom, how's this outfit.

1043
01:18:42,334 --> 01:18:43,834
Would you want it shorter than this?

1044
01:18:43,876 --> 01:18:45,959
Must be your school
that wear short skirt.

1045
01:18:46,292 --> 01:18:47,167
Come here, girl.

1046
01:18:51,792 --> 01:18:57,958
If there're some kind of ranking,

1047
01:18:57,959 --> 01:18:59,834
you'll get at least 4 stars.

1048
01:19:00,459 --> 01:19:01,959
You should be proud.

1049
01:19:03,584 --> 01:19:06,125
From now on, this is your home.

1050
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:08,417
You're going to live with me.

1051
01:19:08,459 --> 01:19:09,667
Be my daughter.

1052
01:19:11,042 --> 01:19:12,626
And if you behave well.

1053
01:19:13,501 --> 01:19:15,375
I'll take good care of you,

1054
01:19:15,959 --> 01:19:17,417
buy you beautiful clothes,

1055
01:19:18,125 --> 01:19:19,292
and even some gold to wear.

1056
01:19:20,918 --> 01:19:22,292
Call me "MOM" than,

1057
01:19:22,959 --> 01:19:26,501
they call me "MOM" here.

1058
01:19:28,209 --> 01:19:31,167
Try, call me, MOM.

1059
01:19:31,667 --> 01:19:32,667
You...

1060
01:19:32,709 --> 01:19:35,000
- Witch! You Witch!
- Oh, shit.

1061
01:19:35,042 --> 01:19:37,000
Are you asking for it?

1062
01:19:37,042 --> 01:19:39,918
- Easy MOM, no damage.
- You'll get it!

1063
01:19:39,959 --> 01:19:41,417
CHAI, call Mr.PENG,

1064
01:19:41,459 --> 01:19:43,334
Chief PAIBOON and Mr. LENG,

1065
01:19:43,542 --> 01:19:45,208
whoever offers me the most,

1066
01:19:45,209 --> 01:19:47,167
can have this bitch's virginity,

1067
01:19:47,834 --> 01:19:49,876
either tonight or tomorrow.

1068
01:19:50,959 --> 01:19:52,626
Tell them she's a student,

1069
01:19:52,667 --> 01:19:54,334
a 4 stars guarantee.

1070
01:20:00,959 --> 01:20:02,125
My pocket!

1071
01:20:02,167 --> 01:20:04,083
Somebody picked my pocket.

1072
01:20:04,125 --> 01:20:06,209
Stop! Stop the bus!

1073
01:20:08,250 --> 01:20:16,042
Somebody took my wallet.

1074
01:20:19,501 --> 01:20:21,374
Is this what you called "Condo"?

1075
01:20:21,375 --> 01:20:23,125
Yeah, this is it.

1076
01:20:23,584 --> 01:20:26,501
Nobody knows or ever been here.

1077
01:20:26,542 --> 01:20:29,334
NOKLAE found this place.

1078
01:20:33,626 --> 01:20:34,918
We'll wait for NOKLAE,

1079
01:20:34,959 --> 01:20:36,917
then we'll make out a plan
to help your brother and sister.

1080
01:20:36,918 --> 01:20:39,124
We? How can we?

1081
01:20:39,125 --> 01:20:40,249
If NOKLAE said it can be done,

1082
01:20:40,250 --> 01:20:42,018
then it shall be done,
you've got to believe me.

1083
01:20:42,042 --> 01:20:43,292
If he is not that good,

1084
01:20:43,334 --> 01:20:45,459
the BOSS wouldn't have
trusted him that much.

1085
01:20:45,501 --> 01:20:47,417
They call him "tough".

1086
01:20:47,459 --> 01:20:48,459
He never cry.

1087
01:20:49,375 --> 01:20:51,501
The BOSS used to whip him
to the skin,

1088
01:20:51,542 --> 01:20:52,751
he didn't utter a word.

1089
01:20:53,167 --> 01:20:55,249
If he decided to take on the BOSS,

1090
01:20:55,250 --> 01:20:56,584
and help your brother and sister,

1091
01:20:56,626 --> 01:20:58,625
you can bet on it.

1092
01:20:58,626 --> 01:21:00,250
May the BOSS go to hell.

1093
01:21:02,501 --> 01:21:05,709
May that fucker go to hell.

1094
01:21:08,542 --> 01:21:11,626
May that fucker go to hell.

1095
01:21:14,584 --> 01:21:18,334
Hey, is this too early
to say a pray?

1096
01:21:19,667 --> 01:21:21,000
What pray?

1097
01:21:21,709 --> 01:21:23,166
A magic pray to kill the beast.

1098
01:21:23,167 --> 01:21:24,167
Did you find them?

1099
01:21:24,542 --> 01:21:26,500
- Only the sister.
- OHH...

1100
01:21:26,501 --> 01:21:27,626
She was there for sure.

1101
01:21:28,417 --> 01:21:30,417
Did she got pop yet?

1102
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:32,000
I don't know.

1103
01:21:32,250 --> 01:21:34,208
Why didn't you help her?

1104
01:21:34,209 --> 01:21:36,209
What did they take her for?

1105
01:21:36,417 --> 01:21:37,417
You don't want to know.

1106
01:21:39,042 --> 01:21:41,584
Hey SEAR, go get something to eat.

1107
01:21:43,167 --> 01:21:43,959
Wow!

1108
01:21:44,209 --> 01:21:45,375
Hey, money's my business.

1109
01:21:45,417 --> 01:21:46,250
I'll go with you.

1110
01:21:46,292 --> 01:21:48,477
- None of your business. Back off!
- That's big bill, where did you get it?

1111
01:21:48,501 --> 01:21:50,542
What a hand.

1112
01:21:51,083 --> 01:21:54,292
You bastard...
you're spitting at me.

1113
01:21:54,334 --> 01:21:58,083
When are you going to help
my brother an sister?

1114
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:01,000
You fucker...don't push, will you?

1115
01:22:04,375 --> 01:22:07,042
We can confirm now,

1116
01:22:07,083 --> 01:22:08,667
the boy's name is "NOKLAE".

1117
01:22:09,334 --> 01:22:13,250
He's the leader of
those homeless boys.

1118
01:22:13,626 --> 01:22:15,334
Do you know where he is?

1119
01:22:15,709 --> 01:22:16,792
Did you get him?

1120
01:22:16,876 --> 01:22:18,751
We're still looking for him.

1121
01:22:19,375 --> 01:22:21,042
The problem is...

1122
01:22:21,083 --> 01:22:26,648
They never stay in one place.

1123
01:22:26,792 --> 01:22:30,834
For NOKLAE, he usually hang around

1124
01:22:30,876 --> 01:22:35,375
the Bangkok Station and Rongmuang.

1125
01:22:35,751 --> 01:22:39,292
We've checked over the whole area,

1126
01:22:39,501 --> 01:22:44,209
but they all seem to disappear.

1127
01:22:44,292 --> 01:22:46,459
What about our children?
What to do now?

1128
01:22:49,417 --> 01:22:51,667
We'll find them somehow.

1129
01:22:53,667 --> 01:22:57,500
NID, do you remember
a story we published

1130
01:22:57,501 --> 01:23:00,167
about a teacher who started
a school for homeless children?

1131
01:23:01,209 --> 01:23:02,459
Yes, that one.

1132
01:23:02,876 --> 01:23:04,208
Would you look for his number for me?

1133
01:23:04,209 --> 01:23:06,375
There's something urgent
I'll have to ask him.

1134
01:23:07,667 --> 01:23:08,834
Okay, I'll wait.

1135
01:23:11,584 --> 01:23:13,417
What? The appointment was set?

1136
01:23:17,209 --> 01:23:20,417
How about asking Mr.NIRUM
to postpone for now?

1137
01:23:22,042 --> 01:23:25,167
What? The big guy is going abroad?

1138
01:23:28,667 --> 01:23:30,584
I've to postpone it anyway.

1139
01:23:30,626 --> 01:23:32,667
Just get me that
teacher's phone number now.

1140
01:23:34,542 --> 01:23:38,209
Easy, hey,easy.

1141
01:23:39,584 --> 01:23:40,751
Here, eat.

1142
01:23:47,709 --> 01:23:50,292
You bastard, where' s my change?

1143
01:23:50,751 --> 01:23:51,959
Oh shit, I forgot.

1144
01:23:53,125 --> 01:23:54,918
Nice try.

1145
01:23:54,959 --> 01:23:56,334
Take it easy, man.

1146
01:24:04,334 --> 01:24:05,459
What a hell?

1147
01:24:05,959 --> 01:24:08,459
With just this food,
is this all change left?

1148
01:24:08,834 --> 01:24:10,375
Are you trying to cheat me?

1149
01:24:10,417 --> 01:24:11,709
Let's get him!

1150
01:24:14,167 --> 01:24:16,792
I didn't take a shit, damn it.

1151
01:24:16,834 --> 01:24:18,501
Oh yeah? I'm gonna kick your ass.

1152
01:24:18,542 --> 01:24:20,167
I didn't take a shit.

1153
01:24:20,292 --> 01:24:22,501
Hey, it's here.

1154
01:24:22,542 --> 01:24:23,250
Give it back!

1155
01:24:23,626 --> 01:24:24,876
He bought one of this.

1156
01:24:25,375 --> 01:24:26,959
I've been wanting it for so long.

1157
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:29,209
You bastard, it's my money,

1158
01:24:29,250 --> 01:24:31,125
it's for something we can eat.

1159
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:35,334
Hey, this is fun.

1160
01:24:35,375 --> 01:24:36,292
Let me play too.

1161
01:24:36,334 --> 01:24:39,000
Give it to me, you bastard.
I must be the first to play.

1162
01:24:39,125 --> 01:24:40,542
- Hey, I'm a kid.
- Beat it!

1163
01:24:41,250 --> 01:24:42,374
I bought it.

1164
01:24:42,375 --> 01:24:44,417
You don't know how to play.
You're breaking it.

1165
01:24:44,459 --> 01:24:46,542
Stop.

1166
01:24:46,667 --> 01:24:50,291
Bastard! It's my money.
Give it to me.

1167
01:24:50,292 --> 01:24:52,501
Everybody stop.

1168
01:24:52,918 --> 01:24:54,334
Stop.

1169
01:24:54,834 --> 01:24:56,417
You bastard! Stop!

1170
01:24:57,626 --> 01:24:59,751
When are we going to help
my brother and sister?

1171
01:25:20,542 --> 01:25:23,459
RAMBO, I want you to spy on
what's going on in the building.

1172
01:25:23,501 --> 01:25:26,876
We'll be waiting outside.

1173
01:25:27,250 --> 01:25:30,541
If CHALAO put his sister at work,

1174
01:25:30,542 --> 01:25:32,000
just let me know right away.

1175
01:25:32,042 --> 01:25:34,042
Taking her from a customer

1176
01:25:34,167 --> 01:25:35,792
is much easier thean
from that bitch

1177
01:25:35,834 --> 01:25:37,042
and her bodyguards.

1178
01:25:37,959 --> 01:25:39,209
What about my brother?

1179
01:25:40,042 --> 01:25:42,000
I don't even know
where's your brother.

1180
01:25:42,876 --> 01:25:44,542
Okay SEAR.

1181
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:47,334
You don't have to come along

1182
01:25:47,375 --> 01:25:51,876
just go and find out where
the BOSS keep the baby.

1183
01:25:52,459 --> 01:25:55,709
After we got his sister out,
we'll go for the baby.

1184
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:56,876
Come on.

1185
01:25:57,375 --> 01:26:02,250
May the BOSS go to hell.

1186
01:26:05,250 --> 01:26:08,375
May the BOSS go to hell.

1187
01:26:12,542 --> 01:26:14,876
How about it?

1188
01:26:14,918 --> 01:26:17,459
- Wait till my turn.
- Let's do it again. I'm first this time.

1189
01:26:18,792 --> 01:26:19,709
Hey, the teachers!

1190
01:26:19,751 --> 01:26:23,042
Hey...Why don't you take your friend
to class. It's been days already.

1191
01:26:23,083 --> 01:26:24,727
It's their business,
they don't want to go.

1192
01:26:24,751 --> 01:26:27,625
Where're you going?
They'll do us no harm.

1193
01:26:27,626 --> 01:26:29,501
Don't let them go.

1194
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:31,792
Hey kids, hold it.

1195
01:26:31,834 --> 01:26:32,834
If his name is NOKLAE.

1196
01:26:32,876 --> 01:26:34,292
And looks the way you've told me.

1197
01:26:34,334 --> 01:26:35,292
Just don't worry.

1198
01:26:35,293 --> 01:26:37,125
I know him and
I think I can find him.

1199
01:26:47,834 --> 01:26:49,501
I've found her...

1200
01:26:49,542 --> 01:26:52,334
they've taken her
to the customer just now.

1201
01:26:52,375 --> 01:26:53,459
Are you sure it's her?

1202
01:26:53,501 --> 01:26:54,459
It can't be other person.

1203
01:26:54,501 --> 01:26:56,792
If she's in school uniform
and has long hair.

1204
01:26:56,834 --> 01:26:58,459
It gotta be her.

1205
01:26:58,501 --> 01:27:00,542
You, stay with him here.

1206
01:27:00,584 --> 01:27:01,833
Let's do it.

1207
01:27:01,834 --> 01:27:03,584
Be careful.

1208
01:27:03,918 --> 01:27:05,292
Hey.. Be careful there!

1209
01:27:08,042 --> 01:27:09,417
Hurry!

1210
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:13,042
Hey.. Hurry! They're here.

1211
01:27:33,751 --> 01:27:35,709
CHAI, MOOD, hey!

1212
01:27:36,584 --> 01:27:38,000
Hey! Hurry!

1213
01:27:39,083 --> 01:27:40,000
Come on!

1214
01:27:40,292 --> 01:27:41,876
Here Mom.

1215
01:27:43,459 --> 01:27:44,125
Shut the door.

1216
01:27:44,667 --> 01:27:46,083
Did you send in someone else?

1217
01:27:46,417 --> 01:27:47,810
He doesn't want anyone else.
He already left.

1218
01:27:47,834 --> 01:27:49,209
Lucky, Mom.

1219
01:27:49,292 --> 01:27:50,541
Lucky my butt!

1220
01:27:50,542 --> 01:27:53,374
That damn BOSS.
Always bring me troubles.

1221
01:27:53,375 --> 01:27:54,209
Chicken out Mon?

1222
01:27:54,334 --> 01:27:55,667
Me chicken out?

1223
01:27:55,709 --> 01:27:57,375
I just wanna be careful.

1224
01:27:57,876 --> 01:27:58,584
I don't want to be arrested

1225
01:27:58,626 --> 01:28:00,792
and being charged with many counts.

1226
01:28:03,042 --> 01:28:05,709
Here! Ruin my luck...

1227
01:28:26,626 --> 01:28:34,000
- It's rat!
- Rats!

1228
01:28:34,918 --> 01:28:37,083
- It's this room.
- Let me.

1229
01:28:37,834 --> 01:28:40,125
Hey, what the hell's going on?

1230
01:28:40,167 --> 01:28:41,083
Rats.

1231
01:28:41,125 --> 01:28:43,459
They're running all over the place.

1232
01:28:43,501 --> 01:28:44,417
What rats?

1233
01:28:44,417 --> 01:28:45,167
What a noice here?

1234
01:28:45,168 --> 01:28:46,501
You're frightening our customers,

1235
01:28:46,542 --> 01:28:47,459
you bitch!

1236
01:28:47,501 --> 01:28:49,958
Get rid of them!

1237
01:28:49,959 --> 01:28:52,209
Make sure they're all out!

1238
01:28:52,626 --> 01:28:55,083
What the hell are you
coming in here for?

1239
01:28:55,125 --> 01:28:56,083
What?

1240
01:28:56,375 --> 01:28:58,083
Come on inside Mom. Have a sent.

1241
01:28:58,125 --> 01:29:00,667
What for? What is this
"take a seat" all about?

1242
01:29:00,709 --> 01:29:01,834
Be comfortable Mom.

1243
01:29:01,876 --> 01:29:04,209
Say...One, two, three!

1244
01:29:05,751 --> 01:29:06,792
Quick! Get out...

1245
01:29:07,209 --> 01:29:09,667
ONN's waiting outside.

1246
01:29:12,250 --> 01:29:14,750
Stop them! Stop NOKLAE.

1247
01:29:14,751 --> 01:29:23,292
There, they took that girl.
Hurry up, stop them!

1248
01:29:29,250 --> 01:29:32,709
Tell her I want, the rest,
of the money.

1249
01:29:35,959 --> 01:29:37,268
BOSS, NOKLAE is taking
that girl away.

1250
01:29:37,292 --> 01:29:39,492
- Go! Don't be afraid of him.
- You bastard! Got a gun?

1251
01:29:39,709 --> 01:29:41,667
- Watch out, NOKLAE.
- Go!

1252
01:29:41,709 --> 01:29:43,501
Stop them! Don't let them get away.

1253
01:29:43,542 --> 01:29:44,584
Get them!

1254
01:29:45,584 --> 01:29:46,542
BOSS.

1255
01:29:46,584 --> 01:29:47,417
Come on.

1256
01:29:47,459 --> 01:29:48,209
OHH.

1257
01:29:48,918 --> 01:29:49,792
ONN..

1258
01:29:50,792 --> 01:29:51,584
Let go!

1259
01:29:51,585 --> 01:29:52,709
NOKLAE!

1260
01:29:52,751 --> 01:29:53,709
Hurry!

1261
01:29:55,959 --> 01:29:57,959
Where is UMM?

1262
01:30:00,876 --> 01:30:01,667
Stop them!

1263
01:30:02,250 --> 01:30:03,542
Don't come any closer.

1264
01:30:04,584 --> 01:30:05,751
What're you afraid of?

1265
01:30:05,792 --> 01:30:07,477
His gun is home made,
he has only one shot.

1266
01:30:07,501 --> 01:30:09,250
Don't be afraid, you stupid!

1267
01:30:09,709 --> 01:30:11,751
Do you wanna try? Come on.

1268
01:30:11,792 --> 01:30:13,501
Let's go.

1269
01:30:14,167 --> 01:30:15,250
My ankle.

1270
01:30:16,876 --> 01:30:19,334
Whoever move first gonna get it.

1271
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:24,667
Hurry up...let's get out of here.

1272
01:30:26,876 --> 01:30:27,501
Hurry!

1273
01:30:27,542 --> 01:30:29,625
NOKLAE, you son of a bitch!

1274
01:30:29,626 --> 01:30:31,786
Don't forget what you did to me.
You all gonna get it.

1275
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:39,501
Hurry up. They're after us.

1276
01:30:41,542 --> 01:30:42,334
Hey! You idiot.

1277
01:30:43,292 --> 01:30:44,375
So what, BOSS?

1278
01:30:44,501 --> 01:30:46,250
You two hit the street.

1279
01:30:46,292 --> 01:30:49,000
Find out where they hide

1280
01:30:49,626 --> 01:30:50,792
and take them in.

1281
01:30:51,542 --> 01:30:53,000
No new at all?

1282
01:30:54,918 --> 01:30:56,501
What about that boy?

1283
01:31:01,667 --> 01:31:05,083
Thank you.

1284
01:31:11,375 --> 01:31:13,667
Something like this
shouldn't happen to us,

1285
01:31:14,250 --> 01:31:15,959
the other day they still..

1286
01:31:16,292 --> 01:31:17,542
It will not happen again.

1287
01:31:18,918 --> 01:31:21,417
How can you be so sure?

1288
01:31:22,167 --> 01:31:23,709
Before they're grown up.

1289
01:31:24,334 --> 01:31:27,334
They do not want
just only one of us,

1290
01:31:28,167 --> 01:31:29,876
but they need us both.

1291
01:31:30,709 --> 01:31:33,250
No way, it 's already finished for us.

1292
01:31:33,709 --> 01:31:34,918
Even for our children?

1293
01:31:34,959 --> 01:31:36,542
Never bring up the children.

1294
01:31:36,584 --> 01:31:37,709
For them?

1295
01:31:37,751 --> 01:31:39,249
What did you do for them?

1296
01:31:39,250 --> 01:31:40,250
Having fun with them?

1297
01:31:40,251 --> 01:31:43,042
Always told them stories
and had them spoiled?

1298
01:31:43,083 --> 01:31:45,685
They're just living with nonsense
and fantasy, don't you know that?

1299
01:31:45,709 --> 01:31:47,667
How come they mode such a decision?

1300
01:31:48,334 --> 01:31:49,917
I'm tired.

1301
01:31:49,918 --> 01:31:52,584
I'm the on who'd been doing
nearly everything,

1302
01:31:53,042 --> 01:31:54,791
so don't ever make
the children a reason

1303
01:31:54,792 --> 01:31:56,626
for me to take it anymore,

1304
01:31:56,709 --> 01:31:59,250
even when you're fooling around
with someone else.

1305
01:31:59,292 --> 01:32:00,792
- But that's not true.
- It's true.

1306
01:32:02,375 --> 01:32:04,375
It is not true.

1307
01:32:04,751 --> 01:32:07,459
Okay, there're some talking,
but nothing else.

1308
01:32:07,834 --> 01:32:08,626
Liar!

1309
01:32:10,751 --> 01:32:13,459
Okay, suppose it's true,

1310
01:32:13,584 --> 01:32:14,292
but for the children,

1311
01:32:14,334 --> 01:32:15,959
wouldn't you let it pass
and forgive me?

1312
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,709
Why didn't you think
about the children then?

1313
01:32:18,751 --> 01:32:20,959
It's already passed,

1314
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:22,334
It's not even true,

1315
01:32:22,375 --> 01:32:27,209
I'm talking about what's going on...
Now!

1316
01:32:27,250 --> 01:32:29,083
We still can't even find our children.

1317
01:32:29,709 --> 01:32:30,918
But once we found them

1318
01:32:30,959 --> 01:32:32,459
can't you just forgive me.

1319
01:32:32,584 --> 01:32:36,751
And return the good things
to their life?

1320
01:33:16,417 --> 01:33:19,250
"I love you dad."

1321
01:33:39,209 --> 01:33:40,375
Hey, eat.

1322
01:33:41,417 --> 01:33:42,709
What do you bought?

1323
01:33:42,959 --> 01:33:43,542
Roast duck.

1324
01:33:43,667 --> 01:33:45,209
Here.

1325
01:33:47,709 --> 01:33:50,751
I don't like duck.

1326
01:33:50,792 --> 01:33:52,833
Just eat, man.

1327
01:33:52,834 --> 01:33:54,959
This is already something,
don't you know that?

1328
01:33:58,792 --> 01:34:00,250
Eat some.

1329
01:34:11,501 --> 01:34:13,501
How long have you guys been together?

1330
01:34:14,083 --> 01:34:15,125
Sometime...

1331
01:34:16,083 --> 01:34:17,417
Do you have a home?

1332
01:34:18,501 --> 01:34:19,751
Why do you ask?

1333
01:34:19,792 --> 01:34:21,125
Yeah, why?

1334
01:34:21,959 --> 01:34:24,083
I'm eating, why the hell?

1335
01:34:24,459 --> 01:34:25,876
Crazy again?

1336
01:34:27,292 --> 01:34:29,334
Don't talk about home
when he's around.

1337
01:34:29,792 --> 01:34:32,834
His parents abandoned him

1338
01:34:32,876 --> 01:34:34,459
ever since he was just a little baby.

1339
01:34:35,209 --> 01:34:37,291
NOKLAE found him in a box somewhere.

1340
01:34:37,292 --> 01:34:38,792
He never has a home.

1341
01:34:40,250 --> 01:34:42,250
You have home?

1342
01:34:44,042 --> 01:34:46,876
Ever think about going back home?

1343
01:34:47,918 --> 01:34:49,626
For what?

1344
01:34:50,459 --> 01:34:52,791
This is what we guess.

1345
01:34:52,792 --> 01:34:55,042
Maybe he was thrown away
by his parents too.

1346
01:35:00,792 --> 01:35:01,542
What about you?

1347
01:35:01,584 --> 01:35:02,542
Of course, I do.

1348
01:35:04,417 --> 01:35:05,792
Ever think about going back home?

1349
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:07,209
For what?

1350
01:35:07,417 --> 01:35:09,876
I never even know my father.

1351
01:35:10,042 --> 01:35:12,792
I don't know how many men,
my mother has.

1352
01:35:13,209 --> 01:35:14,792
We are all like this.

1353
01:35:15,459 --> 01:35:17,918
Otherwise we wouldn't want to be here.

1354
01:35:18,417 --> 01:35:19,250
NOKLAE!

1355
01:35:21,209 --> 01:35:22,167
NOKLAE.

1356
01:35:24,042 --> 01:35:27,292
Hey, I've found where
they hid the baby.

1357
01:35:27,334 --> 01:35:28,125
Where?

1358
01:35:28,167 --> 01:35:30,083
Oh, I'm hungry.

1359
01:35:30,125 --> 01:35:32,375
You bastard,
can't you just wait for a moment?

1360
01:35:32,459 --> 01:35:33,834
Where the hell did they keep him?

1361
01:35:34,125 --> 01:35:35,292
At the BOSS's shop.

1362
01:35:35,334 --> 01:35:37,292
I've found out
from one of Mr.JUA'S boy.

1363
01:35:37,501 --> 01:35:39,310
They planned to have the baby
delivered tonight.

1364
01:35:39,334 --> 01:35:41,292
The BOSS is really mad at us.

1365
01:35:42,626 --> 01:35:45,583
His men are looking
for us everywhere.

1366
01:35:45,584 --> 01:35:47,292
They want to take you in.

1367
01:35:47,792 --> 01:35:49,626
But nobody says anything,
just don't worry.

1368
01:35:51,834 --> 01:35:52,375
Once Mr.JUA got the baby.

1369
01:35:52,417 --> 01:35:54,059
It would be much more
difficult to get him back.

1370
01:35:54,083 --> 01:35:57,292
We've got to get him out

1371
01:35:57,834 --> 01:35:59,375
before the BOSS deliver him.

1372
01:36:12,626 --> 01:36:14,042
Be careful. Don't wake him up.

1373
01:36:23,709 --> 01:36:25,334
Easy.

1374
01:36:30,626 --> 01:36:33,542
Kidnappers!

1375
01:36:33,584 --> 01:36:36,334
Stop them! Get out and stop them!

1376
01:36:36,375 --> 01:36:45,667
OHH. Hurry up! They'll get us.

1377
01:36:49,751 --> 01:36:51,876
Quick! Follow them.

1378
01:36:56,125 --> 01:36:57,375
Close the back door, idiot!

1379
01:37:01,459 --> 01:37:04,542
If they follow us, you lure them
to the other way, okay?

1380
01:37:06,501 --> 01:37:08,458
Let's go! Hurry!

1381
01:37:08,459 --> 01:37:10,042
Here they come.

1382
01:37:10,459 --> 01:37:12,501
Go now.
I'll make sure they follow me.

1383
01:37:12,542 --> 01:37:13,584
Come on.

1384
01:37:14,667 --> 01:37:15,959
Hey, quick!

1385
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:21,626
- Come and get me, you damn BOSS.
- Come on, we're here.

1386
01:37:21,667 --> 01:37:22,959
Not this way, stupid!

1387
01:37:23,334 --> 01:37:24,542
Follow the others that way!

1388
01:37:26,250 --> 01:37:28,042
Hurry!

1389
01:37:33,125 --> 01:37:34,501
Run! Don't stop!

1390
01:37:34,542 --> 01:37:35,250
Come on, ONN.

1391
01:37:38,292 --> 01:37:39,292
Come on, OHH.

1392
01:37:40,918 --> 01:37:42,334
You're dead, BOSS.

1393
01:37:42,375 --> 01:37:45,083
He's got the gun, watch out!

1394
01:37:50,584 --> 01:37:51,125
OHH, watch out!

1395
01:37:52,167 --> 01:37:53,083
AOM...

1396
01:37:54,292 --> 01:37:55,584
Cross there!

1397
01:37:57,501 --> 01:37:58,250
Hey!

1398
01:37:59,459 --> 01:38:00,417
UMM.

1399
01:38:01,167 --> 01:38:02,167
UMM.

1400
01:38:04,292 --> 01:38:05,250
UMM.

1401
01:38:06,667 --> 01:38:07,751
UMM.

1402
01:38:09,125 --> 01:38:09,751
UMM.

1403
01:38:10,334 --> 01:38:11,292
UMM.

1404
01:38:14,501 --> 01:38:15,292
UMM.

1405
01:38:16,501 --> 01:38:17,334
UMM.

1406
01:38:17,959 --> 01:38:19,000
UMM.

1407
01:38:19,751 --> 01:38:22,417
Careful...

1408
01:38:22,959 --> 01:38:23,667
UMM.

1409
01:38:27,667 --> 01:38:28,685
Almost have a heart-attack.

1410
01:38:28,709 --> 01:38:29,417
Is he alright?

1411
01:38:29,459 --> 01:38:30,083
Is he hurt?

1412
01:38:30,125 --> 01:38:32,709
He's so smart,
he didn't cry at all.

1413
01:38:36,501 --> 01:38:39,375
I'll kill you all.
I'll kill you, NOKLAE.

1414
01:38:39,959 --> 01:38:44,334
Get me my gun. Where's the gun?

1415
01:38:44,626 --> 01:38:45,751
I don't know.

1416
01:38:47,334 --> 01:38:48,459
You don't know?

1417
01:38:48,501 --> 01:38:49,959
Does that really hurt you?

1418
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:51,000
I'll kill you.

1419
01:38:52,083 --> 01:38:53,042
Come on.

1420
01:38:53,125 --> 01:38:56,167
May the BOSS go to hell.

1421
01:38:58,751 --> 01:39:01,709
May the BOSS go to hell.

1422
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:08,791
When're you gonna let me
shoot your gun?

1423
01:39:08,792 --> 01:39:10,542
Sleep here

1424
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:12,375
I'll take you home tomorrow.

1425
01:39:13,709 --> 01:39:14,876
Can I shoot too?

1426
01:39:15,209 --> 01:39:16,334
Oh yeah?

1427
01:39:16,375 --> 01:39:18,250
The gun is almost
as big as you are.

1428
01:39:19,042 --> 01:39:19,792
Be still.

1429
01:39:19,834 --> 01:39:22,584
I'll make you a pad to sleep on.

1430
01:39:23,375 --> 01:39:25,000
I only have few bullets.

1431
01:39:25,042 --> 01:39:26,802
We should save them
for only when necessary.

1432
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:28,250
Once I get more.

1433
01:39:28,292 --> 01:39:30,751
You guys can shoot
as much as you want.

1434
01:39:30,792 --> 01:39:32,166
Hey, I got two.

1435
01:39:32,167 --> 01:39:34,792
Damn it, you're too young
to talk dirty.

1436
01:39:34,834 --> 01:39:36,667
Go, go to sleep.

1437
01:39:36,709 --> 01:39:37,709
It's almost down.

1438
01:39:50,792 --> 01:39:52,876
Okay, I'll tell you the story.

1439
01:39:59,834 --> 01:40:01,250
Where's all the children?

1440
01:40:04,167 --> 01:40:06,417
I'll cut up some more.

1441
01:40:17,751 --> 01:40:23,834
See? Here's the children.

1442
01:40:30,959 --> 01:40:33,250
I'm going to start the story now.

1443
01:40:33,417 --> 01:40:34,458
Listen.

1444
01:40:34,459 --> 01:40:36,375
Make it good, OHH.

1445
01:40:43,417 --> 01:40:45,250
Once upon a time.

1446
01:40:45,792 --> 01:40:48,584
There were children
who lived in a village.

1447
01:40:48,626 --> 01:40:52,834
One day, they went to play
in a garden near a castle

1448
01:40:52,876 --> 01:40:58,250
without knowing that
it belonged to a witch.

1449
01:40:58,292 --> 01:41:00,000
The witch captured all the children,

1450
01:41:00,083 --> 01:41:02,542
and used her spell
to change them into animals.

1451
01:41:02,626 --> 01:41:09,250
The parents tried to search
for their children,

1452
01:41:09,292 --> 01:41:11,250
but find no trace of them.

1453
01:41:11,292 --> 01:41:15,834
They were all very sad
and started to cry.

1454
01:41:16,334 --> 01:41:19,209
A prince and a princess passed by.

1455
01:41:19,250 --> 01:41:20,890
They felt very much pity
on the children,

1456
01:41:20,918 --> 01:41:22,143
so the prince used his magic sward

1457
01:41:22,167 --> 01:41:24,000
to release them
from the witch's spell.

1458
01:41:27,375 --> 01:41:31,167
Suddenly,
the witch appeared in the sky.

1459
01:41:31,375 --> 01:41:34,792
She landed in front
of the couple and the children.

1460
01:41:35,250 --> 01:41:41,292
"You are very brave to come here,"

1461
01:41:41,334 --> 01:41:46,584
"but you won't get out
of here alive."

1462
01:41:46,626 --> 01:41:49,876
Instantly, she called out
for her one-eyed monster, from a pit.

1463
01:41:51,959 --> 01:41:55,918
And used her magic sword
to darken the sky.

1464
01:41:56,334 --> 01:41:59,209
The prince swang
his magic sword around,

1465
01:41:59,250 --> 01:42:02,375
to recreate the bright stars,

1466
01:42:02,417 --> 01:42:04,459
till everyone was able to see again.

1467
01:42:07,584 --> 01:42:10,334
Then the prince
and the one-eyed monster

1468
01:42:10,375 --> 01:42:16,042
started to fight.

1469
01:42:16,334 --> 01:42:19,375
With his magic sword,

1470
01:42:19,417 --> 01:42:22,459
the prince striked
the one-eyed monster,

1471
01:42:22,501 --> 01:42:26,834
till it fell to the ground and died.

1472
01:42:26,876 --> 01:42:34,083
Then the prince burnt
the witch's castle down.

1473
01:42:34,292 --> 01:42:37,751
Which also destroyed
all her magical power.

1474
01:42:37,918 --> 01:42:42,000
The witch became a homeless
and helpless old woman.

1475
01:42:42,459 --> 01:42:45,375
The prince and the princess
then started their journey

1476
01:42:45,417 --> 01:42:47,708
to take all the children back
to their home.

1477
01:42:47,709 --> 01:42:52,375
And they all live happily ever after.

1478
01:43:18,959 --> 01:43:20,477
How about going to Pataya,
having some fun

1479
01:43:20,501 --> 01:43:22,061
before coming back
to see your parents?

1480
01:43:22,792 --> 01:43:24,959
I don't want to go anywhere.

1481
01:43:25,459 --> 01:43:27,667
I just want to know if my parents

1482
01:43:27,709 --> 01:43:29,189
have come back
to stay together again

1483
01:43:30,042 --> 01:43:32,751
so I can go home.

1484
01:43:32,959 --> 01:43:34,834
It's just a couple of days,

1485
01:43:34,876 --> 01:43:35,918
then we come back.

1486
01:43:36,626 --> 01:43:38,459
Pataya's gonna be a big fun.

1487
01:43:38,501 --> 01:43:40,417
I know some people there.

1488
01:43:40,459 --> 01:43:42,417
It's much better than here.

1489
01:43:42,834 --> 01:43:44,083
NOKLAE, hey!

1490
01:43:44,834 --> 01:43:47,042
The Boss already knows we're here.

1491
01:43:47,083 --> 01:43:48,083
How're we gonna do?

1492
01:43:48,459 --> 01:43:49,501
Who told him.

1493
01:43:49,542 --> 01:43:51,709
I don't know.
I heard it from the street.

1494
01:43:51,792 --> 01:43:54,167
We'd better move now.

1495
01:43:54,792 --> 01:43:56,292
Let's go pick up your stuff.

1496
01:43:58,792 --> 01:44:00,334
Hey, move.

1497
01:44:00,375 --> 01:44:01,334
Why.

1498
01:44:01,459 --> 01:44:02,959
The BOSS knows we're here.

1499
01:44:03,834 --> 01:44:06,876
- Quick! Hold them all.
- The one-eyed monster!

1500
01:44:06,918 --> 01:44:08,584
- ONN, run!
- OHH.

1501
01:44:08,709 --> 01:44:10,626
Let'go, come on.

1502
01:44:12,167 --> 01:44:13,083
Stop them!

1503
01:44:14,459 --> 01:44:15,083
Hurry up, jump.

1504
01:44:15,084 --> 01:44:16,125
Let them go.

1505
01:44:16,167 --> 01:44:17,542
Get the girl and the baby.

1506
01:44:19,167 --> 01:44:20,727
- Where you think you are going?
- Let go of me!

1507
01:44:20,751 --> 01:44:23,876
- Come here!
- Let me go!

1508
01:44:24,292 --> 01:44:27,751
- Let me go!
- Quick! Take the baby.

1509
01:44:27,792 --> 01:44:29,000
Let me go!

1510
01:44:30,667 --> 01:44:31,876
Where're you going?

1511
01:44:36,334 --> 01:44:37,417
Here!

1512
01:44:37,667 --> 01:44:39,334
I'll find you a new job.

1513
01:44:39,959 --> 01:44:42,459
You've heard of "factory of hell",
haven't you?

1514
01:44:43,584 --> 01:44:45,125
And for you.

1515
01:44:45,167 --> 01:44:46,709
CHALAO is waiting for you.

1516
01:44:52,918 --> 01:44:53,918
Hello.

1517
01:44:55,584 --> 01:44:57,209
Teacher? Are they found?

1518
01:44:57,709 --> 01:44:58,584
Where?

1519
01:45:01,209 --> 01:45:02,167
A whore house.

1520
01:45:04,501 --> 01:45:07,042
Yes, I'm on my way now.

1521
01:45:15,751 --> 01:45:16,751
OHH...

1522
01:45:24,834 --> 01:45:26,834
We can't help what's already happened.

1523
01:45:28,042 --> 01:45:30,876
But we've got to get our children back.

1524
01:45:32,584 --> 01:45:34,834
Call the police.

1525
01:45:35,751 --> 01:45:37,000
I'll go with the teacher.

1526
01:45:38,501 --> 01:45:40,141
Our children are
in CHALAO's whore house,

1527
01:45:40,417 --> 01:45:41,417
at Rongmuang.

1528
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:02,000
Come on.

1529
01:46:09,501 --> 01:46:12,042
Passing out?

1530
01:46:13,542 --> 01:46:15,125
Once your sister makes me
enough money.

1531
01:46:15,792 --> 01:46:17,592
I'm gonna send you all
for a trip down south.

1532
01:46:20,667 --> 01:46:21,667
In there.

1533
01:46:22,042 --> 01:46:23,083
That's the way in.

1534
01:46:44,042 --> 01:46:45,292
Good evening.

1535
01:46:45,334 --> 01:46:46,334
Looking for a date?

1536
01:46:46,459 --> 01:46:47,167
Yes.

1537
01:46:47,209 --> 01:46:49,959
Good, any kind you like.
I'll set it up.

1538
01:46:50,250 --> 01:46:52,249
Kid. Young and pretty.

1539
01:46:52,250 --> 01:46:54,167
About twelve years old.

1540
01:46:54,209 --> 01:46:56,876
Let us take a look at all of them.

1541
01:46:56,918 --> 01:46:58,209
It's jail, man.

1542
01:46:58,250 --> 01:47:00,250
That's my problem.
I'll take any price.

1543
01:47:00,709 --> 01:47:03,334
Good, this way man.

1544
01:47:08,334 --> 01:47:09,042
Come on.

1545
01:47:11,250 --> 01:47:12,751
How is this, like, like her?

1546
01:47:15,250 --> 01:47:16,042
First class.

1547
01:47:16,709 --> 01:47:18,334
You handle the rest, okay?

1548
01:47:18,501 --> 01:47:20,876
Don't worry, I know how.

1549
01:47:21,292 --> 01:47:22,125
Get in there.

1550
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:25,501
Just wait right in here.

1551
01:47:25,542 --> 01:47:27,584
What? Where are they them?

1552
01:47:27,792 --> 01:47:31,626
- Don't! Please no!
- Come on. Fight.

1553
01:47:32,542 --> 01:47:35,501
- Are you cops?
- No.

1554
01:47:35,626 --> 01:47:37,959
How do you know
we have twelve years old here?

1555
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:39,334
We'd bettle check it out ourself.

1556
01:47:39,375 --> 01:47:40,667
Excuse us, we're going up there.

1557
01:47:45,876 --> 01:47:51,209
- No. Let me go!

1558
01:48:03,167 --> 01:48:05,042
- Here!

1559
01:48:11,209 --> 01:48:13,417
No! Stop!

1561
01:48:24,125 --> 01:48:27,042
- Fire!

01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:52,459
Help! Help!

01:48:52,584 --> 01:48:54,000
What's happened?

1564
01:48:55,584 --> 01:48:57,584
She's crazy. She's really crazy.

1565
01:48:57,626 --> 01:48:58,959
Check that out. That smoke.

1566
01:49:00,292 --> 01:49:01,292
Go, quick!

1567
01:49:02,876 --> 01:49:03,834
Fire!

1568
01:49:05,167 --> 01:49:06,959
Fire!

1569
01:49:07,083 --> 01:49:08,625
Put it out.

1570
01:49:08,626 --> 01:49:11,125
Fire! Everybody out!

1571
01:49:11,834 --> 01:49:12,959

1572
01:49:18,250 --> 01:49:20,751
Stop! Don't come near me.

1573
01:49:34,209 --> 01:49:35,125
She's crazy.

1574
01:49:35,167 --> 01:49:42,501
God damn it, it's burning.

Hey wait, what about this two?

1578
01:49:50,334 --> 01:49:51,292
Leave them here.

1579
01:49:53,459 --> 01:49:57,334
Teacher.

1580
01:50:01,918 --> 01:50:04,667
OHH. Help!

1581
01:50:33,876 --> 01:50:35,334
Call the fire department.

1582
01:50:43,959 --> 01:50:45,750
Sir, what're you doing here?

1583
01:50:45,751 --> 01:50:48,417
Don't tell my wife.
Don't tell anyone.

1584
01:50:53,292 --> 01:50:54,042
This way.

1585
01:50:54,334 --> 01:50:55,334
OHH.

1586
01:50:55,375 --> 01:50:56,083

01:50:56,125 --> 01:50:58,000
OHH. OHH.

01:50:58,042 --> 01:50:58,876
NOKLAE!

1589
01:51:01,209 --> 01:51:03,958
Mom, the cops are here.

1590
01:51:03,959 --> 01:51:06,125
Hey wait! Get that box and
my handbag in the cabinet,

1591
01:51:06,167 --> 01:51:09,083
also what in the drawer.

1592
01:51:10,083 --> 01:51:11,560
Commander,
you don't have to go up there,

1593
01:51:11,584 --> 01:51:13,082
there're fire and smoke all around.

1594
01:51:13,083 --> 01:51:15,292
It's no problem for me,

1595
01:51:15,334 --> 01:51:16,792
just take this lady outside.

1596
01:51:16,834 --> 01:51:18,417
No, let me go with you.

1597
01:51:18,459 --> 01:51:21,209
- My children are up there.
- Take her out.

1598
01:51:21,250 --> 01:51:24,459
Let me go, I want to help my baby.

1599
01:51:24,918 --> 01:51:26,750
Come on. Hurry up.

1600

Hold it, you're all are under arrest.

1601
01:51:29,083 --> 01:51:29,501
NOKLAE.

1602
01:51:29,502 --> 01:51:33,250
- OHH.
- Daddy, I'm in here!

1603
01:51:33,292 --> 01:51:35,459

- ONN, daddy's here! Daddy!

1604
01:51:36,792 --> 01:51:38,000

1605
01:51:41,125 --> 01:51:41,751
ONN.

1606
01:51:42,209 --> 01:51:42,959
NOKLAE.

1607
01:51:47,250 --> 01:51:48,334
Where's OHH?

1608
01:51:48,375 --> 01:51:49,250
I don't know.

1609
01:51:49,918 --> 01:51:50,792
Let's go.

1610
01:51:52,459 --> 01:51:56,250
Daddy, he's the BOSS who kidnapped us.

1611
01:51:56,292 --> 01:51:58,083
You recognize me, you should die.

1612
01:51:58,125 --> 01:51:59,083
Freeze!

1613
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:01,292
Let the police do their job.

1614
01:52:01,334 --> 01:52:03,876
Let me go. My baby's inside.

1615
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:09,250
Let go of me, don't you understand?

1616
01:52:09,542 --> 01:52:11,302
I'll let go of you,
but you can't go inside.

1617
01:52:11,334 --> 01:52:19,918
Come on out, hurry up.

1618
01:52:22,209 --> 01:52:23,167
Let go of me.

1619
01:52:23,167 --> 01:52:23,834
Easy, man.

1620
01:52:23,835 --> 01:52:25,584
Easy man, I can walk by myself.

1621
01:52:35,834 --> 01:52:36,584
You...

1622
01:52:37,292 --> 01:52:38,375
Where did you keep my children?

1623
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:41,834
Take her away.

1624
01:52:44,375 --> 01:52:46,292
Why should you do this to my children?

1625
01:52:46,334 --> 01:52:47,209
Easy.

1626
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:54,250
Oh, my baby.

1627
01:52:54,292 --> 01:52:59,459
Mommy.

1628
01:52:59,501 --> 01:53:00,626
UMM, ONN.

1629
01:53:06,375 --> 01:53:07,959
Where is DAMRONG?
What about OHH?

1630
01:53:08,209 --> 01:53:12,334
I don't know yet.
He's looking for her.

1631
01:53:17,417 --> 01:53:18,584
Hey, NOKLAE.

1632
01:53:20,501 --> 01:53:21,542
Is the ambulance here yet?

1633
01:53:22,209 --> 01:53:23,459
This boy hurts badly.

1634
01:53:23,501 --> 01:53:24,542
How's NOKLAE?

1635
01:53:27,167 --> 01:53:29,501
I'll be out soon, I'll get you all.

1636
01:53:30,292 --> 01:53:31,292
I'm not afraid of you, you fucker!

1637
01:53:31,334 --> 01:53:32,542
Hey, let's go see NOKLAE.

1638
01:54:20,417 --> 01:54:22,417
Help! Help!

1639
01:54:26,334 --> 01:54:27,209
OHH.

1640
01:54:30,626 --> 01:54:31,292
Run!

1641
01:54:40,292 --> 01:54:40,792
Watch out!

1642
01:54:43,584 --> 01:54:47,167
Help! Help!

1643
01:54:56,751 --> 01:54:59,375
- Hey wait.
- OHH.

1644
01:55:00,209 --> 01:55:02,750
I think it would be safer
if you get out of this building now.

1645
01:55:02,751 --> 01:55:06,501
- Okay, take him out of here.
- Let go of me, please.

1646
01:55:06,542 --> 01:55:09,541
We'll find your daughter.

1647
01:55:09,542 --> 01:55:12,209
Let me go!

1648
01:55:13,209 --> 01:55:16,417
Let me go!
My daughter's still inside.

1649
01:55:16,459 --> 01:55:18,792
Let me go! OHH!

1650
01:55:20,417 --> 01:55:21,999
Easy man!

1651
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:24,292
We're doing everything to help her.

1652
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:27,792
Get us some fire coats,
we've got to find her.

1653
01:55:27,834 --> 01:55:28,459
Come on.

1654
01:55:28,501 --> 01:55:30,834
Only one kid.

1655
01:55:46,584 --> 01:55:48,501
- Commander please.
- Calm down, man!

1656
01:55:48,709 --> 01:55:51,375
Can I have a firecoat too, please...

1657
01:55:52,042 --> 01:55:53,751
Okay, get him one.

1658
01:55:53,792 --> 01:55:54,667
Come on.

1659
01:55:55,125 --> 01:55:57,000
One more Firecoat here.

1660
01:55:57,042 --> 01:55:58,083
Wearing something.

1661
01:56:25,626 --> 01:56:26,542
OHH.

1662
01:56:36,042 --> 01:56:37,209
Did you see my daughter?

1663
01:56:42,250 --> 01:56:43,250
OHH.

1664
01:56:55,918 --> 01:56:57,375
OHH.

1665
01:57:03,334 --> 01:57:04,584
OHH.

1666
01:57:09,584 --> 01:57:11,083
OHH.

1667
01:57:40,709 --> 01:57:42,000
Did you find my daughter?

1668
01:57:46,209 --> 01:57:47,584
Did anyone see my daughter?

1669
01:58:00,125 --> 01:58:01,000
Teachers.

1670
01:58:08,542 --> 01:58:10,209
Where is OHH? Where is she?

1671
01:58:11,250 --> 01:58:13,125
I still can't find her.

1672
01:58:13,584 --> 01:58:15,000
Why can't you find her?

1673
01:58:15,125 --> 01:58:16,167
Hey wait, don't go in there.

1674
01:58:16,209 --> 01:58:17,125
PHA, wait!

1675
01:58:17,626 --> 01:58:18,751
Mom.

1676
01:58:20,209 --> 01:58:21,250
PHA.

1677
01:58:21,292 --> 01:58:23,375
- OHH.
- Hold it PHA.

1678
01:58:23,667 --> 01:58:24,417
OHH.

1679
01:58:27,751 --> 01:58:29,416
- PHA.
- OHH.

1680
01:58:29,417 --> 01:58:30,876
Hold it PHA.

1681
01:58:34,459 --> 01:58:36,626
- Hold it PHA.
- OHH.

1682
01:58:37,375 --> 01:58:38,751
Hold it PHA...

1683
01:58:39,334 --> 01:58:42,918
trust me, I've looked all over.

1684
01:58:43,334 --> 01:58:44,626
She's not here.

1685
01:58:45,751 --> 01:58:48,959
You better take ONN
and UMM back to your place.

1686
01:58:49,709 --> 01:58:50,959
I'll keep looking for her.

1687
01:59:01,834 --> 01:59:03,751
OHH, where are you?

1688
01:59:11,918 --> 01:59:12,584
OHH.

1689
02:00:44,292 --> 02:00:45,667
Where is OHH?

1690
02:00:48,459 --> 02:00:50,626
I can't find her.

1691
02:01:02,792 --> 02:01:04,125
Go back to bed.

1692
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:07,751
We'll find her tomorrow.

1693
02:01:07,834 --> 02:01:09,751
I want to go home.

1694
02:01:10,918 --> 02:01:12,375
Oh son.

1695
02:01:29,501 --> 02:01:33,584
Will we find her, dad?

1696
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:35,000
We will.

1697
02:01:35,334 --> 02:01:37,459
I'll find her for sure.

1698
02:01:37,584 --> 02:01:38,792
After dropping us off at home.

1699
02:01:38,834 --> 02:01:41,834
Daddy will go with the police,
looking for her.

1700
02:02:06,626 --> 02:02:07,959
The police has found her.

1701
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:09,167
At a garbage dump.

1702
02:02:09,209 --> 02:02:10,501
Don't know where it is.

1703
02:02:10,542 --> 02:02:13,250
I know, but I don't know
how to get there.

1704
02:02:13,501 --> 02:02:14,542
It's okay son.

1705
02:02:14,959 --> 02:02:16,375
Let's get to the house first.

1706
02:02:16,417 --> 02:02:17,834
I'll take care of it.

1707
02:02:33,167 --> 02:02:34,750
I'll make a call to the police

1708
02:02:34,751 --> 02:02:36,459
and I'll get the bags out later.

1709
02:02:39,667 --> 02:02:40,667
Mommy.

1710
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:43,667
Here, come on out.

1711
02:02:57,292 --> 02:03:00,083
Did the police really find her?

1712
02:03:00,876 --> 02:03:02,209
I don't know yet.

1713
02:03:02,584 --> 02:03:04,667
May I go see Ninja, mom?

1714
02:03:05,209 --> 02:03:06,125
Sure.

1715
02:03:29,167 --> 02:03:31,708
Mommy, Mom!

1716
02:03:31,709 --> 02:03:34,249
OHH is here.

1717
02:03:34,250 --> 02:03:39,083
Mommy quick, OHH's over here.

1718
02:03:39,125 --> 02:03:41,834
Daddy! OHH is here.

1719
02:03:41,876 --> 02:03:42,918
Dad!

1720
02:03:42,959 --> 02:03:45,501
Quick, mommy quick, OHH's here.

1721
02:03:46,876 --> 02:03:48,292
OHH.

1722
02:03:48,709 --> 02:03:49,959
OHH.

1723
02:03:53,834 --> 02:03:54,792
OHH.

1724
02:04:00,542 --> 02:04:05,292
Don't leave anymore,
we'll be here together.

1725
02:04:16,292 --> 02:04:19,167
"Girl at the garbage dump"

1726
02:04:19,209 --> 02:04:21,250
"is not your child"

1727
02:04:21,292 --> 02:04:23,000
"we're still trying..."

1728
02:04:34,834 --> 02:04:36,083
It's over.

1729
02:04:36,250 --> 02:04:37,584
Let's get inside.

1730
02:04:38,751 --> 02:04:40,125
It's all over.

1731
02:04:54,792 --> 02:04:59,292
Be careful, don't drop it again.

1732
02:04:59,334 --> 02:05:00,375
It's okay.

1733
02:05:01,375 --> 02:05:04,083
See? Like I said.

1734
02:05:07,083 --> 02:05:09,000
Hand it over to me.

1735
02:05:19,751 --> 02:05:23,751
See? UMM,
this turtle is really a fucker.

1736
02:06:07,667 --> 02:06:08,501
Hello.

1737
02:06:10,083 --> 02:06:12,626
We'd like to see NOKLAE and THONG.

1738
02:06:12,667 --> 02:06:15,124
Pardon me sir,
are you related to the boys?

1739
02:06:15,125 --> 02:06:16,965
Normally, not manybody
ever come to visit them.

1740
02:06:17,417 --> 02:06:19,667
We're not related, but...

1741
02:06:20,292 --> 02:06:24,167
NOKLAE, THONG and their friend used
to help our children.

1742
02:06:24,417 --> 02:06:25,666
I see.

1743
02:06:25,667 --> 02:06:28,999
Quick! Some boys are trying to escape.

1744
02:06:29,000 --> 02:06:31,709
Come on.

1745
02:06:31,751 --> 02:06:33,417
They're climbling the back wall.

1746
02:06:33,459 --> 02:06:36,250
I saw it from my window.

1747
02:06:36,292 --> 02:06:38,375
It's NOKLAE.

1748
02:06:39,834 --> 02:06:40,876
Hey, there! Student!

1749
02:06:42,667 --> 02:06:44,000
Hey, come down.

1750
02:06:50,334 --> 02:06:51,667
Don't go.

1751
02:06:53,375 --> 02:06:54,334
Come on.

02:06:57,459 --> 02:06:58,918
Hurry up.

1753
02:06:59,042 --> 02:07:01,083
NOKLAE, don't go.

1754
02:07:01,334 --> 02:07:02,959
THONG, don't go.

1755
02:07:03,125 --> 02:07:04,709
Come on, let's go.
The bus is coming.

1756
02:07:06,042 --> 02:07:07,042

- Let's go. NOKLAE.

1760
02:07:12,918 --> 02:07:14,042
OHH, don't go.

OHH.

1762
02:07:19,375 --> 02:07:21,250

1764
02:07:29,375 --> 02:07:32,292
NOKLAE don't go, THONG.

1765
02:08:24,501 --> 02:08:31,125
<i>Whoever love us as their lives.</i>
