4
00:00:47,788 --> 00:00:49,517
How do you do?

5
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:54,825
I'm Takiguchi,
one of this film's characters.

6
00:00:54,928 --> 00:00:59,524
This is the story of a woman
who calls me "Brother."

7
00:00:59,967 --> 00:01:03,198
Her name? It's Sada.

8
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:07,267
Yes. That famous Sada. Sada Abe.

9
00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:13,869
She insists on telling you
about herself.

10
00:01:13,981 --> 00:01:19,920
Facts can easily become fiction
when recounted by someone

11
00:01:20,554 --> 00:01:22,852
even by oneself.

12
00:01:24,257 --> 00:01:29,251
But with a bit of sincerity,
lies can become truth.

13
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:33,961
So, why not enjoy yourselves
this evening

14
00:01:34,101 --> 00:01:37,696
by listening to Sada's story?

15
00:01:38,472 --> 00:01:42,101
She's like a lovable kid sister to me.

16
00:01:42,209 --> 00:01:45,303
I apologize for her rudeness.

17
00:01:45,412 --> 00:01:48,609
I'd appreciate your generosity.

18
00:01:48,982 --> 00:01:52,509
I'll see you again later.

19
00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:54,280
Excuse me.

20
00:01:55,389 --> 00:01:56,617
Step aside!

"Sada Abe really lived.

43
00:04:49,529 --> 00:04:51,429
She is well known

44
00:04:51,598 --> 00:04:55,762
because she sliced off
her man's sexual organ.

45
00:04:56,937 --> 00:05:03,433
But of course, her life cannot be told
only through that episode."

46
00:05:05,445 --> 00:05:09,643
<i>I, too, had a childhood.</i>

<i>as neither happy nor unhappy.</i>

52

SUMMER 1919

55
00:05:45,318 --> 00:05:47,878
Open up. Please!

56
00:05:48,088 --> 00:05:50,181
I have a question!

57
00:05:54,728 --> 00:05:58,664
How many times must I repeat this?

58
00:05:59,165 --> 00:06:01,963
I won't leave until you answer!

59
00:06:06,206 --> 00:06:07,571
Yes?

60
00:06:09,676 --> 00:06:11,075
You a maid?

61
00:06:11,244 --> 00:06:12,233
As you can see.

62
00:06:12,412 --> 00:06:15,711
I must talk to your mistress!

63
00:06:15,882 --> 00:06:19,283
She's home.
I saw her just now.

64
00:06:21,021 --> 00:06:23,387
Listen. Tell me!

65
00:06:23,556 --> 00:06:26,616
Her son, a college boy,

66
00:06:26,793 --> 00:06:30,456
dragged my daughter into an inn!

67
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:35,397
Do something!
If worst comes to worst, she'll die.

68
00:06:35,635 --> 00:06:39,594
She's just a schoolgirl.
She's only 14.

69
00:06:41,875 --> 00:06:44,207
You hear me, eh?

70
00:06:44,377 --> 00:06:46,106
She's only 14!

71
00:06:52,419 --> 00:06:55,183
You think you can deceive us like this?

72
00:06:56,856 --> 00:06:59,654
Because she's a merchant's daughter,
you think she isn't human?

73
00:07:06,433 --> 00:07:12,065
Being here with a man
means you know what happens.

74
00:07:12,672 --> 00:07:13,798
Okay?

75
00:07:14,507 --> 00:07:15,974
Stop.

76
00:07:17,444 --> 00:07:19,469
It's too late to stop.

77
00:08:04,024 --> 00:08:05,389
I'm scared.

78
00:08:08,194 --> 00:08:12,221
Silly. This isn't the first time
for you, eh?

79
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,067
It is.

80
00:08:15,802 --> 00:08:19,533
Liar! You're well-known among us.

81
00:08:19,706 --> 00:08:22,436
At your age you already have a man.

82
00:08:24,511 --> 00:08:25,876
That's not true!

83
00:08:26,513 --> 00:08:28,447
I'll make it true.

84
00:08:29,449 --> 00:08:31,110
No!

85
00:08:36,589 --> 00:08:38,284
That hurts!

86
00:08:57,911 --> 00:09:00,277
That hurts!

87
00:09:48,294 --> 00:09:49,818
Who are you?

88
00:09:54,567 --> 00:09:57,559
How rude to barge into my room.

89
00:09:57,737 --> 00:09:59,204
Toshihiko.

90
00:10:00,106 --> 00:10:01,835
Aren't you the one who's being rude?

91
00:10:05,945 --> 00:10:06,843
You Okada?

92
00:10:56,729 --> 00:10:58,720
She needs treatment.

93
00:11:00,133 --> 00:11:02,465
- Call a doc.
- Don't do that.

94
00:11:03,169 --> 00:11:05,296
It'll cause trouble.

95
00:11:07,807 --> 00:11:09,069
I have money.

96
00:11:09,442 --> 00:11:12,070
Use this to take care of it.

97
00:11:13,146 --> 00:11:14,636
We're friends, right?

98
00:11:16,583 --> 00:11:18,744
I don't like weepy women.

99
00:11:39,372 --> 00:11:40,862
Take it easy.

100
00:11:42,208 --> 00:11:43,641
I'm a medical student.

101
00:11:44,944 --> 00:11:46,639
I'll treat you.

102
00:11:47,947 --> 00:11:49,972
This is my aunt's place.

103
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:51,910
Stay here.

104
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,046
Please.

105
00:11:55,822 --> 00:11:57,687
Stay by me.

106
00:11:58,691 --> 00:12:00,591
You're bleeding.

107
00:13:20,907 --> 00:13:23,171
It's all right now.

108
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:25,735
Rest for a while.

109
00:13:26,446 --> 00:13:30,177
Stay here.
Stay here, please.

110
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:32,515
If you leave me,

111
00:13:34,187 --> 00:13:36,212
I'll kill myself with this.

112
00:13:36,389 --> 00:13:38,755
I don't want to be left alone.

113
00:13:38,925 --> 00:13:41,291
Look at my blood.
It's scarlet.

114
00:13:41,461 --> 00:13:42,928
Look at that.

115
00:13:43,229 --> 00:13:46,289
I'll bleed even more.

116
00:13:58,978 --> 00:14:01,276
I bought these for my aunt.

117
00:14:04,984 --> 00:14:06,212
Have one.

118
00:14:08,321 --> 00:14:09,481
Eat it.

119
00:14:30,843 --> 00:14:32,401
It's sweet.

120
00:15:26,966 --> 00:15:28,866
FATAL DISEASE

121
00:15:36,183 --> 00:15:39,949
How odd!
Raining on a lucky day.

122
00:15:40,187 --> 00:15:41,916
A lucky day?

123
00:15:43,524 --> 00:15:44,991
You're here.

124
00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:54,558
You don't have to talk.
Just stay by my side.

125
00:15:54,735 --> 00:15:56,828
I've never met anyone like you.

126
00:15:57,971 --> 00:15:59,029
I detest him.

127
00:16:00,107 --> 00:16:02,268
Not you.

128
00:16:02,743 --> 00:16:04,074
That student.

129
00:16:04,745 --> 00:16:06,269
To think how he tricked me.

130
00:16:09,883 --> 00:16:13,717
I can't get married now.

131
00:16:13,887 --> 00:16:15,787
Will you marry me?

132
00:16:15,956 --> 00:16:17,890
Sorry, I can't.

133
00:16:18,058 --> 00:16:19,855
Then die with me.

134
00:16:21,929 --> 00:16:23,362
Die?

135
00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:26,458
Yes. Double suicide.

136
00:16:34,207 --> 00:16:35,196
Listen.

137
00:16:35,709 --> 00:16:40,271
Why do you wear dark glasses
all the time?

138
00:16:44,318 --> 00:16:47,014
I know you have lovely eyes.

139
00:16:48,055 --> 00:16:49,488
Why hide them?

140
00:16:49,656 --> 00:16:50,953
Sada.

141
00:16:52,426 --> 00:16:54,087
You should know this:

142
00:16:55,462 --> 00:17:01,799
Though we just met,
we mustn't meet again.

143
00:17:03,570 --> 00:17:04,832
Why not?

144
00:17:05,472 --> 00:17:06,734
Tell me.

145
00:17:07,174 --> 00:17:08,732
Why not?

146
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:13,177
I won't tell you.

147
00:17:13,347 --> 00:17:14,939
Tell me!

148
00:17:21,355 --> 00:17:22,822
You're nice.

149
00:17:23,924 --> 00:17:25,391
An honest girl.

150
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:32,321
Don't go astray
just because of this.

151
00:17:33,967 --> 00:17:35,559
Wherever I am,

152
00:17:36,203 --> 00:17:39,798
I'll watch over you in my heart.

153
00:17:44,511 --> 00:17:47,537
We'll say good-bye here.

154
00:17:48,982 --> 00:17:50,609
Find happiness.

155
00:17:52,085 --> 00:17:54,144
No! You're lying!

156
00:17:54,655 --> 00:17:57,818
You don't care about me at all!

157
00:17:58,358 --> 00:18:02,351
Watch over me in your heart?
Where is the heart, really?

158
00:18:07,234 --> 00:18:10,965
You're right.
Even X-rays can't show where it is.

159
00:18:23,417 --> 00:18:26,750
Use this and cut out my heart.

160
00:18:34,528 --> 00:18:37,520
Do like this.

161
00:18:54,848 --> 00:18:56,042
Look.

162
00:18:57,751 --> 00:18:59,548
This is my heart.

163
00:19:01,722 --> 00:19:03,053
It's yours.

164
00:19:03,223 --> 00:19:05,248
Take it with you.

165
00:19:08,729 --> 00:19:10,629
The knife too.

166
00:19:11,798 --> 00:19:17,430
Then you can believe
you took my heart yourself.

167
00:19:18,438 --> 00:19:20,372
Blood gushes

168
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:22,735
from my heart too.

169
00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:26,979
Now let's part here.

170
00:19:28,148 --> 00:19:30,173
I'll be going far away.

171
00:19:30,684 --> 00:19:32,083
I'll never

172
00:19:33,587 --> 00:19:35,282
come back again.

173
00:19:39,826 --> 00:19:41,157
Good-bye.

174
00:20:10,724 --> 00:20:13,625
I hate rainy days.

175
00:20:19,032 --> 00:20:20,499
<i>Hansen's disease.</i>

176
00:20:20,867 --> 00:20:23,665
<i>Okada suffered from it.</i>

177
00:20:23,937 --> 00:20:26,599
<i>It was regarded as incurable.</i>

178
00:20:26,773 --> 00:20:29,901
<i>Its patients were isolated.</i>

179
00:20:30,277 --> 00:20:33,804
<i>Okada was secretly sent away
to a remote island,</i>

180
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:36,574
<i>and Sada never knew.</i>

181
00:20:36,883 --> 00:20:41,320
<i>Okada lived during Sada's lifetime,
but did they meet and part like this?</i>

182
00:20:41,822 --> 00:20:46,259
<i>Sada spoke little about it,
and no one actually knows.</i>

183
00:20:46,626 --> 00:20:50,995
<i>This film trespasses
in the mysterious realm of Sada.</i>

184
00:21:03,343 --> 00:21:07,404
Are you going
to sell those kimonos again?

185
00:21:07,581 --> 00:21:11,039
Yes.
What's wrong with selling mine?

186
00:21:11,218 --> 00:21:12,742
Now you're just quibbling.

187
00:21:12,919 --> 00:21:15,683
You quit school.
You're a truant.

188
00:21:15,856 --> 00:21:18,984
Your dad says
he might make you a geisha.

189
00:21:19,159 --> 00:21:21,184
Really? Why not?

190
00:21:23,096 --> 00:21:25,690
How can I ignore my dad?

191
00:21:25,999 --> 00:21:30,402
Stop asking that student to marry me.

192
00:21:30,904 --> 00:21:33,429
He'll never marry me.

193
00:21:33,607 --> 00:21:35,541
I'll have a miserable life!

194
00:21:36,209 --> 00:21:39,701
But we must make him pay

195
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,913
for what he did
to our precious daughter.

196
00:21:43,083 --> 00:21:44,573
It's <i>me</i> he did it to.

197
00:21:44,985 --> 00:21:48,682
Don't try to sell my virginity to him.

198
00:21:48,855 --> 00:21:50,880
That's so lowdown.

199
00:21:51,057 --> 00:21:53,184
Then what am I to do?

200
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:56,227
He said you made eyes at him.

201
00:21:56,496 --> 00:21:58,088
Like this?

202
00:21:59,165 --> 00:22:00,598
Money isn't the issue.

203
00:22:00,767 --> 00:22:04,897
We should've made him
apologize in public.

204
00:22:07,007 --> 00:22:09,635
Don't you agree?

205
00:22:13,146 --> 00:22:14,636
But what's done is done.

206
00:22:14,981 --> 00:22:18,610
I can't regain my virginity anyway.

207
00:22:19,452 --> 00:22:21,113
Sada.

208
00:22:21,488 --> 00:22:26,084
Tell Dad I'll be glad to be
a geisha or anything.

209
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,257
Out of my way!

210
00:22:32,632 --> 00:22:36,124
<i>I was still the person
I had always been,</i>

211
00:22:36,303 --> 00:22:40,865
<i>but perhaps the world
saw me differently now.</i>

212
00:22:41,074 --> 00:22:44,305
<i>Anyway, it didn't really concern me.</i>

213
00:22:45,312 --> 00:22:49,146
<i>I could be more at ease than before.</i>

214
00:22:49,316 --> 00:22:52,752
<i>In a way, I was enjoying myself.</i>

215
00:22:53,353 --> 00:22:55,514
- Wait!
- Run!

216
00:22:56,489 --> 00:22:59,356
Two cops against the seven of us.

217
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:02,091
They'll never get us.

218
00:23:03,563 --> 00:23:05,554
Try to get us!

219
00:23:06,299 --> 00:23:07,425
Hey, wait!

220
00:23:18,111 --> 00:23:21,080
Only idiots wait for cops!

221
00:23:22,115 --> 00:23:24,049
Try to get us!

222
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:26,115
Let's go!

223
00:23:26,953 --> 00:23:28,215
Wait!

224
00:23:30,490 --> 00:23:31,980
Wait!

225
00:24:48,535 --> 00:24:52,801
That student looked rich,
but he was broke.

226
00:24:59,479 --> 00:25:03,540
Let's blackmail
rich old men next time.

227
00:25:04,517 --> 00:25:06,883
<i>Where are you, Okada?</i>

228
00:25:07,053 --> 00:25:08,850
<i>Did you run away?</i>

229
00:25:10,190 --> 00:25:11,487
Cops!

230
00:25:20,333 --> 00:25:21,459
Which way?

231
00:25:21,634 --> 00:25:22,760
That way!

232
00:25:26,172 --> 00:25:27,161
Wait!

233
00:25:59,205 --> 00:26:02,504
Run! Sada, run!

234
00:26:06,779 --> 00:26:08,440
Get away!

235
00:26:08,748 --> 00:26:14,380
<i>My childhood was over
before I even knew it.</i>

236
00:26:14,554 --> 00:26:17,751
I never thought of you as this sexy.

237
00:26:17,924 --> 00:26:19,221
Sexy?

238
00:26:19,759 --> 00:26:21,659
You've matured.

239
00:26:22,195 --> 00:26:24,561
Your dad told me.
A lot has happened, eh?

240
00:26:25,064 --> 00:26:27,191
Your brother left home
with a woman.

241
00:26:27,367 --> 00:26:30,700
Your dad had a big tatami shop,

242
00:26:30,870 --> 00:26:33,304
but he closed it to pay debts.

243
00:26:34,107 --> 00:26:36,735
Anything can happen in life.

244
00:26:36,910 --> 00:26:39,538
Business is slow in Japan.

245
00:26:39,712 --> 00:26:42,272
Recession is everywhere.

246
00:26:42,448 --> 00:26:46,578
But there's no recession
where you're going to work.

247
00:26:47,487 --> 00:26:51,753
Men can't resist
as long as they have money.

248
00:26:52,792 --> 00:26:58,094
A geisha's job is
to sell her art, right?

249
00:26:58,431 --> 00:26:59,921
Yes. "Art."

250
00:27:00,533 --> 00:27:02,899
A very feminine art.

251
00:27:42,475 --> 00:27:45,000
Can she play the <i>samisen?</i>

252
00:27:46,079 --> 00:27:48,604
She doesn't just play music, ma'am.

253
00:27:48,915 --> 00:27:52,476
She dances well too. Right?

254
00:27:53,386 --> 00:27:55,445
Then play this.

255
00:28:02,629 --> 00:28:05,621
Play anything you like.

256
00:28:08,134 --> 00:28:09,226
All right?

257
00:28:20,847 --> 00:28:25,284
<i>"Cat" is slang for geisha</i>

258
00:28:25,618 --> 00:28:28,086
<i>They call me cat</i>

259
00:28:28,621 --> 00:28:35,584
<i>But do you think a cat comes
wearing clogs and kimono</i>

260
00:29:07,393 --> 00:29:12,456
THE GREAT EARTHQUAKE OF 1923

261
00:30:20,366 --> 00:30:22,527
<i>My mind is elsewhere.</i>

262
00:30:23,202 --> 00:30:26,296
<i>Only my body is hot.</i>

263
00:30:30,042 --> 00:30:36,379
<i>An endless stream of men came and went,
and endless days as well.</i>

264
00:30:44,497 --> 00:30:46,055
SUMMER 1929

265
00:30:46,833 --> 00:30:49,597
It's been 10 years.
I've moved all over Japan.

266
00:30:49,836 --> 00:30:51,827
I've used aliases.

267
00:30:52,572 --> 00:30:55,040
Geishas sell their bodies too,

268
00:30:55,341 --> 00:30:58,799
so why not just be a whore instead?
I felt more at ease that way.

269
00:30:59,312 --> 00:31:02,338
I don't dislike this racket,

270
00:31:02,715 --> 00:31:05,149
and I get to choose my clients too.

271
00:31:17,997 --> 00:31:19,328
Miyako,

272
00:31:19,899 --> 00:31:21,662
there's a client for you.

273
00:31:22,535 --> 00:31:25,060
A client at this hour?

274
00:31:30,610 --> 00:31:32,168
All right.

275
00:31:41,354 --> 00:31:45,415
Why, it's you, Brother!

276
00:31:46,259 --> 00:31:49,786
I heard you were ill,
so I came to see you.

277
00:31:50,630 --> 00:31:53,360
Thank you for coming all this way.

278
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:59,499
This racket and this illness
go together.

279
00:32:00,139 --> 00:32:03,165
There's an offer for you.

280
00:32:04,477 --> 00:32:07,810
Why not work at Kusatsu spa?

281
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:09,447
It'll cure your illness.

282
00:32:09,916 --> 00:32:11,076
I know.

283
00:32:11,951 --> 00:32:14,511
That's what you came for.

284
00:32:14,854 --> 00:32:18,153
You'll make more money off me.

285
00:32:20,593 --> 00:32:25,587
Otherwise, you wouldn't have come
all the way to Osaka to see me.

286
00:32:29,035 --> 00:32:31,128
You're a real professional now.

287
00:32:32,004 --> 00:32:33,232
Meaning?

288
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:37,074
Do I look so sexy?

289
00:32:38,611 --> 00:32:41,978
You've always been sexy
and a straight talker.

290
00:32:47,219 --> 00:32:52,714
Doesn't it bother your clients?
I'm amazed.

291
00:32:53,526 --> 00:32:55,858
Why not become one of them?

292
00:32:56,028 --> 00:32:58,963
Silly!
You're like my sister.

293
00:32:59,131 --> 00:33:01,827
You want to lay me
as long as it's free, huh?

294
00:33:03,135 --> 00:33:04,727
Your face says so.

295
00:33:05,071 --> 00:33:07,232
I'm old enough to see that.

296
00:33:08,841 --> 00:33:11,105
It's my long experience.

297
00:33:17,917 --> 00:33:20,351
Sonomaru, a client.

298
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:22,410
- A client?
- Yes.

299
00:33:22,588 --> 00:33:25,352
He says it won't take long.

300
00:33:27,126 --> 00:33:28,923
It's my job.

301
00:33:29,895 --> 00:33:30,919
Brother.

302
00:33:32,231 --> 00:33:33,255
Hurry!

303
00:33:44,076 --> 00:33:45,407
Come in.

304
00:33:45,578 --> 00:33:47,671
Please take good care of him.

305
00:33:52,718 --> 00:33:56,313
I'm being sent to Manchuria tomorrow.

306
00:33:57,323 --> 00:34:01,191
I'm embarrassed to say it,
but I've never had a woman.

307
00:34:01,627 --> 00:34:03,094
I put myself in your hands.

308
00:34:04,163 --> 00:34:06,495
His father's waiting downstairs.

309
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:07,788
Yes.

310
00:34:08,134 --> 00:34:12,264
Once I taste a woman,
I won't let myself be killed easily.

311
00:34:12,438 --> 00:34:14,235
That's what Dad said.

312
00:34:43,936 --> 00:34:45,767
Manchuria, eh?

313
00:34:47,373 --> 00:34:49,273
For your country?

314
00:34:49,608 --> 00:34:50,597
Yes.

315
00:34:50,910 --> 00:34:53,811
I'll serve my mother country.

316
00:34:54,447 --> 00:34:56,108
How great!

317
00:34:56,816 --> 00:34:59,284
Men serve their country.

318
00:34:59,952 --> 00:35:02,716
I never thought of it.

319
00:35:03,856 --> 00:35:05,084
But...

320
00:35:06,292 --> 00:35:10,251
I'll make you a real man.

321
00:35:10,930 --> 00:35:12,227
Thank you.

322
00:35:17,536 --> 00:35:20,403
Relax, all right?

323
00:35:27,012 --> 00:35:30,243
Just do as I say.

324
00:35:58,344 --> 00:36:02,781
Let's go to Manchuria together.

325
00:36:03,616 --> 00:36:05,083
Yes, let's.

326
00:36:06,385 --> 00:36:07,875
No.

327
00:36:08,387 --> 00:36:09,547
Let's go.

328
00:36:09,722 --> 00:36:11,212
- We can't go.
- Yes, we can.

329
00:36:11,390 --> 00:36:12,823
Yes, we'll go.

330
00:36:14,493 --> 00:36:16,620
No. No.

331
00:36:16,896 --> 00:36:18,796
I can't hold it.

332
00:36:18,964 --> 00:36:20,261
Not yet.

333
00:36:20,833 --> 00:36:22,095
Take it slow.

334
00:36:22,701 --> 00:36:23,793
Slow.

335
00:36:23,969 --> 00:36:26,301
We'll go to Manchuria.

336
00:36:26,472 --> 00:36:27,632
That's right.

337
00:36:28,107 --> 00:36:29,506
It feels so good!

338
00:36:55,634 --> 00:36:59,161
You're amazing, Sada! Irresistible!

339
00:36:59,371 --> 00:37:02,340
It really got me excited.
When you touched him down there.

340
00:37:02,508 --> 00:37:04,442
Soldiers are special.

341
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:05,768
Thanks.

342
00:37:08,214 --> 00:37:11,308
Okayo, a client.

343
00:37:11,984 --> 00:37:13,042
A client?

344
00:37:19,525 --> 00:37:20,753
Some tea?

345
00:37:21,227 --> 00:37:24,025
No, thanks. I'm in a hurry!

346
00:37:39,879 --> 00:37:42,404
One, two

347
00:38:01,467 --> 00:38:03,264
Boss!

348
00:38:11,110 --> 00:38:12,668
You're doing well, eh?

349
00:38:15,814 --> 00:38:17,714
What are you doing?

350
00:38:17,883 --> 00:38:21,216
How can I control myself now?

351
00:38:21,387 --> 00:38:23,082
You'll catch what I have.

352
00:38:23,322 --> 00:38:24,448
Who cares?

353
00:38:26,525 --> 00:38:28,652
- Brother.
- Who cares?

354
00:38:28,961 --> 00:38:31,191
Why are you speaking
with an Osaka accent?

355
00:38:31,363 --> 00:38:32,853
Who cares?

356
00:38:37,636 --> 00:38:41,766
Thank you for your hard work, Kimie.

357
00:38:47,513 --> 00:38:48,707
Thanks.

358
00:38:49,348 --> 00:38:52,909
Your box sure is great.

359
00:38:53,919 --> 00:38:57,719
It's more than just experience.

360
00:38:59,992 --> 00:39:02,825
Sorry about this.

361
00:39:03,896 --> 00:39:07,354
What'll we do? Shall I pay you?

362
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:10,032
How can I take money from you?

363
00:39:11,503 --> 00:39:13,130
Instead,

364
00:39:13,405 --> 00:39:18,206
there's a man I want to lay me free.

365
00:39:19,378 --> 00:39:20,868
You love him?

366
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:22,377
No.

367
00:39:22,848 --> 00:39:25,316
He's the one who stole my virginity.

368
00:39:25,751 --> 00:39:27,912
Why for free?

369
00:39:28,287 --> 00:39:33,953
If a whore refuses money from a man,
it's a big insult to him.

370
00:39:34,393 --> 00:39:37,794
I'll get back at him that way.

371
00:39:39,131 --> 00:39:43,192
Look for him and bring him to me.

372
00:39:49,108 --> 00:39:51,008
You're an interesting woman.

373
00:39:53,278 --> 00:39:54,472
No.

374
00:39:55,647 --> 00:39:57,547
You're a dreadful woman.

375
00:40:02,588 --> 00:40:06,854
Thus time passed once again.

376
00:40:20,672 --> 00:40:24,267
Do you know why flowers
are so lovely like this?

377
00:40:24,443 --> 00:40:25,410
Pardon?

378
00:40:25,744 --> 00:40:27,302
SUMMER 1935

379
00:40:27,479 --> 00:40:29,709
Flowers are like a woman's equipment.

380
00:40:29,882 --> 00:40:31,213
Oh, madam

381
00:40:31,383 --> 00:40:35,945
Flowers bloom just for that purpose.

382
00:40:36,422 --> 00:40:39,391
They attract bees,
then their petals fall away.

383
00:40:40,125 --> 00:40:42,753
It would be sad
if people were the same way.

384
00:40:43,328 --> 00:40:47,856
People are different because
they have something called a "heart."

385
00:40:48,033 --> 00:40:49,227
Understand?

386
00:40:49,501 --> 00:40:51,594
Where did you hear that?

387
00:40:51,770 --> 00:40:54,068
I read it in that magazine.

388
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:57,031
HOUSEWIVES' FRI END

389
00:40:58,177 --> 00:40:59,974
The master's back.

390
00:41:02,581 --> 00:41:05,675
And don't call me madam.

391
00:41:05,984 --> 00:41:08,452
I'm just a concubine.

392
00:41:23,168 --> 00:41:27,229
She knows what to do,
so have a nice time.

393
00:41:29,475 --> 00:41:30,840
Welcome back.

394
00:41:39,251 --> 00:41:41,742
Welcome. My name is Sada.

395
00:41:42,821 --> 00:41:44,311
Welcome back.

396
00:41:45,023 --> 00:41:46,149
Mr. Tachibana.

397
00:41:47,726 --> 00:41:49,819
Pleased to meet you.

398
00:41:51,663 --> 00:41:54,496
A bath first, or something to eat?

399
00:41:54,666 --> 00:41:55,963
A bath first.

400
00:41:56,235 --> 00:41:57,964
Let him change his clothes and relax.

401
00:41:59,271 --> 00:42:00,738
Excuse me.

402
00:42:02,007 --> 00:42:03,804
See you later.

403
00:42:15,154 --> 00:42:16,883
I'll do it.

404
00:42:20,659 --> 00:42:21,819
Sorry.

405
00:42:22,494 --> 00:42:23,961
Excuse me.

406
00:42:31,837 --> 00:42:32,963
I'll do it.

407
00:42:41,847 --> 00:42:42,814
Listen.

408
00:42:44,550 --> 00:42:46,677
You were wrong.

409
00:42:49,054 --> 00:42:54,458
You weren't formal enough
when introducing yourself.

410
00:42:56,895 --> 00:43:01,832
You must speak more politely
to men in my position.

411
00:43:23,989 --> 00:43:25,081
Another thing.

412
00:43:25,257 --> 00:43:28,715
I can take of myself.

413
00:43:28,961 --> 00:43:30,223
Leave me alone.

414
00:43:34,766 --> 00:43:36,927
<i>I felt he had made a fool of me.</i>

415
00:43:37,202 --> 00:43:41,605
<i>I decided to conquer him for revenge.</i>

416
00:43:57,222 --> 00:43:59,452
Don't touch me there.

417
00:43:59,958 --> 00:44:03,587
I'm a man, after all.
It makes me feel strange.

418
00:44:10,035 --> 00:44:14,131
Then why not just feel strange?

419
00:44:19,578 --> 00:44:21,910
You have soft hands.

420
00:44:24,650 --> 00:44:27,483
No. You mustn't do this.

421
00:44:28,353 --> 00:44:29,513
Master.

422
00:44:30,422 --> 00:44:31,719
Don't.

423
00:44:32,291 --> 00:44:34,623
What's your name?

424
00:44:36,094 --> 00:44:38,028
It's Sada.

425
00:44:38,797 --> 00:44:41,630
You were wrong again.

426
00:44:41,967 --> 00:44:44,060
Why not be wrong with me?

427
00:44:45,937 --> 00:44:46,961
Sada.

428
00:45:06,725 --> 00:45:08,784
Aren't you Sada?

429
00:45:09,328 --> 00:45:11,228
Mom!

430
00:45:13,031 --> 00:45:14,589
It's me.

431
00:45:15,667 --> 00:45:17,464
I came home to see you.

432
00:45:20,772 --> 00:45:22,865
It's been so long.

433
00:45:28,046 --> 00:45:30,037
Could this really be true?

434
00:45:31,550 --> 00:45:32,574
Yes, it is.

435
00:45:32,751 --> 00:45:35,151
You're seeing the real Sada.

436
00:45:37,456 --> 00:45:39,686
A gift for you.

437
00:45:41,693 --> 00:45:43,422
Thank you.

438
00:45:44,329 --> 00:45:46,820
When you wrote
you were coming home,

439
00:45:47,265 --> 00:45:50,257
your dad didn't believe it.

440
00:45:50,435 --> 00:45:54,303
I believed it.
I prayed to Buddha.

441
00:45:54,473 --> 00:45:56,498
And I told your dad you'd come.

442
00:45:56,675 --> 00:45:59,075
Of course I'd come home.

443
00:45:59,244 --> 00:46:00,734
But still!

444
00:46:00,912 --> 00:46:04,609
I never lied to Dad or you.

445
00:46:04,850 --> 00:46:06,943
That's why I got scolded so often!

446
00:46:08,653 --> 00:46:10,280
Let's go.

447
00:46:13,581 --> 00:46:16,015
You're really beautiful.

448
00:46:16,851 --> 00:46:18,318
I'm a lady.

449
00:46:20,121 --> 00:46:21,554
I'll carry your things.

450
00:46:21,723 --> 00:46:24,988
No. It's part of my outfit.

451
00:46:29,130 --> 00:46:31,121
What a nice day!

452
00:46:38,373 --> 00:46:40,807
How's Dad doing these days?

453
00:46:41,643 --> 00:46:46,376
He sits and looks out
on the landscape all day.

454
00:46:46,548 --> 00:46:47,446
Good.

455
00:46:48,683 --> 00:46:51,015
We owe you so much.

456
00:46:51,386 --> 00:46:53,411
You send us money.

457
00:46:53,588 --> 00:46:57,183
We can buy medicine
and pay doctors.

458
00:46:58,259 --> 00:47:01,695
No one else here sees a doctor.

459
00:47:02,797 --> 00:47:04,128
This way.

460
00:47:05,767 --> 00:47:07,394
What about you?

461
00:47:07,569 --> 00:47:11,665
I met a big shot for the first time.

462
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:15,401
I know. Takiguchi told us.

463
00:47:15,910 --> 00:47:18,435
You're fortunate.

464
00:47:19,147 --> 00:47:23,948
You worked hard
and it brought you good fortune.

465
00:47:25,153 --> 00:47:26,916
His name is Tachibana?

466
00:47:27,088 --> 00:47:32,025
He's a school principal.
He'll be in parliament too.

467
00:47:32,727 --> 00:47:36,527
But he didn't tell me that.
I found out on my own.

468
00:47:36,698 --> 00:47:41,067
Maybe he wants to hide what he is.

469
00:47:41,236 --> 00:47:45,798
He pays me and teaches me lots.

470
00:47:45,974 --> 00:47:49,137
He told me to go see my parents.

471
00:47:49,310 --> 00:47:52,074
He said to be a dutiful daughter.

472
00:47:54,149 --> 00:47:55,673
I'm so grateful to him.

473
00:47:57,986 --> 00:48:00,921
After I leave here,

474
00:48:01,222 --> 00:48:04,988
he told me to be an apprentice
in a Tokyo restaurant.

475
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:06,286
A restaurant?

476
00:48:06,461 --> 00:48:08,053
To study cooking.

477
00:48:08,696 --> 00:48:14,396
Then he'll give me enough
to run a small restaurant.

478
00:48:20,341 --> 00:48:22,104
Let's race, Mom.

479
00:48:27,916 --> 00:48:29,941
Ready?

480
00:48:30,518 --> 00:48:31,712
Go!

481
00:48:55,176 --> 00:48:57,542
Dad!

482
00:49:03,651 --> 00:49:05,710
I feel better.

483
00:49:08,089 --> 00:49:11,991
Japanese kimonos are something.

484
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:16,324
This dress suits you too.

485
00:49:16,498 --> 00:49:19,695
It's the "modern girl" style.

486
00:49:19,934 --> 00:49:21,492
It's the rage now.

487
00:49:22,170 --> 00:49:25,003
I wanted to surprise you.

488
00:49:25,173 --> 00:49:28,939
Actually, I hate it.

489
00:49:29,944 --> 00:49:32,174
Why not show it to your dad?

490
00:49:33,047 --> 00:49:35,481
It'd shock him to death.

491
00:49:43,024 --> 00:49:47,586
I always wanted to tell you this.

492
00:49:48,530 --> 00:49:50,225
What?

493
00:49:53,768 --> 00:49:57,864
That college student
who made you suffer so

494
00:49:59,007 --> 00:50:00,531
He died.

495
00:50:01,476 --> 00:50:06,607
He became a pilot
and crashed during a drill.

496
00:50:08,283 --> 00:50:10,046
He was punished.

497
00:50:11,853 --> 00:50:15,050
And the other student you mentioned

498
00:50:15,223 --> 00:50:17,817
His name was Okada.

499
00:50:19,794 --> 00:50:21,989
I thought you knew this.

500
00:50:23,765 --> 00:50:27,758
He suffered from Hansen's disease.

501
00:50:27,936 --> 00:50:30,404
He was sent to an island.

502
00:50:32,173 --> 00:50:33,902
These things happen.

503
00:50:35,910 --> 00:50:37,707
Hansen's disease?

504
00:50:40,381 --> 00:50:42,747
Such lovely flowers!

505
00:50:45,053 --> 00:50:47,647
This paper's lovely too.

506
00:50:48,856 --> 00:50:51,882
Sulfate paper.
It's the rage, too.

507
00:50:57,031 --> 00:50:58,965
Rain again.

508
00:51:08,476 --> 00:51:09,807
Dad.

509
00:51:15,016 --> 00:51:16,745
What are you looking at?

510
00:51:20,288 --> 00:51:21,448
Mountains?

511
00:51:25,126 --> 00:51:26,252
Trees?

512
00:51:30,264 --> 00:51:31,288
The sky?

513
00:51:36,704 --> 00:51:38,638
Or the rain?

514
00:51:44,812 --> 00:51:46,302
Dad.

515
00:51:48,816 --> 00:51:52,843
What about the heart?

516
00:51:55,289 --> 00:51:56,654
The heart?

517
00:51:56,891 --> 00:51:59,519
Can you see a human heart?

518
00:52:03,398 --> 00:52:04,888
Smile.

519
00:52:07,502 --> 00:52:09,697
Smile more, Sada.

520
00:52:13,307 --> 00:52:15,605
I can see it.

521
00:52:17,645 --> 00:52:22,673
Your heart is smiling.
Sada's heart is smiling.

522
00:52:25,620 --> 00:52:27,019
Dad.

523
00:52:27,822 --> 00:52:28,948
Listen.

524
00:52:29,590 --> 00:52:31,751
When you smile,

525
00:52:32,727 --> 00:52:35,093
mountains, trees,

526
00:52:35,697 --> 00:52:38,495
the sky, the rain

527
00:52:39,967 --> 00:52:42,458
everything smiles too.

528
00:52:44,372 --> 00:52:47,273
That's a human heart.

529
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:00,319
Dad.

530
00:53:14,135 --> 00:53:16,296
Why did you buy them?

531
00:53:21,476 --> 00:53:24,309
You're no ordinary woman.

532
00:53:25,346 --> 00:53:26,574
Sir.

533
00:53:27,582 --> 00:53:29,140
Will you do me a favor?

534
00:53:29,984 --> 00:53:34,387
Money? I'll give you some now,
then more at year-end.

535
00:53:34,956 --> 00:53:37,083
Learn the trade
and open a restaurant.

536
00:53:37,258 --> 00:53:38,987
That's not it.

537
00:53:39,761 --> 00:53:41,058
Then what?

538
00:53:41,796 --> 00:53:44,424
I must return to the conference.

539
00:53:46,768 --> 00:53:51,432
Find a man who's in isolation
for Hansen's disease.

540
00:53:54,208 --> 00:53:55,869
You can do it.

541
00:53:56,110 --> 00:54:00,240
I know what your conference is for.
I know all about you.

542
00:54:00,414 --> 00:54:03,281
You can do anything.

543
00:54:04,585 --> 00:54:06,917
Listen, Sada.

544
00:54:08,122 --> 00:54:09,612
I'm a school principal.

545
00:54:10,458 --> 00:54:13,655
I'll be finished
if we're seen together.

546
00:54:14,295 --> 00:54:19,790
I can't walk on the street
with you openly.

547
00:54:20,768 --> 00:54:23,896
My fate depends on you.

548
00:54:24,539 --> 00:54:25,665
Then find him.

549
00:54:26,107 --> 00:54:30,009
Okada. A medical student.
I met him in 1919.

550
00:54:30,178 --> 00:54:32,646
His aunt is the proprietress
of an inn.

551
00:54:32,814 --> 00:54:34,907
That's all. Look for him.

552
00:54:35,082 --> 00:54:36,845
A student named Okada?

553
00:54:37,785 --> 00:54:40,345
I must see him at any cost.

554
00:54:44,125 --> 00:54:45,786
If you promise,

555
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:49,487
I'll work at the restaurant
you recommended.

556
00:54:50,097 --> 00:54:53,498
I'll leave this life
and run a small restaurant.

557
00:54:54,168 --> 00:54:57,194
I'll do whatever it takes to learn
the trade, even washing dishes.

558
00:54:58,606 --> 00:55:04,272
But Hansen's disease is a secret.

559
00:55:04,445 --> 00:55:08,939
I can't do it.
That's why I'm asking you.

560
00:55:09,116 --> 00:55:12,483
All right. I'll do what I can.

561
00:55:14,055 --> 00:55:16,285
You sure are a nice person.

562
00:55:20,561 --> 00:55:21,619
I love you!

563
00:55:22,430 --> 00:55:24,398
That's enough.

564
00:55:25,032 --> 00:55:26,522
All right.

565
00:55:27,101 --> 00:55:31,003
We'll stay in contact
through this place.

566
00:55:32,773 --> 00:55:35,105
I'll ask the madam.

567
00:55:36,077 --> 00:55:39,604
Keep quiet till I'm elected.

568
00:55:40,448 --> 00:55:42,040
I'll make it.

569
00:55:42,516 --> 00:55:43,983
I know.

570
00:55:46,354 --> 00:55:47,878
Mr. Tachibana.

571
00:55:49,991 --> 00:55:51,549
See you again.

572
00:56:13,781 --> 00:56:16,272
Here comes the fateful man -

573
00:56:16,450 --> 00:56:18,111
Tatsuzo Kikumoto.

574
00:56:18,286 --> 00:56:19,651
February 1936.

575
00:56:19,820 --> 00:56:23,347
It was three months
before it happened.

576
00:56:23,524 --> 00:56:26,493
She was 31 and at her best.

577
00:56:28,029 --> 00:56:32,489
<i>Sada is walking along the street</i>

578
00:56:34,502 --> 00:56:38,962
<i>Passersby turn to look at her</i>

579
00:56:41,375 --> 00:56:47,245
<i>But Sada keeps on walking</i>

580
00:56:48,182 --> 00:56:49,809
Hello?

581
00:56:56,157 --> 00:57:05,555
<i>Did you dream of her</i>

582
00:57:06,734 --> 00:57:13,105
<i>Then you don't love her enough</i>

583
00:57:13,274 --> 00:57:20,578
<i>If you really fall for her</i>

584
00:57:22,817 --> 00:57:26,651
<i>You can't sleep at night</i>

585
00:57:35,162 --> 00:57:36,561
What are you doing?

586
00:57:40,034 --> 00:57:41,092
Come in.

587
00:58:11,332 --> 00:58:12,458
Hey!

588
00:58:15,469 --> 00:58:16,527
I'm Sada.

589
00:58:17,671 --> 00:58:20,231
There's a Sada here.
See to her.

590
00:58:54,475 --> 00:58:56,739
I'm here to work as an apprentice.

591
00:58:56,911 --> 00:58:58,572
My name is -

592
00:58:58,746 --> 00:59:00,270
I know already.

593
00:59:01,816 --> 00:59:04,614
Who was that gentleman?

594
00:59:06,454 --> 00:59:08,718
He owns this place.

595
00:59:09,356 --> 00:59:12,450
He's my husband, Tatsuzo.

596
00:59:12,893 --> 00:59:14,258
Be careful.

597
00:59:14,728 --> 00:59:16,753
He's fast with women.

598
00:59:20,166 --> 00:59:22,361
Shinkichi!

599
00:59:23,002 --> 00:59:24,902
Help her.

600
00:59:43,022 --> 00:59:48,255
FEBRUARY 12

601
01:00:15,388 --> 01:00:17,379
Will this do?

602
01:00:19,992 --> 01:00:21,391
Not yet.

603
01:00:22,628 --> 01:00:23,822
Ass!

604
01:00:24,730 --> 01:00:27,164
How can you polish a square dish
with circular motions?

605
01:00:27,333 --> 01:00:29,130
Use square strokes.

606
01:00:36,509 --> 01:00:38,568
You have nice, lovely hands.

607
01:00:39,679 --> 01:00:42,512
You've never worked
in a kitchen, have you?

608
01:00:49,789 --> 01:00:52,280
Here she comes.

609
01:01:05,605 --> 01:01:07,197
How is she?

610
01:01:10,042 --> 01:01:11,407
She's doing all right.

611
01:01:11,577 --> 01:01:12,976
She is?

612
01:01:13,446 --> 01:01:17,780
We never let a woman
touch finished food before.

613
01:01:19,218 --> 01:01:22,676
It's Mr. Tachibana's wish.

614
01:01:22,855 --> 01:01:24,914
Mr. Tachibana?

615
01:01:25,224 --> 01:01:27,351
Sada, how old is he?

616
01:01:28,494 --> 01:01:32,191
He's tough, isn't he?
I admire him.

617
01:01:32,365 --> 01:01:35,960
My kids will come home
from school soon.

618
01:01:36,168 --> 01:01:38,102
Give them a snack.

619
01:01:39,071 --> 01:01:40,038
All right?

620
01:01:55,622 --> 01:01:59,388
Let's see what happens.

621
01:02:05,599 --> 01:02:10,764
FEBRUARY 28

622
01:02:34,127 --> 01:02:39,292
MARCH 17

623
01:03:00,153 --> 01:03:05,318
APRIL 19

624
01:03:22,209 --> 01:03:28,079
<i>Even after I started working there,
I never forgot Tachibana.</i>

625
01:03:28,415 --> 01:03:31,213
<i>I expected a bright future.</i>

626
01:03:31,718 --> 01:03:36,155
<i>One night I was writing to him</i>

627
01:03:36,323 --> 01:03:38,086
<i>when Tatsuzo came in.</i>

628
01:03:42,930 --> 01:03:48,800
"I wish I knew what happened
regarding what I asked you about."

629
01:04:04,117 --> 01:04:07,848
You're writing to Tachibana, eh?

630
01:04:10,757 --> 01:04:12,190
Damn him!

631
01:06:36,570 --> 01:06:39,937
The light's still on.

632
01:06:45,112 --> 01:06:49,378
<i>We made love for the first time there.</i>

633
01:06:49,983 --> 01:06:52,645
<i>We did it,</i>

634
01:06:52,886 --> 01:06:54,717
<i>but it was no fun.</i>

635
01:06:58,759 --> 01:07:01,387
<i>Everyone knew about your affair,</i>

636
01:07:01,795 --> 01:07:05,128
<i>so you two decided to stay at an inn?</i>

637
01:07:05,599 --> 01:07:09,968
<i>Mr. Tachibana phoned me
the morning of April 23.</i>

638
01:07:10,137 --> 01:07:13,402
<i>I took leave and went to see him.</i>

639
01:07:17,477 --> 01:07:22,574
APRIL 23

640
01:07:26,186 --> 01:07:27,084
Listen.

641
01:07:29,022 --> 01:07:30,216
About Okada

642
01:07:34,394 --> 01:07:36,521
"February 26 Coup d'Etat"

643
01:07:36,730 --> 01:07:38,391
Answer my question!

644
01:07:40,400 --> 01:07:43,164
I don't like your attitude.

645
01:07:43,336 --> 01:07:47,136
Some young military officers
rose up on February 26.

646
01:07:47,307 --> 01:07:49,741
It shocked the whole nation.

647
01:07:50,343 --> 01:07:52,834
You should take more interest
in current events.

648
01:07:53,013 --> 01:07:58,246
I don't understand anything
about such affairs.

649
01:07:58,785 --> 01:08:00,946
I understand only Okada.

650
01:08:01,121 --> 01:08:03,521
He misses me. I must see him.

651
01:08:14,434 --> 01:08:18,996
He's in an asylum
in Okayama Prefecture.

652
01:08:19,172 --> 01:08:20,833
Where is it?

653
01:08:21,842 --> 01:08:22,968
On an island.

654
01:08:25,245 --> 01:08:27,338
Is he well?

655
01:08:29,482 --> 01:08:30,710
I don't know.

656
01:08:30,884 --> 01:08:32,715
What do you mean?

657
01:08:32,886 --> 01:08:34,319
About Hansen's disease

658
01:08:34,487 --> 01:08:36,478
I asked about him, not the disease.

659
01:08:36,656 --> 01:08:41,616
Understand about the disease first,
or I won't tell you anything.

660
01:08:42,696 --> 01:08:43,788
The cause is unknown.

661
01:08:45,532 --> 01:08:49,901
Hansen's disease
is considered hopeless.

662
01:08:50,237 --> 01:08:52,034
It's incurable.

663
01:08:53,940 --> 01:08:58,604
The patients are isolated
from their families.

664
01:08:59,112 --> 01:09:02,707
Nothing is reported about them.

665
01:09:03,617 --> 01:09:07,075
Then I can't see him if I go?

666
01:09:07,587 --> 01:09:08,781
No, you can't.

667
01:09:09,623 --> 01:09:12,023
He won't see you either.

668
01:09:13,560 --> 01:09:15,027
It's too much.

669
01:09:15,195 --> 01:09:19,427
Nevertheless,
that's how today's Japan is.

670
01:09:20,100 --> 01:09:22,898
Then I can understand those officers.

671
01:09:23,069 --> 01:09:25,162
They tried to improve Japan!

672
01:09:25,338 --> 01:09:27,067
Not so loud.

673
01:09:27,874 --> 01:09:33,608
When someone plots something,
he first needs the world's help.

674
01:09:34,614 --> 01:09:35,842
It's not easy.

675
01:09:36,716 --> 01:09:37,614
Definitely not.

676
01:09:37,784 --> 01:09:38,716
It's sad.

677
01:09:38,885 --> 01:09:40,182
That's life.

678
01:09:47,794 --> 01:09:52,231
Why aren't we meeting
at the usual inn?

679
01:09:54,901 --> 01:09:58,302
I hate this place.

680
01:09:59,606 --> 01:10:02,769
I must leave soon.

681
01:10:04,177 --> 01:10:07,078
I brought your favorite food.

682
01:10:14,654 --> 01:10:20,388
Physical love has only secondary meaning
between a man and woman.

683
01:10:20,560 --> 01:10:24,291
A close rapport should come first.

684
01:10:24,798 --> 01:10:28,063
Just someone holding your hand
seems to excite you.

685
01:10:28,234 --> 01:10:29,895
You're easily aroused.

686
01:10:30,070 --> 01:10:33,767
When you're with a man,
you must control yourself.

687
01:10:35,108 --> 01:10:36,234
Good-bye.

688
01:10:53,360 --> 01:10:56,693
<i>I found his theories boring,</i>

689
01:10:56,863 --> 01:11:01,163
<i>but at the same time
I regarded him as a great person.</i>

690
01:11:02,302 --> 01:11:06,363
<i>Sada is telling us her story</i>

691
01:11:07,874 --> 01:11:12,106
<i>It surprises people greatly</i>

692
01:11:13,613 --> 01:11:18,516
<i>She never stoops along the way</i>

693
01:11:18,685 --> 01:11:20,676
Why is this, Okada?

694
01:11:21,955 --> 01:11:24,321
I can't remember your face.

695
01:11:52,419 --> 01:11:54,148
It hurts.

696
01:11:56,156 --> 01:11:58,852
It pains my body, but

697
01:12:07,834 --> 01:12:10,701
<i>I walked on the beach alone.</i>

698
01:12:10,970 --> 01:12:16,169
<i>Tatsuzo gave me a note
as I was going out.</i>

699
01:12:16,342 --> 01:12:20,335
<i>I went to the inn
he mentioned in his note.</i>

700
01:12:32,192 --> 01:12:34,854
"See you at Yoshinoya Inn"

701
01:13:10,530 --> 01:13:13,294
So you came.

702
01:13:13,466 --> 01:13:15,991
I knew you'd come.
Come in.

703
01:13:17,537 --> 01:13:19,437
Wasn't it cold?

704
01:13:19,906 --> 01:13:21,100
Sit over here.

705
01:13:21,274 --> 01:13:22,673
Though I must say,

706
01:13:24,043 --> 01:13:27,240
when you're standing,
I can look at your cute butt.

707
01:13:32,352 --> 01:13:33,979
Give me some sake too.

708
01:13:34,154 --> 01:13:36,452
Sure. You drink?

709
01:13:38,458 --> 01:13:40,016
You believe in omens?

710
01:13:40,927 --> 01:13:41,985
Omens?

711
01:13:42,195 --> 01:13:44,857
Drink up. I'll get more.

712
01:13:49,435 --> 01:13:50,834
Why?

713
01:13:51,004 --> 01:13:52,369
Omens?

714
01:13:52,839 --> 01:13:55,467
I like to believe in omens.

715
01:13:56,042 --> 01:14:00,240
Like: "She who drinks with me
will never leave me."

716
01:14:01,080 --> 01:14:05,881
There are hundreds
of restaurants in Tokyo,

717
01:14:07,820 --> 01:14:10,846
and lots of women
are training in them.

718
01:14:11,024 --> 01:14:12,457
I know.

719
01:14:12,692 --> 01:14:16,423
You chose mine.
That in itself was destiny.

720
01:14:16,763 --> 01:14:18,560
Is that what you meant?

721
01:14:18,731 --> 01:14:19,857
Yes.

722
01:14:20,200 --> 01:14:23,363
- You're smarter than you look.
- My mind isn't my only strong point.

723
01:14:23,536 --> 01:14:25,128
You really speak your mind!

724
01:14:26,873 --> 01:14:28,807
What happened?

725
01:14:52,080 --> 01:14:53,638
We're getting drunk.

726
01:14:55,250 --> 01:15:00,187
Want to go to bed
before we're too drunk?

727
01:15:00,789 --> 01:15:03,917
Is that what you wanted after all?

728
01:15:04,092 --> 01:15:06,720
What are you saying?

729
01:15:07,596 --> 01:15:12,727
What else would a married man
like me want from you?

730
01:15:13,335 --> 01:15:15,769
We could enjoy talking

731
01:15:15,937 --> 01:15:19,031
and then just say good-bye.

732
01:15:19,207 --> 01:15:20,606
Talk?

733
01:15:20,776 --> 01:15:24,234
About that coup d'tat
or things like that.

734
01:15:25,080 --> 01:15:27,048
Don't try to sober me up.

735
01:15:27,783 --> 01:15:29,478
You care about that?

736
01:15:29,651 --> 01:15:33,382
It's big news, isn't it?

737
01:15:34,156 --> 01:15:35,521
That's enough.

738
01:15:36,425 --> 01:15:38,893
As I told you

739
01:15:39,795 --> 01:15:42,958
You know, right? I'm

740
01:15:44,433 --> 01:15:46,264
I know.

741
01:15:47,202 --> 01:15:49,898
You're married and have children.

742
01:15:50,372 --> 01:15:54,035
You can't spend money endlessly,

743
01:15:54,443 --> 01:15:57,105
even if you own a restaurant.

744
01:15:57,913 --> 01:16:02,111
Can you pay for this place?

745
01:16:03,285 --> 01:16:06,880
You're mean when you're drunk.

746
01:16:07,055 --> 01:16:08,682
What if I am?

747
01:16:09,691 --> 01:16:14,128
Can you drop me just like that?

748
01:16:18,600 --> 01:16:21,467
I can, and I will.

749
01:16:22,471 --> 01:16:23,768
I'll drop you.

750
01:16:23,939 --> 01:16:25,338
Thank you.

751
01:16:33,148 --> 01:16:34,376
What's this?

752
01:16:34,649 --> 01:16:35,581
Give me that.

753
01:16:36,585 --> 01:16:38,849
What is it? Show me.

754
01:16:39,020 --> 01:16:40,146
No.

755
01:16:48,163 --> 01:16:49,630
Master.

756
01:16:52,834 --> 01:16:54,893
Don't call me that.

757
01:16:57,639 --> 01:17:01,234
I've liked you since I first met you.

758
01:17:02,544 --> 01:17:05,877
I like you too.

759
01:17:06,381 --> 01:17:09,612
We'll hold a wedding today.

760
01:17:11,019 --> 01:17:12,919
We'll call geishas.

761
01:17:13,655 --> 01:17:17,022
I'm glad. It sounds like fun.

762
01:17:38,246 --> 01:17:43,309
<i>That night we made love
over and over again.</i>

763
01:18:47,082 --> 01:18:52,281
<i>That night I could relax
for the first time in a long time.</i>

764
01:18:52,888 --> 01:18:54,515
<i>Before I realized it,</i>

765
01:18:54,756 --> 01:19:00,626
<i>I found that my body
couldn't do without a man.</i>

766
01:19:01,196 --> 01:19:05,223
<i>How many men had I known?
They were countless.</i>

767
01:19:05,400 --> 01:19:08,801
<i>They had left me craving
a man's body.</i>

768
01:19:09,604 --> 01:19:14,200
<i>Among the many
I had affairs with,</i>

769
01:19:14,442 --> 01:19:18,276
<i>Tatsuzo was the best
in a sexual sense.</i>

770
01:19:18,680 --> 01:19:21,478
<i>Even when dozing off,</i>

771
01:19:21,650 --> 01:19:25,245
<i>he gently stroked my body all over.</i>

772
01:19:25,620 --> 01:19:27,850
<i>For the first time,</i>

773
01:19:28,023 --> 01:19:32,483
<i>I had met a man who could
care for me and really excite me.</i>

774
01:19:32,694 --> 01:19:36,926
<i>I loved him and didn't want
to be apart from him.</i>

775
01:19:37,265 --> 01:19:40,234
<i>But without money,
what could we do?</i>

776
01:19:43,338 --> 01:19:45,272
More, please.

777
01:19:51,146 --> 01:19:52,135
Sada.

778
01:20:01,122 --> 01:20:02,521
Okada...

779
01:20:15,170 --> 01:20:18,037
<i>You know how many men Sada has had?</i>

780
01:20:18,206 --> 01:20:19,571
<i>No need to be mean.</i>

781
01:20:19,741 --> 01:20:20,639
APRIL 24

782
01:20:20,809 --> 01:20:22,970
<i>How dare you talk like that?</i>

783
01:20:23,645 --> 01:20:26,944
<i>I've been patient
as a favor to Mr. Tachibana,</i>

784
01:20:27,315 --> 01:20:29,647
<i>but I'll fire that bitch!</i>

785
01:20:29,818 --> 01:20:31,843
<i>Give that to me!</i>

786
01:20:32,721 --> 01:20:37,920
Are you plotting to take over
by sleeping with the master?

787
01:20:38,827 --> 01:20:42,627
If I were, wouldn't it be better
to go after you?

788
01:20:44,199 --> 01:20:47,362
What a thing to say!

789
01:20:52,440 --> 01:20:54,567
You're terrible.

790
01:21:03,785 --> 01:21:06,481
You heard us, eh?

791
01:21:08,890 --> 01:21:14,760
Why did you seduce my husband?
You're just kitchen help!

792
01:21:15,363 --> 01:21:18,298
Can't the kitchen help
sleep with men?

793
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:21,764
He started all this.

794
01:21:22,570 --> 01:21:25,198
Perhaps if his wife
were more attractive

795
01:21:25,373 --> 01:21:27,637
What? Bitch!

796
01:21:28,843 --> 01:21:29,935
Stop that!

797
01:21:30,679 --> 01:21:33,671
You started it, you villain!

798
01:21:34,349 --> 01:21:35,543
Nonsense!

799
01:21:40,588 --> 01:21:44,456
What's the difference who started it?

800
01:21:45,226 --> 01:21:47,319
Was he that good?

801
01:21:47,862 --> 01:21:51,354
He was great!
And he said I was better than you.

802
01:22:39,914 --> 01:22:41,506
Shall I call the police?

803
01:22:41,683 --> 01:22:42,911
Idiot!

804
01:22:56,498 --> 01:22:59,899
<i>What did you think of Yoshi,
the madam?</i>

805
01:23:13,581 --> 01:23:18,518
<i>I thought she was a fool
for bad-mouthing her husband.</i>

806
01:23:25,527 --> 01:23:28,496
What a mess!

807
01:23:46,548 --> 01:23:48,948
Sada, wait!

808
01:23:50,819 --> 01:23:51,945
Are you hurt?

809
01:23:52,153 --> 01:23:56,351
No. It's nothing,
compared to the other pain.

810
01:23:56,891 --> 01:23:59,553
What do you mean, the other pain?

811
01:24:00,295 --> 01:24:02,126
Men wouldn't know.

812
01:24:02,797 --> 01:24:05,595
Were you kicked out, too?

813
01:24:08,236 --> 01:24:11,535
I was just an heiress's husband.

814
01:24:11,706 --> 01:24:15,267
They say, "Never marry an heiress."

815
01:24:15,977 --> 01:24:17,968
Don't make fun of me.

816
01:24:18,980 --> 01:24:20,345
What'll you do now?

817
01:24:20,515 --> 01:24:24,246
I have no idea.
What about you?

818
01:24:25,687 --> 01:24:28,451
"My sorrow is stained.

819
01:24:28,990 --> 01:24:32,585
What do I want?
What can I wish for?"

820
01:24:33,328 --> 01:24:34,625
What's that?

821
01:24:34,796 --> 01:24:36,024
A poem.

822
01:24:36,664 --> 01:24:39,462
A young man wrote that sad poem.

823
01:24:42,070 --> 01:24:44,504
"Stained sorrow...

824
01:24:45,440 --> 01:24:47,499
dreams of death in lassitude."

825
01:24:47,675 --> 01:24:48,869
"Lassitude"?

826
01:24:49,043 --> 01:24:49,941
Yes.

827
01:24:51,679 --> 01:24:53,146
It means feeling tired and dull.

828
01:24:53,314 --> 01:24:55,782
So you want to die?

829
01:25:01,222 --> 01:25:03,588
No, it's just a poem.

830
01:25:04,259 --> 01:25:05,817
I'm all right.

831
01:25:06,327 --> 01:25:10,024
Let's go to that inn again.

832
01:25:10,765 --> 01:25:13,825
While you were fighting with Yoshi,

833
01:25:14,736 --> 01:25:17,364
I stole some money.

834
01:25:51,906 --> 01:25:53,305
I wish you happiness.

835
01:25:59,547 --> 01:26:01,174
Doughnuts, please.

836
01:26:05,720 --> 01:26:08,951
How come you like that stuff?

837
01:26:18,633 --> 01:26:20,123
Thank you.

838
01:27:05,146 --> 01:27:06,807
Hey, Sada.

839
01:27:09,349 --> 01:27:10,543
Yes?

840
01:27:11,684 --> 01:27:13,447
Why not toss those doughnuts?

841
01:27:15,321 --> 01:27:16,219
Toss them?

842
01:27:16,923 --> 01:27:18,322
Look.

843
01:27:19,325 --> 01:27:21,350
I'll catch them.

844
01:27:25,098 --> 01:27:26,190
Idiot!

845
01:27:31,471 --> 01:27:34,736
You see? I'm still young, eh?

846
01:27:40,480 --> 01:27:43,972
<i>One, then two</i>

847
01:27:44,317 --> 01:27:47,878
<i>Two, then three</i>

848
01:27:48,321 --> 01:27:51,757
<i>Then four</i>

849
01:27:52,325 --> 01:27:56,352
<i>Then five</i>

850
01:27:58,598 --> 01:28:03,331
<i>Then finally six</i>

851
01:28:04,871 --> 01:28:06,395
What's that song?

852
01:28:08,007 --> 01:28:09,634
It was years ago.

853
01:28:10,176 --> 01:28:13,543
Maybe I sang it when I was a child.

854
01:28:15,782 --> 01:28:16,908
It's coming back to you now?

855
01:28:17,083 --> 01:28:18,607
No.

856
01:28:19,886 --> 01:28:21,945
Now is like the past.

857
01:28:25,558 --> 01:28:28,994
<i>How many did you count</i>

858
01:28:29,729 --> 01:28:33,290
<i>How many and how many</i>

859
01:28:34,934 --> 01:28:38,802
<i>Count many numbers</i>

860
01:28:41,307 --> 01:28:45,073
<i>They can bring tomorrow</i>

861
01:28:47,881 --> 01:28:52,648
<i>They can bring back yesterday</i>

862
01:28:54,387 --> 01:28:55,615
That picture.

863
01:28:55,788 --> 01:28:58,723
I've seen it somewhere.

864
01:29:00,793 --> 01:29:01,782
It's by Yumeji.

865
01:29:04,364 --> 01:29:05,456
He drew it.

866
01:29:08,568 --> 01:29:10,331
Whether a poem or a painting,

867
01:29:12,071 --> 01:29:14,631
I envy those who leave behind
something important.

868
01:29:16,776 --> 01:29:18,403
I, on the other hand,

869
01:29:20,079 --> 01:29:22,673
spend my life in vain.

870
01:29:23,950 --> 01:29:25,417
As for me,

871
01:29:26,386 --> 01:29:30,220
I'm beginning to find something
to live for.

872
01:29:44,904 --> 01:29:48,465
What's Okada to you?

873
01:29:52,278 --> 01:29:55,338
You called me Okada the other day.

874
01:29:56,683 --> 01:29:58,480
You said his name.

875
01:29:59,352 --> 01:30:00,649
I did?

876
01:30:03,056 --> 01:30:04,614
Who is he?

877
01:30:08,695 --> 01:30:11,721
He may not be you...

878
01:30:13,199 --> 01:30:15,099
or he may be you.

879
01:30:22,075 --> 01:30:24,339
What can it be?

880
01:30:25,712 --> 01:30:28,044
I mean, a man's name.

881
01:30:30,016 --> 01:30:33,042
<i>What did you do
while you were with Tatsuzo?</i>

882
01:30:33,419 --> 01:30:38,550
For two weeks,
from April 24 to May 7,

883
01:30:38,725 --> 01:30:41,523
we moved from inn to inn.

884
01:30:42,161 --> 01:30:44,629
Normally people would get
tired of each other,

885
01:30:45,898 --> 01:30:51,029
but I actually grew
more and more fond of him.

886
01:30:52,305 --> 01:30:55,934
He went back to Yoshi to get money.

887
01:30:56,276 --> 01:30:59,268
I was left alone for three days.

888
01:30:59,946 --> 01:31:02,312
<i>I was so jealous and impatient.</i>

889
01:31:03,082 --> 01:31:08,281
<i>That was the hardest time of my life.</i>

890
01:31:19,632 --> 01:31:24,660
MAY 8

891
01:33:13,211 --> 01:33:18,376
MAY 9

892
01:33:45,910 --> 01:33:47,605
MAY 10

893
01:33:47,779 --> 01:33:54,582
<i>One, then two</i>

894
01:33:59,924 --> 01:34:05,021
<i>Two, then three</i>

895
01:34:11,536 --> 01:34:15,939
<i>Then four</i>

896
01:34:22,013 --> 01:34:26,473
<i>Then five</i>

897
01:34:30,121 --> 01:34:35,957
<i>Then finally six</i>

898
01:35:04,722 --> 01:35:10,092
<i>Those three days seemed
like a month to me.</i>

899
01:35:18,803 --> 01:35:23,934
MAY 11

900
01:35:24,175 --> 01:35:25,437
Did you miss me?

901
01:35:27,345 --> 01:35:28,573
Yes.

902
01:35:30,181 --> 01:35:31,876
Did you miss me too?

903
01:35:34,619 --> 01:35:36,280
Yeah, but it was a rough time.

904
01:35:36,454 --> 01:35:39,617
<i>A horse went wild.</i>

905
01:35:39,790 --> 01:35:41,849
<i>It kicked a girl.</i>

906
01:35:43,694 --> 01:35:45,491
<i>I hope she's all right.</i>

907
01:35:46,664 --> 01:35:48,723
Was that the "rough time"?

908
01:35:50,234 --> 01:35:52,498
No, that wasn't all.

909
01:35:56,307 --> 01:35:59,037
Are you angry?

910
01:36:00,244 --> 01:36:01,575
In a bad mood?

911
01:36:04,448 --> 01:36:06,609
I was upset too.

912
01:36:07,418 --> 01:36:11,548
You know Yoshi.
She was hard to convince.

913
01:36:11,789 --> 01:36:14,019
Did you lay her too?

914
01:36:19,530 --> 01:36:23,557
Did you let her feel you?

915
01:36:26,037 --> 01:36:29,404
What?
Why do you let that bother you?

916
01:36:31,609 --> 01:36:35,705
I know.
That's why she got jealous.

917
01:36:35,913 --> 01:36:39,815
<i>If we balanced our love on a scale,</i>

918
01:36:39,984 --> 01:36:43,977
<i>I loved Tatsuzo
more than he loved me.</i>

919
01:36:44,989 --> 01:36:46,957
Hey, Tatsuzo!

920
01:36:54,932 --> 01:36:56,900
I'm mad at you.

921
01:36:59,804 --> 01:37:05,140
I'll never let you go back
to your wife again.

922
01:37:06,344 --> 01:37:10,576
If you do, I'll kill us both!

923
01:37:21,559 --> 01:37:24,653
As a joke,
I bound his wrists with a sash.

924
01:37:25,129 --> 01:37:28,030
It made him happy.

925
01:37:28,199 --> 01:37:31,691
He tickled me with his bound hands.

926
01:37:31,869 --> 01:37:37,535
<i>We hardly slept.
We made love till morning.</i>

927
01:37:38,009 --> 01:37:39,271
Tatsuzo.

928
01:37:43,981 --> 01:37:48,543
<i>He couldn't get money from his wife.</i>

929
01:37:49,220 --> 01:37:54,214
<i>I decided to ask Tachibana for some.</i>

930
01:38:00,398 --> 01:38:04,027
I'm sorry to make you come so far.

931
01:38:04,368 --> 01:38:05,426
MAY 16

932
01:38:05,770 --> 01:38:08,603
I have work to do here anyway.

933
01:38:10,841 --> 01:38:12,468
You're looking well.

934
01:38:13,577 --> 01:38:18,537
That woman told me she fired you.
I was worried about you.

935
01:38:19,417 --> 01:38:22,318
I didn't know where you were.

936
01:38:22,486 --> 01:38:24,511
Are you here for another conference?

937
01:38:25,456 --> 01:38:26,445
No.

938
01:38:27,358 --> 01:38:30,225
I'll go to the usual inn with you.

939
01:38:31,429 --> 01:38:33,329
Then I'll go home.

940
01:38:33,497 --> 01:38:35,829
Welcome.

941
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:37,024
Coffee, please.

942
01:38:37,201 --> 01:38:38,668
Is this your "work"?

943
01:38:39,537 --> 01:38:42,199
A Calpis, please.

944
01:38:45,710 --> 01:38:47,268
It's raining.

945
01:38:49,280 --> 01:38:51,612
Let's take a trip together

946
01:38:53,217 --> 01:38:55,811
for a few days.

947
01:38:56,520 --> 01:38:59,614
We'll go to the Seto Inland Sea.

948
01:39:00,491 --> 01:39:03,688
We'll see the island
where that student is.

949
01:39:04,361 --> 01:39:07,296
We might get
some information on him.

950
01:39:09,567 --> 01:39:12,695
What's wrong?
You were so eager before.

951
01:39:14,305 --> 01:39:19,038
Don't bother about him anymore.

952
01:39:19,210 --> 01:39:22,407
If he doesn't see me or write to me,

953
01:39:22,580 --> 01:39:23,979
I feel as if

954
01:39:25,116 --> 01:39:29,849
he were here all the time.

955
01:39:35,392 --> 01:39:36,552
Please enjoy.

956
01:39:40,765 --> 01:39:46,294
I'm beginning to understand
the things you tell me.

957
01:39:47,371 --> 01:39:48,599
So please don't bother.

958
01:39:49,440 --> 01:39:50,566
I see.

959
01:39:51,842 --> 01:39:53,070
Then

960
01:39:53,511 --> 01:39:58,505
let's not go to that inn together.

961
01:39:59,984 --> 01:40:01,611
That's better, eh?

962
01:40:03,454 --> 01:40:04,887
I'm sorry.

963
01:40:07,158 --> 01:40:10,594
Here's 200 yen for you.

964
01:40:12,096 --> 01:40:13,996
Keep in touch.

965
01:40:14,865 --> 01:40:16,856
I'll send more.

966
01:40:17,468 --> 01:40:21,063
Excuse me.
Would you have a match?

967
01:40:22,973 --> 01:40:24,440
Thank you.

968
01:40:32,249 --> 01:40:36,117
Isn't a man waiting for you?

969
01:40:38,022 --> 01:40:41,185
If you have a beau, tell me.

970
01:40:42,259 --> 01:40:45,251
I'll inquire about him.

971
01:40:45,429 --> 01:40:46,726
I'll sponsor your wedding.

972
01:40:47,731 --> 01:40:52,464
I think of you as my kid sister.

973
01:40:52,672 --> 01:40:54,833
I'll take care of you even if I die.

974
01:40:55,442 --> 01:40:59,572
It's as if you belonged
to another world.

975
01:41:16,930 --> 01:41:19,694
<i>I missed Tatsuzo so badly</i>

976
01:41:19,866 --> 01:41:23,199
<i>and hurried back to him.</i>

977
01:41:25,438 --> 01:41:29,101
I'm lonely. So lonely.

978
01:41:29,342 --> 01:41:32,539
What's wrong with you?

979
01:41:33,847 --> 01:41:37,715
I'm very lonely somehow.

980
01:41:38,251 --> 01:41:39,809
I'm here.

981
01:41:40,120 --> 01:41:42,486
Just like usual.

982
01:41:42,889 --> 01:41:45,585
It's odd, very odd.

983
01:41:46,459 --> 01:41:49,951
I've never been so lonely.

984
01:41:53,366 --> 01:41:57,928
You won't go away.
You won't leave me, will you?

985
01:41:58,538 --> 01:42:02,201
Why not tie me up so I can't leave?

986
01:42:04,978 --> 01:42:07,640
I wish I were a sash myself.

987
01:42:08,281 --> 01:42:11,148
I could tie you up with my body.

988
01:42:18,325 --> 01:42:20,520
Please strangle me.

989
01:42:21,428 --> 01:42:25,888
Squeeze my throat.

990
01:42:26,800 --> 01:42:28,165
Strangle me.

991
01:42:37,410 --> 01:42:38,468
Let's stop.

992
01:42:42,048 --> 01:42:43,310
Let's stop.

993
01:42:43,717 --> 01:42:45,344
I feel sorry for you.

994
01:42:46,753 --> 01:42:50,211
Then I'll strangle you.

995
01:42:52,192 --> 01:42:54,023
I'll use this sash.

996
01:42:54,194 --> 01:42:57,129
I'll stop you from breathing.

997
01:42:57,297 --> 01:43:00,858
Stop it!
You're tickling me.

998
01:43:04,404 --> 01:43:06,133
How can I make love like this?

999
01:43:07,340 --> 01:43:08,432
Stop!

1000
01:43:08,608 --> 01:43:10,940
At first he enjoyed it.

1001
01:43:11,111 --> 01:43:14,205
<i>He slapped his forehead
and made faces.</i>

1002
01:43:14,381 --> 01:43:15,643
He was having fun.

1003
01:43:16,516 --> 01:43:19,542
<i>When I squeezed his throat,</i>

1004
01:43:19,719 --> 01:43:22,449
<i>his belly trembled nicely.</i>

1005
01:43:22,622 --> 01:43:23,953
I told him so.

1006
01:43:24,124 --> 01:43:25,887
If you like it,

1007
01:43:28,461 --> 01:43:31,089
I'll endure it,
even thought it hurts.

1008
01:43:31,264 --> 01:43:32,891
That's what he said.

1009
01:43:33,066 --> 01:43:38,026
I don't care what happens to my body.

1010
01:43:39,072 --> 01:43:40,300
He said that, too.

1011
01:43:48,715 --> 01:43:51,809
Hey, it's shrunk.

1012
01:43:56,056 --> 01:43:57,819
What happened?

1013
01:44:00,193 --> 01:44:02,184
My neck's hot.

1014
01:44:55,582 --> 01:44:58,551
Look what you did to me.

1015
01:45:02,122 --> 01:45:03,487
They're dead.

1016
01:45:06,593 --> 01:45:09,061
They got wet in the rain, huh?

1017
01:45:29,449 --> 01:45:31,417
Human life is short.

1018
01:45:32,085 --> 01:45:35,521
How long can birds live?

1019
01:45:36,356 --> 01:45:40,554
How brief!
They were alive just a while ago.

1020
01:45:41,928 --> 01:45:45,261
Everything dies someday.

1021
01:45:47,066 --> 01:45:48,931
I'm 42 already.

1022
01:45:50,103 --> 01:45:54,540
I've done almost everything
a man can do in his life.

1023
01:45:56,509 --> 01:45:58,101
As for the rest,

1024
01:45:58,778 --> 01:46:02,771
my assets are mortgaged.

1025
01:46:04,384 --> 01:46:06,284
It'll take a while,

1026
01:46:07,253 --> 01:46:09,721
but I'll help you open a restaurant.

1027
01:46:10,557 --> 01:46:13,390
Not a bad way
to spend the rest of my life.

1028
01:46:14,160 --> 01:46:18,062
I'm glad, but I'm sad, too.

1029
01:46:18,965 --> 01:46:21,525
- I suppose.
- If

1030
01:46:24,370 --> 01:46:25,496
If

1031
01:46:25,672 --> 01:46:26,832
Don't say that.

1032
01:46:30,410 --> 01:46:32,640
There are no "ifs" in life.

1033
01:46:34,480 --> 01:46:39,110
To live, you must stop saying "if."

1034
01:46:39,852 --> 01:46:41,649
Really?

1035
01:46:42,422 --> 01:46:43,855
Absolutely.

1036
01:46:44,657 --> 01:46:47,785
Let's drop this gloomy subject.

1037
01:46:48,628 --> 01:46:50,653
There may be no "ifs,"

1038
01:46:50,830 --> 01:46:54,391
but you're here, and that's for sure.

1039
01:46:57,103 --> 01:46:59,037
Let's go to bed.

1040
01:47:00,306 --> 01:47:02,604
Let's do it again.

1041
01:47:04,077 --> 01:47:05,908
Staying with you,

1042
01:47:07,113 --> 01:47:08,944
I'll end up a skeleton.

1043
01:47:14,687 --> 01:47:16,518
<i>On the 17th,</i>

1044
01:47:16,689 --> 01:47:19,658
<i>you strangled Tatsuzo to death
in his sleep.</i>

1045
01:47:19,826 --> 01:47:21,316
<i>Tell us how it happened.</i>

1046
01:47:21,894 --> 01:47:23,327
He kept saying

1047
01:47:24,130 --> 01:47:27,395
that he was sleepy.

1048
01:47:29,035 --> 01:47:31,765
<i>As I watched him sleep,</i>

1049
01:47:31,938 --> 01:47:34,065
MAY 17

1050
01:47:34,240 --> 01:47:35,673
<i>he opened his eyes</i>

1051
01:47:36,476 --> 01:47:38,967
<i>and was glad to see me.</i>

1052
01:47:39,145 --> 01:47:40,612
Listen.

1053
01:47:42,215 --> 01:47:44,115
After I fall asleep,

1054
01:47:45,418 --> 01:47:47,352
I'll bet you strangle me again.

1055
01:47:47,887 --> 01:47:49,479
He said so.

1056
01:47:50,390 --> 01:47:51,982
Then I said -

1057
01:47:54,294 --> 01:47:55,522
Yes.

1058
01:47:56,262 --> 01:47:57,820
I said so, laughing.

1059
01:47:57,997 --> 01:47:59,862
When you strangle me,

1060
01:48:01,567 --> 01:48:04,001
don't loosen your hands.

1061
01:48:05,938 --> 01:48:08,566
Otherwise it will hurt afterwards.

1062
01:48:09,242 --> 01:48:10,732
<i>That time,</i>

1063
01:48:10,910 --> 01:48:14,744
I wondered if he wanted me to kill him.

1064
01:48:14,914 --> 01:48:16,404
I thought so.

1065
01:48:16,582 --> 01:48:18,209
<i>But soon afterward,</i>

1066
01:48:18,384 --> 01:48:21,581
<i>I thought he was only joking.</i>

1067
01:48:22,755 --> 01:48:26,122
<i>Before long, he fell asleep.</i>

1068
01:48:26,292 --> 01:48:32,128
<i>I reached with my right hand
and grabbed a pink sash.</i>

1069
01:48:32,298 --> 01:48:36,291
<i>I slid the end under his neck
and wound it twice.</i>

1070
01:48:36,469 --> 01:48:38,699
I gripped both ends

1071
01:48:40,073 --> 01:48:42,769
and slowly strangled him.

1072
01:48:42,942 --> 01:48:45,570
<i>Tatsuzo opened his eyes.</i>

1073
01:48:48,648 --> 01:48:52,049
<i>Saying that, he tried to hug me.</i>

1074
01:48:52,218 --> 01:48:57,451
I pressed my head

1075
01:48:58,758 --> 01:49:00,988
to Tatsuzo's chest.

1076
01:49:06,265 --> 01:49:08,733
Forgive me!

1077
01:49:12,605 --> 01:49:13,902
I cried.

1078
01:49:15,541 --> 01:49:21,411
I pulled on the sash
as hard as I could.

1079
01:50:17,804 --> 01:50:21,467
<i>Then I went downstairs
and looked around.</i>

1080
01:50:22,675 --> 01:50:25,075
<i>I saw a clock in the office.</i>

1081
01:50:25,878 --> 01:50:29,143
<i>It was a little past 2.00 a.m.</i>

1082
01:50:44,964 --> 01:50:48,661
Why did you slice off his penis?

1083
01:50:48,835 --> 01:50:50,826
I thought if I carried it with me,

1084
01:50:51,370 --> 01:50:53,838
he would always be with me,

1085
01:50:54,841 --> 01:50:58,106
and I wouldn't feel lonely.

1086
01:51:45,825 --> 01:51:49,090
Why did you carve
your name into his flesh?

1087
01:51:49,262 --> 01:51:53,255
<i>I wanted him to carry me
with him forever.</i>

1088
01:51:53,432 --> 01:51:55,457
So I carved my name.

1089
01:51:55,635 --> 01:51:58,570
What did you do with his penis?

1090
01:51:58,738 --> 01:52:01,866
<i>It was a keepsake he left me.</i>

1091
01:52:02,441 --> 01:52:05,842
<i>I wrapped it in special paper</i>

1092
01:52:06,178 --> 01:52:08,578
<i>and tucked it under my waistband.</i>

1093
01:52:08,748 --> 01:52:11,239
What about the weapon?

1094
01:52:12,151 --> 01:52:16,554
<i>I put it in my bag
and carried it with me.</i>

1095
01:52:18,124 --> 01:52:23,994
<i>It was a gift from someone special.</i>

1096
01:52:32,038 --> 01:52:37,203
MAY 18

1097
01:53:06,238 --> 01:53:09,036
I'm going out for a while.

1098
01:53:09,208 --> 01:53:13,645
He's sleeping.
Don't wake him till noon.

1099
01:53:32,832 --> 01:53:34,561
If it isn't Sada!

1100
01:53:35,901 --> 01:53:37,334
Such a long time.

1101
01:53:37,603 --> 01:53:40,436
What a surprise!
You, in Tokyo?

1102
01:53:41,807 --> 01:53:43,331
What's up?

1103
01:53:43,709 --> 01:53:45,768
You look happy.

1104
01:53:46,379 --> 01:53:48,279
Has something good happened?

1105
01:53:50,182 --> 01:53:55,950
I feel as if something heavy
that had been here a long time

1106
01:53:57,590 --> 01:54:00,286
suddenly disappeared.

1107
01:54:00,459 --> 01:54:01,790
Is that so?

1108
01:54:03,162 --> 01:54:06,325
I heard your father died.

1109
01:54:07,433 --> 01:54:09,594
I didn't make it to his funeral.

1110
01:54:10,302 --> 01:54:13,066
Eighty-two? A nice long life.

1111
01:54:15,875 --> 01:54:18,139
A lot happens in this life, eh?

1112
01:54:19,712 --> 01:54:21,236
Where are you going?

1113
01:54:26,085 --> 01:54:27,109
Never mind.

1114
01:54:27,353 --> 01:54:30,811
We'll meet again.
Good-bye.

1115
01:54:31,390 --> 01:54:34,791
Good-bye. Take care.

1116
01:54:36,028 --> 01:54:37,495
Thank you.

1117
01:54:37,963 --> 01:54:39,396
Same to you.

1118
01:55:46,632 --> 01:55:48,327
What's this?

1119
01:55:49,135 --> 01:55:50,864
What happened?

1120
01:55:51,036 --> 01:55:54,028
His member has been cut off.

1121
01:55:58,744 --> 01:56:01,235
Cut off with a knife, perhaps.

1122
01:56:02,181 --> 01:56:03,773
A murder case?

1123
01:56:03,949 --> 01:56:06,144
- I'm not sure yet!
- Double suicide?

1124
01:56:07,052 --> 01:56:09,111
I wonder.

1125
01:56:10,022 --> 01:56:14,652
I've been a cop a long time,
but I've never seen anything like this.

1126
01:56:15,394 --> 01:56:18,488
Let's look for this woman Sada.

1127
01:56:19,198 --> 01:56:22,565
What were you doing
before your arrest?

1128
01:56:23,035 --> 01:56:27,699
That day,
I strolled along the riverbank.

1129
01:56:27,907 --> 01:56:29,932
Then I went to Asakusa

1130
01:56:30,743 --> 01:56:34,440
<i>and saw a historical drama
at the movies.</i>

1131
01:56:39,151 --> 01:56:42,086
<i>Didn't you plan to run away?</i>

1132
01:56:47,860 --> 01:56:51,296
<i>Tatsuzo was dead, so I must die.</i>

1133
01:56:51,463 --> 01:56:53,192
<i>I thought so vaguely.</i>

1134
01:56:53,766 --> 01:56:56,633
<i>Besides, it started to rain,</i>

1135
01:56:56,802 --> 01:57:00,260
so I didn't run away
but just wandered around town.

1136
01:57:00,940 --> 01:57:04,068
<i>I sat on a park bench, thinking.</i>

1137
01:57:04,243 --> 01:57:09,146
<i>Then I decided
to meet Tachibana at his inn.</i>

1138
01:57:09,315 --> 01:57:12,375
<i>He happened to be in Tokyo.</i>

1139
01:57:14,186 --> 01:57:18,145
Where are you going in this rain?

1140
01:57:20,025 --> 01:57:22,960
I can't just stay and get wet.

1141
01:57:32,004 --> 01:57:33,028
<i>He said</i>

1142
01:57:33,205 --> 01:57:36,197
Then why not come here?

1143
01:57:36,909 --> 01:57:41,812
<i>I insisted on going
somewhere we'd never been.</i>

1144
01:57:41,981 --> 01:57:45,144
We took a taxi towards Otsuka

1145
01:57:45,317 --> 01:57:48,753
and took a room at an inn.

1146
01:57:48,921 --> 01:57:52,687
I didn't tell him
that I'd killed Tatsuzo.

1147
01:57:52,858 --> 01:57:54,120
<i>I was very vague.</i>

1148
01:57:54,293 --> 01:57:57,558
Whatever may happen,

1149
01:57:58,931 --> 01:58:02,389
just think that you bought a whore.

1150
01:58:03,602 --> 01:58:05,331
You paid me.

1151
01:58:05,504 --> 01:58:07,938
<i>I kept repeating things like that.</i>

1152
01:58:08,107 --> 01:58:11,304
I knew how he felt at that time.

1153
01:58:11,477 --> 01:58:13,001
Let's go to bed.

1154
01:58:14,013 --> 01:58:16,880
<i>I slept with him merely out of duty.</i>

1155
01:58:22,021 --> 01:58:27,891
This has a secondary meaning
for you, right?

1156
01:58:30,896 --> 01:58:32,488
I hate to say this,

1157
01:58:33,899 --> 01:58:36,800
but you sort of stink.

1158
01:58:39,972 --> 01:58:45,103
MAY 19

1159
01:58:45,611 --> 01:58:47,841
<i>Then we parted.</i>

1160
01:58:48,013 --> 01:58:51,505
<i>I moved to another inn by myself.</i>

1161
01:58:51,984 --> 01:58:56,421
Although I tried
to kill myself there,

1162
01:58:56,588 --> 01:59:01,184
<i>the transom was
too low to hang myself.</i>

1163
01:59:01,360 --> 01:59:03,624
I couldn't die.

1164
01:59:04,430 --> 01:59:11,165
So I wrote to Tachibana and Tatsuzo,
who was already dead.

1165
01:59:13,005 --> 01:59:16,031
<i>"You whom I loved most have died.</i>

1166
01:59:16,542 --> 01:59:18,908
<i>You became mine.</i>

1167
01:59:19,845 --> 01:59:21,642
<i>I will join you.</i>

1168
01:59:22,314 --> 01:59:24,248
<i>You are mine.</i>

1169
01:59:25,284 --> 01:59:26,649
<i>From Sada. "</i>

1170
01:59:28,387 --> 01:59:31,288
<i>"Dear Mr. Tachibana.</i>

1171
01:59:31,623 --> 01:59:34,854
<i>You said you'd help me
to live decently.</i>

1172
01:59:35,027 --> 01:59:37,461
<i>You treated me with love,</i>

1173
01:59:37,696 --> 01:59:40,665
<i>though you didn't satisfy me.</i>

1174
01:59:41,000 --> 01:59:44,766
<i>But it's for another reason
that I'm going to die. "</i>

1175
01:59:44,937 --> 01:59:46,131
MAY 20

1176
01:59:46,305 --> 01:59:49,706
<i>I couldn't mail the letter to Tatsuzo.</i>

1177
01:59:50,309 --> 01:59:53,642
<i>I asked a maid</i>

1178
01:59:53,812 --> 01:59:55,803
<i>to post my letter
to Tachibana the next day,</i>

1179
01:59:55,981 --> 02:00:00,941
<i>and thus his name
was disclosed to the world.</i>

1180
02:00:01,146 --> 02:00:05,879
<i>It caused him troubles,
and I'm sorry for that.</i>

1181
02:00:06,518 --> 02:00:07,576
<i>Then</i>

1182
02:00:08,453 --> 02:00:10,717
I drank two bottles of beer.

1183
02:00:11,689 --> 02:00:15,455
I lay in bed, wondering how to die.

1184
02:00:16,261 --> 02:00:19,890
<i>The police came about 4.00 p.m.</i>

1185
02:00:38,416 --> 02:00:43,353
Yes, I'm Sada Abe.

1186
02:00:45,523 --> 02:00:47,923
Then they arrested me.

1187
02:00:50,462 --> 02:00:52,930
<i>Here's a strange picture.</i>

1188
02:00:53,431 --> 02:00:55,399
<i>It was taken when she was arrested.</i>

1189
02:00:55,567 --> 02:00:59,833
<i>She's smiling, feeling relieved,
as she stated in her confession.</i>

1190
02:01:00,004 --> 02:01:05,067
<i>The cops are smiling too.
I wonder what that implies.</i>

1191
02:01:05,710 --> 02:01:10,409
<i>Actually, the Sada case was
looked upon favorably by the public.</i>

1192
02:01:10,582 --> 02:01:14,313
<i>Sada became a heroine,
a winner in love.</i>

1193
02:01:14,486 --> 02:01:19,355
"This incident tells that
their plus and minus

1194
02:01:19,524 --> 02:01:21,048
satisfied each other."

1195
02:01:22,160 --> 02:01:23,092
Meaning?

1196
02:01:23,261 --> 02:01:26,890
The man and woman fit each other.

1197
02:01:27,499 --> 02:01:33,199
"Their plus and minus
satisfied each other

1198
02:01:34,005 --> 02:01:36,872
and led to this rare outcome."

1199
02:01:37,041 --> 02:01:38,804
It's the talk of the town.

1200
02:01:38,977 --> 02:01:40,706
Her lawyer's speech

1201
02:01:40,879 --> 02:01:44,747
softened up the public prosecutors.

1202
02:01:44,916 --> 02:01:48,943
She staked her life on love.
I envy her.

1203
02:01:49,120 --> 02:01:50,951
It was an act of love.

1204
02:01:51,122 --> 02:01:54,523
It sure is something great
in these gloomy times.

1205
02:01:54,692 --> 02:01:56,922
I'll applaud.

1206
02:01:57,095 --> 02:01:58,687
Loud enough for all to hear.

1207
02:02:00,899 --> 02:02:02,730
"What a problem for Mr. Tachibana!"

1208
02:02:20,818 --> 02:02:22,547
Last question:

1209
02:02:23,121 --> 02:02:26,921
You, the accused,
loved Tatsuzo, the victim,

1210
02:02:27,859 --> 02:02:32,228
so much that you wanted
to have him all for yourself,

1211
02:02:33,231 --> 02:02:36,723
even if you had to murder him?

1212
02:02:44,709 --> 02:02:46,700
What is the meaning of that?

1213
02:02:48,613 --> 02:02:50,171
I don't know.

1214
02:02:51,983 --> 02:02:54,611
I don't even know myself.

1215
02:02:56,187 --> 02:03:00,783
At that time, I did as I wished.

1216
02:03:02,560 --> 02:03:04,460
That's all.

1217
02:03:10,001 --> 02:03:11,366
Come to think of it,

1218
02:03:11,903 --> 02:03:14,371
it's hard to know

1219
02:03:15,840 --> 02:03:20,277
how anyone feels - even myself.

1220
02:03:22,380 --> 02:03:25,543
<i>The trial began on May 20, 1936,</i>

1221
02:03:25,750 --> 02:03:28,150
<i>and ended on December 21.</i>

1222
02:03:29,254 --> 02:03:32,951
The accused shall serve six years.

1223
02:03:42,233 --> 02:03:45,862
Do you have anything to say?

1224
02:03:50,475 --> 02:03:52,067
No.

1225
02:04:02,253 --> 02:04:05,188
<i>A long time passed once again.</i>

1226
02:04:05,556 --> 02:04:07,990
<i>Everyone forgot about it.</i>

1227
02:04:09,160 --> 02:04:11,651
<i>If forgetting means dying,</i>

1228
02:04:11,829 --> 02:04:15,424
<i>I guess I died at that time.</i>

1229
02:04:17,435 --> 02:04:19,995
<i>On April 1, 1996,</i>

1230
02:04:20,171 --> 02:04:24,574
<i>the Anti-Leprosy Law,
which caused bias and segregation,</i>

1231
02:04:24,742 --> 02:04:28,234
<i>was abolished
90 years after it was enacted.</i>

1232
02:04:30,748 --> 02:04:33,342
<i>The island was opened to everyone.</i>

1233
02:04:34,252 --> 02:04:37,551
<i>But no one knows
where Okada went.</i>

1234
02:04:43,494 --> 02:04:47,897
Sada's term was shortened
to five years.

1235
02:04:48,533 --> 02:04:51,934
She was released on May 17, 1941.

1236
02:04:53,771 --> 02:04:58,470
Some say she changed her name
and got married,

1237
02:04:59,544 --> 02:05:06,473
or that she staged a drama
about herself and toured Japan.

1238
02:05:07,885 --> 02:05:12,345
But everything faded
with the passing of time.

1239
02:05:13,458 --> 02:05:16,916
Few people know about Sada now.

1240
02:05:18,629 --> 02:05:21,462
Japan is in a dark age again.

1241
02:05:21,632 --> 02:05:26,160
But the Japanese
were beautiful in those days.

1242
02:05:26,604 --> 02:05:28,834
I felt that way.

1243
02:05:30,007 --> 02:05:31,998
It's been all of 61 years.

1244
02:05:32,377 --> 02:05:34,971
Sada's days are over, I guess.

1245
02:05:36,114 --> 02:05:38,139
I who fret like this

1246
02:05:38,416 --> 02:05:42,284
am no longer needed these days.

1247
02:05:43,788 --> 02:05:49,226
It's about time to exit this stage.

1248
02:05:52,296 --> 02:05:56,027
Well, then, good-bye, everyone.

1249
02:06:00,238 --> 02:06:01,671
Be careful.

1250
02:06:03,508 --> 02:06:07,569
<i>How many did you count</i>

1251
02:06:08,246 --> 02:06:12,182
<i>How many and how many</i>

1252
02:06:12,784 --> 02:06:17,050
<i>Count many numbers</i>

1253
02:06:17,522 --> 02:06:21,822
<i>They can bring tomorrow</i>

1254
02:06:21,993 --> 02:06:23,984
1998

1255
02:06:24,395 --> 02:06:29,890
<i>They can bring back yesterday</i>

1256
02:06:32,036 --> 02:06:36,336
<i>If Sada's still alive,
she'd be 93 years old.</i>

1257
02:09:03,554 --> 02:09:09,424
