3
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:13,080
…Under the whip of pleasure,

4
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:15,760
this merciless torturer

5
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,320
Where are we?

6
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:27,080
I don't know… nowhere.

7
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:36,760
And who are you?

8
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:39,080
I don't know. No one yet.

9
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:40,560
No one?

10
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:44,200
I shall be…

11
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:45,440
Who?

12
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,040
"O", perhaps.

13
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:53,680
We are here. I'll remove your blindfold.

14
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,280
In the late 1920s, China is restless.

15
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:16,560
Rebellions are breaking out in Hong Kong and Shanghai.

16
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,200
Yet Sir Stephen chose

17
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,760
to bring "O" here,

18
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:24,160
to test their insane pact…

19
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:25,880
…and the strength of their love.

20
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:28,080
Are you sure you won't regret it?

21
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,840
I won't regret it.

22
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:35,920
Are you sure?

23
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,080
You know that through other men,

24
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,680
I will be yours only.

25
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:51,160
Fruits of Passion

26
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,680
Mama…

27
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,960
Mama…

28
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,920
Hurry up!

29
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,520
What are you staring at?

30
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,480
A new one.

31
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,800
A white prostitute…

32
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,800
Looks like it.

33
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,440
She won't last.

34
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,320
Fabulous

35
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:54,000
You really want us
to take her in charge?

36
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,800
Such a lovely girl?

37
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,880
Definitely, you'll teach her.

38
00:04:59,240 --> 00:04:59,960
But…

39
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:02,760
It's a challenge. We have an agreement.

40
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,120
It is a detour to reach the deepest form of love.

41
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:07,880
There's no need to understand,

42
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,240
keep the money anyway.

43
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,640
You have heard of me, I suppose?

44
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,720
Oh, yes, they say that in Shangai…

45
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,760
I am the owner of a casino there.

46
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,320
Ah, she really is willing?

47
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,000
Say it yourself.

48
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,920
Yes, I am willing.

49
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,480
She'll never stand it.

50
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,680
She looks so fresh

51
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,320
and innocent.

52
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,600
Suika!

53
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:42,960
Show her the rules of the House.

54
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,080
To work here,

55
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:49,480
you need to follow these rules…

56
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:57,480
Refuse a customer, and you shall receive 101 lashes.

57
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,520
Refuse a customer's request,

58
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:08,760
no matter how difficult it may be…
and you shall not be fed for 101 days.

59
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,000
You're no more than a plaything.

60
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,120
Pray to God

61
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:16,640
or commit a religious act,

62
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:19,720
and you shall be forced to…

63
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:22,640
…copulate with the Untouchables, such as drug addicts.

64
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:27,400
No, never. I'll never manage.

65
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,920
You see…

66
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,560
I am no longer myself.

67
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,080
You are my worst passion.

68
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,920
I want whatever you want.

69
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:18,520
Do I please you? Am I beautiful?

70
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,960
I'm all yours, Stephen.

71
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:42,440
Devil… You devil!

72
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,960
This'll be your room.

73
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,800
My name is O.

74
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,560
And mine's Byakuran.

75
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,560
We'll be friends.

76
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:44,880
The poor district along the river…

77
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,920
…here are the alleys, the slums.

78
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:52,400
Here they eat… drink… smoke.

79
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:55,760
And at daybreak they conspire as well.

80
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:03,400
If you keep drinking like that, you'll die.

81
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,680
Leave him alone. If he wants to kill himself…

82
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,560
…drinking's as good a way as any.

83
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:11,840
Yeah, and the cemetery costs a lot less than the alcohol.

84
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,760
Hey, it's your turn!

85
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:16,880
Papa! Get up, get up!

86
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:18,480
Get up!

87
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,440
My room…

88
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:33,000
no, my prison.

89
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
But love is my prison.

90
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,400
Wasn't I forever looking for a prison?

91
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:40,240
Now, there are real walls.

92
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,960
In a lower-class restaurant behind the house of pleasure…

93
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:56,120
…which the Chinese called "house of flowers"…

94
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,160
a young boy…

95
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,240
Come on, play!

96
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,080
I'm feeling lucky tonight.

97
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,640
Good move.

98
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,600
You know, he might be dead.

99
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,000
If he is, he's lucky.

100
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:32,320
No more debts, right?

101
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:35,680
Kato, come on. It's your turn.

102
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:37,800
Okay.

103
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,440
He was alright… He was really nice.

104
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:45,920
I really wouldn't worry.

105
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,480
He dies ten times a day.

106
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,400
Here you are.

107
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:13,440
I never leave you.

108
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:21,480
The light came on.

109
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:27,880
Hey! You horny kid, watching the brothel again.

110
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,720
The noodle's getting overcooked!

111
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,880
Without a mirror…

112
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,240
…my image

113
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,080
and my self elude me.

114
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,640
Haven't you gone to bed yet?

115
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,560
Beautiful …

116
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:38,000
Anything you need,

117
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,520
you have only to tell us, okay?

118
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,000
Goodnight.

119
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:44,200
Please, Madame,

120
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,280
when shall I begin?

121
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,200
That's for Sir Stephen to decide.

122
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:54,920
I just take care of my pretty French doll.

123
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:40,400
You didn't get a steel pot today?

124
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,600
Father, I am not a thief.

125
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:45,640
Spoiled brat!

126
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,400
Tomorrow you get a steel pot…

127
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:52,280
…or I'll kick you out! Got it?!

128
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,840
Place your bets.

129
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:01,920
You won again.

130
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:05,760
You win, that's right.

131
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:13,320
Bet's down, please. We'll begin the next one.

132
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:16,720
Twenty dollars to start. Bets down, please.

133
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,520
The open struggle will soon begin.

134
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,640
Men come out of the shadows.

135
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:26,560
They want foreign businessmen to contribute to their struggle.

136
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:32,720
What you want in fact is financial help?

137
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,240
The coolies union has voted that every coolie must

138
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:39,520
contribute five cents to the strike fund.

139
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,200
Which is not enough.

140
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:45,080
I don't see why you should ask an Englishman

141
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:47,120
to help you kick out the English!

142
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:52,080
The Soviet Union is sending material
to the army in Canton.

143
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,120
Race doesn't matter anymore.

144
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:55,800
Now what's the sense in it?

145
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:58,920
We want freedom for China.

146
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:08,040
The Chinese will be happier if they
remain under the control of foreigners.

147
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,040
You're wrong!

148
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:13,600
The history of China shows that

149
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:17,280
China has always got the better of its foreign rulers.

150
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:18,960
Let's go.

151
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,040
Why did we even bother.

152
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:21,840
Don't be in such a hurry.

153
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:25,120
I don't see eye to eye with you politically,

154
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,520
but I might help you all the same.

155
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:30,200
It's a kind of gamble.

156
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,200
How much would you want?

157
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,840
Stephen, Stephen, darling.

158
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:04,280
Let's go back to France.

159
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,160
My parents will leave.

160
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:10,040
Let's forget the business, everything.

161
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:17,000
The international concessions can't protect us anymore.

162
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,560
Let's go back.

163
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:20,560
We'll live together. Over there.

164
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:22,480
I don't want to leave China.

165
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,960
I'm happy here.

166
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,840
You know, Stephen, I understand.

167
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,440
Understand what?

168
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,320
Why you want to stay in China.

169
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,080
Because of "O", of course.

170
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:40,560
You can laugh if you like.

171
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,520
I pity you.

172
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:45,560
She chose to be a whore, that's all.

173
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:47,360
You think she loves you.

174
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:52,080
She doesn't choose. She accepts.

175
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,120
Because it's her desire.

176
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:55,320
It's ugly.

177
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,880
It's appalling.

178
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:00,520
She'll end up falling in love with someone else.

179
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:03,080
You'll see. She'll forget you.

180
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:05,640
It'll serve you right. You deserve it.

181
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,160
You don't understand a thing.

182
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:30,680
You got flowers… dirty flowers.

183
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,400
Who sent them?

184
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,200
Don't talk to me.

185
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,760
I speak no English.

186
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,040
Sad flowers.

187
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,880
And they're not from him.

188
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,640
Then who?

189
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,360
Why?

190
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:30,280
The little fortune teller hands out pieces of luck.

191
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,720
Time is in her box.

192
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,360
Oka-san does her books.

193
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,520
Oka-san means Madam.

194
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:43,880
Mama…

195
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:48,600
…didn't the studio send me a script?

196
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:51,560
What script?

197
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:56,400
The next movie to go into production.

198
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,520
Is there a new movie?

199
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:04,600
Mama, I'm still the lead.

200
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,000
Yesterday I got a letter

201
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,160
saying they were sending me a script.

202
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:16,640
You still got a big payment on your debt.

203
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,880
Take care of it or it's a problem!

204
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:23,400
Later, later, later, all the time!

205
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:25,600
What's going on?

206
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:28,440
She's told me the same story for ten years now!

207
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:31,520
That girl is crazy, crazy in the head!

208
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:33,600
Poor Aisen…

209
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,280
…spent 10 years dreaming she's still an actress…

210
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:37,760
A big star.

211
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,680
And poor Obana, endlessly coughing.

212
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:45,640
Obana…

213
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:50,800
…you should have a doctor examine you properly.

214
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:56,600
Sakuya listens to the piano at the bottom of the river.

215
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:59,200
It only plays for her… and for us.

216
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:04,360
When I was a kid, nobody bothered to play with me.

217
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:09,400
So I often lied to get attention.

218
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:13,520
A red bird nobody ever saw.

219
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:17,040
A piece of a star that fell from the sky.

220
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:21,960
A grand piano that sank in the river.

221
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:28,280
But my lies eventually became truth.

222
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:33,400
I can hear the piano in the river.

223
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,920
Come on in, come on in.

224
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:43,840
Here I am in a house of flowers.

225
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:46,040
We are the flowers.

226
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,360
A customer enters through the door.

227
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,520
Which one of us does he want?

228
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:54,760
Welcome, Sir Kudo Fu, are you in love?

229
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:57,640
I got a rare taxidermy piece.

230
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:58,840
I want to give it to her.

231
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:00,680
Thank you all the time.

232
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:03,440
Byakuran, sweetie! Byakuran!

233
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,440
Yes?

234
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,600
You sure you did it?

235
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:13,880
Yes, I did it all, everything.

236
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,320
Then I shall give you lashes!

237
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:18,160
Not yet, not yet.

238
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,160
Not yet?

239
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,360
Your line is wrong.

240
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:25,120
Why can't you remember?

241
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:29,800
In fact, I opened the letter,

242
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:32,680
I left the bee box open, it was all me.

243
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:36,560
Go on. Go on.

244
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:40,320
You opened the letter, you left the bee box open…

245
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:43,000
…you stole Mom's underwear,

246
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,040
it was all you, is that it?

247
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:47,200
Forgive me, Mom.

248
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,440
You shall be punished.

249
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:49,720
Show me your ass!

250
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:52,480
Don't hit me, Mom.

251
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:55,360
Don't… Do it harder!

252
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:58,400
Don't hit me, Mom, don't…

253
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,480
Don't hit me, Mom…

254
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:10,240
Mom, don't hit me, Mom…

255
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:20,760
Don't hit me, Mom, don't hit me.

256
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:23,680
My pretty Byakuran.

257
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:25,160
Which part is she playing?

258
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,240
I don't have a part yet.

259
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:29,080
I'm only an image.

260
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:33,960
It doesn't matter.

261
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:36,560
I hold you, I keep you.

262
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:39,520
Even if you're away… far…

263
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:41,080
or with another woman…

264
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:42,680
…you're with me.

265
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,960
Still no news from him?

266
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,760
That's the way he wanted it.

267
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,400
That way he is always with me…

268
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,240
I like it better that way.

269
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:59,120
What do you mean?

270
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:01,680
Letters show distance.

271
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:03,120
What distance?

272
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:08,160
Oh, don't you realize

273
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:11,120
he is here, in Hong Kong?…with Nathaiie?

274
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:12,680
His new woman?

275
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:16,000
She still doesn't understand.

276
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:19,560
Oh, what a curious ring!

277
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,880
May I try it on?

278
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,640
It's for me only.

279
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:31,400
Pleasure can be shared.

280
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:34,520
Pain is only for Stephen and me.

281
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,040
Papa!

282
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,080
Papa!

283
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:32,960
Papa!

284
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:37,080
Papa!

285
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:58,760
Oh, Stephen, you threw me into another world.

286
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,600
Who can explain it to me?

287
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:04,840
Soldiers are marching by. Why soldiers?

288
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:07,000
All the girls are scared.

289
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:58,720
I don't like the military.

290
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:07,400
My brother.

291
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:10,400
Idiot! Stay quiet!

292
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:18,560
As the fortune teller walks by Death…

293
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:20,480
…the day is breaking.

294
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:33,840
Is it really okay?

295
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:45,920
You stay naked… don't you catch cold?

296
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,560
This looks fun.

297
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:54,960
How do you use it?

298
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:36,160
Wow.

299
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,920
You look like a bird!

300
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:43,080
I imitate pigeons very well.

301
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:03,880
You laughed… Finally.

302
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:10,680
Let's pretend we are pigeons.

303
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:39,960
You see, she really enjoys it. All on her own.

304
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,440
But I enjoy it, too.

305
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:46,120
We both share the pleasure.

306
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,240
You're horrible.

307
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:51,640
And you refuse to see the truth.

308
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:53,560
Right now, she's in another world.

309
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:54,920
She's forgetting you.

310
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:59,280
You make pigeon noise, too.

311
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:43,160
Come on in.

312
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:45,160
We have lots of pretty girls.

313
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,120
That girl.

314
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:42,960
So…? Anyone you like?

315
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:45,120
That woman.

316
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:47,600
That's "O."

317
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,640
And how much do you have?

318
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:51,920
How much?

319
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:55,480
Of course. Blondes are expensive.

320
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:06,600
What's wrong with this brat?

321
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:08,960
You're not serious?!

322
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:11,960
This is no place for kids.

323
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:18,120
He is rebelling.

324
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:21,360
A new recruit for the coolie organization.

325
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:38,880
You sure you weren't followed?

326
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:59,200
Sir Stephen shoves aside a young stranger.

327
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,320
So they each meet their destiny…

328
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:03,920
…without knowing it.

329
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:06,720
Rich asshole.

330
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:12,520
Kid, going to Ku-Ron?

331
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:18,120
Mr. Kudo Fu?

332
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:20,560
Don't talk loud. People might hear.

333
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,360
If you're going to Ku-Ron…

334
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:27,440
…take this.

335
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,240
We might have to change our plans.

336
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:47,480
But what about the Red Guard?

337
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:50,960
We must act now.

338
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:56,880
We have orders from the political committee.

339
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,080
Any ideas?

340
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:00,080
With no arms? How?

341
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:01,560
Keep your voice down.

342
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:04,040
The committee needs an answer.

343
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:06,520
And we need guns, right?

344
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:07,560
That's our answer.

345
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:09,840
Yeah, that's what we'll say.

346
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:13,760
Who'll deliver the message?

347
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,040
What about the boy?

348
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:16,920
He could pass through unnoticed. What do you say?

349
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:18,840
Good idea.

350
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:20,040
He wants money.

351
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:23,720
Kid, don't eavesdrop. Come over.

352
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:25,400
We'll give you work.

353
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:27,320
You'll pay?

354
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:32,000
After this, you can eat all the meat pie you want.

355
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,760
I don't want that.

356
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:35,720
I'm buying myself a girl.

357
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:46,520
You again!

358
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,320
Go!

359
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:02,120
Today I'll be watching.

360
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:06,400
He's a butcher from Canton.

361
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:08,480
He reeks of blood.

362
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:31,360
No…

363
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,560
…don't close your eyes.

364
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,640
Look.

365
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:38,920
Look.

366
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:03,640
I know.

367
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:05,240
I've always known.

368
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:07,080
I redeem you.

369
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:09,000
I make you free.

370
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:11,840
Stephen,

371
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:18,000
Stephen

372
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:22,520
Stephen

373
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,400
Stephen

374
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:37,360
What is she like, this girl we're visiting?

375
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:41,240
Just tell me… do you still love her?

376
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:44,560
I don't care if you won't answer me.

377
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:51,680
Let's go.

378
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:56,800
Here we are.

379
00:40:57,720 --> 00:41:00,040
"O", this is Nathalie.

380
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:01,760
Hello.

381
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,040
Let's go.

382
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:18,400
She's beautiful…

383
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:19,840
but I make her uncomfortable.

384
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:22,280
I am not embarrassed.

385
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:25,160
I wanted you to see her.

386
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:29,920
I can't imagine living without her anymore.

387
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:35,640
Other than that, nothing has changed.

388
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:38,840
I understand.

389
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:41,280
Is that all?

390
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:45,760
Mademoiselle… How can you submit like this?

391
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:48,560
How can you even bear to have lunch with us?

392
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:49,560
You are…

393
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:50,920
It's terrible.

394
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:52,800
You love him, don't you?

395
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:55,560
So do I.

396
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:02,720
That's why I want him to choose.

397
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:07,640
What about you, "O"?

398
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:12,160
Do you also want me to choose?

399
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:18,680
I want whatever you want, that's all.

400
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:28,760
Yes, Nathalie. Why not her?

401
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:31,480
He won't think of other women.

402
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:35,160
The poor thing has no idea.

403
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:45,560
Crazy…

404
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:47,640
Crazy?

405
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:49,960
I am crazy.

406
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:52,120
I want to be crazy.

407
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:55,520
I know he loves my silence, my chains.

408
00:44:58,360 --> 00:45:01,280
Look… Look!

409
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:18,960
See how he loves me.

410
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:40,560
She says, "See how he loves me."

411
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:43,200
While he's looking into my eyes.

412
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:21,360
The piano in the river.

413
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:25,720
I beg of you… talk to me, Stephen.

414
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:28,040
Your voice erases everything.

415
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:30,680
The parrot's escaped!

416
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:39,520
There, there!　-Hey, hey…

417
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:57,360
Thanks.

418
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:04,240
Action.

419
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:07,080
Can you hear that waltz?

420
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:11,120
That music that trembled my heart

421
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:12,840
is coming from the river.

422
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:19,120
Yes, Ma'am.

423
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:21,680
Wrong…

424
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:25,560
You hold a gun like this, right?

425
00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:28,360
I've paid good money for you, and not just for the film.

426
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:31,760
And you fire, and I will die, saying…

427
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:32,760
Bang!

428
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:39,920
"My last wish before I die…"

429
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:42,240
How long do you want to continue this?

430
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:44,680
Let me do it or I'm leaving!

431
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:47,560
"Please request the orchestra"

432
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:50,440
"to play that sad waltz…"

433
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:52,320
Stop it already.

434
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:54,200
I'm not here to play an extra.

435
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:55,400
Bitch!

436
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:56,680
Talk about an ex-actress

437
00:47:56,680 --> 00:47:58,320
and cheap!

438
00:47:58,320 --> 00:48:00,600
Just an ugly crazy woman.

439
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:02,920
Piano coming from a river?!

440
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:04,040
An orchestra playing a waltz!

441
00:48:04,040 --> 00:48:05,520
What do you take me for?

442
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:07,520
Let me do it, or I'm leaving.

443
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:09,880
Please, please…

444
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:15,320
I guarantee she'll do whatever you ask of her, you'll see…

445
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:21,280
You're so bad.

446
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:23,600
What you're doing doesn't make you a dog.

447
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:25,240
Bow-wow! Bow-wow!

448
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:27,040
Be a real dog!

449
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,800
Show him an example.

450
00:48:32,360 --> 00:48:33,360
Fetch!

451
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:48,160
Good dog.

452
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:52,440
See, Carloff…

453
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:54,560
You see how to be a good dog?

454
00:48:58,840 --> 00:48:59,880
Paw!

455
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:06,120
Stay!

456
00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:26,640
Father.

457
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:48,360
Dad, got a toy dog for me?

458
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:50,080
No, I drank the money.

459
00:51:16,120 --> 00:51:19,400
"O", without a clue, witnesses the first meeting…

460
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:21,320
…the first signal.

461
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:10,960
Terrorism breaks out.

462
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:13,160
First target… the Union Jack.

463
00:53:13,560 --> 00:53:16,280
First attack… a police precinct.

464
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:50,200
A little higher.

465
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:57,880
Raise your arm. The other side.

466
00:55:02,560 --> 00:55:05,280
He's much too young for this.

467
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:26,200
O, You've got to get well.

468
00:55:26,840 --> 00:55:28,680
Do you feel a little better?

469
00:55:45,240 --> 00:55:46,480
I am sorry.

470
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:49,560
You are no good.

471
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,480
He ought to be here, with you now

472
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:22,040
Hey, how is she?

473
00:56:22,040 --> 00:56:25,120
Don't worry. Just a cold.

474
00:56:25,120 --> 00:56:26,320
Oh yeah?

475
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:28,160
Then, fine.

476
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:46,200
History sets so many different traps.

477
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:05,400
Sure of himself, he gambled without thinking he could lose.

478
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:06,600
And yet…

479
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:13,080
It's like… leaving to die.

480
00:57:16,320 --> 00:57:19,160
Medical cost is not that much.

481
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:24,800
You Europeans always do things by halves, that's your way.

482
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:27,880
I've told you, not a penny more.

483
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:30,080
And now, get out!

484
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:34,440
Do you really mean it? Not a penny?

485
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:37,360
Running with the wolves, yes.

486
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:41,600
It's a gamble.
But contributing for slaughter

487
00:57:41,600 --> 00:57:42,840
No, I'm not interested.

488
00:57:42,840 --> 00:57:45,160
Asshole. You betrayed us!

489
00:57:46,560 --> 00:57:48,200
Wait! We can work something out…

490
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:53,400
Take anything valuable.

491
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:54,840
We'll sell them and buy weapons!

492
00:58:01,040 --> 00:58:04,720
Help! Help! Call the police, hurry!

493
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:22,600
A customer for you. No?

494
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:26,040
You're still not well?

495
00:58:26,040 --> 00:58:28,800
Not really, I'm sorry.

496
00:58:32,520 --> 00:58:36,280
IF you are sick, I won't force you.

497
00:58:41,240 --> 00:58:44,960
But don't forget the agreement with Sir Stephen.

498
00:58:46,520 --> 00:58:48,720
You've no right to choose.

499
00:58:55,720 --> 00:58:59,120
It's okay for today, but…

500
00:59:25,720 --> 00:59:28,760
Well…? "O" got roses again?

501
00:59:36,360 --> 00:59:37,520
Mama.

502
00:59:37,800 --> 00:59:40,040
Something's weird with Aisen.

503
00:59:40,040 --> 00:59:42,320
She's always weird.

504
00:59:47,080 --> 00:59:49,000
Action

505
00:59:58,440 --> 01:00:00,880
Okay, okay. It's started.

506
01:00:02,200 --> 01:00:03,800
Do you like to dance?

507
01:00:04,120 --> 01:00:06,080
Yes, of course.

508
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:07,960
Your age?

509
01:00:08,280 --> 01:00:09,600
I'm 42.

510
01:00:09,840 --> 01:00:13,120
27.

511
01:00:20,600 --> 01:00:22,480
That night of celebration…

512
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:27,040
…we sneaked out of the dancing crowd…

513
01:00:28,920 --> 01:00:32,040
We listened by the river…

514
01:00:32,520 --> 01:00:35,600
…that sad waltz…

515
01:00:43,560 --> 01:00:44,800
But…

516
01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:47,440
…the ship has sailed off.

517
01:00:47,680 --> 01:00:49,200
I don't care.

518
01:00:50,120 --> 01:00:53,320
Let's drink through the night.

519
01:00:54,440 --> 01:00:55,640
I can't.

520
01:00:56,960 --> 01:00:58,640
The cops will be here soon.

521
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:04,440
Then, please ask for me…

522
01:01:05,080 --> 01:01:07,720
…ask that traveling singer…

523
01:01:08,840 --> 01:01:12,280
…to play that sad song, that sad waltz.

524
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:15,280
Aisen, let's run away.

525
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:17,920
It's not too late yet.

526
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:23,360
It's no use. Too late.

527
01:01:23,960 --> 01:01:28,360
Because the world ends… right here.

528
01:01:30,040 --> 01:01:33,320
Aisen. You are not…

529
01:01:34,320 --> 01:01:35,480
The two of us…

530
01:01:35,480 --> 01:01:36,840
Yes.

531
01:01:37,080 --> 01:01:39,200
The two of us will dance the sad waltz

532
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:41,720
and escape to the world's end.

533
01:01:42,040 --> 01:01:43,920
Before the cops arrive.

534
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:46,280
The red moon over Monte Carlo,

535
01:01:46,280 --> 01:01:47,520
a gleaming gun in the right hand…

536
01:01:47,520 --> 01:01:50,360
…the end of the world is in my heart.

537
01:01:51,280 --> 01:01:53,880
Let's make up our minds with one gunshot…

538
01:01:53,880 --> 01:01:55,960
…no, with two!

539
01:01:57,280 --> 01:02:00,160
The two of us, where nobody can catch us.

540
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:17,160
The movie died.

541
01:03:41,840 --> 01:03:43,120
Double suicide…

542
01:03:43,120 --> 01:03:44,560
Shot the man,

543
01:03:44,560 --> 01:03:45,720
then drowned herself.

544
01:03:45,720 --> 01:03:47,480
A prostitute and a john.

545
01:03:47,480 --> 01:03:49,760
Heard she had a big debt.

546
01:03:50,320 --> 01:03:52,720
Look, a piano floated to the surface.

547
01:03:52,720 --> 01:03:55,320
How did a grand piano get in the river?

548
01:03:55,320 --> 01:03:57,520
I don't know…

549
01:04:01,520 --> 01:04:03,560
She played her last part.

550
01:04:04,160 --> 01:04:06,080
She played it to the bitter end.

551
01:04:06,840 --> 01:04:08,640
She took off her mask.

552
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:10,960
We mustn't cry over her.

553
01:04:27,320 --> 01:04:29,600
The fortune teller has grown older.

554
01:04:29,880 --> 01:04:31,960
Her box is void of future.

555
01:04:38,200 --> 01:04:39,200
What's going on?

556
01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:40,760
Don't come any closer.

557
01:04:41,800 --> 01:04:43,320
I can't stand it, I'm leaving!

558
01:04:46,480 --> 01:04:48,120
Don't touch me! Leave me alone!

559
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:49,920
What's wrong, Nathalie?

560
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:50,920
You're evil,

561
01:04:50,920 --> 01:04:52,800
you're a fake, a cheat!

562
01:04:52,800 --> 01:04:54,240
You're disgusting!

563
01:04:56,280 --> 01:04:57,840
No!

564
01:04:57,840 --> 01:04:58,880
Are you crazy?

565
01:04:58,880 --> 01:05:00,200
Let go of me!

566
01:05:01,480 --> 01:05:04,000
You were right, go back to "O"!

567
01:05:04,320 --> 01:05:06,040
You two make a fine pair!

568
01:05:06,640 --> 01:05:08,080
You'll be ruined!

569
01:05:09,680 --> 01:05:11,400
She can support you!

570
01:05:30,080 --> 01:05:31,400
Don't make a fool of me!

571
01:05:59,600 --> 01:06:00,640
Come in.

572
01:06:20,160 --> 01:06:21,240
Hello.

573
01:06:22,240 --> 01:06:23,480
Hello.

574
01:06:25,400 --> 01:06:26,720
What do you want?

575
01:06:31,760 --> 01:06:33,640
This is for you.

576
01:06:37,120 --> 01:06:38,280
Sit down.

577
01:06:43,040 --> 01:06:46,240
I would like just a little…

578
01:06:46,240 --> 01:06:47,560
A little what?

579
01:06:48,200 --> 01:06:49,920
A little smile.

580
01:06:50,360 --> 01:06:52,280
Because you'd
look even lovelier, I know.

581
01:06:52,840 --> 01:06:54,760
What is there to smile about?

582
01:06:55,320 --> 01:06:57,000
For what reason?

583
01:06:57,880 --> 01:06:59,240
I paid… a lot of money!

584
01:07:13,120 --> 01:07:14,160
Don't kiss me!

585
01:07:14,160 --> 01:07:15,560
Why not?

586
01:07:16,640 --> 01:07:19,280
You belong to me now.

587
01:07:20,920 --> 01:07:23,800
I bought you. You're mine forever.

588
01:07:37,080 --> 01:07:38,480
Let me have this.

589
01:07:39,880 --> 01:07:42,200
I'll buy you a new ring…

590
01:08:05,560 --> 01:08:07,160
My arm!

591
01:08:08,040 --> 01:08:11,640
It's because of you that I hurt it,

592
01:08:11,920 --> 01:08:15,160
I needed money to pay for you.

593
01:08:59,680 --> 01:09:00,720
She kissed him.

594
01:09:01,040 --> 01:09:02,600
What an idiot.

595
01:09:05,360 --> 01:09:06,840
He's just a kid.

596
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:27,920
You smiled! Smile more!

597
01:10:21,640 --> 01:10:23,800
Does she still belong to Sir Stephen?

598
01:10:24,360 --> 01:10:25,640
He doesn't know anymore.

599
01:10:25,640 --> 01:10:27,800
He's beside himself with anger.

600
01:10:28,600 --> 01:10:30,360
Fate turns against him.

601
01:12:15,920 --> 01:12:17,280
No more opium.

602
01:12:17,280 --> 01:12:19,000
Kato sent me.

603
01:12:55,440 --> 01:12:56,880
Ogaku? Are you in there?

604
01:12:57,200 --> 01:12:58,400
Yes.

605
01:13:53,040 --> 01:13:54,200
Hello

606
01:13:54,200 --> 01:13:55,360
No.

607
01:13:55,360 --> 01:13:56,640
Why?

608
01:13:56,640 --> 01:14:00,880
In China when friends meet,
they never shake hands.

609
01:14:00,880 --> 01:14:02,200
They do like this.

610
01:14:04,160 --> 01:14:06,280
Really? Why?

611
01:14:06,280 --> 01:14:08,160
For fear of contamination.

612
01:14:09,200 --> 01:14:10,160
Well, well, well…

613
01:14:10,160 --> 01:14:13,000
why such a difficult topic?

614
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:14,040
Shall we dance?

615
01:14:14,040 --> 01:14:16,080
No, no dance.

616
01:14:16,960 --> 01:14:18,600
I have a good girl.

617
01:14:45,920 --> 01:14:48,360
Byakuran, nice rental costume.

618
01:14:48,360 --> 01:14:50,200
We're getting married.

619
01:14:50,200 --> 01:14:51,320
Married?

620
01:14:51,320 --> 01:14:53,280
He's my childhood sweetheart.

621
01:14:53,280 --> 01:14:55,320
Neither of us could go to school…

622
01:14:55,320 --> 01:14:57,920
…so we played hide-and-seek in slaughterhouses.

623
01:15:00,440 --> 01:15:03,120
Why not a masked ball today?

624
01:15:06,560 --> 01:15:09,040
Does this make me look like a charming demon?

625
01:15:16,600 --> 01:15:17,680
"O"?

626
01:15:19,320 --> 01:15:20,720
Do you know him?

627
01:15:27,280 --> 01:15:27,800
He is…

628
01:15:27,800 --> 01:15:30,280
That boy, last night…

629
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:31,720
Yes.

630
01:15:31,720 --> 01:15:34,520
The boy was killed.

631
01:15:35,600 --> 01:15:37,640
Sir Stephen killed him,

632
01:15:37,640 --> 01:15:39,720
then tried to kill himself…

633
01:15:39,720 --> 01:15:41,640
…but they stopped him in time.

634
01:15:43,120 --> 01:15:46,400
Take this contract.

635
01:15:47,320 --> 01:15:49,240
I give it back to you.

636
01:15:50,040 --> 01:15:52,040
"O", you are free!

637
01:16:04,320 --> 01:16:06,080
You are free!

638
01:16:06,480 --> 01:16:09,200
You can go wherever you want.

639
01:16:18,280 --> 01:16:21,440
But if you want, you can stay here.

640
01:16:29,040 --> 01:16:30,760
You are free!

641
01:16:31,200 --> 01:16:33,520
You can go wherever you want.

642
01:16:37,880 --> 01:16:41,960
But if you want, you can stay here, "O".
