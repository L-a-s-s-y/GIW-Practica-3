Give me.

12
00:06:54,809 --> 00:06:55,833
It's mine...

13
00:06:55,944 --> 00:06:57,036
It's mine now.

14
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:06,048
Yasuo!

15
00:08:07,226 --> 00:08:08,716
You look fine.

16
00:08:15,035 --> 00:08:17,129
Let's go:

17
00:08:17,338 --> 00:08:19,465
Start the engine.

18
00:08:20,107 --> 00:08:21,165
Go now!

19
00:08:21,609 --> 00:08:22,439
Go!

20
00:08:25,914 --> 00:08:27,211
Hungry?

21
00:08:28,717 --> 00:08:29,979
Let's eat.

22
00:08:30,219 --> 00:08:32,779
OK. Let's go.

23
00:11:40,937 --> 00:11:43,371
Kenji.

24
00:11:43,473 --> 00:11:44,668
Yasuo?

25
00:11:44,775 --> 00:11:46,037
Yeah.

26
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:47,334
How are you?

27
00:11:47,444 --> 00:11:51,211
Finally got out. Look.

28
00:11:51,316 --> 00:11:53,216
It's nice.

29
00:11:53,318 --> 00:11:59,315
Not nice. Our boss died
and our gang's gone.

30
00:11:59,425 --> 00:12:00,255
Yasuo.

31
00:12:00,593 --> 00:12:05,793
Only four years in prison.
It's nothing for them.

32
00:12:05,899 --> 00:12:09,131
I got no time.

33
00:12:09,237 --> 00:12:12,172
Ain't seen him so long, bro.

34
00:12:13,208 --> 00:12:18,806
I shouldn't call you bro, Sir.

35
00:12:20,216 --> 00:12:22,776
I'm leaving.

36
00:12:22,885 --> 00:12:23,977
Where to?

37
00:12:24,086 --> 00:12:25,018
Shopping.

38
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,088
Girl?

39
00:12:27,691 --> 00:12:28,851
Still live there?

40
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:29,721
Yeah.

41
00:12:29,826 --> 00:12:31,226
Call you later.

42
00:12:31,696 --> 00:12:32,720
See you.

43
00:12:35,667 --> 00:12:39,001
Three coffees.

44
00:12:39,571 --> 00:12:40,560
My treat

45
00:12:40,673 --> 00:12:42,403
Nice guy.

46
00:12:43,643 --> 00:12:46,134
Really good at fishing.

47
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:52,175
He can fish one after another.
I got none.

48
00:12:57,592 --> 00:12:58,820
Yasuo, let's leave.

49
00:12:59,461 --> 00:13:03,831
Now? Take it easy.

50
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:05,032
Hey.

51
00:13:06,068 --> 00:13:07,000
Yasuo.

52
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:12,173
Keep it. I don't want to see.

53
00:13:15,713 --> 00:13:19,844
Regard it's from boss, not me.

54
00:13:20,018 --> 00:13:23,818
Where is he?

55
00:13:24,756 --> 00:13:29,218
Don't fool around.

56
00:13:30,163 --> 00:13:31,357
Where?

57
00:13:32,933 --> 00:13:34,696
In the cemetery.

58
00:13:35,769 --> 00:13:40,208
Stop joking please.

59
00:13:45,314 --> 00:13:46,804
No joke.

60
00:13:48,650 --> 00:13:49,981
Where is he?

61
00:13:54,758 --> 00:13:56,589
I want to see him.

62
00:13:57,627 --> 00:13:59,959
Is he fine? How is he?

63
00:14:13,312 --> 00:14:14,439
Don't...

64
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:19,116
call me too often.

65
00:14:37,373 --> 00:14:38,898
Nice to be normal.

66
00:14:53,959 --> 00:14:55,426
Let's take the car.

67
00:16:00,802 --> 00:16:02,531
It's lonesome.

68
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:07,639
How is your job?

69
00:16:08,912 --> 00:16:11,278
Offer from Dainichi Steel.

70
00:16:12,949 --> 00:16:14,007
Dripping.

71
00:16:23,028 --> 00:16:24,655
Blast Furnance...

72
00:16:26,364 --> 00:16:28,230
You know nothing.

73
00:16:33,607 --> 00:16:34,665
Go home?

74
00:16:35,809 --> 00:16:37,276
Strait jacket.

75
00:16:42,117 --> 00:16:43,846
You don't know...

76
00:16:45,721 --> 00:16:48,019
Long sleeves.

77
00:16:48,591 --> 00:16:50,354
They tie them in back

78
00:16:52,129 --> 00:16:54,620
Empty your hands.

79
00:16:55,866 --> 00:16:58,027
They take away everything.

80
00:17:01,838 --> 00:17:02,770
No...

81
00:17:04,776 --> 00:17:06,801
You'll forsake me also.

82
00:17:06,912 --> 00:17:08,346
No...

83
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:13,609
Like your mom.

84
00:17:14,587 --> 00:17:16,647
Like a rolling stone.

85
00:19:52,969 --> 00:19:53,937
Yes.

86
00:19:54,705 --> 00:19:56,400
What?

87
00:19:57,642 --> 00:19:59,974
I can only trust you.

88
00:20:01,546 --> 00:20:03,207
You're my friend.

89
00:20:05,650 --> 00:20:09,178
I see. It's good.

90
00:20:55,107 --> 00:20:56,131
Here you are.

91
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:03,916
Remember? Yuri, my sister.

92
00:21:17,332 --> 00:21:19,767
I knew I couldn't trust him.

93
00:21:20,970 --> 00:21:24,031
Had a small gun...
good for women.

94
00:21:25,776 --> 00:21:27,175
Did you kill him?

95
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:32,249
No. He died by himself.

96
00:21:40,191 --> 00:21:43,684
He used me so much.

97
00:21:44,096 --> 00:21:46,565
I'm out...no gang...no boss.

98
00:21:47,667 --> 00:21:49,464
Lies no one believes in.

99
00:21:56,445 --> 00:21:58,379
Boss lost face.

100
00:22:01,784 --> 00:22:03,183
So he hides himself.

101
00:22:07,457 --> 00:22:08,925
Boss never dies.

102
00:22:10,695 --> 00:22:12,185
I'll kill him.

103
00:22:29,481 --> 00:22:30,972
Bury him and leave.

104
00:22:31,918 --> 00:22:35,854
Kenji. I've got something
I want you to keep.

105
00:22:47,136 --> 00:22:48,865
Don't ask what?

106
00:22:49,205 --> 00:22:50,604
No need.

107
00:22:51,107 --> 00:22:52,472
You're brave.

108
00:22:53,811 --> 00:22:55,176
I'm shaking.

109
00:22:57,882 --> 00:22:59,645
Be my lost hand.

110
00:23:00,017 --> 00:23:02,485
A hassle to have one hand.

111
00:23:06,357 --> 00:23:09,020
Take care. See you tonight.

112
00:23:10,562 --> 00:23:16,523
Listen to him and behave.
Or I'll scold you.

113
00:25:12,637 --> 00:25:17,768
Thanks a lot. Call you later.

114
00:25:19,477 --> 00:25:20,910
Yasuo.

115
00:25:22,047 --> 00:25:23,309
What's up?

116
00:25:26,218 --> 00:25:28,118
Kill my boss.

117
00:25:29,955 --> 00:25:31,388
Prisoner again.

118
00:25:33,426 --> 00:25:37,727
Can't help.
See and ask why he left...

119
00:25:41,802 --> 00:25:43,895
Never mind.

120
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:46,234
Call you later.

121
00:26:27,288 --> 00:26:28,619
What's the song?

122
00:26:33,562 --> 00:26:34,655
I don't know.

123
00:26:40,003 --> 00:26:42,062
Don't touch. Muffler's hot.

124
00:27:01,727 --> 00:27:02,887
Shall we go?

125
00:28:40,841 --> 00:28:43,776
Nobody answers as always.

126
00:28:46,914 --> 00:28:48,644
Damn.

127
00:28:52,122 --> 00:28:58,721
I'm Shiraishi. My father please.

128
00:29:09,041 --> 00:29:10,235
Yes.

129
00:29:15,248 --> 00:29:18,115
I see.

130
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:24,217
Liar. They don't even
check on him.

131
00:29:27,996 --> 00:29:29,327
Angry?

132
00:29:31,966 --> 00:29:33,490
Don't be upset

133
00:32:09,281 --> 00:32:11,078
Where are you going?

134
00:32:34,776 --> 00:32:36,243
Boss came here?

135
00:32:38,147 --> 00:32:39,842
He died.

136
00:32:45,489 --> 00:32:47,582
They told you to say it.

137
00:32:57,970 --> 00:32:59,301
Where is he?

138
00:32:59,538 --> 00:33:01,632
So, he passed away.

139
00:33:10,484 --> 00:33:12,042
Stop. I'm serious.

140
00:33:12,152 --> 00:33:15,088
Went to the hospital and funeral.

141
00:33:15,189 --> 00:33:16,656
It's strange.

142
00:33:17,359 --> 00:33:20,192
You're only a punk. Why?

143
00:33:20,595 --> 00:33:22,495
I did go to the funeral.

144
00:33:26,403 --> 00:33:30,568
You have speed. Give me some.

145
00:33:39,885 --> 00:33:41,217
Where is he?

146
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:43,481
Hurts...

147
00:33:43,890 --> 00:33:45,187
Tell me.

148
00:33:45,291 --> 00:33:48,692
He died.

149
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:54,731
Where is he?

150
00:33:59,306 --> 00:34:00,398
Boss?

151
00:34:00,908 --> 00:34:02,809
What the hell...

152
00:34:07,316 --> 00:34:09,511
All liars.

153
00:35:15,828 --> 00:35:16,795
What?

154
00:35:17,696 --> 00:35:18,822
I don't like here.

155
00:35:18,931 --> 00:35:19,898
Why?

156
00:35:20,433 --> 00:35:22,333
Brother gone before.

157
00:35:25,671 --> 00:35:27,105
You came before.

158
00:35:30,076 --> 00:35:31,407
He won't disappear.

159
00:35:31,979 --> 00:35:34,743
Let's wait for him inside.

160
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:40,846
Can I trust you?

161
00:36:34,819 --> 00:36:36,116
Your orders?

162
00:36:36,753 --> 00:36:37,845
Coke.

163
00:36:38,522 --> 00:36:39,751
You?

164
00:36:43,094 --> 00:36:44,186
Menu?

165
00:36:46,399 --> 00:36:47,627
Here it is.

166
00:36:54,374 --> 00:36:56,501
I need pictures.

167
00:36:57,344 --> 00:36:58,436
What do you like?

168
00:37:02,115 --> 00:37:04,949
Puffy one.

169
00:37:05,953 --> 00:37:10,254
With brown sauce and fruit.

170
00:37:10,592 --> 00:37:11,752
Chocolate parfait.

171
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:12,918
Right.

172
00:37:18,935 --> 00:37:20,563
Chocolate parfait and coke.

173
00:37:40,293 --> 00:37:41,760
She's been with you?

174
00:37:42,328 --> 00:37:43,317
Ms.Q.

175
00:37:44,097 --> 00:37:45,223
She's Q.

176
00:38:20,773 --> 00:38:23,606
Excuse me. Phone?

177
00:38:23,709 --> 00:38:24,801
It's broken.

178
00:38:24,945 --> 00:38:25,877
Your store's...

179
00:38:28,214 --> 00:38:29,375
No.

180
00:38:29,783 --> 00:38:31,410
It's near the tunnel.

181
00:38:42,031 --> 00:38:44,397
Do I have to go there...

182
00:38:50,839 --> 00:38:53,605
Can you wait for me?

183
00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:55,273
Where to?

184
00:38:55,547 --> 00:38:58,209
To the tunnel. Phone.

185
00:39:00,752 --> 00:39:01,878
To my brother?

186
00:39:03,154 --> 00:39:04,213
My dad.

187
00:39:05,125 --> 00:39:06,752
Your dad.

188
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,250
You tell him?

189
00:39:09,362 --> 00:39:10,727
No.

190
00:39:12,566 --> 00:39:17,561
Told nothin' to the teacher.
He'll be angry.

191
00:39:18,338 --> 00:39:21,637
My brother said
I won't go back there.

192
00:39:23,477 --> 00:39:25,968
Wonder if he'll disappear again...

193
00:39:27,315 --> 00:39:30,183
He promised to be together:

194
00:39:32,022 --> 00:39:35,253
Don't worry.
He'll pick you up later.

195
00:39:35,892 --> 00:39:37,257
I'll be back soon.

196
00:39:38,029 --> 00:39:42,228
He didn't lie before...

197
00:41:14,706 --> 00:41:19,167
Kenji!

198
00:41:28,554 --> 00:41:29,452
You!

199
00:41:36,430 --> 00:41:38,762
I'll beat you!

200
00:41:40,835 --> 00:41:42,302
You were scared.

201
00:41:43,706 --> 00:41:44,695
Now what?

202
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:47,005
None of your business.

203
00:41:47,343 --> 00:41:49,106
How about you?

204
00:41:49,245 --> 00:41:51,406
I'm hiking.

205
00:41:54,651 --> 00:41:57,917
By yourself? You're weird.

206
00:41:58,957 --> 00:42:00,049
You too.

207
00:42:00,158 --> 00:42:01,921
Don't talk to me like that.

208
00:42:02,894 --> 00:42:04,088
Go!

209
00:42:04,863 --> 00:42:06,125
Why so angry?

210
00:42:06,231 --> 00:42:07,824
Shut up: Just go!

211
00:42:08,034 --> 00:42:10,366
I see. See you later!

212
00:42:14,808 --> 00:42:16,332
I'll forgive you.

213
00:42:26,554 --> 00:42:28,146
Forgive me?

214
00:42:47,612 --> 00:42:48,601
Yes.

215
00:42:49,881 --> 00:42:51,815
Wait a moment.

216
00:44:06,436 --> 00:44:07,698
You're working hard.

217
00:44:08,406 --> 00:44:09,964
I'm wanted.

218
00:44:11,274 --> 00:44:12,639
Yasuo Matsumura?

219
00:44:12,877 --> 00:44:13,775
Yeah.

220
00:44:15,513 --> 00:44:18,641
Tell him to bring the car keys.

221
00:44:20,719 --> 00:44:22,812
Hey, keys.

222
00:44:23,188 --> 00:44:24,348
For cars.

223
00:44:33,902 --> 00:44:35,164
Throw them away.

224
00:44:37,071 --> 00:44:38,129
Throw them away!

225
00:44:38,272 --> 00:44:39,296
What?

226
00:44:39,740 --> 00:44:41,230
Hurry! Do it!

227
00:44:45,948 --> 00:44:48,109
Turn around.

228
00:44:54,791 --> 00:44:56,487
Turn back

229
00:44:59,163 --> 00:45:00,425
Hands on the ceiling.

230
00:45:05,704 --> 00:45:08,697
Follow me.

231
00:45:16,316 --> 00:45:17,374
Don't come!

232
00:45:21,523 --> 00:45:25,220
Give up! No escape.

233
00:45:25,827 --> 00:45:29,285
Do you know where my boss is?

234
00:45:30,598 --> 00:45:33,727
You don't know he died?

235
00:45:36,139 --> 00:45:38,471
You want me to give it up.

236
00:45:40,010 --> 00:45:44,572
They forgot a punk like you.

237
00:45:44,849 --> 00:45:46,009
Poor thing.

238
00:45:48,253 --> 00:45:52,451
Who's a punk!

239
00:46:25,328 --> 00:46:27,694
Kenji's motorbike.

240
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,366
I'm his friend.

241
00:46:34,740 --> 00:46:36,901
It's melting. Eat.

242
00:46:38,377 --> 00:46:39,366
Why not?

243
00:46:40,312 --> 00:46:41,745
Too nice.

244
00:46:42,682 --> 00:46:44,981
Don't be wasteful...

245
00:46:46,354 --> 00:46:47,753
It's pretty.

246
00:46:55,296 --> 00:46:58,391
They are also nice.

247
00:46:58,734 --> 00:47:00,201
I just took them.

248
00:47:01,103 --> 00:47:02,263
What is it?

249
00:47:02,404 --> 00:47:03,962
Mountains here.

250
00:47:06,208 --> 00:47:08,177
Inside the tunnel.

251
00:47:08,311 --> 00:47:10,712
You've never checked the wall.

252
00:47:15,820 --> 00:47:18,311
I forgot it.

253
00:47:18,889 --> 00:47:20,551
What?

254
00:47:20,692 --> 00:47:22,422
Time for TV.

255
00:47:29,034 --> 00:47:30,934
Ice coffee. She's an idiot.

256
00:47:34,076 --> 00:47:35,441
Scary.

257
00:47:58,602 --> 00:47:59,762
No.

258
00:48:00,938 --> 00:48:02,337
No sound.

259
00:48:04,541 --> 00:48:05,599
That's it.

260
00:48:31,439 --> 00:48:33,304
You like it with no sound?

261
00:48:42,753 --> 00:48:44,778
Better with sound?

262
00:49:00,006 --> 00:49:01,598
You like pictures only.

263
00:49:14,223 --> 00:49:16,088
It's the same for idiots.

264
00:50:21,867 --> 00:50:23,266
What are you doing?

265
00:50:25,305 --> 00:50:26,772
We?

266
00:50:27,540 --> 00:50:29,599
I know the boss, Sakanashi.

267
00:50:30,643 --> 00:50:33,908
A gang member's sister.

268
00:50:35,181 --> 00:50:36,878
They were here before.

269
00:50:38,252 --> 00:50:40,083
What're you up to?

270
00:50:41,756 --> 00:50:43,417
I don't know anything.

271
00:50:45,259 --> 00:50:46,317
Tell me what!

272
00:50:46,428 --> 00:50:48,420
I don't know.

273
00:50:48,965 --> 00:50:50,762
I'll check.

274
00:50:50,867 --> 00:50:52,300
What?

275
00:50:52,402 --> 00:50:53,494
I'll check.

276
00:51:10,890 --> 00:51:13,621
Hurts. Don't underestimate me!

277
00:51:26,041 --> 00:51:27,167
What the hell!

278
00:51:32,381 --> 00:51:33,507
Pay for it.

279
00:51:49,401 --> 00:51:51,062
Good timing.

280
00:51:52,103 --> 00:51:54,663
Without you, he'd have killed me.

281
00:51:58,344 --> 00:52:01,473
It took time. How come?

282
00:52:06,520 --> 00:52:09,115
Are you with me?

283
00:52:11,792 --> 00:52:12,657
Hey.

284
00:52:13,596 --> 00:52:14,688
Shut up.

285
00:52:15,932 --> 00:52:18,423
What is it?

286
00:52:28,412 --> 00:52:31,644
Who is this idiot?
Is this social work?

287
00:52:47,634 --> 00:52:48,760
Gross.

288
00:53:16,833 --> 00:53:18,597
Did you watch "Prisoner 6"?

289
00:53:23,141 --> 00:53:26,771
No. 6 escaped to London.

290
00:53:26,878 --> 00:53:29,439
No.2 called... went to HQ.

291
00:53:29,583 --> 00:53:33,041
Title with rear view of Lotus.

292
00:53:33,153 --> 00:53:36,554
Parachuted from the plane.

293
00:53:36,656 --> 00:53:40,424
He couldn't leave
the village: Scary.

294
00:53:42,498 --> 00:53:43,726
I saw it.

295
00:53:43,832 --> 00:53:46,699
Really? You did?

296
00:53:46,901 --> 00:53:48,630
I saw them all.

297
00:53:49,271 --> 00:53:50,330
Damn.

298
00:53:51,575 --> 00:53:53,099
Leave now.

299
00:53:54,110 --> 00:53:55,941
Never mind. It's OK.

300
00:54:16,236 --> 00:54:17,828
What's inside?

301
00:54:18,838 --> 00:54:20,169
Never mind.

302
00:54:26,716 --> 00:54:28,775
Hey, I'll beat you!

303
00:54:28,884 --> 00:54:31,444
Hurts. Easy.

304
00:54:33,189 --> 00:54:34,656
Stop insisting!

305
00:54:54,614 --> 00:54:56,377
You didn't hurt me.

306
00:55:00,319 --> 00:55:01,753
You wanted to?

307
00:55:03,991 --> 00:55:05,481
Just pretending.

308
00:55:08,862 --> 00:55:09,988
I know.

309
00:55:10,931 --> 00:55:13,526
You just wanted to tease me.

310
00:55:19,809 --> 00:55:21,674
That was awful.

311
00:55:23,746 --> 00:55:25,873
You country bumpkins.

312
00:55:28,318 --> 00:55:30,377
Stop! What's wrong!

313
00:55:30,487 --> 00:55:32,648
Your mind is screwed up.

314
00:55:32,756 --> 00:55:36,193
No wonder they didn't
like you. Still...

315
00:55:36,861 --> 00:55:38,192
I see.

316
00:55:38,831 --> 00:55:39,661
Ouch.

317
00:55:39,965 --> 00:55:41,193
Why smile!

318
00:55:41,300 --> 00:55:43,768
Go outside to fight!

319
00:55:55,983 --> 00:55:57,314
What are you up to?

320
00:55:58,453 --> 00:56:00,012
Nothing to do with you.

321
00:56:00,223 --> 00:56:04,126
Not really. I was almost
killed 'cause of it.

322
00:56:04,695 --> 00:56:05,787
What?

323
00:56:06,495 --> 00:56:08,588
He tried to see it.

324
00:56:08,798 --> 00:56:10,390
I resisted.

325
00:56:10,499 --> 00:56:12,490
Why did he...

326
00:56:12,634 --> 00:56:16,230
Who cares. She's yakuza's sister.

327
00:56:18,041 --> 00:56:21,101
Why not say it earlier!

328
00:56:21,378 --> 00:56:23,939
It's my place!

329
00:56:26,951 --> 00:56:27,884
What!

330
00:56:29,422 --> 00:56:31,014
Making your face!

331
00:56:33,794 --> 00:56:35,785
Call police!

332
00:56:37,130 --> 00:56:40,498
You punk. Crazy!

333
00:56:55,352 --> 00:56:57,081
Damn. Don't snub me.

334
00:56:57,888 --> 00:56:58,877
My dad...

335
00:56:59,489 --> 00:57:00,615
Stop!

336
00:57:24,385 --> 00:57:25,409
Akihiko.

337
00:57:27,087 --> 00:57:28,146
Bring a rope.

338
00:58:10,471 --> 00:58:12,063
Stop!

339
00:58:12,874 --> 00:58:15,069
Ouch...

340
00:59:05,068 --> 00:59:07,229
You said you'd forgive me.

341
00:59:12,409 --> 00:59:14,877
No meaning.

342
00:59:17,281 --> 00:59:18,680
You mean...

343
00:59:19,850 --> 00:59:22,580
Bother you? You're chicken.

344
00:59:23,054 --> 00:59:24,146
What!

345
00:59:30,029 --> 00:59:31,257
Interesting.

346
00:59:31,364 --> 00:59:32,524
What?

347
00:59:33,599 --> 00:59:35,032
Revenge.

348
00:59:35,468 --> 00:59:36,901
What do you mean?

349
00:59:37,303 --> 00:59:39,135
Class reunion.

350
00:59:40,307 --> 00:59:42,799
I'll poison the juice.

351
00:59:44,446 --> 00:59:46,437
Beer sounds better.

352
00:59:47,516 --> 00:59:48,608
I mean it.

353
00:59:48,683 --> 00:59:50,515
He doesn't ask you to join.

354
00:59:51,319 --> 00:59:52,513
I decide.

355
00:59:53,857 --> 00:59:55,119
I won't ask you.

356
00:59:55,325 --> 00:59:56,349
Why not?

357
00:59:56,760 --> 00:59:57,818
Forgiveness.

358
00:59:57,929 --> 00:59:59,055
Why?

359
00:59:59,163 --> 01:00:01,358
Helped find my shorts.

360
01:00:01,465 --> 01:00:03,399
Not to see your ass.

361
01:00:03,500 --> 01:00:05,264
It's OK.

362
01:00:05,369 --> 01:00:06,495
I must join.

363
01:00:06,604 --> 01:00:07,093
No.

364
01:00:07,204 --> 01:00:08,102
I must go.

365
01:00:08,205 --> 01:00:10,230
You watch TV at home.

366
01:00:11,543 --> 01:00:14,069
See, hurts?

367
01:00:14,379 --> 01:00:17,212
You can't forgive me. Right?

368
01:00:18,418 --> 01:00:20,750
Look at your eyes.

369
01:00:22,022 --> 01:00:24,583
Coward.

370
01:00:24,692 --> 01:00:26,956
You mother fucker!

371
01:00:30,699 --> 01:00:31,631
Shut up!

372
01:00:32,501 --> 01:00:34,230
Fuck you!

373
01:00:34,336 --> 01:00:35,803
You're weak!

374
01:00:35,904 --> 01:00:36,997
What!

375
01:00:37,107 --> 01:00:40,406
Don't fight. Make him quiet.

376
01:00:40,510 --> 01:00:42,138
He drives me crazy.

377
01:00:42,279 --> 01:00:44,304
I'm no wimp!

378
01:00:44,414 --> 01:00:46,541
You're weaker than a woman.

379
01:00:48,219 --> 01:00:49,846
Hurts! Stop!

380
01:00:49,953 --> 01:00:51,853
Stop kicking me.

381
01:00:53,891 --> 01:00:55,449
Stop it!

382
01:01:45,285 --> 01:01:46,582
You...

383
01:01:57,599 --> 01:01:58,930
You!

384
01:02:39,512 --> 01:02:40,672
Dead?

385
01:02:50,058 --> 01:02:51,252
You killed them.

386
01:03:47,024 --> 01:03:50,585
Take a memorial picture.

387
01:04:18,559 --> 01:04:21,154
Smile.

388
01:04:21,697 --> 01:04:23,028
Memorial picture.

389
01:04:38,983 --> 01:04:40,917
Should've taken dad too.

390
01:04:45,924 --> 01:04:49,826
Take the picture
at the reunion also.

391
01:04:50,663 --> 01:04:52,426
After poisoning them.

392
01:05:10,520 --> 01:05:11,987
No good.

393
01:05:59,344 --> 01:06:01,710
Here they come.

394
01:06:06,417 --> 01:06:07,884
Hurry up!

395
01:06:26,807 --> 01:06:27,831
What the...

396
01:06:27,942 --> 01:06:30,137
Killed'em... ridiculed me.

397
01:06:46,263 --> 01:06:48,356
Let's go.

398
01:06:48,799 --> 01:06:49,731
And him?

399
01:06:49,834 --> 01:06:50,960
Never mind.

400
01:07:00,579 --> 01:07:02,240
It's yours.

401
01:07:02,982 --> 01:07:04,813
How come?

402
01:07:05,018 --> 01:07:06,076
Take it.

403
01:07:06,852 --> 01:07:09,584
Let's go together.

404
01:07:09,690 --> 01:07:10,884
To where?

405
01:07:24,007 --> 01:07:27,170
Q...Q...

406
01:07:29,378 --> 01:07:31,643
What's wrong!

407
01:07:32,082 --> 01:07:34,244
You kill her.

408
01:07:34,953 --> 01:07:36,944
Selfish bastard!

409
01:07:37,255 --> 01:07:41,282
So selfish. You can't
push only your way.

410
01:07:41,359 --> 01:07:43,520
She's poor by herself.

411
01:07:43,628 --> 01:07:47,087
It's your own cause. Bastard!

412
01:07:47,299 --> 01:07:48,391
Q...

413
01:07:50,903 --> 01:07:54,339
No, Q!

414
01:08:24,311 --> 01:08:26,074
Shoot if you can.

415
01:11:15,974 --> 01:11:18,704
Everything you need's
on the shelf.

416
01:11:19,578 --> 01:11:21,944
Please get rid of my things...

417
01:11:23,116 --> 01:11:25,881
I won't give you any trouble.

418
01:11:27,021 --> 01:11:31,117
Lonely, but it must
be better outside.

419
01:11:31,592 --> 01:11:32,752
Goodbye.

420
01:11:38,466 --> 01:11:39,933
To the restroom.

421
01:15:03,803 --> 01:15:06,601
"HELP ME"

422
01:16:08,710 --> 01:16:10,200
Did you find Q?

423
01:16:11,813 --> 01:16:12,802
Ride on it.

424
01:16:13,849 --> 01:16:16,648
My ass hurts.

425
01:16:49,457 --> 01:16:50,651
Let's go together.

426
01:16:52,428 --> 01:16:53,656
How about that?

427
01:16:54,594 --> 01:16:56,152
Leave it.

428
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:58,424
That's right.
