1
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
How did it all begin?

2
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:43,900
How did it begin?

3
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,500
I can't remember anymore.

4
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:50,200
I think I wanted a cup of tea.

5
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:54,700
Yes, tea. That's it, of course.

6
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:58,000
After all,
what Russian doesn't drink tea.

7
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:00,700
I am getting off the topic,
off the topic.

8
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:04,400
So, I decided to drink some tea.

9
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:06,750
Yes, I took the cup.

10
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:11,000
And suddenly, I felt as though a veil
slipped away from my eyes,

11
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:15,500
as though someone uttered inside me,
but this is the beginning of Last Judgment.

12
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,800
Judgment, God's Judgment.

13
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:23,100
Even the elders of the church say that
all trials of history are God's judgment.

14
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:25,500
That is the truth.

15
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
It looks like it has begun.

16
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:32,800
It's thundered.
The hour has come.

17
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:37,500
A fiery sword is forged over our land.

18
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,800
And time is running out
as though nothing ever was.

19
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:45,800
The past stands before open doors,
demanding justice.

20
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,500
It looks like God's judgment
has arrived, atheist gentlement.

21
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,900
The perils of Russian land
are finally here for you.

22
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:54,400
Here it is!

23
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:56,800
The brooding judge is distressing hearts.

24
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:59,400
History's secrets are reaching
their zenith.

25
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,500
Forgive us, the damned, our Lord.

26
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:05,400
Absolve us of the judgment
reigning over our land.

27
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:09,500
Show our crippled souls the path to salvation.
My lord, my lord.

28
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:15,900
Victor Mihailov

29
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:21,600
Aleksandr Ilin

30
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:29,800
Konstantin Lopushansky

31
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:41,100
RUSSIAN SYMPHONY

32
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
And it has begun after all.
Yes, it has begun.

33
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:58,900
The great war is here.

34
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,300
God. God and Devil are battling.

35
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,500
And who will triumph, only God knows.

36
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:11,100
It cannot be guessed.

37
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,600
It cannot be guessed.

38
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:17,000
Here's a question.

39
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:22,500
How? How can a sinner's soul
find redemtion before God's judgment?

40
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,200
With what deed? With what word?

41
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,400
Ah, if only I could know this.

42
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:39,200
Yes, war,
war is waging.

43
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,800
Only its fate can not be foreseen.

44
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:45,700
No. It can't be done.

45
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,900
This war is blind.

46
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,300
It is in the darkness of the human soul.

47
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,600
But what lies in those shadows?

48
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,000
What is there?

49
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,700
I better sit down.
May I?

50
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,500
I am listening.

51
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,200
I don't understand anything.

52
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I don't understand anything.
Are you ill?

53
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,800
But, but, why aren't you saying anything?

54
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,600
You see,

55
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I must

56
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:54,100
say this out loud.

57
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:58,900
It's hard to begin

58
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,400
Just a second,
I'll gather my thoughts.

59
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,800
What is it?
Speak.

60
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:11,500
I, forgot about the children.

61
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:12,500
What?

62
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,700
I am sitting in room.

63
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,500
And then what?

64
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,500
I wanted to drink some tea.

65
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,800
And suddenly, it hit me
like an electric shock.

66
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:25,000
What about the children, ah?

67
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,000
But what children?

68
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,600
From the orphanage,
orphans, children without parents.

69
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,300
So what?

70
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,100
Let's say I am the principal
of the orphanage?

71
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,500
You, a principle?
Just look at that!

72
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,300
Ah, but that's not important!

73
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,400
Wait, wait, how is that not important?

74
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,000
Something else is important here,
which is that I, a Russian intellectual.

75
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,500
Who, who?

76
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
How do they say, a successor of
Tolstoy, Dostoyevsky. And What?

77
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,500
Ah, just look at this, look at him!

78
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
And what I am doing?
Why am I sitting here?

79
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,500
I must save the children.
You must understand.

80
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
They will drown. They can't swim.
They will drown!

81
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,500
But what do you want from us!
What do you want?

82
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,200
Calm down, please, calm down, go.

83
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,900
What scum. The thought came so
suddenly, what about the children?

84
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I forgot about them.
I am sitting here instead.

85
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:13,700
You know what?

86
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:15,000
No.

87
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:18,500
What scum I am.

88
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,800
Just look at him, mom?
Just look at him!

89
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,500
Scum, scum, scum.

90
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:30,600
Scum.

91
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,800
What scum I am.

92
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:37,000
You forgot about the children, eh?

93
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,800
Scum.

94
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Scum, scum.

95
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Just wait, just wait.

96
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
But he's making it all up!

97
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,400
Just look!

98
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,900
He's playing with us!

99
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:03,000
His eyes are dry, he's not crying at all.

100
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Why aren't you crying then? Why?

101
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,200
Why is he hiding his face in shadows?
Why are you hiding your face
in the shadow?

102
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,500
He's not looking at me,
because he's lying. I can tell.

103
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:12,300
He made it all up.

104
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:15,000
Found himself an audience of idiots,
he's hanging noodles over our ears!

105
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,000
Strange, this is quite strange.

106
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:20,500
Aaa, it's just a role he's made up.
Of course!

107
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Aaa, aww, he's saving little children.

108
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,500
Aww, excuse me, but you know,
it's all so unrealistic.
Of course, it's unrealistic!

109
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:31,000
Excuse me of course.
Don't apologize before this cretin.

110
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,900
Shame on you, came in and sat down!
Get out of here!

111
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Yes, yes. Get out of here, fool.
You'll get yours!
Why'd you shut up? Why'd you shut up?

112
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,500
There is no kidness in you.
There is no kindness.

113
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,500
No kindness, none!

114
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,000
Get out of here, we said!

115
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:52,000
What are you up to?
What are you doing?

116
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,500
God sees all!
Knows all!

117
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Get out of here! You are scaring us!
There are children here.

118
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,500
People!

119
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
People!

120
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,500
Just look at him, He's completely trashed.
A drunk. Just go! Get out! You'll end up in jail!

121
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Get away, get out, you creep, we said!

122
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,500
What are doing now? Let go of the closet!
People!

123
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Leave me alone,
I need your closet.

124
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Will someone help us already? Please!

125
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,800
What's going on there?

126
00:08:32,410 --> 00:08:35,500
Can't you see we need help.
He's taking our closet!
Mazayev is taking the closet!

127
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:38,800
Devil knows what's going on.

128
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,400
Probably only a drunk neighbor.

129
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,500
I think I was dreaming,

130
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,900
I dreamt of a church,
what does it mean?

131
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:50,000
Go to sleep.

132
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,500
It's not my face.

133
00:08:59,000 --> 00:08:59,600
Borisovich?

134
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,000
What?

135
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,500
I found an oar here.

136
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:08,500
Come here.

137
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,500
What? Look here.
Look in the mirror.

138
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:15,500
The face.
It's not mine, right?

139
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,000
What wrong with it?

140
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,200
Looks the same to me.

141
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,400
The voice, the voice is mine.
The expression is mine.

142
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,000
But the face,

143
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
the face isn't mine.
It seems not mine.

144
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:29,500
You did lose a little weight.
What are you worrying about?

145
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,600
I found an oar. Look!

146
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:34,100
Come on.

147
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:36,700
Come on, hold this, let's go.

148
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,600
Just like this.
Perfect.

149
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,800
And now we'll sail.

150
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,500
"The face is not mine," haha.

151
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,500
Come on. Take the oar.

152
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Dear Lord, what are they doing?

153
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:10,500
My god, but what will
become of them?

154
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Let's go, go, come on!

155
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,500
May God be with you, Borisovich.

156
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:29,100
You should, you hear me?

157
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Navigate towards the main square.
Why?

158
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,800
There is less water there.

159
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:51,000
Valentina Ivanovna. Get ready, children.
Come, get ready, faster.

160
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,500
Valentina Ivanovich, there's some tall
man there, he opened the attic,

161
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:57,800
he's taking command, where did
he come from, what is he doing here?

162
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:58,500
I don't know. I don't know.

163
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:01,500
What does that mean?
Anyone can just come from the street
and start taking command?

164
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,500
But that's Ivan Sergeyevich Mozayev,
I know him, he lives in my building.

165
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
He's a little eccentric, but overall,
he is probably nice.

166
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:09,500
What do you mean by eccentric?
Is he a lunatic or something?

167
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:11,200
Why should he be crazy?
Why attack me?

168
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:17,000
I also don't what he's doing here.
Mozarev, where'd he come from,
I don't understand.

169
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,300
Maybe he just wants to help?

170
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:20,500
What he does he want to help with?

171
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:21,500
With what means?

172
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Everyone, to the third floor.

173
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,000
If necessary, go to the attic.
All doors are unlocked.

174
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,900
It's children, after all.
They must send a helicopter, or boat.

175
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,500
Allo, allo, miss,
don't hang up, miss!

176
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,000
I am calling from the orphanage, yes.

177
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,100
Street Poklonnaya 25.

178
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:19,500
Miss, please connect us to...
al, allo?

179
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,500
Let me try.

180
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
There is no point in calling.
We must go there.

181
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,500
Come on, let's go.

182
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,500
Is he actually sleeping?

183
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,500
Let's wake him.
Ivan Sergeyevich.

184
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Ivan Sergeyevich.
Ivan Sergeyevich.

185
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:13,500
Did we wake you? Forgive us.

186
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Did you reach them?

187
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:19,500
No, there is no point in calling.
You must go there.

188
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,900
Only don't get upset with us.

189
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:25,000
We've been thinking,
only don't get upset with us.

190
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,500
What's there to be upset about.
Basically, we need to rehearse

191
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:30,000
your trip to the city.
You understand?

192
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,600
You see, you are a soft,
intelligent man.

193
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:35,500
You'll arrive to there and ask for a boat,
and they'll say no.

194
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,000
Why would they say no?

195
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Because they won't understand,
You need to make them understand.

196
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,900
You have to twist their hearts,
twist their hearts, you understand!

197
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
These are only children.
The children are dying!

198
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,500
Basically, let's go. I will teach you.
Everything will work out.

199
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Let's go.

200
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,500
It must work, most definitely.

201
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
You will see. I will teach you.

202
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,900
What are you standing there for?
Come in, come in.

203
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,800
Nina Stepanovna, sit down,
you are going to play Vozduhina.

204
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:07,250
Nina Stepanonva,
you are Vozduhina.

205
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:11,500
So, imagine you came in.

206
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
What do you need to say?
Think of some poetry!*

207
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:19,000
Let's try this. There, you came in.
I came in.

208
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,800
And then you must say what?
One second.

209
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:27,500
I...
Look there at Nina Stepanovna, please.

210
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I, I've arrived from the orphanage.

211
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,000
There's water there.

212
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
It flooded everything.

213
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,900
Katya, I can't do this.
This isn't acceptable.

214
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,800
I can't do this! I am not an actor,
I am not actor, can you understand that?

215
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:47,900
What are you talking about? What actor?
I must feel your worry, your despair.

216
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:50,600
You must have tears in your eyes.
Courageous tears.

217
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:54,300
Eat this to make tears.
It's onion.

218
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:57,500
Eat, eat.
It's an excellent method.

219
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,500
Let's see. Very good.

220
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,800
Let's try again. Calmly this time.

221
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
So, suppose, you came in.

222
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,900
There, you came out of water.

223
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,900
You are all wet and dripping.

224
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,800
You are all wet,
there is despair in your eyes.

225
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:17,000
Because you understand that
there's little time left,

226
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:21,300
The children are sitting on the roof,
and you, everything depends on

227
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,500
Give us a motor boat!

228
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,500
The children,
the children are dying.

229
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Yes, yes, very good.

230
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
It's great!
Of course, it's very good!

231
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,500
Finally, we got it to work,
it's great: we need a motor boat!

232
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:42,000
If he can do this again,
then success is ensured.

233
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Surely. It certainly is.

234
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:50,500
Excuse me.

235
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:53,200
It's time to go.
The water has risen significantly.
And there's no time.

236
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:53,900
Yes, yes.

237
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
I am telling him that
there is no time.

238
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:00,000
I am saying
there is no time.

239
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,500
There's no time at all.

240
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Let me through!

241
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:51,100
It's about the children.

242
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,600
What are you doing?

243
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:57,100
I am here about the children.

244
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,200
Get up, come on, get up.

245
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Your hands!
Take your hands off!

246
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,500
What are you doing!

247
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Let me go, let me go!

248
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,500
Run, run!

249
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:07,800
Where's the car?

250
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,200
I called twice.

251
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,900
Run there instead of calling.

252
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:23,100
Comrade Vozduhina,
comrade Vozduhina, one minute please!

253
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:26,400
Forgive me if this is not the time,
but I can't wait any longer.

254
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,000
Children dying are dying there.

255
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,500
Comrade, do you understand Russian?

256
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,500
We don't have anything.
No boats, no cabbage soup.
I can offer rations for soap.

257
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:36,400
No, I don't need rations.

258
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,500
We need a motor boat, a boat,
something like that!

259
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:44,900
Measure me. We'll do a
measurement. Then we can talk.

260
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:50,950
General Potapov,
where is the detachment?

261
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,000
They've departed.
They will be there before us.

262
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:06,500
And what is that? Without pants?
Hahaha.

263
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,500
It's a new form of dressing,

264
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,500
given these circumstances.

265
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:14,500
Since there's water everywhere,
and the pants, they get wet.

266
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:18,500
That's not neat.
I've imposed a new dress code.

267
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:23,000
If you have any objections,
I can suspend it.

268
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:27,500
Colonial uniform.
Americans wear shorts in such cases.

269
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:31,000
That's what I wrote in regulations:
shorts. But where do we get them?

270
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:32,100
We've only got one pair*

271
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:35,500
Should have put those on then.
Let's get out of here.

272
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,500
Comrade Vozduhina, comrade Vozduhina!

273
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,500
What about the children?

274
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,800
What should I do with the orphanage?

275
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Maybe send a helicopter there?

276
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,450
That's possible, maybe.

277
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:58,900
Do we have time?

278
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:01,400
Comrade Glugin.
Yes?

279
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,500
We should help the orphanage.

280
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
A helicopter is needed.
We don't have any helicopters.

281
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,500
Why are you always hiding behind the hat?

282
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,500
What's wrong with you face, ah?

283
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:18,500
I am ill.
I've got an infection.

284
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,500
I can't without a hat,
it's the disease, I am sorry.

285
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,500
Hm, looks sober.

286
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
One will go mad with you lot here.

287
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:53,100
Where do you think you are going?

288
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,500
Back up. Go back.

289
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:57,500
I am telling you to back off,
your damn mother.

290
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Valentine Ivanovna,
They are swarming in!
They are swarming!

291
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:07,500
I can't take it anymore.
I can't. Get air foce, artillery.
Call them.

292
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
What the hell is going on there?

293
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Lieutenant, this way.

294
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:30,500
Where?

295
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:31,600
There.

296
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,500
The dead.

297
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,500
Yes, them.

298
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,500
It can't be anyone else.

299
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Go to the graves of your brothers.
Come through, don't stand there.

300
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:07,500
Grab the shovels and pass through here.
Free the entrance.

301
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Make way. Step aside.

302
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:14,500
Grab the shovels and pass through here.
for the graves of our brothers.

303
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,000
A terrible thought.

304
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:50,900
Yes.

305
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,800
See how man is saved with lies,
and not with sincerity.

306
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:01,000
If he lies well, and pretends well.
Look, he's righteous already.

307
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:03,000
He's dodged the judgment.

308
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:05,600
Yes.

309
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:08,000
You open your eyes,
you look around,

310
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:10,000
and then you are overcome with nausea.

311
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:14,200
It's like they're all scheming together,
hushing up he most important thing,

312
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,300
as though it doesn't exist.

313
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:17,500
God's judgment!

314
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:21,400
They talk of everything else,
as though it's some kind of a game.

315
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:24,200
And they're all winking at each other,

316
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,000
snickering together.

317
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
It's as if it's all make-belief.

318
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Like there is not going to be a
judgment, only pretense,

319
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:33,000
a universal bravado.

320
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,500
Here's a question.

321
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Could it be possible that all these
are devil's minions? Could it be?

322
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:43,500
It is not possible.

323
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:46,500
And then what? What?

324
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,500
double vision, everything is
slipping from my hands,

325
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:53,500
as though through my...
I can't capture the essence.

326
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:56,500
Here is this face.

327
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Yes.
There's something demonic there.

328
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:02,000
This is not my face.

329
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:04,500
What's going on here?

330
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
It's open, I said.

331
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:38,500
Excuse me.

332
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
I heard you had a typewriter.

333
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:43,100
So?

334
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,200
Are you a writer?

335
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,400
Yes, I am writer.
What about you? What do you want?

336
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
You see, you see, I came here to

337
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:53,500
And what do you want? Haha.

338
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
He should be thrown into
the Volga river.

339
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:58,500
Look, with his iron ships*

340
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:00,800
I traveled here about...
about...

341
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
about the children.

342
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:05,100
I don't have any.

343
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,600
I need to write a claim,
and I am not taking no for an answer.

344
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
What is he drunk?
You are the drunk!

345
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:13,500
No. I am sober. Sober.

346
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
I just need to write a claim.
To whom?

347
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:18,500
To Vozduhina.
To Vozduhina? Come in then.

348
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
But only for a minute,
only to file a claim.

349
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
There we go, I,

350
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
as a Russian intellectual,

351
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:47,200
as they say, a successor of

352
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:51,700
of Tolstoy, Dostoyevski.

353
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:56,500
For a second day in a row,
I am stuck in a hotel,

354
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:02,000
because of the terrible Last Judgment,

355
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:08,000
I presently have no means
of transportation.

356
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
And, I, uh,

357
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:18,500
Excuse me. Yes, but if...
the current forces of nature,

358
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:24,900
- they think writing is easy
...do indeed have a rational explanation,

359
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:27,500
then why not evacuate the children,
I ask?

360
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,000
Because, just one second.

361
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:32,100
Let me think.

362
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:35,500
Aren't you ashamed?

363
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:37,500
What?
I am asking you, aren't you ashamed?

364
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Sanya, calm down, Sanya.
Just wait, let me talk!

365
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:46,500
I am saying, aren't you ashamed?

366
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Disgrace!

367
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:51,500
What is he talking about?

368
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,700
Sanya, have a bite.
Wait, I said.

369
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:57,800
Tolstoy wrote before you,
Chekhov wrote, and you just
called yourself their successor!

370
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,000
And what's here?

371
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,900
How are you expressing yourself?

372
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:07,200
Pfu, such conservatism.
Throw the paper out.

373
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:08,200
What are you yelling at me for?

374
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,000
Throw out, I said,
I can't tolerate this.

375
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:12,500
He's right, a different approach
- Roaring in here!

376
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:16,400
I simply,

377
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:19,900
nothing's coming into my head,

378
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,500
what's important is that

379
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,200
they give us a motor boat.

380
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,200
Boat - shmoat!

381
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:30,000
Alma Mater!
Go, look outside.

382
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:32,100
Sanya, have a sip.
Will you just wait, Yura.

383
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:38,600
What did you start with?

384
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,700
I am asking, what did you start with?

385
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,500
Come on, remember!
Platonov begins with

386
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,500
slicing up kielbasa on his
wife's grave!

387
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:51,000
That's a beginning!

388
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:52,800
And what's with you?

389
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:55,300
Successor?
*

390
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,800
Sanya, leave him,
let him write as he wants.

391
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:09,000
Let's try again.

392
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:12,500
It really does need to be written
somehow differently.

393
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:16,300
The important thing is to
get to the point.

394
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:18,300
To the point, or no one will bother
reading it.

395
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:22,300
I understand, but this needs
something, a phrase of some kind.

396
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:26,300
You should start by describing nature.

397
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:28,800
What, what?

398
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,710
Yes, that's right. It's in the
tradition of Russian literature.

399
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:33,210
Wait, I said!
What, you are starting again!

400
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:36,500
What kind of foolishness is this,
moron!

401
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:38,210
Me? A moron!
What are you blabbing about?

402
00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:40,710
What nature, what nature?
Why are you slandering me?

403
00:28:41,210 --> 00:28:43,210
What does nature have to do with it?

404
00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:46,000
Character!
You need a character!

405
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:47,200
There!

406
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:52,500
Children, right?

407
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:55,500
What kind?

408
00:28:56,500 --> 00:29:00,000
I must be able to see them,
immediately, understand?

409
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:09,500
Yes, you are right.

410
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Of course, how else could it be?

411
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:21,500
I... I... will.... one minute...

412
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Let's drink a little.

413
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
The children.

414
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:03,900
The children, the children.

415
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:16,500
The children, the children.

416
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:34,500
The children.

417
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
These are such children,

418
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:43,500
these are special children,

419
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:46,000
they are, they are different,

420
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:50,500
There's one, they burned his mother.

421
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:55,800
Another one, they killed his
entire  family in front of him.

422
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:02,500
They have peculiar personalities.

423
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:06,800
Basically, they mentally disturbed.

424
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:09,300
They don't even want to live!

425
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:12,000
That's the whole problem.

426
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:18,800
And we don't even yet know
how to cure them.

427
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:23,000
There is no medicine for them.

428
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,800
But this doesn't upset anyone.

429
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:37,800
You.

430
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:43,300
Hiding such talent!
- Do you know what you have in your hands?

431
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:46,100
What horror!
This is great material!

432
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:50,300
This is priceless,
any publishing house will pick this up!

433
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,200
You'll be a millionaire!

434
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:57,500
Hiding such talent!
About this, I'd even write myself,
here, right now!

435
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
Come here, come here,
pour him a drink!

436
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:03,500
Come on. Let's drink.

437
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:07,800
Aaaahh.
What? What?

438
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,500
A snake,
a green snake!

439
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:12,000
Where, where?
There it is, there it is!
There, there, there, there!

440
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:16,500
A joke.
Don't you get it!

441
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
What a bitch!
Hahaha.

442
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:21,900
A joke!
That's all it is!

443
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:31,500
What a pig!

444
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:33,500
Condemn everybody!

445
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Condemn everybody!

446
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:00,500
And what are you standing for here,
scum!

447
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Comrades, I am a married man.

448
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:35,900
Corvalol. Corvalol!
Where is Corvavol?

449
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
You've got nothing here!

450
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:42,200
Allo, speak louder.

451
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,500
Get undressed, Valentina Ivanovna.
Undress. - Got to hell!

452
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:49,500
Corvalol, give me Corvalol!

453
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,000
Here, here's Corvalol,
Valentina Ivanovna, drink this.

454
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:55,500
Speak louder.
Thank you.

455
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes.

456
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:04,500
Hello Valentina Ivanovna,
perhaps this isn't the right time,

457
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,500
but I've got my typewritten report here,

458
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:08,500
about the children.

459
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Not the right time?
Not the right time!

460
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,500
What, are you blind?

461
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
Come on, don't delay.

462
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:26,500
Take it, take it, scum, take it.
Bastards, scum, take it.

463
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Excuse me, I'll come back later.

464
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,500
Dear comrades, I welcome our artillery!

465
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:41,100
Cry, Valentina Ivanovna.

466
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:44,000
I can't, I won't go there.

467
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,700
Cry, I already taught you how to do it.

468
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,500
I can't.

469
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:53,500
They'll rip you apart otherwise.
I am commanding you,  go out there, go.

470
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:15,500
Don't judge and you won't be judged.

471
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:17,800
That's what's written!

472
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,000
Where is it written?

473
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,000
You don't know, you don't know?

474
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:48,000
You see, you see, they themselves
are setting everything on fire!

475
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:53,000
That's what I saw,
and they keep screaming too.

476
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
I saw it with my own eyes.

477
00:35:58,250 --> 00:36:00,700
I saw it all myself.
I saw it myself.

478
00:36:00,625 --> 00:36:02,125
Just look, you see, there, there.

479
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:04,500
Calm down, women, quiet, quiet.

480
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:07,400
I've got nothing to repent for.

481
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:09,500
I am guilty of nothing!

482
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
You're right, man.
We've got nothing to repent for.

483
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:14,500
We're simple people.

484
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:17,000
Let's go, let's go,
let's go have a drink.

485
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:20,500
The dishes are broken.

486
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,500
Come here, we've got something
to drink.

487
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:28,000
Hold this.

488
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
There you go, swamp monster,

489
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Come on, give me,
I can't wait so much.

490
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:57,000
Want some?
No, I don't.

491
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:01,900
Why are you sulking?

492
00:37:02,750 --> 00:37:06,750
Devil's gossipers,
always cleaning up after you.

493
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:11,400
Found yourself a gathering spot! Pigs.
I'll go and tell your wife on you!

494
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:13,500
What are they doing? What are
they thinking? What a nightmare.

495
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:16,800
What I am saying is,

496
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:20,000
the factory is burning, right?

497
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:23,500
They can't extinguish the fire
for a week already.

498
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:25,600
It just keeps burning and burning.

499
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:29,000
And nobody is putting it out anyway,
who'd want to climb into the fire!

500
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:32,500
Precisely! And the water?
The water?

501
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:35,500
Well, there can be
different scenarios.

502
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,000
For instance,
maybe a dam burst?
And why not?

503
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:43,500
You know how they build them?
They build them on snot!

504
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
What I am getting at is

505
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:49,500
all these conversations
about God's wrath,

506
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
we still have to see about that.

507
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:55,500
Maybe, as they say,
it's all hogwash.

508
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,400
Well, actually, actually,
- that's what I say,

509
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:59,500
well, actually, we believe in God.

510
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,500
Don't think otherwise.
Everything is as it should be.

511
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:05,000
that's a given,
nobody's arguing with that,
Nobody is disagreeing with that,

512
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:08,500
but something is amiss here,
you understand?

513
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,500
What's wrong with him?
Feeling nauseous?

514
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:16,000
***

515
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:18,800
I must say this,

516
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:20,900
I know, I feel,

517
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:24,100
I must say,

518
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:27,000
What's wrong with him?

519
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:36,000
I feel - Eh, people, be quite!
I must say - he wants to speak!

520
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:39,180
Quiet, someone is going to speak.

521
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:42,500
Here is
- Be quiet.

522
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:45,500
a man

523
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
he lives

524
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:50,500
and life passes

525
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:53,500
and that's it.

526
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:58,100
But what good have I seen
in my entire life?

527
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
And that's how every one of us is,

528
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:03,500
and then they talk of happiness.

529
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,500
And what is happiness,
has anybody seen it?

530
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:12,500
Indeed, indeed,
in India and Tibet, they say that

531
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:14,900
life of a man is but a dream.

532
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,300
But that's not really the point.

533
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:22,500
What's important is, first reason
being what?

534
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:25,000
What was in the beginning?

535
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:27,500
A consciousness.

536
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,800
Or Matter?

537
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:33,500
The spirit of the world

538
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:36,800
is imprisoned by earthly flesh,

539
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,800
or maybe the sin of Atlantis,

540
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:45,700
for we are the fallen ones.

541
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
Yes.

542
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:53,800
The earth is cursed because of mankind.

543
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:55,300
But you,

544
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:57,500
but I,

545
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,900
Maybe I learned something special
about myself,

546
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:04,500
something so special.

547
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,500
You think I called an old lady?

548
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:09,500
No.

549
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:11,600
I am worse.

550
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:14,800
I ate a little onion.

551
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:17,100
An onion.

552
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:19,100
To make little tears.

553
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:22,800
To speak of the little children,

554
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:24,300
with a look of pity.

555
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:27,500
Because without the onion

556
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,500
no such pity exists.

557
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:33,500
I don't feel it.

558
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:35,700
I don't pity.

559
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,200
My mind understands it,

560
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,400
but my heart does not.

561
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:45,400
What is happening here,
comrades?

562
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:48,400
Children are drowning there.

563
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,200
Unwanted orphans,

564
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,500
and we're drinking beer here!

565
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,500
Chasing it down with fish, eh?

566
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:02,800
Here it is, the seal.

567
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
And they dare call our
people god-bearers.

568
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,000
What now?

569
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
Little god-bearing men,

570
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:19,800
Dostoevskies!

571
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:25,500
Too weak to get a motor boat,
to save the children?

572
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:28,700
Too weak.

573
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:38,500
Too weak.

574
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:40,900
But of course,

575
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:47,000
We all come out from
Gogol's 'Overcoat'.

576
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,000
What of the overcoat though,

577
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:01,000
what of the overcoat,
ah!

578
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:05,000
Play! Play merrier!

579
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:02,500
What's wrong with you,
calm down.

580
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
Can't you see he is ill?

581
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:09,500
Calm down, everything's fine,
calm down, it's ok.

582
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,200
Do you need help?

583
00:44:21,410 --> 00:44:23,080
What's wrong with you?

584
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:26,200
Who are you here to see?

585
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:28,800
You live here?

586
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
Who are you?

587
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:34,500
We are refugees.

588
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:41,500
Is he deranged or something?

589
00:44:41,900 --> 00:44:42,800
I don't know.

590
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:48,800
That's enough.

591
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:51,900
Who is that?
Who's there?

592
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,600
Georgi? Georgi?

593
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:56,400
Who just came in?
Georgi?

594
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,400
Don't push him, don't push him.

595
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:01,200
Who are you looking for?

596
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:03,600
What's the problem?

597
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:06,200
That's what I thought.

598
00:45:09,900 --> 00:45:11,400
That's what I thought.

599
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:20,400
Who is he?

600
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,800
How am I supposed to know?
Ask him.

601
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,500
Excuse me, but
what exactly do you want?

602
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,800
I came here to mourn.

603
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,600
I must see it all.

604
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:43,900
A mourner?
Yes.

605
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:47,500
Excuse me please, are you from
the paper? A writer?

606
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:51,800
I, I, I don't know,

607
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,600
I came here to mourn.

608
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,000
Please excuse me,

609
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:18,200
please get comfortable here,
in this room, it's a mess in there.

610
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:20,000
Yes, it's a mess in there.

611
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:25,500
What difference does it make to me?
Understand that I must mourn. I must.

612
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,500
Must mourn. My soul is aching,
understand?

613
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,000
Just stay there.
Very well.

614
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:34,000
Georgi, show your drawings
to this man, go ahead.

615
00:46:34,100 --> 00:46:36,100
What's there to show?
- Calm down.

616
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:38,600
How many times do I have to repeat
myself? - Calm down, calm down.

617
00:46:38,700 --> 00:46:40,700
Just look at these drawings,

618
00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:42,900
what a talented boy,

619
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:45,400
you see, just look.

620
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:47,600
And this one, look how good it is.

621
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:51,000
Alik, Alik come and play.

622
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:54,500
Come on, take the cello, Alik,

623
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:55,500
get up, get up.

624
00:46:56,700 --> 00:46:57,900
Only my hand still hurts.

625
00:46:58,200 --> 00:47:01,200
- Your pain is long gone!
- I threw a grenade.

626
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:02,000
Sit down, sit down.

627
00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:06,900
Come on and play.
- A shard wounded me. Look.

628
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,800
He keeps telling everyone this story,
I am already sick of it.

629
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:11,600
Such a bum. He'll do anything to
avoid school work.

630
00:48:16,900 --> 00:48:19,900
Attention, attention.
Step through, step through.

631
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,400
Try touching the clothing.

632
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:55,800
There was a man here before you.

633
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,500
He remembered who he was in
his previous life,

634
00:48:58,600 --> 00:49:00,700
through these curtains.

635
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:04,000
I feel it through hair,

636
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:05,500
I was braiding my hair,

637
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:09,700
and I remembered,
that in my previous life,

638
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,200
I was a university student.

639
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:14,500
They killed me.
A civilian.

640
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,000
That's it.

641
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:25,500
One, two, three, four...

642
00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:36,500
Buttons.

643
00:49:37,900 --> 00:49:39,500
The buttons were different.

644
00:49:41,500 --> 00:49:42,500
Yes.

645
00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:46,500
Try on one dress,
it's hanging there.

646
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:49,400
A scarf or a sash is essential.

647
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:51,200
That white one?
Yes.

648
00:49:56,200 --> 00:49:57,200
The moon.

649
00:50:01,100 --> 00:50:02,200
The moon.

650
00:50:06,900 --> 00:50:07,900
The moon.

651
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:17,000
Lilacs.

652
00:50:19,300 --> 00:50:21,800
I ate lilacs, gentlemen.

653
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,200
I searched for happiness
in lilacs.

654
00:50:24,100 --> 00:50:26,100
For that, you must eat

655
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:28,800
a flower with five petals,
I...

656
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:34,600
I lived along the Volga river,
gentlemen,

657
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:37,500
I lived in Samara.

658
00:50:40,500 --> 00:50:41,900
I was happy.

659
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:44,900
I was loved.

660
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,400
Excuse me, gentlemen,

661
00:50:54,500 --> 00:50:55,500
I am feeling ill.

662
00:50:55,600 --> 00:50:57,500
I am not well.

663
00:50:59,500 --> 00:51:00,500
There's something wrong with my face,

664
00:51:01,900 --> 00:51:03,200
it's not my face.

665
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:07,000
I don't understand what's
wrong with me, I,

666
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:09,400
Excuse me.

667
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:11,500
Gentlemen!

668
00:51:11,800 --> 00:51:13,800
Gentlemen, what's wrong?

669
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,500
Let's drink champagne.

670
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,000
Black wine.

671
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:22,800
Black wine.

672
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:25,500
White snow,

673
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
White snow,
Black wine, gentlemen.

674
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:30,500
Black wine.
Gentlemen, black wine.

675
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
White Snow. Taste it.
Taste the black wine.

676
00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:35,500
Black wine, black wine,
gentlemen, drink.

677
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
Excuse me, for God's sake,
let me through.

678
00:51:44,500 --> 00:51:45,500
Gentlemen.

679
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
Gentlemen.

680
00:51:51,500 --> 00:51:52,800
Listen, gentlemen.

681
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,500
But this is Andrey Bely.
Yes, look, an identifical face.

682
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,500
It's Andrey Bely.
Astonishing.

683
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
People, let's pray.

684
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:16,000
We stand on the brink of history,

685
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:21,000
We're the children of a universal
epilogue, gentlemen.

686
00:52:21,500 --> 00:52:23,000
Hear me out.

687
00:52:30,500 --> 00:52:32,900
History has ended.

688
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:36,900
Gentlemen!

689
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:46,000
A candle was burning on a table,
a candle was burning.

690
00:52:53,500 --> 00:52:56,200
Yes, snow in July,

691
00:52:58,500 --> 00:52:59,500
abandoned trains,

692
00:53:01,800 --> 00:54:02,500
It's that they want to look inside!

693
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,500
trains,

694
00:53:05,500 --> 00:53:08,200
blood on white snow,

695
00:53:11,500 --> 00:53:14,500
Russia is soaked in blood.

696
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,400
That's how it is.
I understand.

697
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:26,000
I do have a question.

698
00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:36,500
Why did every one of our native
old-believers illustrate apocalypses, eh?

699
00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:42,500
Why always draw abyss?

700
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,300
Surely, there is always a gloomy abyss,

701
00:53:47,900 --> 00:53:49,900
on the brink.

702
00:53:50,200 --> 00:53:52,500
Understand?
On the brink.

703
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:56,000
Step away, miserable man,
you'll fall, you see.

704
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
No, that's not the dilemma.

705
00:54:02,500 --> 00:54:04,500
But apocalypse is there.

706
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:06,600
There God and Devil are waging war,

707
00:54:06,700 --> 00:54:09,800
for that beauty which could
supposedly save the world.

708
00:54:09,900 --> 00:54:11,700
It won't save a squat.

709
00:54:12,900 --> 00:54:14,900
And about what's said,

710
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:18,400
One hundred forty thousand will be saved
at the terrible tribunal of penance,

711
00:54:18,900 --> 00:54:19,900
that's it.

712
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:26,200
And that's counting entire history.

713
00:54:27,500 --> 00:54:30,800
From the clan of Israel,
that is what's written, right?

714
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:34,600
And maybe from Israel, I don't
remember that part, so I won't argue.

715
00:54:41,500 --> 00:54:42,500
Actually,

716
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:45,500
what I came here for is,

717
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:48,000
You see, Vanya,

718
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:52,000
I can't sleep, I keep thinking
of those children.

719
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:56,500
I was deeply touched, Vanya.

720
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,500
So deeply, so deeply,

721
00:54:59,500 --> 00:55:00,500
to the core.

722
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:07,000
To the very core of the Russian soul,
even deeper than that.

723
00:55:12,500 --> 00:55:15,700
Just thought of a scenario,
for a novel.

724
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
If all the little ones of the world,

725
00:55:21,500 --> 00:55:24,500
the abandoned, innocent children

726
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
don't want to live,

727
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,500
then who will multiple?*

728
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:38,000
In the morning, Vanya,
I surged up like a scolded man.

729
00:55:38,500 --> 00:55:41,500
I wake Nina up, and tell her,
you fool, you fool, get up!

730
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:46,500
That contemporary Tolstoy at our place,
looking for a typewriter!

731
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:52,500
And you, drunkard,
preaching to him,

732
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:54,800
smirching him with your
descriptions of nature.

733
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:59,900
Showing off her bitch brains.
I had to punch her a few times.

734
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
Why, that's not good,
that's not good.

735
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:06,100
We're fine, it's nothing,
we've made up already.

736
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:11,500
She sees a sausage,
ah, it's ready!

737
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:17,200
Roaches are crawling over her,
almost into her mouth,
but what it's to her,

738
00:56:17,500 --> 00:56:20,800
she'll just get up, smear her lips,
paint her face, curl her hair.

739
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:25,000
Rousseau!
Who would have thought?

740
00:56:27,500 --> 00:56:30,500
What's wrong, Vanya?
Vanya, did I upset you?

741
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
What are you doing?
Let's drink some water.

742
00:56:34,500 --> 00:56:35,500
I can't.

743
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:39,000
Children are dying there,
and I...

744
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:40,500
Vanya.
- What? What must I do?

745
00:56:40,700 --> 00:56:43,000
What? What should I write?
What depths of a soul?

746
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:45,500
I need a motor boat, you understand?
Motor boat!

747
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:46,500
Fine, fine, boat-shmoat.

748
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:49,800
They don't want to live?
They should decide that when
they grow up, you understand?

749
00:56:50,300 --> 00:56:52,900
And what do cockroaches have to do
with it? What cockroaches?

750
00:56:52,900 --> 00:56:54,000
Madman!

751
00:56:54,900 --> 00:56:56,900
Eh, Vanya, wait up,
Vanya, Vanya!

752
00:56:57,400 --> 00:56:58,800
You need to rest.

753
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:18,000
Fine.

754
00:57:20,500 --> 00:57:22,500
But that was Myshkin!

755
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:28,800
What a chance meeting!
Do you believe that?

756
00:57:29,300 --> 00:57:30,900
Taking a stroll here,

757
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,500
near a government summer house,

758
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:35,000
amidist fresh air.

759
00:57:35,500 --> 00:57:38,300
I've been to my judgment,

760
00:57:39,500 --> 00:57:42,800
at the dreadful court,
hahahahaha.

761
00:57:43,500 --> 00:57:45,200
And he's saving the children.

762
00:57:45,500 --> 00:57:47,000
He's a savior.

763
00:57:48,500 --> 00:57:49,500
What are you looking at?

764
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:53,000
What are you looking at,
feeling scared?

765
00:57:53,500 --> 00:57:55,500
No, no.
You are scared!

766
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
Look, I am dead!

767
00:57:58,500 --> 00:58:01,000
I am alive. I am alive.

768
00:58:01,300 --> 00:58:03,800
Maybe I am eternally alive!

769
00:58:05,500 --> 00:58:06,500
What's wrong with you?

770
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:08,800
What do you want from me?

771
00:58:08,900 --> 00:58:10,000
Go, go away.

772
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:12,500
Go your own way.

773
00:58:45,500 --> 00:58:46,500
Excuse me, please.

774
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:48,500
And how did you get here?

775
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,500
Yegorov. Yegorov.

776
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:53,600
What are you doing here,
I am asking you.

777
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:55,500
Did you climb over the fence?

778
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:56,800
Over the fence?

779
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,800
I am here about the children.
- What children!

780
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:03,000
What children, mind you. You've turned this
property into their pedestrian cloister.

781
00:59:03,500 --> 00:59:04,500
Yegorov!

782
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
Excuse me, a minute.

783
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:41,800
Excuse me, Mr. Johansson wants to know
if these mice are domestic or?

784
00:59:45,800 --> 00:59:48,000
Ah, he's saying, he's asking
what breed are they?

785
00:59:48,200 --> 00:59:49,800
Mr. Johansson is a great admirer
of wildlife.

786
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:53,000
These are rats, they are plenty of
rats here, mind you.

787
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:56,000
Devil knows what's up, but actually,
you don't need to translate that.

788
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:05,200
Mr. Johansson is enquiring why
everything in your country is so

789
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:06,500
strange and...

790
01:00:06,500 --> 01:00:10,000
Upside down.
Why?

791
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:14,700
Oh, I was expecting such a question!
You are asking the right question.

792
01:00:14,800 --> 01:00:16,500
because our people are shit,

793
01:00:16,500 --> 01:00:18,000
they're not even people,
devil knows what they are.

794
01:00:18,500 --> 01:00:21,000
When I was visiting Bush,
that's what Maximovna said:

795
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:25,800
look how well-behaved they are,
so to speak,
greeting us with flowers.

796
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:29,800
And how they work! I've seen it with
my own eyes, for your information,
so to speak.

797
01:00:29,900 --> 01:00:32,800
That's right. I saw how they play sports,
and they don't smoke.

798
01:00:33,100 --> 01:00:35,000
And what have we got here?
They drink and steal.

799
01:00:35,100 --> 01:00:36,800
Steal and drink.

800
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:40,400
And smoke, and then they can't
breathe, mind you, so to speak.

801
01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:41,500
what are you doing there?

802
01:00:41,600 --> 01:00:43,000
One minute, I'll be right back.

803
01:00:49,600 --> 01:00:50,400
Excuse me.

804
01:01:00,500 --> 01:01:02,800
And it's not only us,
entire Europe is perplexed

805
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,500
with our Russian strangeness
in such instances.

806
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:06,800
Who said that?

807
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:08,500
Myshkin, Myshkin.

808
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:12,100
If one of us embraces Catholicism,

809
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:14,400
then he’s bound to become a Jesuit,

810
01:01:14,800 --> 01:01:16,900
of the most obscure sort, at that,

811
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:19,800
and if he becomes an atheist,
he is bound to start demanding

812
01:01:19,900 --> 01:01:22,200
the purge of faith with violence,

813
01:01:22,300 --> 01:01:24,600
in other words, and with a sword!

814
01:01:24,800 --> 01:01:28,800
Why is that, why is there such
frenzy all at once?

815
01:01:29,300 --> 01:01:30,300
Do you really not know?

816
01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:31,200
Because he...

817
01:01:31,400 --> 01:01:34,300
Excuse me, please,
I am from the orphanage about

818
01:01:34,500 --> 01:01:35,700
the children.

819
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:38,000
Everything's flooded.

820
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:42,000
We need a motor boat.
To transport the children.

821
01:01:42,500 --> 01:01:43,600
But they're not giving it to us.

822
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:46,800
Yes, yes, I understand.
You see, Raisa Maximovna and I,

823
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:50,400
we read a book every evening,
Dostoyevsky,

824
01:01:50,500 --> 01:01:51,900
Just sit down here and listen.

825
01:01:52,200 --> 01:01:53,500
I, I'll stand.

826
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:56,400
Because he's found his fatherland,

827
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,500
which he had missed,
ans so he rejoices,

828
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:03,300
believing he's found the shore,
and so he rushes to kiss it.

829
01:02:03,500 --> 01:02:05,500
And who said that? Rogozhin?

830
01:02:06,500 --> 01:02:07,000
I've already told you,

831
01:02:07,500 --> 01:02:09,500
Myshkin.

832
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:11,000
Excuse me.

833
01:02:12,200 --> 01:02:14,000
I came to Mikhail Sergeyevich.

834
01:02:14,200 --> 01:02:16,000
What Mikhail Sergeyevich,
open your eyes.

835
01:02:17,500 --> 01:02:19,900
That's his double,
pretending.

836
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:22,700
How? I don't understand.

837
01:02:23,800 --> 01:02:25,900
Him? Double? I am asking you!

838
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:28,000
Why are you playing games with me?

839
01:02:28,500 --> 01:02:29,500
A double, not a double!

840
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:32,000
I need a motor boat!

841
01:02:34,500 --> 01:02:35,500
there are children croaking!

842
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:39,000
Eh, you!

843
01:03:26,500 --> 01:03:28,500
Let me through, I have a pass.

844
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:30,500
Stand still.
- I have a pass.

845
01:05:38,500 --> 01:05:40,500
Come on, hold this, hold this.

846
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,000
Climb up here.

847
01:05:45,500 --> 01:05:47,500
You are all playing me.

848
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
Who's playing you?
Come on, come on, up, up here.

849
01:05:50,500 --> 01:05:52,500
You've gone mad.
- Who me! Look at how he's dressing.

850
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,000
Don't ask. I am not going anywhere.

851
01:05:55,500 --> 01:05:57,500
I know this is a masquerade

852
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
I am not going anywhere.
I need to save the children.

853
01:06:00,500 --> 01:06:02,500
But you are not being sincere, Ivan.
playing role, but not sincerely.

854
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,400
You don't believe yourself.
Thought up a role for yourself,

855
01:06:05,500 --> 01:06:07,700
of a bearer of truth!
- What role, what role!

856
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
Vanya!
 - Stop insinuating this nonsense!

857
01:06:10,500 --> 01:06:12,500
This is what I'll tell you, Vanya.

858
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,800
There! Over Kulikovo!

859
01:06:16,500 --> 01:06:18,400
There!
- Yes, he's a little to drink,
- don't mind him,

860
01:06:18,500 --> 01:06:21,000
the forces of light,
and forces of darkness,

861
01:06:21,500 --> 01:06:22,800
are waging war,

862
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:26,300
maybe history is taking place
there right now!

863
01:06:26,500 --> 01:06:28,500
That's what I say.
Thank you. Vanya!

864
01:06:29,500 --> 01:06:31,500
This is what I will say,

865
01:06:32,500 --> 01:06:36,000
in every human life,
there happen to be such minutes,

866
01:06:36,500 --> 01:06:41,000
for which later, you feel so
excruciatingly ashamed!

867
01:06:41,100 --> 01:06:42,500
That's it, you've said enough.

868
01:06:43,100 --> 01:06:45,100
Vanya!
Don't yell.

869
01:06:45,600 --> 01:06:47,900
People, he knows where to go.

870
01:06:48,100 --> 01:06:54,300
If he's going toward Kulikovo,
then there shall be a great assembly!

871
01:06:54,800 --> 01:06:55,400
Stand up!

872
01:06:55,600 --> 01:06:56,100
Ah, forgive me, people.

873
01:06:58,100 --> 01:07:03,100
Shake off the dust, mankind.
Hear the tolling of Heaven's bells!

874
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:09,500
The hour has come,
Russian people.

875
01:07:12,300 --> 01:07:16,500
We shall break the walls,
and our heads shall not break,

876
01:07:17,600 --> 01:07:20,200
for our native land!

877
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:05,500
Vanya, wait up!

878
01:08:08,600 --> 01:08:10,600
You've lost your stockings!

879
01:08:18,100 --> 01:08:21,000
He's standing over the grave,
greetings, greetings,

880
01:08:21,500 --> 01:08:22,900
he's standing over the grave,

881
01:08:23,100 --> 01:08:25,500
and singing 'The Internationale.'

882
01:08:26,200 --> 01:08:33,000
Caruso, I am telling you, your mother,
what a joke.

883
01:08:34,800 --> 01:08:36,200
Imagine there is a hag,

884
01:08:37,300 --> 01:08:39,300
she's running after the train,

885
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:42,000
with a flag.

886
01:08:44,200 --> 01:08:46,500
Or all of a sudden,
a candle is burning.

887
01:08:48,300 --> 01:08:49,800
They are singing somewhere.

888
01:08:53,500 --> 01:08:55,100
And I, I see myself from the side.

889
01:08:56,600 --> 01:08:58,800
Like someone else playing my role.

890
01:09:02,500 --> 01:09:04,000
Meaning, it's as though it's not me,

891
01:09:04,100 --> 01:09:06,100
but someone else.

892
01:09:07,500 --> 01:09:09,500
Aah, such passion.

893
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:14,000
Come on, read on,
what's next? Read on.

894
01:09:14,500 --> 01:09:17,500
No, let's drink first a little.

895
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:23,000
Please, please do continue reading.

896
01:09:24,500 --> 01:09:28,500
You know, I love doing this
on a nighttime train,

897
01:09:28,600 --> 01:09:30,500
even the sound of words is different.

898
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:32,000
Everything seems different.

899
01:09:32,800 --> 01:09:34,700
Genius!

900
01:09:35,500 --> 01:09:37,500
Genius! Up there, there!

901
01:09:38,500 --> 01:09:40,000
The different.

902
01:09:41,500 --> 01:09:46,200
For Russian literature, we always
need something like atmosphere.

903
01:09:46,500 --> 01:09:48,800
A head-spin.
- Yes, yes.

904
01:09:49,500 --> 01:09:51,500
Vanya, to you. Vanya.

905
01:09:52,500 --> 01:09:57,500
There is no shame in presenting
such literature at the Last Judgment.

906
01:09:58,000 --> 01:09:59,500
To you, let's drink.

907
01:10:02,500 --> 01:10:06,900
Actually, before, I thought of this
as an official claim, but now,

908
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,000
I don't even know,

909
01:10:09,500 --> 01:10:11,500
perhaps it's a novel.

910
01:10:11,700 --> 01:10:13,700
Read it, read it.

911
01:10:13,900 --> 01:10:16,200
I have some kielbasa with me.
Read on.

912
01:10:23,400 --> 01:10:25,300
And thus, Ivan Sergeyevich

913
01:10:25,500 --> 01:10:28,000
became an unfamiliar persona,

914
01:10:29,900 --> 01:10:32,900
so to speak, a subject of
some extrinsic will,

915
01:10:33,500 --> 01:10:35,500
something malignant and
evidently cynical.

916
01:10:36,700 --> 01:10:40,500
More importantly, he realized this
the moment he saw that others

917
01:10:40,500 --> 01:10:44,200
are not better than him.
They are merely not playing
their roles better.

918
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:47,800
And the roles they've got are merely
episodic rather than central.

919
01:10:48,400 --> 01:10:50,000
Who is the protagonist then?

920
01:10:51,400 --> 01:10:53,000
More questions again.

921
01:10:53,500 --> 01:10:55,000
The questions.

922
01:10:55,500 --> 01:10:57,500
If there was anyone in
our Russian empire

923
01:10:58,500 --> 01:11:01,200
who'd get permission to make a
communal novel out of our society,

924
01:11:01,500 --> 01:11:03,500
then who should it to be?

925
01:11:04,500 --> 01:11:08,500
If not again, the enemy of
the people, the father of lies,

926
01:11:08,600 --> 01:11:09,400
conspiring a cunning game,

927
01:11:09,500 --> 01:11:10,500
heralding a deviant spirit.

928
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,500
To agitate and to blind again,

929
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:17,500
to prevent our beloved land from rising
out of the dirt of eternal deceit.

930
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:22,100
Could it be that the demons
are howling and diverting us
from our paths?

931
01:11:22,200 --> 01:11:25,500
how close this path seemed,
so clear and simple,

932
01:11:25,500 --> 01:11:28,200
My God, my god, help us, the sinners.

933
01:11:28,500 --> 01:11:30,700
Help us escape the spirit of antichrist,

934
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:33,500
the spirit of pretence,
with his repulsive minions,

935
01:11:33,500 --> 01:11:36,500
and especially, especially,
the banality of corrosion.

936
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:41,500
This corrosion, which nothing
to this day could withstand.

937
01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:42,700
Even holy truths.

938
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,000
God, liberate us from our banality.

939
01:11:45,500 --> 01:11:49,100
Liberate us, liberate us.

940
01:11:50,200 --> 01:11:51,800
And the rest,

941
01:11:52,200 --> 01:11:54,000
will be as it shall be.

942
01:11:54,500 --> 01:11:56,000
God knows.

943
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,000
O Slavs!

944
01:12:33,100 --> 01:12:35,800
Let's pray for our
devastated motherland.

945
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,800
Let's pray for our Orthodox people.

946
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,500
Let's pray for the Russian conviction,

947
01:12:41,500 --> 01:12:45,500
for the Russian conviction is the idea
of a spirit's battle with worldly evil,

948
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,800
And no other creed exists
for a Russian man,

949
01:12:48,900 --> 01:12:52,500
for everything is in that conviction,
and God's justifications,

950
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:53,500
and the Judgment of God!

951
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,200
And all the mysteries of
Russian history.

952
01:12:57,000 --> 01:13:01,500
The great blazing cross she bears
until the end the time.

953
01:13:02,600 --> 01:13:05,300
Brothers and sisters!
My beloved!

954
01:13:05,800 --> 01:13:09,900
Let us not be ashamed of our calling
at the celestial battle of all nations.

955
01:13:10,300 --> 01:13:14,000
Rise, the living and the dead!
To the final battle!

956
01:13:14,200 --> 01:13:18,400
Let us crush all worldly evil for the
spiritual fate of our paternal land.

957
01:13:18,900 --> 01:13:21,300
God's Great Plan
shall be accomplished,

958
01:13:21,500 --> 01:13:23,200
for the Russian land,

959
01:13:23,600 --> 01:13:26,100
for the roots of our fathers,
for the world.

960
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:41,000
Keep moving, believers, keep moving.

961
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:44,000
Men!

962
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,000
Help, there's
Men! Help us!

963
01:14:15,500 --> 01:14:17,500
We are not far.

964
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,200
There it is, Kulikovo.

965
01:14:20,500 --> 01:14:22,500
Its tip can be seen*

966
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:27,800
Brothers, listen.

967
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,500
Brothers,
brothers!

968
01:14:34,500 --> 01:14:37,500
Rise for the holy war
with the Antichrist!

969
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:43,000
We shall upright and
we shall feel no shame.

970
01:14:43,700 --> 01:14:46,400
The hour has come,

971
01:14:46,900 --> 01:14:48,500
above Mother Russia,

972
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:53,000
God has heard our buried prayers,

973
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,500
Russia has risen!

974
01:14:57,900 --> 01:15:00,500
Risen against the Antichrist!

975
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,000
We shall stand all together,

976
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:09,500
for the world,
for the Russian soil.

977
01:15:10,500 --> 01:15:13,500
We won't pity our stomachs,

978
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:19,000
we won't betray our Russian dignity*

979
01:15:21,500 --> 01:15:23,500
Don't fall  behind.

980
01:15:26,500 --> 01:15:28,500
Stand aside, stand aside.

981
01:15:28,800 --> 01:15:30,800
Let the Icon through.

982
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:34,300
Step aside!

983
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:36,800
They are carrying the Icon.

984
01:15:38,300 --> 01:15:40,300
Step aside, step aside,
they are carrying the icon.

985
01:15:41,800 --> 01:15:43,800
The Holy Mother of Christ.

986
01:15:44,300 --> 01:15:46,300
Lord, save us.

987
01:18:32,500 --> 01:18:33,500
I can hear it.

988
01:18:34,300 --> 01:18:35,300
I can hear it.

989
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:38,500
The earth is humming.

990
01:18:39,500 --> 01:18:40,500
O, it's humming.

991
01:18:41,500 --> 01:18:42,500
O misery,

992
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:44,000
misery!

993
01:18:45,500 --> 01:18:46,800
Earth is humming.

994
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:52,500
The battle is ensuing,

995
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:55,500
The prince of the universe is coming!

996
01:18:56,500 --> 01:18:58,000
Enemy of mankind!

997
01:18:59,500 --> 01:19:02,000
Came out of the lair,

998
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:04,500
A cursed snake,

999
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:06,700
an ancient dragon,

1000
01:19:06,900 --> 01:19:09,000
the Antichrist is coming.

1001
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,000
Woe, woe!

1002
01:19:15,200 --> 01:19:17,500
The great force is coming!

1003
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,000
It's treading on our souls!

1004
01:19:22,500 --> 01:19:24,000
The earth is shivering.

1005
01:19:23,700 --> 01:19:25,700
It's starving*

1006
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:33,000
And with him, three thousand ??.

1007
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:45,700
You have to consider where
he'll come out from.

1008
01:19:46,200 --> 01:19:48,200
I don't know.
It's not possible to know!

1009
01:19:48,300 --> 01:19:50,300
How is that?

1010
01:19:50,300 --> 01:19:52,500
Just look around,
he's emerging out of darkness.

1011
01:19:53,500 --> 01:19:55,500
Out of blindness, and into
the Babylonian whore.

1012
01:19:59,500 --> 01:20:01,500
Enough of you, out of here,
get out of here.

1013
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:11,000
Come to your senses,
O great misery!

1014
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:15,500
I can see,
he will stab you in the back!

1015
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:17,000
In the back!

1016
01:20:17,500 --> 01:20:19,500
But you will never know!

1017
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,000
You won't even notice!

1018
01:21:53,500 --> 01:21:55,500
Do you see him?
Ivan?

1019
01:22:03,500 --> 01:22:07,500
Ivan! Ivan!

1020
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:11,500
Ivan, Ivan, Ivan!

1021
01:22:12,500 --> 01:22:13,500
Where is he?

1022
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,500
There, there.
Let me see.

1023
01:22:30,500 --> 01:22:32,500
What's the delay?
What's going on here?

1024
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:38,000
Stand upright.

1025
01:22:39,500 --> 01:22:41,500
Stop all chatter.

1026
01:22:48,500 --> 01:22:50,500
Where's the one about the children?

1027
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,000
What? Where did they take him?

1028
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:57,500
I can't hear you, come closer.

1029
01:22:59,500 --> 01:23:02,000
Come here.

1030
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:04,500
I am telling you, I am saying,
he's at the make-up department.

1031
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:07,000
They are doing his face,
see, the carriage is coming already.

1032
01:23:08,500 --> 01:23:10,500
What make-up department,
are you mad?

1033
01:23:09,600 --> 01:23:11,600
That's the order I received.

1034
01:23:11,800 --> 01:23:14,500
What order?
Who is giving orders here?

1035
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:17,000
Damn it,
what's going on here!

1036
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:18,800
We can't begin.
He's not here.

1037
01:23:21,500 --> 01:23:22,500
I know, I know!

1038
01:23:23,800 --> 01:23:26,500
Let me run get him,
I know where he is.

1039
01:23:26,700 --> 01:23:27,500
It's nearby.

1040
01:23:28,500 --> 01:23:30,500
You know, do you?

1041
01:23:30,600 --> 01:23:32,600
What?

1042
01:23:33,500 --> 01:23:36,500
Go at this instance,
take the carriage.

1043
01:23:37,800 --> 01:23:39,300
Get him a carriage.

1044
01:23:52,300 --> 01:23:54,300
Where's Mazayev?
There, inside.

1045
01:23:54,800 --> 01:23:56,800
Where?
There, inside, I am telling you.

1046
01:23:57,300 --> 01:24:00,300
Everything is already set,
why all this yelling?

1047
01:24:01,800 --> 01:24:03,800
Everyone is idling about,
everyone's out of time.

1048
01:24:04,300 --> 01:24:06,800
Where did you go?
Where did you go?

1049
01:24:06,900 --> 01:24:08,000
To the right, I said.

1050
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:10,000
Will you have coffee?

1051
01:24:10,500 --> 01:24:13,100
I haven't even had breakfast
because of you.

1052
01:24:16,500 --> 01:24:17,600
Why are you messing about?

1053
01:24:19,500 --> 01:24:20,500
Last stroke, one moment.

1054
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:25,000
He's here!
We've been ready.

1055
01:24:26,500 --> 01:24:27,500
Ready!

1056
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,500
Talk as though you invoking.
- What, I haven't said anything.

1057
01:24:30,600 --> 01:24:32,600
What have I said?

1058
01:24:32,800 --> 01:24:34,800
Hm, text from The Apocalypse.

1059
01:24:35,300 --> 01:24:37,300
What text?

1060
01:24:37,500 --> 01:24:39,800
'There is no time, time will
be no more.' Also this text,

1061
01:24:40,300 --> 01:24:42,300
'the silence will be as though
only half an hour,'

1062
01:24:42,800 --> 01:24:45,000
Tell me, half an hour, how is that?
As a matter of fact?

1063
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:49,200
Why are you putting words in my mouth?

1064
01:24:49,800 --> 01:24:52,500
Let him go immediately.
Let him go, I said, immediately.

1065
01:24:52,500 --> 01:24:54,300
Vanya, what are you sitting here for?
There are people waiting.

1066
01:24:54,800 --> 01:24:56,800
There is a battle.

1067
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:58,000
Please.

1068
01:25:02,500 --> 01:25:04,500
There...

1069
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:09,000
but what have you done with him?

1070
01:25:09,500 --> 01:25:11,000
What kind of a face is that?

1071
01:25:15,500 --> 01:25:18,500
What's wrong?
I did what I was asked to do.

1072
01:25:18,600 --> 01:25:20,500
I'll even do an Ivan with mustache.

1073
01:25:20,500 --> 01:25:22,400
It doesn't matter to us.

1074
01:25:22,800 --> 01:25:24,800
Who asked you to do this?

1075
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:28,500
You just told me that you were asked
to do this, who asked you?

1076
01:25:28,500 --> 01:25:30,000
Who in particular asked you?

1077
01:25:30,500 --> 01:25:32,500
Who asked what?

1078
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,500
Some kind of a man came in,
who was it, who's the main one?

1079
01:25:36,500 --> 01:25:38,500
They are all commandants there.
- Exactly.

1080
01:25:38,500 --> 01:25:41,000
So a person a came in,
gave us orders, and
so we did what he asked.

1081
01:25:47,500 --> 01:25:48,500
Vanya?

1082
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:53,500
Can you speak?

1083
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:57,000
I can.

1084
01:25:58,500 --> 01:25:59,500
It's very difficult.

1085
01:26:02,500 --> 01:26:04,000
I have to get used to it.

1086
01:26:05,500 --> 01:26:07,500
Briefcase, go, go go,
forget the briefcase.

1087
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,500
We've done a brilliant job.
Brilliant.

1088
01:26:12,500 --> 01:26:14,100
A sportsman!
So elegant,

1089
01:26:14,200 --> 01:26:16,200
a man who
takes care of himself.

1090
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:24,000
They don't know what they want!
Exactly. Don't know what else
we could have done.

1091
01:26:57,000 --> 01:27:04,000
So, why are standing!
We must advance!

1092
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:13,000
Forward!
- Look, look at what's he doing!

1093
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:41,000
Attention.

1094
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:57,500
We are happy to welcome you.

1095
01:28:04,500 --> 01:28:07,800
We welcome a Russian intellectual,
a successor of Tolstoy, Dostoyevsky.

1096
01:28:09,100 --> 01:28:12,500
A humanist writer,
Ivan Sergeyevich Mazayev.

1097
01:28:13,800 --> 01:28:15,800
Let's welcome him,
let's welcome him.

1098
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:26,000
Everyone says,

1099
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,000
let's save the children.

1100
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:31,000
somewhere children are drowning,

1101
01:28:32,500 --> 01:28:34,500
and a motor boat is required,

1102
01:28:37,100 --> 01:28:39,200
they supposedly need boats.

1103
01:28:41,500 --> 01:28:42,500
All of this is funny.

1104
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:46,500
And on top of that,
it's irrelevant.

1105
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:51,500
No boats for the drowning!

1106
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,000
Let them learn how to swim.

1107
01:28:56,500 --> 01:28:58,500
Whoever can swim, can live.

1108
01:28:59,500 --> 01:29:01,500
In accordance with the spirit of times!

1109
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:16,000
I beg you, brothers, stand together,
with the world, don't run, brothers,

1110
01:30:18,500 --> 01:30:20,500
brothers, the dead have no shame.

1111
01:30:21,800 --> 01:30:23,800
Don't run.

1112
01:30:25,300 --> 01:30:27,300
Don't run.

1113
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,000
Brothers, stand together, brothers,

1114
01:30:34,250 --> 01:30:36,250
with the whole world!

1115
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:57,000
Beast, beast!

1116
01:31:10,500 --> 01:31:11,500
Beast!

1117
01:32:06,500 --> 01:32:08,500
Greetings Simyonovna.

1118
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:12,200
Why are you looking at me
like you don't recognize me?

1119
01:32:13,500 --> 01:32:14,900
Did I age so much?

1120
01:32:15,500 --> 01:32:17,000
I didn't recognize you,

1121
01:32:17,500 --> 01:32:19,500
thought it was a stranger.

1122
01:32:20,400 --> 01:32:21,700
It's you.
What a surprise.

1123
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:24,900
My heart is aching,
do you have some pain-killers?

1124
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:26,700
We don't have anything.

1125
01:32:27,900 --> 01:32:29,900
I'll bring you some hot tea right now.

1126
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:31,500
It will ease the pain.

1127
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:34,800
I am just collecting bottles here,

1128
01:32:35,800 --> 01:32:37,300
thinking things out,

1129
01:32:38,200 --> 01:32:40,200
I'll be quick.
In an instance.

1130
01:32:43,500 --> 01:32:45,500
What a surprise.

1131
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:21,000
Here. Hot tea.

1132
01:33:24,200 --> 01:33:26,500
You'll warm up soon.

1133
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:29,000
Your feet must be soaking wet.

1134
01:33:29,400 --> 01:33:31,500
They will be aching.

1135
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:35,000
And why are you sitting in the dark?

1136
01:33:35,500 --> 01:33:37,000
Look how many candles you've got.

1137
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:41,000
We'll light the candles right now,

1138
01:33:41,500 --> 01:33:44,000
it will be merrier.

1139
01:33:47,200 --> 01:33:50,500
Damn matches keep going out.

1140
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:54,000
Flaky matches, here, here.

1141
01:33:54,500 --> 01:34:02,000
One candle, second candle,
and you've got a lamp somewhere too.

1142
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:07,500
Have you forgotten?
Must be somewhere here.

1143
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:17,000
I've been to corner store recently,
bought a sugar jar. Good sugar.

1144
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:19,200
You'll be warm soon.

1145
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:25,000
This kind of tea will make
you feel so nice and warm.

1146
01:34:27,500 --> 01:34:29,500
We'll drink tea now.

1147
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:33,000
You'll warm up.
There, hold this.

1148
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:36,500
There.

1149
01:34:50,100 --> 01:34:53,500
Why are you shivering?

1150
01:34:54,800 --> 01:34:56,000
Did something happen?

1151
01:35:08,500 --> 01:35:10,000
What sin!

1152
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:14,000
Did you murder someone?

1153
01:35:16,500 --> 01:35:17,700
You murdered.

1154
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:27,000
I murdered, Simyonovna.

1155
01:35:27,500 --> 01:35:29,500
How could this be?

1156
01:35:31,500 --> 01:35:32,800
I am a murderer.

1157
01:35:36,500 --> 01:35:37,500
Yes.

1158
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:43,500
That's how it goes.

1159
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:48,000
Who did you kill?

1160
01:35:58,900 --> 01:36:00,700
Little children.

1161
01:36:00,800 --> 01:36:04,200
Dear God, dear God.

1162
01:36:04,500 --> 01:36:06,000
Orphans.

1163
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:12,700
That's how it is.

1164
01:36:18,200 --> 01:36:19,500
I drowned them.

1165
01:36:23,500 --> 01:36:25,500
Like kittens, yes.

1166
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:28,500
They are small children,

1167
01:36:30,500 --> 01:36:32,500
where could they swim afterall?

1168
01:36:36,100 --> 01:36:38,000
They needed protection,

1169
01:36:38,500 --> 01:36:40,500
from grown-ups,

1170
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:44,000
all of them drow...

1171
01:36:48,500 --> 01:36:49,500
That's how it is.

1172
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:53,600
How will you live now?

1173
01:36:59,500 --> 01:37:01,000
I am not going to live.

1174
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:01,800
What's wrong with you?

1175
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:05,000
Do you know what you are saying?

1176
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:08,000
I won't live.

1177
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:11,100
I had a dream,

1178
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:16,500
an angel appears and says,

1179
01:37:16,500 --> 01:37:20,000
he keeps saying,
Mazayev, behind the curtain.

1180
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:25,500
What curtain, I ask?

1181
01:37:26,500 --> 01:37:28,500
I didn't understand.

1182
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:31,500
But he isn't answering.

1183
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:35,500
Behind the curtain, Mozayev,
he repeats.

1184
01:37:39,500 --> 01:37:42,000
You see, calling me by last name,
not the first.

1185
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:45,500
And as soon he said that,

1186
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:48,200
I see our building's entrance.

1187
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:52,500
They are carrying wreaths.

1188
01:37:57,500 --> 01:38:01,500
Some people are asking where to put
the lid of the coffin,

1189
01:38:01,600 --> 01:38:02,800
but I am here.

1190
01:38:03,500 --> 01:38:05,500
In this room.

1191
01:38:05,800 --> 01:38:07,000
Laying on the table.

1192
01:38:10,300 --> 01:38:11,800
I am being dressed.

1193
01:38:14,800 --> 01:38:17,900
Everyone is looking for a shirt,
but no clean one can be found.

1194
01:38:23,500 --> 01:38:25,000
They found one later.

1195
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:32,600
There is a wake in the kitchen.

1196
01:38:34,500 --> 01:38:36,500
They are talking about me.

1197
01:38:36,800 --> 01:38:39,000
I can't remember,
they are saying different things.

1198
01:38:41,500 --> 01:38:43,200
Strange. I am here,

1199
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:47,000
and there's my wake.

1200
01:38:50,500 --> 01:38:51,500
Dear God.

1201
01:38:53,500 --> 01:38:54,500
This means,

1202
01:38:57,000 --> 01:38:58,500
that this angel,

1203
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:02,000
knows ahead of time, if he's saying,
behind the curtain.

1204
01:39:02,500 --> 01:39:03,500
It means that

1205
01:39:05,100 --> 01:39:06,500
everything is already decided,

1206
01:39:06,500 --> 01:39:09,700
for me, for you, for everyone, ah?

1207
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:17,500
He's kind of just reading by the book,

1208
01:39:18,400 --> 01:39:22,000
while we are kind of like actors,

1209
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:28,500
taking part in a play,

1210
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:33,300
forcing out demons.

1211
01:39:39,500 --> 01:39:40,500
That's it.

1212
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:48,300
Leave me, Semyonanva, go,
I still need to

1213
01:39:48,500 --> 01:39:49,500
solve one question.

1214
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:53,500
What question could there be?
It's a difficult problem.

1215
01:39:53,500 --> 01:39:55,500
And there is no time, no time,
go, go, go.

1216
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:06,500
What's the question though?

1217
01:40:12,500 --> 01:40:13,500
A question, a question.

1218
01:40:17,500 --> 01:40:20,000
A truly significant question.

1219
01:40:20,500 --> 01:40:21,500
the most important one.

1220
01:40:26,200 --> 01:40:27,000
About God.

1221
01:40:29,200 --> 01:40:30,000
About Him.

1222
01:40:33,500 --> 01:40:35,300
Everything else is trivial.

1223
01:40:39,600 --> 01:40:41,200
But this is the question.

1224
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:48,000
Semyonovna?

1225
01:40:50,200 --> 01:40:52,000
Put out the candle.

1226
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:58,000
It's easier to think in the dark.

1227
01:41:01,800 --> 01:41:02,800
Easier.

1228
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:17,500
What a tragedy.

1229
01:41:39,500 --> 01:41:42,000
What will become of us,
our Heavenly Father?
