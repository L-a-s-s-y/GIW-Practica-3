1
00:00:14,295 --> 00:01:34,698
you didn't sleep well?

2
00:01:35,198 --> 00:01:35,398
Yes,

3
00:01:35,418 --> 00:01:35,838
quite badly.

4
00:01:37,178 --> 00:01:38,098
If you like,

5
00:01:38,138 --> 00:01:39,758
the operation can be postponed.

6
00:01:41,238 --> 00:01:41,838
Do not

7
00:01:41,838 --> 00:01:42,778
don't worry about me.

8
00:01:43,778 --> 00:01:45,418
We can do that another day.

9
00:01:47,018 --> 00:01:47,418
No,

10
00:01:47,498 --> 00:01:47,958
today,

11
00:01:47,958 --> 00:01:48,618
we're doing this today.

12
00:01:50,398 --> 00:01:50,918
But t '

13
00:01:50,918 --> 00:01:51,618
are you sure about this?

14
00:01:52,578 --> 00:01:53,378
If ever it '

15
00:01:53,378 --> 00:01:53,758
wasn't him.

16
00:01:55,338 --> 00:01:56,538
I'm sure of myself.

17
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:40,810
Marie,

18
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:41,150

19
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:41,790
coming soon.

20
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:52,130
I'll be right back.

21
00:03:15,738 --> 00:03:21,568
Join me at the

22
00:03:21,568 --> 00:03:22,838
interior?

23
00:03:23,188 --> 00:03:23,578
Yes.

24
00:03:24,848 --> 00:03:25,724
The valet of

25
00:03:25,724 --> 00:03:27,158
a universe?

26
00:03:27,698 --> 00:03:28,418
Yes.

27
00:03:29,568 --> 00:03:29,958
Come on,

28
00:03:30,058 --> 00:03:31,238
put that away.

29
00:03:50,016 --> 00:03:59,856
you're looking for something you're looking for someone

30
00:03:59,856 --> 00:04:10,376
parlez français ou du speak english et sinon il ya

31
00:04:10,376 --> 00:04:13,436
a janitor if you need to find yourself

32
00:05:29,507 --> 00:05:35,627
Thanks for watching!

33
00:06:08,471 --> 00:06:10,071
Oh,

34
00:06:10,131 --> 00:06:13,891
my God.

35
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:40,540
Oh,

36
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:40,940
my God.

37
00:07:25,432 --> 00:07:31,432
Who are you?

38
00:07:35,172 --> 00:07:36,852
What do you want from me?

39
00:08:20,322 --> 00:08:25,312
C'

40
00:08:25,312 --> 00:08:25,702
is my daughter,

41
00:08:25,842 --> 00:08:26,682
she was killed.

42
00:08:36,604 --> 00:08:42,244
Marie Bacheret,

43
00:08:42,384 --> 00:08:43,044
8 years old,

44
00:08:43,104 --> 00:08:45,004
found dead near the lime trees in the forest of

45
00:08:45,004 --> 00:08:45,244
Sénard,

46
00:08:45,404 --> 00:08:47,304
about a week after his death.

47
00:08:48,044 --> 00:08:50,241
There were 16 stab wounds on the

48
00:08:50,241 --> 00:08:50,844
the whole body,

49
00:08:51,384 --> 00:08:53,624
fracture of the right wrist and middle finger of the hand

50
00:08:53,624 --> 00:08:55,004
left prior to death,

51
00:08:55,544 --> 00:08:57,244
serious injury to abdomen and head,

52
00:08:57,504 --> 00:08:59,924
multiple wounds and subcutaneous hemorrhage.

53
00:09:00,064 --> 00:09:01,964
The cause of death appears to be haemorrhage

54
00:09:01,964 --> 00:09:02,604
widespread.

55
00:09:03,044 --> 00:09:04,704
A third of the brain is gone,

56
00:09:04,764 --> 00:09:07,384
80% of the organs were harvested,

57
00:09:07,484 --> 00:09:09,044
the victim was disfigured.

58
00:09:09,424 --> 00:09:09,872
L'

59
00:09:09,872 --> 00:09:11,824
identity was determined thanks to the fingerprint

60
00:09:11,824 --> 00:09:12,204
dental.

61
00:09:12,444 --> 00:09:13,344
And then,

62
00:09:13,524 --> 00:09:15,644
what's that got to do with me?

63
00:09:18,984 --> 00:09:19,784
Thibault Laval,

64
00:09:19,784 --> 00:09:21,644
you were the accountant for the Minard Foundation.

65
00:09:23,184 --> 00:09:23,804
But us,

66
00:09:23,804 --> 00:09:27,124
it was dissolved centuries ago.

67
00:09:27,744 --> 00:09:28,170
J'

68
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:29,264
have nothing more to do with them.

69
00:09:29,804 --> 00:09:31,170
My daughter has been kidnapped by someone

70
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:32,194
one of the foundation and

71
00:09:32,194 --> 00:09:32,284
one,

72
00:09:32,304 --> 00:09:32,524
is you.

73
00:09:32,604 --> 00:09:33,604
But no!

74
00:09:37,364 --> 00:09:37,829
Then it's

75
00:09:37,829 --> 00:09:38,164
is who?

76
00:09:38,164 --> 00:09:39,424
In the position you occupy,

77
00:09:39,504 --> 00:09:40,824
you couldn't be unaware of it.

78
00:09:41,084 --> 00:09:41,464
But at last,

79
00:09:41,544 --> 00:09:42,484
kidnap your daughter,

80
00:09:42,544 --> 00:09:43,924
why would the foundation do this?

81
00:09:43,924 --> 00:09:44,764
What for?

82
00:09:47,564 --> 00:09:47,914
C'

83
00:09:47,914 --> 00:09:48,744
you can tell me.

84
00:09:49,444 --> 00:09:50,329
But I'm telling you

85
00:09:50,329 --> 00:09:50,824
is not me!

86
00:09:50,824 --> 00:09:52,264
I don't know this child!

87
00:09:58,098 --> 00:10:04,121
But what

88
00:10:04,121 --> 00:10:08,138
what do you want?

89
00:10:08,518 --> 00:10:10,158
Are you telling us the truth or do you want to be

90
00:10:10,158 --> 00:10:10,998
here?

91
00:10:10,998 --> 00:10:11,668
But it's

92
00:10:11,668 --> 00:10:13,318
don't panic.

93
00:10:13,638 --> 00:10:14,738
We've got plenty of time.

94
00:10:15,918 --> 00:10:16,478
I know,

95
00:10:16,578 --> 00:10:17,558
I'm sure I'm scary.

96
00:10:26,061 --> 00:10:32,281
It's going to cost you.

97
00:10:36,261 --> 00:10:36,821
Hey!

98
00:10:36,821 --> 00:10:46,241
Help!

99
00:10:46,241 --> 00:10:47,641
There's no point in shouting.

100
00:10:48,101 --> 00:10:48,701
It

101
00:10:48,701 --> 00:10:49,281
there's nobody here.

102
00:10:51,781 --> 00:10:52,701
I've got to go.

103
00:10:53,581 --> 00:10:54,441
Ah yes,

104
00:10:54,501 --> 00:10:54,721
is the

105
00:10:54,721 --> 00:10:54,841
time.

106
00:11:19,915 --> 00:11:25,095
This is it,

107
00:11:25,095 --> 00:11:26,075
I don't know how to thank you.

108
00:11:26,715 --> 00:11:28,095
Thank you for everything you do for me.

109
00:11:29,155 --> 00:11:29,935
It took a long time,

110
00:11:29,995 --> 00:11:31,975
but it's the home stretch.

111
00:11:32,835 --> 00:11:33,257

00:17:33,437 --> 00:17:35,537

Do you cook for him too?

177
00:20:21,392 --> 00:20:22,858
It would be annoying if

178
00:20:22,858 --> 00:20:23,432
he would die in front of it.

179
00:20:58,947 --> 00:21:21,472

about a week after his death.

Whole body.

Thank you.

193
00:23:42,763 --> 00:23:43,923
I'm coming out of consultation,

194
00:23:44,183 --> 00:23:45,223
I just wanted to rest a little.

195
00:23:46,603 --> 00:23:47,158
C'

196
00:23:47,158 --> 00:23:49,643
is the London doctor who saw you?

197
00:23:50,343 --> 00:23:50,603
Yes.

198
00:23:56,943 --> 00:23:59,603
Are you Mr. Bassuret?

199
00:24:00,223 --> 00:24:00,743
Yes.

200
00:24:02,583 --> 00:24:03,723
Let me introduce myself.

201
00:24:04,703 --> 00:24:05,155
I

202
00:24:05,155 --> 00:24:06,243
is Sayo Konijima.

203
00:24:07,063 --> 00:24:08,983
I'm a psychosomatic therapist.

204
00:24:10,523 --> 00:24:12,923
Will you have five minutes for me?

205
00:24:12,923 --> 00:24:13,263
grant?

206
00:24:33,344 --> 00:24:38,704
Your name,

207
00:24:38,724 --> 00:24:39,564
is Bachal.

208
00:24:48,505 --> 00:24:51,045
That

209
00:24:51,045 --> 00:24:54,565
did you say?

210
00:24:55,405 --> 00:24:56,245
Albert Bacheret.

211
00:24:56,945 --> 00:24:59,285
I remember seeing your name in some files.

212
00:24:59,285 --> 00:24:59,785
by Minard.

213
00:25:01,445 --> 00:25:02,485
So what?

214
00:25:03,015 --> 00:25:04,365
You were part of the Circle,

215
00:25:04,385 --> 00:25:05,445
isn't it?

216
00:25:06,905 --> 00:25:08,125
What are you talking about?

217
00:25:08,125 --> 00:25:08,265
C'

218
00:25:08,265 --> 00:25:09,465
was written in the files.

219
00:25:12,585 --> 00:25:14,465
I knew a few people from the Cercle,

220
00:25:14,505 --> 00:25:14,865
that ' s all.

221
00:25:15,605 --> 00:25:16,055
Qu '

222
00:25:16,055 --> 00:25:17,265
what's going on?

C '

224
00:25:18,295 --> 00:25:19,885
What's all this about the Circle?

225
00:25:22,225 --> 00:25:22,895
I won't

226
00:25:22,895 --> 00:25:23,285
hadn't said,

227
00:25:23,325 --> 00:25:24,585
but I myself was part of the

228
00:25:24,585 --> 00:25:25,545
Foundation a long time ago.

229
00:25:26,165 --> 00:25:26,845
But it doesn

230
00:25:26,845 --> 00:25:27,185
has nothing to do with it.

231
00:25:27,725 --> 00:25:28,385
Tell me about it.

232
00:25:31,925 --> 00:25:32,438
C '

233
00:25:32,438 --> 00:25:34,765
was a humanitarian circle to help children.

234
00:25:35,785 --> 00:25:38,825
It was created by a few volunteers from the

235
00:25:38,825 --> 00:25:39,485
Fondation Minard.

236
00:25:39,905 --> 00:25:41,965
A humanitarian circle?

237
00:25:43,045 --> 00:25:43,983
A kind of

238
00:25:43,983 --> 00:25:44,405
orphanage.

239
00:25:44,445 --> 00:25:45,445
An orphanage?

240
00:25:45,445 --> 00:25:46,611
Have you ever heard of

241
00:25:46,611 --> 00:25:47,205
an orphanage?

242
00:25:47,265 --> 00:25:49,642
An orphanage allegedly involved in '

243
00:25:49,642 --> 00:25:49,945
children.

244
00:25:50,225 --> 00:25:50,585
This,

245
00:25:50,685 --> 00:25:50,850
is that

246
00:25:50,850 --> 00:25:51,345
a rumor.

247
00:25:51,505 --> 00:25:51,791

re you sure?

249
00:25:52,245 --> 00:25:53,085
Because if you don't,

250
00:25:53,165 --> 00:25:54,585
ça voudrait dire c ' Guérin qui tait

251
00:25:54,585 --> 00:25:55,425
the strings from behind.

N ' Importe quoi.

253
00:25:57,465 --> 00:25:58,258
From what I

254
00:25:58,258 --> 00:25:58,825
I've heard.

255
00:25:58,925 --> 00:26:00,220
He killed the children

256
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:00,385
they

257
00:26:00,385 --> 00:26:01,185
couldn't sell.

258
00:26:01,305 --> 00:26:02,110
I don't know if it's

259
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:03,405
was Guérin himself.

260
00:26:03,765 --> 00:26:04,289
But you

261
00:26:04,289 --> 00:26:04,905
imagine someone

262
00:26:04,905 --> 00:26:06,545
to do something like that without having received a

263
00:26:06,545 --> 00:26:08,345
directly from him?

264
00:26:08,345 --> 00:26:10,405
Do you have any proof of this?

265
00:26:10,405 --> 00:26:10,665
C'

266
00:26:10,665 --> 00:26:12,085
it's you who should have them.

267
00:26:12,885 --> 00:26:15,925
You were spying on the Foundation and ratting out

268
00:26:15,925 --> 00:26:16,925
information to the press.

269
00:26:16,925 --> 00:26:17,175
C'

270
00:26:17,175 --> 00:26:17,625
is how you

271
00:26:17,625 --> 00:26:18,865
got in touch with Guérin.

272
00:26:19,125 --> 00:26:19,325
That

273
00:26:19,325 --> 00:26:20,525
what the hell were you doing with Guérin?

274
00:26:20,525 --> 00:26:20,858
Why don't you

275
00:26:20,858 --> 00:26:21,725
left Lina?

276
00:26:25,225 --> 00:26:25,865
Albert!

00:26:26,385 --> 00:26:26,740
C'

00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:27,005

00:26:27,105 --> 00:26:27,805
what the hell?

00:26:27,805 --> 00:26:28,155
C'

is you who

00:26:28,545 --> 00:26:28,785
said that it

283
00:26:28,785 --> 00:26:29,705
was he the culprit?

284
00:26:29,705 --> 00:26:30,825
Who is this Guérin?

285
00:26:30,825 --> 00:26:31,611
You '

286
00:26:31,611 --> 00:26:32,485

talk about it.

290
00:26:36,345 --> 00:26:36,985
Why?

C '

00:26:41,385 --> 00:26:42,485
But he had real power.

294
00:26:43,105 --> 00:26:44,205
Everyone hated him,

295
00:26:44,265 --> 00:26:46,045
but no one dared contradict him.

296
00:26:46,925 --> 00:26:48,245
What to manipulate without you realizing it.

C '

298

No,

300
00:26:53,245 --> 00:26:54,585
I was just investigating.

301
00:26:55,825 --> 00:26:58,485
To sell Foundation information to the press

302
00:26:58,485 --> 00:26:58,725
?

303
00:26:58,725 --> 00:26:59,065
No,

304
00:26:59,065 --> 00:26:59,745
it wasn't for that.

305
00:27:00,125 --> 00:27:01,745
I was doing a journalistic investigation.

306
00:27:02,145 --> 00:27:03,365
When you have an interesting subject,

307
00:27:03,645 --> 00:27:04,345
you deepen it.

J '

309
00:27:04,905 --> 00:27:06,305
simply did my job as a journalist.

310
00:27:07,565 --> 00:27:08,110
And that

311
00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:09,705
what did you find in the end?

312
00:27:09,705 --> 00:27:10,185
Nothing,

313
00:27:10,245 --> 00:27:10,925
precisely.

314
00:27:11,565 --> 00:27:12,665
All this traffic,

315
00:27:12,665 --> 00:27:13,265
that's bullshit.

316
00:27:14,145 --> 00:27:14,765
What's up?

00:27:16,925 --> 00:27:17,705
The problem?

320
00:27:17,705 --> 00:27:17,825
It

321
00:27:17,825 --> 00:27:18,165
no problem.

322
00:27:18,425 --> 00:27:18,971
So why don't you

323
00:27:18,971 --> 00:27:19,745
left Mina?

00:27:23,005 --> 00:27:23,475
Guérin the

327
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:23,685
knew,

328
00:27:23,745 --> 00:27:24,481
you managed to

329
00:27:24,481 --> 00:27:24,805
escape.

330
00:27:24,965 --> 00:27:26,845
But they killed your daughter to set an example.

331
00:27:27,105 --> 00:27:27,665
All of it,

332
00:27:27,665 --> 00:27:30,665
he's a monster!

333
00:27:31,805 --> 00:27:34,585
Did this circle really exist?

334
00:27:34,585 --> 00:27:35,065
Yes.

335
00:27:35,805 --> 00:27:36,385
But not the

336
00:27:36,385 --> 00:27:36,997
story of his

337
00:27:36,997 --> 00:27:37,225
child.

338
00:27:37,705 --> 00:27:38,065
This,

339
00:27:38,085 --> 00:27:38,585
it's not true.

340
00:27:39,205 --> 00:27:39,455
That

00:27:39,455 --> 00:27:39,960
who is

happened with Guérin?

00:27:43,285 --> 00:27:44,298
I swear to you

344
00:27:44,298 --> 00:27:45,625
I never stopped telling him to the press.

345
00:27:45,765 --> 00:27:46,150
C'

346
00:27:46,150 --> 00:27:46,745
is a misunderstanding.

347
00:27:46,745 --> 00:27:47,620
I'm sure that if I

348
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:48,265
explains Guérin,

349
00:27:48,305 --> 00:27:48,985
I explain myself to him.

350
00:27:49,205 --> 00:27:50,125
He'll understand.

351
00:27:50,605 --> 00:27:51,365
He's dead.

352
00:27:59,605 --> 00:28:01,265
Why were you doing that?

353
00:28:03,265 --> 00:28:04,565
To avenge Marie?

354
00:28:18,862 --> 00:28:24,465
I'm sorry to

355
00:28:24,465 --> 00:28:25,342
in this story.

356
00:28:26,662 --> 00:28:27,447
But it's

357
00:28:27,447 --> 00:28:29,342
is not the same if there's nothing in it.

358
00:28:31,762 --> 00:28:32,082
Now,

359
00:28:32,122 --> 00:28:33,222
we're the ones in danger.

00:28:35,362 --> 00:28:35,835
You don't

361
00:28:35,835 --> 00:28:37,702
you're not telling me that you want me to

363
00:28:37,822 --> 00:28:38,762
stop there?

364
00:28:40,282 --> 00:28:40,602
No,

365
00:28:40,622 --> 00:28:41,062
it's not that.

366
00:28:43,822 --> 00:28:44,342
Think carefully.

367
00:28:46,922 --> 00:28:47,152
That

368
00:28:47,152 --> 00:28:48,122
do you want to do?

369
00:28:48,922 --> 00:28:49,162
That

370
00:28:49,162 --> 00:28:50,522
what are you afraid of?

371
00:28:51,702 --> 00:28:52,922
If you need me,

372
00:28:53,022 --> 00:28:53,882
I'm here to help you.

373
00:28:54,822 --> 00:28:55,182
Now,

374
00:28:55,382 --> 00:28:57,442
you have to tell me clearly what you want.

375
00:28:57,442 --> 00:28:57,622
do.

376
00:29:05,602 --> 00:29:08,122
Do you mind if I stay by your side?

377
00:29:10,682 --> 00:29:12,462
Why won't you help me?

378
00:29:13,742 --> 00:29:14,702
I won't refuse it.

379
00:29:15,422 --> 00:29:16,495
If you want me

380
00:29:16,495 --> 00:29:16,682
go away,

381
00:29:16,842 --> 00:29:18,362
you tell me.

382
00:29:21,022 --> 00:29:22,282
I'm very sorry,

383
00:29:22,302 --> 00:29:22,642
Sayoko.

384
00:29:27,742 --> 00:29:29,082
We stay together,

385
00:29:29,282 --> 00:29:30,242
d' Accord?

386
00:29:30,982 --> 00:29:32,182
We'll look for it together,

Suki -Ran.

388
00:29:45,908 --> 00:29:47,968
What?

389
00:29:50,308 --> 00:29:52,388
Want to know where you can find Guérin?

390
00:29:53,228 --> 00:29:53,653
C'

00:29:53,653 --> 00:29:53,808
is this.

392
00:29:55,148 --> 00:29:56,248
He no longer lives in Paris.

393
00:29:57,148 --> 00:29:58,348
He's in the country.

394
00:29:58,608 --> 00:29:59,033
C'

395
00:29:59,033 --> 00:29:59,434
is a dream that

396
00:29:59,434 --> 00:29:59,988
he'd had for a long time.

397
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:10,685
C'

398
00:30:10,685 --> 00:30:10,930
is what,

399
00:30:11,010 --> 00:30:11,170
this?

400
00:30:13,230 --> 00:30:15,030
You'll soon have a companion.

401
00:30:15,390 --> 00:30:18,010
Let's compare your story with Guérin's.

402
00:30:19,650 --> 00:30:20,404
You will

403
00:30:20,404 --> 00:30:20,890
bring here?

404
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:21,596
But you

405
00:30:21,596 --> 00:30:22,250
are you crazy?

406
00:30:32,767 --> 00:30:37,893
You

407
00:30:37,893 --> 00:30:40,507
you Guérin. Do you remember what kind

408
00:30:40,507 --> 00:30:41,017
type c'

409
00:30:41,017 --> 00:30:42,567
was You think

410
00:30:42,567 --> 00:30:43,649
he'll throw the whole

411
00:30:43,649 --> 00:32:02,639
Monsieur Guérin?

412
00:32:04,899 --> 00:32:05,539
Mr Guérin,

413
00:32:05,539 --> 00:32:06,139
anyone home?

414
00:32:33,938 --> 00:32:39,778
We caught a lot of rabbit,

415
00:32:39,858 --> 00:32:40,158
no?

416
00:32:40,158 --> 00:32:40,538
Oh,

417
00:32:40,538 --> 00:32:40,638
ben,

418
00:32:40,658 --> 00:32:40,938
this way,

419
00:32:40,958 --> 00:32:41,358
game,

420
00:32:41,358 --> 00:32:41,598
I leave some.

421
00:32:41,858 --> 00:32:42,098
Here,

422
00:32:42,118 --> 00:32:43,538
you'd say it was good.

423
00:32:46,138 --> 00:32:46,458
Ah,

424
00:32:46,738 --> 00:32:46,898
this,

425
00:32:46,978 --> 00:32:47,738
it's boring,

426
00:32:47,818 --> 00:32:47,918
there.

427
00:32:49,998 --> 00:32:50,318
Good,

428
00:32:50,358 --> 00:32:51,058
I hope you enjoyed it,

429
00:32:51,098 --> 00:32:51,238
for that matter.

430
00:32:52,098 --> 00:32:52,678
Well, yes,

431
00:32:52,818 --> 00:32:53,338
it was great.

432
00:32:53,798 --> 00:32:54,151
J'

433
00:32:54,151 --> 00:32:54,498
loved it.

434
00:32:55,598 --> 00:32:57,178
Would you like me to teach you to shoot?

435
00:32:57,498 --> 00:32:57,818
Oh,

436
00:32:57,858 --> 00:32:58,098
no.

437
00:32:58,378 --> 00:32:58,778
C'

438
00:32:58,778 --> 00:32:59,958
is too violent for me.

439
00:33:01,638 --> 00:33:01,958
Come on,

440
00:33:01,998 --> 00:33:02,478
take one.

441
00:33:04,138 --> 00:33:04,538
Ah,

442
00:33:04,538 --> 00:33:04,938
thank you,

443
00:33:05,138 --> 00:33:05,458
Michel.

444
00:33:07,118 --> 00:33:07,518
Good,

445
00:33:07,618 --> 00:33:07,718
ben,

446
00:33:07,778 --> 00:33:08,578
come on,

447
00:33:08,678 --> 00:33:09,318
to the next one.

448
00:33:09,538 --> 00:33:09,618
C'

449
00:33:09,618 --> 00:33:09,778
is good.

450
00:33:11,158 --> 00:33:11,558
Oh,

451
00:33:11,558 --> 00:33:11,878
very well.

452
00:33:12,598 --> 00:33:12,998
Come on,

453
00:33:13,038 --> 00:33:13,278
you too.

454
00:33:29,626 --> 00:33:34,246
Who are you?

455
00:33:34,246 --> 00:33:34,526
That

456
00:33:34,526 --> 00:33:35,866
what are you doing at my place?

457
00:33:36,506 --> 00:33:37,226
Albert Bacheret.

458
00:33:37,386 --> 00:33:38,686
I worked at the Foundation.

459
00:33:40,006 --> 00:33:40,986
Albert Bacheret?

460
00:33:43,626 --> 00:33:44,206
Ah yes,

461
00:33:44,266 --> 00:33:45,366
Albert!

462
00:33:46,166 --> 00:33:47,426
But it makes peace,

463
00:33:47,426 --> 00:33:47,586
he says.

464
00:33:48,946 --> 00:33:49,176
That

465
00:33:49,176 --> 00:33:50,526
what are you doing here?

466
00:33:51,086 --> 00:33:51,463
J'

467
00:33:51,463 --> 00:33:52,166
should have warned you,

468
00:33:52,206 --> 00:33:52,266
M.

469
00:33:52,406 --> 00:33:52,706
Guérin,

470
00:33:52,746 --> 00:33:54,186
but I had no choice.

471
00:33:55,306 --> 00:33:56,486
The choice of what?

472
00:33:56,486 --> 00:33:57,226
I don't get it.

473
00:33:58,446 --> 00:33:59,906
We'd like you to come with us.

474
00:34:00,866 --> 00:34:02,146
And for what?

475
00:34:02,786 --> 00:34:03,126
On n '

476
00:34:03,126 --> 00:34:04,306
doesn't have time to explain.

477
00:34:05,626 --> 00:34:07,066
And you are?

478
00:34:07,066 --> 00:34:07,661
C '

479
00:34:07,661 --> 00:34:08,266
is my partner.

480
00:34:10,906 --> 00:34:11,786
Pierre Guérin.

481
00:34:12,946 --> 00:34:14,866
Former head of the Minard Foundation.

482
00:34:16,306 --> 00:34:17,986
Your reputation is well known.

483
00:34:18,966 --> 00:34:20,226
You knew that

484
00:34:20,226 --> 00:34:20,486
one day,

485
00:34:20,606 --> 00:34:23,446
we would have come to get you and make you pay

486
00:34:23,446 --> 00:34:24,406
everything you've done.

487
00:34:24,806 --> 00:34:25,246
Ah,

488
00:34:25,266 --> 00:34:26,006
I see,

489
00:34:26,086 --> 00:34:26,706
you're happy.

490
00:34:27,886 --> 00:34:30,166
Sent by one of my former collaborators who

491
00:34:30,166 --> 00:34:30,946
wants to get back at me,

492
00:34:31,026 --> 00:34:31,546
is that it?

493
00:34:31,546 --> 00:34:32,886
She has no connection with Minard.

494
00:34:33,506 --> 00:34:34,086
And from

495
00:34:34,086 --> 00:34:35,126
where she gets all her stories,

496
00:34:35,126 --> 00:34:36,006
then?

497
00:34:36,366 --> 00:34:36,666
This,

498
00:34:36,766 --> 00:34:38,366
it's because ...

499
00:34:38,926 --> 00:34:39,226
M.

500
00:34:39,366 --> 00:34:40,686
Guérin?

501
00:34:41,966 --> 00:34:42,292
J '

502
00:34:42,292 --> 00:34:42,926
heard voices,

503
00:34:42,986 --> 00:34:43,106
there,

504
00:34:43,126 --> 00:34:43,446
How are you?

505
00:34:43,446 --> 00:34:43,486
...

506
00:35:02,359 --> 00:35:07,359
Qu '

507
00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:07,999
is what you're doing here,

508
00:35:08,019 --> 00:35:08,579
you?

509
00:35:12,279 --> 00:35:12,559
Oh,

510
00:35:12,599 --> 00:35:12,859
Albert,

511
00:35:13,059 --> 00:35:13,579
How are you?

512
00:35:13,579 --> 00:35:14,039
J'

513
00:35:14,039 --> 00:35:14,399
understood.

514
00:35:15,699 --> 00:35:16,359
Fix your thing,

515
00:35:16,459 --> 00:35:16,559
there,

516
00:35:16,559 --> 00:35:16,779
I'm fine.

517
00:35:26,159 --> 00:35:26,439
What,

518
00:35:26,459 --> 00:35:27,019
I slip into it,

519
00:35:27,139 --> 00:35:28,019
is that it?

520
00:35:29,079 --> 00:35:29,559
Ah,

521
00:35:29,559 --> 00:35:30,039
fuck.

522
00:35:31,179 --> 00:35:31,993
If I

523
00:35:31,993 --> 00:35:34,599
expected to experience something so absurd at my age.

524
00:35:41,222 --> 00:35:42,562
Come on.

525
00:37:04,397 --> 00:37:09,337
This is it,

526
00:37:09,397 --> 00:37:09,757
we got it.

527
00:37:10,757 --> 00:37:10,937
Pepe,

528
00:37:10,937 --> 00:37:11,177
is you.

529
00:37:39,235 --> 00:37:44,515
Downstream,

530
00:37:44,535 --> 00:37:45,015
good morning.

531
00:37:45,795 --> 00:37:46,627
If I

532
00:37:46,627 --> 00:37:48,295
expected to see you again in such a situation.

533
00:37:50,235 --> 00:37:51,295
Ah fuck,

534
00:37:51,295 --> 00:37:58,754
again!

535
00:37:58,754 --> 00:38:06,213
C'

536
00:38:06,213 --> 00:38:07,848
is my daughter you killed.

537
00:38:08,368 --> 00:38:08,780
What's up?

538
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:09,193
C'

539
00:38:09,193 --> 00:38:09,628
is he who

540
00:38:09,628 --> 00:38:10,108
said that?

541
00:38:10,108 --> 00:38:10,328
No,

542
00:38:10,388 --> 00:38:10,548
no,

543
00:38:10,548 --> 00:38:11,648
I didn't say that.

544
00:38:11,728 --> 00:38:11,808
J'

545
00:38:11,808 --> 00:38:12,481
simply said that

546
00:38:12,481 --> 00:38:14,574
he had to leave the Foundation because

547
00:38:14,574 --> 00:38:15,268
he was afraid of you.

548
00:38:15,368 --> 00:38:15,888
Afraid of me?

549
00:38:15,888 --> 00:38:15,948
No,

550
00:38:15,988 --> 00:38:16,648
but you're kidding.

551
00:38:18,368 --> 00:38:20,194
But how could you be afraid of someone

552
00:38:20,194 --> 00:38:21,348
one like me?

553
00:38:21,348 --> 00:38:21,744
You can

554
00:38:21,744 --> 00:38:22,461
threatened because

555
00:38:22,461 --> 00:38:25,368
he tried to divulge the Foundation's secret

556
00:38:25,368 --> 00:38:26,128
to the press,

557
00:38:26,148 --> 00:38:26,568
no?

558
00:38:26,568 --> 00:38:28,728
What the hell are you talking about?

559
00:38:28,728 --> 00:38:31,008
The secret of the circle.

560
00:38:31,548 --> 00:38:32,108
What?

561
00:38:32,108 --> 00:38:32,688
What circle?

562
00:38:32,688 --> 00:38:34,108
What secret?

563
00:38:36,508 --> 00:38:37,068
Albert,

564
00:38:37,068 --> 00:38:37,748
explain.

565
00:38:38,668 --> 00:38:39,228
Me,

566
00:38:39,228 --> 00:38:40,008
I don't know.

567
00:38:40,068 --> 00:38:40,168
C '

568
00:38:40,168 --> 00:38:40,868
he invented it.

569
00:38:43,068 --> 00:38:46,148
But you were conducting an investigation at Minard's?

570
00:38:46,968 --> 00:38:47,248
No,

571
00:38:47,328 --> 00:38:47,388
no,

572
00:38:47,388 --> 00:38:47,508
no,

573
00:38:47,508 --> 00:38:47,948
it's not that.

574
00:38:48,028 --> 00:38:49,888
I was doing some journalistic research.

575
00:38:50,788 --> 00:38:52,608
And the result?

576
00:38:53,208 --> 00:38:53,588
Nothing.

577
00:38:54,368 --> 00:38:54,928
Ah,

578
00:38:54,948 --> 00:38:55,088
here it is.

579
00:38:58,948 --> 00:38:59,308
Good,

580
00:38:59,308 --> 00:38:59,668
listening,

581
00:38:59,668 --> 00:38:59,848
Albert.

582
00:39:01,808 --> 00:39:02,168
Me,

583
00:39:02,268 --> 00:39:03,988
I've always considered you a friend.

584
00:39:05,348 --> 00:39:05,876
And I '

585
00:39:05,876 --> 00:39:06,353
hope it '

586
00:39:06,353 --> 00:39:07,268
is the same for you.

587
00:39:07,468 --> 00:39:07,828
Yes.

588
00:39:09,128 --> 00:39:10,168
Do you think it's

589
00:39:10,168 --> 00:39:10,688
is how

590
00:39:10,688 --> 00:39:11,388
treating a friend?

591
00:39:21,494 --> 00:39:27,394
I'm completely lost,

592
00:39:27,594 --> 00:39:27,734
M.

593
00:39:27,934 --> 00:39:28,234
Guérin.

594
00:39:29,214 --> 00:39:31,134
I don't know where the truth lies anymore.

595
00:39:32,874 --> 00:39:33,754
Trust me.

596
00:39:35,094 --> 00:39:36,774
We trust an old friend.

597
00:39:37,674 --> 00:39:39,494
I'll tell you the truth.

598
00:39:39,574 --> 00:39:42,056
The circle sold children to the

599
00:39:42,056 --> 00:39:44,394
and killed those he couldn't live with.

600
00:39:44,394 --> 00:39:44,974
get rid of them.

601
00:39:45,074 --> 00:39:45,534
Here it is,

602
00:39:45,654 --> 00:39:46,274
the truth.

603
00:39:46,534 --> 00:39:46,974
Laval,

604
00:39:46,994 --> 00:39:48,554
are you out of your mind?

605
00:39:50,114 --> 00:39:53,234
He tried to leak the story to the press.

606
00:39:53,234 --> 00:39:55,934
and he had to leave the foundation because

607
00:39:55,934 --> 00:39:57,134
he was afraid of you and you,

608
00:39:57,174 --> 00:40:00,214
you kidnapped his daughter and killed her for

609
00:40:00,214 --> 00:40:00,954
make an example.

610
00:40:01,974 --> 00:40:02,434
Albert,

611
00:40:02,434 --> 00:40:04,874
you're the one who breathed nonsense into him

612
00:40:04,874 --> 00:40:05,574
the same?

613
00:40:05,574 --> 00:40:05,754
No,

614
00:40:05,794 --> 00:40:06,214
it's not me.

615
00:40:08,574 --> 00:40:09,034
Good,

616
00:40:09,074 --> 00:40:09,434
Laval,

617
00:40:09,434 --> 00:40:11,554
your story is completely absurd.

618
00:40:14,134 --> 00:40:14,597
That

619
00:40:14,597 --> 00:40:15,254
who is

620
00:40:15,254 --> 00:40:15,794
has passed?

621
00:40:16,654 --> 00:40:18,334
If you've made a mistake,

622
00:40:18,554 --> 00:40:19,814
don't be afraid to talk to me about it.

623
00:40:19,894 --> 00:40:19,940
But I

624
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:20,694
haven't done anything!

625
00:40:20,694 --> 00:40:21,459
They '

626
00:40:21,459 --> 00:40:22,094
Looks like we're here,

627
00:40:22,214 --> 00:40:22,374
there,

628
00:40:22,394 --> 00:40:23,294
without explaining anything.

629
00:40:23,534 --> 00:40:26,554
They call us pfff!

630
00:40:27,914 --> 00:40:28,794
I swear.

631
00:40:31,314 --> 00:40:31,634
Good,

632
00:40:31,634 --> 00:40:31,954
mademoiselle,

633
00:40:31,974 --> 00:40:32,374
you see.

634
00:40:34,194 --> 00:40:34,654
Mademoiselle?

635
00:40:37,574 --> 00:40:37,894
Mademoiselle,

636
00:40:37,934 --> 00:40:39,734
I don't know what your goal is,

637
00:40:39,734 --> 00:40:40,730
but as you can see

638
00:40:40,730 --> 00:40:41,020
is about

639
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:41,694
a misunderstanding.

640
00:40:42,854 --> 00:40:43,834
Then free me!

641
00:40:59,117 --> 00:41:04,930
It looks like

642
00:41:04,930 --> 00:41:05,277
a snake.

643
00:41:07,937 --> 00:41:08,603
Perhaps

644
00:41:08,603 --> 00:41:09,553
we can stop here for today

645
00:41:09,553 --> 00:41:09,697
today.

646
00:41:17,317 --> 00:41:17,892
C'

647
00:41:17,892 --> 00:41:18,297
is who,

648
00:41:18,417 --> 00:41:19,297
this one?

649
00:41:20,657 --> 00:41:21,577
A Japanese woman,

650
00:41:21,597 --> 00:41:22,217
I think.

651
00:41:30,257 --> 00:41:30,517
J'

652
00:41:30,517 --> 00:41:31,377
was a little disturbed,

653
00:41:31,377 --> 00:41:31,797
but I swear,

654
00:41:31,817 --> 00:41:32,217
I'm not lying to you.

655
00:41:33,817 --> 00:41:34,530
No matter what

656
00:41:34,530 --> 00:41:35,037
he recounts,

657
00:41:35,177 --> 00:41:37,417
our goal remains the same.

658
00:41:38,117 --> 00:41:38,577
You're from

659
00:41:38,577 --> 00:41:38,817
agreement?

660
00:42:14,176 --> 00:42:19,616
Uh-oh!

661
00:42:20,336 --> 00:42:20,796
J'

662
00:42:20,796 --> 00:42:21,156
need

663
00:42:21,156 --> 00:42:21,756
go to the toilet.

664
00:42:25,136 --> 00:42:25,576
Albert,

665
00:42:25,696 --> 00:42:26,576
can you hear me?

666
00:42:28,376 --> 00:42:30,236
You have to let me go to the bathroom now.

667
00:42:31,136 --> 00:42:32,356
There's no point.

668
00:42:33,156 --> 00:42:33,936
I beg your pardon?

669
00:42:35,236 --> 00:42:37,276
I'm telling you, it's no use.

670
00:42:51,856 --> 00:43:07,256
I'm telling you, it's no use.

671
00:43:07,276 --> 00:43:08,156
I'm telling you, it's no use.

672
00:43:08,156 --> 00:43:08,576
Enough is enough,

673
00:43:08,576 --> 00:43:08,796
Albert.

674
00:43:09,696 --> 00:43:10,936
You'll end up here.

675
00:43:13,076 --> 00:43:15,136
You don't care if you think you can go on

676
00:43:15,136 --> 00:43:15,656
like this.

677
00:43:25,076 --> 00:43:27,936
You'll have to see another one when you can.

678
00:43:35,704 --> 00:43:40,870
I don't

679
00:43:40,870 --> 00:43:43,044
still couldn't sleep last night.

680
00:43:43,424 --> 00:43:43,864
No.

681
00:43:45,844 --> 00:43:46,364
You,

682
00:43:46,364 --> 00:43:46,824
you like me,

683
00:43:46,904 --> 00:43:47,084
Anna.

684
00:43:47,284 --> 00:43:48,484
You're always so calm.

685
00:43:48,864 --> 00:43:49,489
It's not

686
00:43:49,489 --> 00:43:49,924
is not true.

687
00:43:51,304 --> 00:43:52,204
Really?

688
00:43:52,204 --> 00:43:52,764
No.

689
00:43:58,864 --> 00:43:59,544
This is it,

690
00:43:59,564 --> 00:44:00,904
do you think we'll make it?

691
00:44:02,424 --> 00:44:03,264
Of course you can.

692
00:44:04,864 --> 00:44:05,264
Otherwise,

693
00:44:05,264 --> 00:44:06,564
what's the point of all this?

694
00:44:14,363 --> 00:44:19,436
J'

695
00:44:19,436 --> 00:44:20,503
have no idea what's going to happen.

696
00:44:47,249 --> 00:45:01,029
アルバーすみません、時間の問題だ。

697
00:45:02,249 --> 00:45:07,609
戦争を操らないといけないほぼ終わりだ。

698
00:45:08,109 --> 00:45:09,069
応援する必要がある。

699
00:45:09,069 --> 00:45:18,589
正解だ、マリー・バシュレイ8歳死亡の場所はセナーの森の近く死亡

700
00:45:18,589 --> 00:45:23,148
したのは1週間後全体に16本の刃を刺しています。

701
00:45:23,909 --> 00:45:33,089
右腕と左腕のマジョンの破裂、死亡前腹部と頭の痛み多くの痛み、腹

うダメかもしれません。

704
00:45:53,649 --> 00:46:01,449
フランス人は誰も詐欺師に見えるし通訳は嘘ばっかりつきますみん

705
00:46:01,449 --> 00:46:07,889
なで酔ってたがって僕をダメにしようとしてるんですもう少し強い

薬を出しておきましょうか僕は先生みたいに憧れの人がいる憧れて

707
00:46:14,909 --> 00:46:20,649
この国に来たわけじゃないからなあと2年ですよ任期が終わるまで

708
00:46:23,809 --> 00:46:30,629
どうしたらいいんですか一度帰国された方がいいかもしれませんね

709
00:46:35,129 --> 00:46:42,929
これで日本に帰ったら僕はもういよいよ終わりです終わり？

710
00:46:44,929 --> 00:46:45,949
何が終わるんです？

711
00:46:47,509 --> 00:46:49,249
終わって困るものがあるんですか？

712
00:46:50,889 --> 00:46:53,149
本当に苦しいのは終わらないことでしょ？

713
00:46:55,509 --> 00:47:10,865
もう分かってるはずですよ吉村さん、あなたならできますはいそうで

714
00:47:10,865 --> 00:48:06,800
すねénéと一つの......ご視聴ありがとうございましたさやこさやこ聞

have something to offer you.

720
00:49:36,010 --> 00:49:36,830
He and I,

721
00:49:36,910 --> 00:49:38,810
we've known each other for a while.

722
00:49:39,790 --> 00:49:41,570
But I'm getting tired of it.

723
00:49:43,010 --> 00:49:45,550
How would you like to put an end to

724
00:49:45,550 --> 00:49:46,150
this game?

725
00:49:46,690 --> 00:49:46,980
That

726
00:49:46,980 --> 00:49:48,790
do you mean?

727
00:49:49,370 --> 00:49:50,243
It's up to you

728
00:49:50,243 --> 00:49:50,890
invent a little,

729
00:49:50,990 --> 00:49:51,410
commissioner.

730
00:49:53,990 --> 00:49:55,650
But why would we do that?

731
00:49:56,170 --> 00:49:57,430
You don't want

732
00:49:57,430 --> 00:49:58,330
shall we set you free?

733
00:49:58,890 --> 00:49:59,360
C'

734
00:49:59,360 --> 00:50:00,810
what's your goal?

735
00:50:02,130 --> 00:50:03,623
No matter who it is

736
00:50:03,623 --> 00:50:03,790
act.

737
00:50:04,970 --> 00:50:07,476
Designate a new enemy and he won't

738
00:50:07,476 --> 00:50:09,130
won't care about you anymore.

739
00:50:10,390 --> 00:50:11,020
You don't

740
00:50:11,020 --> 00:50:12,323
didn't you have an idea of someone

741
00:50:12,323 --> 00:50:14,910
one who could replace you?

742
00:50:17,390 --> 00:50:17,830
Chris.

743
00:50:19,230 --> 00:50:20,230
It could be Christian,

744
00:50:20,350 --> 00:50:21,350
no?

745
00:50:21,770 --> 00:50:23,130
You mean Christian Samy,

746
00:50:23,150 --> 00:50:24,770
the security type?

747
00:50:24,770 --> 00:50:25,355
C'

748
00:50:25,355 --> 00:50:25,930
is a bad guy,

749
00:50:25,970 --> 00:50:26,570
he's a real bastard,

750
00:50:26,590 --> 00:50:26,690
him.

751
00:50:28,810 --> 00:50:29,170
Yes,

752
00:50:29,230 --> 00:50:29,770
That's right.

753
00:50:30,310 --> 00:50:32,430
And in the way he conducts himself with women,

754
00:50:32,570 --> 00:50:33,750
he's a monster.

755
00:50:35,350 --> 00:50:36,830
He has the ideal profile.

756
00:50:39,670 --> 00:50:40,030
OK,

757
00:50:40,030 --> 00:50:41,030
you decide.

758
00:50:42,570 --> 00:50:44,136
Pay particular attention to the '

759
00:50:44,136 --> 00:50:45,490
story you're going to tell.

760
00:50:47,850 --> 00:50:48,210
Thank you.

761
00:50:54,390 --> 00:50:54,750
Thank you.

762
00:50:54,770 --> 00:50:55,190
Christian Samy,

763
00:50:55,230 --> 00:50:57,230
WHO IS THAT?

764
00:50:57,230 --> 00:50:57,743
C '

765
00:50:57,743 --> 00:51:00,190

766
00:51:01,030 --> 00:51:01,495
C '

767
00:51:01,495 --> 00:51:02,286
it's possible that you don't

768
00:51:02,286 --> 00:51:02,990
ever come across,

769
00:51:03,350 --> 00:51:05,170
but he's a real pervert.

770
00:51:06,390 --> 00:51:06,810
Absolutely,

771
00:51:06,890 --> 00:51:07,030
Yes.

772
00:51:08,370 --> 00:51:08,810
J '

773
00:51:08,810 --> 00:51:10,150
have always been reluctant to

774
00:51:10,150 --> 00:51:11,190
idea of keeping him at Mina's.

775
00:51:12,250 --> 00:51:12,686
J '

776
00:51:12,686 --> 00:51:13,676
had a feeling that

777
00:51:13,676 --> 00:51:15,850
one day this guy would end up making a huge

778
00:51:15,850 --> 00:51:16,310
bullshit.

779
00:51:17,270 --> 00:51:18,570
And here's the result.

780
00:51:21,070 --> 00:51:23,210
I'm so sorry about your daughter.

781
00:51:24,170 --> 00:51:26,233
I feel responsible for my own life.

782
00:51:26,233 --> 00:51:26,910
have done anything.

783
00:51:27,750 --> 00:51:29,390
And to tell you the truth,

784
00:51:29,430 --> 00:51:30,923
I would never have imagined that

785
00:51:30,923 --> 00:51:32,150
he'd go that far.

786
00:51:33,510 --> 00:51:34,650
You're a kid.

787
00:51:38,470 --> 00:51:41,210
He may have discovered your daughter when he saw her

788
00:51:41,210 --> 00:51:42,170
name in a folder.

789
00:51:43,270 --> 00:51:43,805
C '

790
00:51:43,805 --> 00:51:44,670
is a horrible story.

791
00:51:49,110 --> 00:51:49,950
Christian Samy,

792
00:51:50,030 --> 00:51:50,950
I agree.

793
00:51:51,310 --> 00:51:51,790
OK,

794
00:51:51,790 --> 00:51:52,290
here we are at last.

795
00:52:02,190 --> 00:52:08,030
We'll go and get it.

796
00:52:09,730 --> 00:52:10,690
On the other hand,

797
00:52:10,830 --> 00:52:13,930
it will be necessary to go towards a place to take it.

798
00:52:13,930 --> 00:52:14,150
here.

799
00:52:15,710 --> 00:52:16,040
C '

800
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:16,610
is a shame.

801
00:52:55,925 --> 00:53:03,105
I'll let you decide for yourself who's going to

802
00:53:03,105 --> 00:53:04,705
stay and the one who's leaving.

803
00:53:12,937 --> 00:53:14,217
Hey!

804
00:53:14,217 --> 00:53:16,377
Oh!

805
00:53:16,377 --> 00:53:17,967
C '

806
00:53:17,967 --> 00:53:19,337
is not what you promised!

807
00:54:24,159 --> 00:54:29,194
Qu '

808
00:54:29,194 --> 00:54:29,724
is it c '

809
00:54:29,724 --> 00:54:31,399
is all this bullshit?

810
00:54:32,099 --> 00:54:33,319
We'll find Christian.

811
00:54:33,479 --> 00:54:36,379
We'll compare your story with his.

812
00:54:38,859 --> 00:54:39,414
N '

813
00:54:39,414 --> 00:54:40,199

814
00:54:41,679 --> 00:54:42,199
Sayoko,

815
00:54:42,379 --> 00:54:43,959
what should i do now?

816
00:54:44,519 --> 00:54:45,139
Mr. Hira,

817
00:54:45,219 --> 00:54:46,679
we'll be taken to Christian's.

818
00:54:55,259 --> 00:54:58,726
There is a warehouse used as a

819
00:54:58,726 --> 00:55:00,419
archive for the foundation.

820
00:55:03,559 --> 00:55:04,059
Oh,

821
00:55:04,099 --> 00:55:05,299
you may not believe me.

822
00:55:06,639 --> 00:55:07,539
You have

823
00:55:07,539 --> 00:55:08,219
other options?

824
00:56:15,619 --> 00:56:20,699
C'

825
00:56:20,699 --> 00:56:20,899
is good,

826
00:56:20,899 --> 00:56:45,266
we're happy to go,

827
00:56:45,266 --> 00:56:48,266
you're here we've been trying for a year

828
00:56:48,266 --> 00:56:50,586
change the owner,

829
00:56:50,586 --> 00:56:53,426
rents are always ready, but okay,

830
00:56:53,426 --> 00:56:55,946
at a given moment if there is no sign of

831
00:56:55,946 --> 00:56:57,292
life owner at the end of

832
00:56:57,292 --> 00:56:57,506
one year,

833
00:56:57,506 --> 00:57:01,886
we're obliged to help with everything.

834
00:57:01,886 --> 00:57:03,846
Go ahead,

835
00:57:03,846 --> 00:57:05,566
we make a sign.

836
00:57:05,566 --> 00:58:19,983
You've finished Look at the

837
00:58:19,983 --> 00:58:22,832
man on the right,

838
00:58:22,832 --> 00:58:25,687
it's him,

839
00:58:25,807 --> 00:59:17,727
Christian Guérin,

840
00:59:17,747 --> 00:59:18,157
WHAT IT IS

841
00:59:18,157 --> 00:59:18,467
is this?

842
00:59:25,432 --> 00:59:31,892
I don't know,

843
00:59:32,072 --> 00:59:35,372
it must surely be a medical collection of the

844
00:59:35,372 --> 00:59:35,832
Foundation.

845
00:59:38,452 --> 00:59:38,905
So it's

846
00:59:38,905 --> 00:59:39,772
wasn't just a rumor,

847
00:59:39,792 --> 00:59:40,700
the history of

848
00:59:40,700 --> 00:59:40,932
children,

849
00:59:40,972 --> 00:59:42,312
is that it?

850
00:59:42,312 --> 00:59:43,432
So they did kill the children,

851
00:59:43,512 --> 00:59:45,272
but they couldn't get rid of it?

852
00:59:47,952 --> 00:59:48,272
Albert,

853
00:59:48,272 --> 00:59:48,932
listen carefully,

854
00:59:49,032 --> 00:59:51,292
this woman is manipulating you,

855
00:59:52,072 --> 00:59:53,382
I have nothing to do with the

856
00:59:53,382 --> 00:59:54,032
your daughter's story,

857
00:59:54,172 --> 00:59:55,252
nor Laval,

858
00:59:55,292 --> 00:59:56,772
or Christian for that matter,

859
00:59:57,312 --> 00:59:58,864
it's all lies that

860
00:59:58,864 --> 00:59:59,252
she tells you,

861
00:59:59,292 --> 00:59:59,952
do you understand?

862
01:00:02,512 --> 01:00:03,237
Explain to me what

863
01:00:03,237 --> 01:00:03,892
I'll be damned!

864
01:00:05,572 --> 01:00:06,062
But it's

865
01:00:06,062 --> 01:00:07,632
is just a medical collection,

866
01:00:07,632 --> 01:00:08,752
it's nothing!

867
01:00:22,767 --> 01:00:25,937
At the

868
01:00:25,937 --> 01:00:28,627
winter we'll be heard,

869
01:00:30,627 --> 01:01:39,234
tu as raison j'ai tué Guérin J'

870
01:01:39,234 --> 01:01:39,828
returned the keys.

871
01:01:39,868 --> 01:01:40,513
The guard

872
01:01:40,513 --> 01:01:41,128
didn't realize anything.

873
01:01:46,689 --> 01:01:50,629
Christian?

874
01:01:51,449 --> 01:01:52,669
Do I know him?

875
01:01:52,669 --> 01:01:53,349
No.

876
01:01:55,609 --> 01:01:56,429
Take a good look.

877
01:02:00,849 --> 01:02:01,969
This gym,

878
01:02:02,069 --> 01:02:02,789

Who it

882
01:03:12,794 --> 01:03:13,394
is this where you fall?

883
01:04:21,731 --> 01:04:22,391
Oh,

884
01:04:22,391 --> 01:04:22,471
my God.

885
01:04:49,859 --> 01:04:52,885

887
01:04:53,005 --> 01:04:53,399

888
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:07,080
Thanks.

889
01:05:42,750 --> 01:05:48,050
He's dead.

890
01:05:49,770 --> 01:05:50,610
In any case,

891
01:05:50,690 --> 01:05:51,190
he deserved it.

892
01:05:55,190 --> 01:05:55,745
It

893
01:05:55,745 --> 01:05:56,190
is not dead.

Where are we?

I'm fine.

No.

Nothing.

nothing has happened yet.

925
01:08:03,752 --> 01:08:17,812
He must be killed,

934
01:09:32,113 --> 01:09:33,183
is just a nightmare,

935
01:09:33,223 --> 01:09:36,343
it seems easy enough to put up with.

couldn't

a single stroke,

948
01:10:53,380 --> 01:10:56,500
he took out a knife and slit his own throat

949
01:10:56,500 --> 01:10:57,140
saying that

950
01:10:57,140 --> 01:10:58,200
he put an end to everything.

951
01:11:16,247 --> 01:11:22,293
He left in the

952
01:11:22,293 --> 01:11:23,527
other world where

953
01:11:23,527 --> 01:11:24,547
feels more pain.

954
01:11:26,907 --> 01:11:29,200
My mother used to say

955
01:11:29,200 --> 01:11:32,787
was a place filled with soft lights and that

956
01:11:32,787 --> 01:11:35,307
everyone would appreciate anything

957
01:11:35,307 --> 01:11:35,607
he did.

958
01:11:39,547 --> 01:11:40,112
C'

959
01:11:40,112 --> 01:11:41,013
is a kind of

960
01:11:41,013 --> 01:11:44,687
eternity that has a real reality out there.

961
01:11:46,247 --> 01:11:47,540
So much so that

962
01:11:47,540 --> 01:11:49,247
you can even touch it.

963
01:12:19,541 --> 01:12:24,641
Ah,

01:12:24,641 --> 01:12:24,881

Oco,

01:12:25,101 --> 01:12:25,761
are you done yet?

967
01:12:26,201 --> 01:12:27,441
Why are you here?

968
01:12:27,441 --> 01:12:28,697
I wanted to change

969
01:12:28,697 --> 01:12:28,981
idea.

970
01:12:29,661 --> 01:12:31,501
I'm going crazy staying cooped up there too long

971
01:12:31,501 --> 01:12:31,741
a long time.

972
01:12:37,674 --> 01:12:43,114
And Christian,

973
01:12:43,334 --> 01:12:44,194
What's it like?

974
01:12:44,194 --> 01:12:44,774
The same.

975
01:12:44,814 --> 01:12:45,974
He looks like a wild beast.

976
01:12:48,594 --> 01:12:48,954
Otherwise,

977
01:12:48,954 --> 01:12:49,174
there's this.

978
01:12:55,331 --> 01:13:00,487
But what

979
01:13:00,487 --> 01:13:00,637
can

980
01:13:00,637 --> 01:13:00,991
we'll make

981
01:13:00,991 --> 01:13:01,171
them?

982
01:13:02,051 --> 01:13:03,971
Can't we keep them at our place?

983
01:13:04,511 --> 01:13:06,351
We can't take them for a walk all the time, can we?

984
01:13:06,351 --> 01:13:06,531
more.

985
01:13:08,311 --> 01:13:08,631
We don't

986
01:13:08,631 --> 01:13:09,591
has not finished with the problems.

987
01:13:17,731 --> 01:13:18,044
J'

988
01:13:18,044 --> 01:13:18,531
never believed that

989
01:13:18,531 --> 01:13:19,131
we could go as far as

990
01:13:19,131 --> 01:13:19,311
to there.

991
01:13:20,251 --> 01:13:20,731
All of it,

992
01:13:20,771 --> 01:13:21,291
it's all thanks to you.

993
01:13:22,571 --> 01:13:22,851
No,

994
01:13:22,851 --> 01:13:23,691
this is not true.

995
01:13:24,731 --> 01:13:24,971
Yes,

996
01:13:25,051 --> 01:13:25,711
it's all thanks to you.

997
01:13:27,491 --> 01:13:28,031
When you're here,

998
01:13:28,071 --> 01:13:28,731
I feel soothed.

999
01:13:30,791 --> 01:13:31,056
C'

1000
01:13:31,056 --> 01:13:32,591
is as if my mind were suddenly clear.

1001
01:13:32,591 --> 01:13:32,691
blow.

1002
01:13:37,391 --> 01:13:37,631
You,

1003
01:13:37,651 --> 01:13:38,531
there's something magical about you,

1004
01:13:38,531 --> 01:13:38,951
this is the shot.

1005
01:13:43,271 --> 01:13:44,591
Do you remember the first time

1006
01:13:44,591 --> 01:13:44,736
we

1007
01:13:44,736 --> 01:13:45,951
is met in the center?

1008
01:13:46,771 --> 01:13:47,011
Yes.

1009
01:13:51,311 --> 01:13:51,591
J'

1010
01:13:51,591 --> 01:13:52,531
was at the end of its rope at the

1011
01:13:52,531 --> 01:13:52,671
era,

1012
01:13:52,771 --> 01:13:54,351
but you,

1013
01:13:54,431 --> 01:13:55,231
you've given me new hope.

1014
01:13:59,591 --> 01:14:01,251
Maybe it's part of your therapy,

1015
01:14:02,251 --> 01:14:03,451
which continues to this day.

1016
01:14:10,971 --> 01:14:11,591
But this too,

1017
01:14:11,631 --> 01:14:12,371
it'll soon be over,

1018
01:14:12,431 --> 01:14:13,151
isn't it?

1019
01:14:14,311 --> 01:14:14,631
Yes.

1020
01:14:19,731 --> 01:14:19,981
That

1021
01:14:19,981 --> 01:14:21,491
what are you going to do once everything is

1022
01:14:21,491 --> 01:14:22,051
finished?

1023
01:14:26,751 --> 01:14:27,231
No idea.

1024
01:14:28,431 --> 01:14:29,591
I never thought about it.

1025
01:14:31,491 --> 01:14:31,771
Me,

1026
01:14:31,791 --> 01:14:32,651
I'd love to go to Japan.

1027
01:14:37,971 --> 01:14:38,711
But maybe

1028
01:14:38,711 --> 01:14:39,151
is a little too long.

1029
01:14:46,146 --> 01:15:09,566

変わりないよそう?

1036

1044
01:18:06,468 --> 01:18:06,768
questions.

1045
01:18:07,688 --> 01:18:08,748
Every time you refuse to

1046
01:18:08,748 --> 01:18:09,068
learn from it,

1047
01:18:09,148 --> 01:18:09,768
I'll get a finger.

1048
01:18:11,208 --> 01:18:11,588
When t '

1049
01:18:11,588 --> 01:18:11,928
more,

1050
01:18:11,988 --> 01:18:12,468
I'll switch to the arm.

1051
01:18:15,328 --> 01:18:15,888
Christian Samy,

1052
01:18:16,788 --> 01:18:17,202
t ' es l '

1053
01:18:17,202 --> 01:18:18,848
former head of security at the Foundation

1054
01:18:18,848 --> 01:18:19,168
Minard.

1055
01:18:30,899 --> 01:18:36,279
I'll take the '

1056
01:18:36,279 --> 01:18:36,359
air,

1057
01:18:36,459 --> 01:18:38,919
I'll be right back. I swear I will.

1058
01:18:38,919 --> 01:20:19,529
do when I come back Why are you angry with me?

1059
01:20:19,529 --> 01:20:20,429
so much?

1060
01:20:22,789 --> 01:20:24,689
I thought you'd gotten better.

1061
01:20:25,709 --> 01:20:27,789
We lost three days because of you.

1062
01:20:35,929 --> 01:20:37,289
I'll make you a deal.

1063
01:20:46,247 --> 01:20:52,067
I know the little girl.

1064
01:20:53,867 --> 01:20:54,507
What do you mean?

1065
01:20:56,987 --> 01:20:57,567
I

1066
01:20:57,567 --> 01:20:58,787
I saw in a video when I

1067
01:20:58,787 --> 01:20:59,367
was at Mina's.

1068
01:21:01,827 --> 01:21:02,687
A video?

1069
01:21:03,347 --> 01:21:04,527
What type of video?

1070
01:21:05,847 --> 01:21:07,927
I think I'll give you info like

1071
01:21:07,927 --> 01:21:08,127
this.

1072
01:21:09,187 --> 01:21:10,267
With nothing in return.

1073
01:21:24,346 --> 01:21:29,286
C'

1074
01:21:29,286 --> 01:21:29,826
is as you wish,

1075
01:21:29,986 --> 01:21:33,506
but I know it won't do you any good if I

1076
01:21:33,506 --> 01:21:34,086
die right away.

1077
01:21:35,246 --> 01:21:38,106
He's never going to let you go without

1078
01:21:38,106 --> 01:21:39,166
answered his questions,

1079
01:21:39,906 --> 01:21:42,286
which will certainly cost you all your rights.

1080
01:21:44,086 --> 01:21:46,106
But if you decided to help us now,

1081
01:21:46,386 --> 01:21:48,226
you could be saved.

1082
01:21:54,386 --> 01:21:56,606
Why should I believe you?

1083
01:22:00,046 --> 01:22:00,551
D'

1084
01:22:00,551 --> 01:22:00,726
agreement.

1085
01:22:03,406 --> 01:22:05,006
So here's what you do.

1086
01:22:07,346 --> 01:22:07,972
You don't

1087
01:22:07,972 --> 01:22:08,606
es not Christian.
{

1088
01:22:09,966 --> 01:22:10,686
Ok?,

1089
01:22:11,566 --> 01:22:13,226
No matter what he asks of you,

1090
01:22:13,526 --> 01:22:16,606
you never admit you're Christian.

1091
01:22:18,766 --> 01:22:19,966
What are you going to do?

1092
01:22:28,794 --> 01:22:34,234
Put that away.

1093
01:22:34,934 --> 01:22:35,434
We don't

1094
01:22:35,434 --> 01:22:35,934
doesn't need it.

1095
01:22:38,454 --> 01:22:39,294
He must be killed.

1096
01:22:42,074 --> 01:22:42,787
He says

1097
01:22:42,787 --> 01:22:43,714
he has things to tell us.

1098
01:22:59,303 --> 01:23:04,863
I'm not Christian.

1099
01:23:05,163 --> 01:23:05,883
What?

1100
01:23:06,423 --> 01:23:06,933
M'

1101
01:23:06,933 --> 01:23:07,603
calls François.

1102
01:23:08,543 --> 01:23:09,423
François Barthez.

1103
01:23:11,683 --> 01:23:12,843
You've got the wrong person.

1104
01:23:13,443 --> 01:23:14,116
Why don't you

1105
01:23:14,116 --> 01:23:16,023
waited so long to tell me?

1106
01:23:16,023 --> 01:23:17,743
You were like wild animals.

1107
01:23:19,143 --> 01:23:20,963
You would never have listened to what I was telling you

1108
01:23:20,963 --> 01:23:21,423
seriously.

1109
01:23:25,323 --> 01:23:26,723
I know where Christian is,

1110
01:23:26,843 --> 01:23:27,183
Samy.

1111
01:23:34,623 --> 01:23:34,883
That

1112
01:23:34,883 --> 01:23:36,783
what do you want to know about him?

1113
01:23:38,203 --> 01:23:40,543
We want to know what's going on in the circle.

1114
01:23:40,883 --> 01:23:41,268
C'

1115
01:23:41,268 --> 01:23:41,443
is this,

1116
01:23:41,503 --> 01:23:42,203
Albert?

1117
01:23:43,023 --> 01:23:43,383
Yes.

1118
01:23:46,263 --> 01:23:46,903
In this case,

1119
01:23:48,263 --> 01:23:50,103
I don't think he'll be able to answer.

1120
01:23:50,103 --> 01:23:50,683
to your questions.

1121
01:23:53,723 --> 01:23:56,183
You should check with the person who

1122
01:23:56,183 --> 01:23:57,643
has the most power in the circle.

1123
01:23:58,003 --> 01:23:58,213
That

1124
01:23:58,213 --> 01:23:59,083
do you mean?

1125
01:24:00,123 --> 01:24:01,343
You must go and see Déborah.

1126
01:24:01,803 --> 01:24:02,323
No.

1127
01:24:05,523 --> 01:24:06,073
C'

1128
01:24:06,073 --> 01:24:06,583
is who?

1129
01:24:07,463 --> 01:24:07,983
Déborah.

1130
01:24:08,743 --> 01:24:09,623
Déborah Minard.

1131
01:24:10,403 --> 01:24:12,363
The one who created the Minard Foundation.

1132
01:24:12,823 --> 01:24:14,263
Is she still alive?

1133
01:24:14,663 --> 01:24:15,123
Of course you can.

1134
01:24:17,463 --> 01:24:19,643
But when the Foundation was dissolved,

1135
01:24:20,343 --> 01:24:22,423
it was no problem for them to manipulate

1136
01:24:22,423 --> 01:24:25,123
the press to make people believe that Déborah was dead?

1137
01:24:27,283 --> 01:24:28,243
Déborah Minard.

1138
01:24:30,623 --> 01:24:32,489
We've finally found the person

1139
01:24:32,489 --> 01:24:32,983
we were looking for.

1140
01:24:38,063 --> 01:24:38,478
C'

1141
01:24:38,478 --> 01:24:38,743
is an echo.

1142
01:24:39,323 --> 01:24:39,748
C'

1143
01:24:39,748 --> 01:24:40,743
is not as simple as you think.

1144
01:24:40,903 --> 01:24:42,263
It will be impossible to get Déborah to talk.

1145
01:24:43,603 --> 01:24:44,863
She lives in another world.

1146
01:24:45,583 --> 01:24:46,512
I don't know how to

1147
01:24:46,512 --> 01:24:46,803
explain,

1148
01:24:46,863 --> 01:24:47,363
but with her,

1149
01:24:47,423 --> 01:24:48,803
truth and lies are always intertwined.

1150
01:24:49,183 --> 01:24:50,183
You can never sort it out.

1151
01:24:50,863 --> 01:24:53,603
His aim has always been perfectly consistent.

1152
01:24:54,243 --> 01:24:55,158
Même si ça a l '

1153
01:24:55,158 --> 01:24:55,543
twisted look.

1154
01:24:55,803 --> 01:24:56,323
Shut up,

1155
01:24:56,363 --> 01:24:57,183
I don't want to know!

1156
01:24:57,183 --> 01:24:57,463
Me,

1157
01:24:57,503 --> 01:24:57,763
if.

1158
01:24:58,483 --> 01:24:59,283
I don't want to hear it.

1159
01:24:59,283 --> 01:24:59,483
Go ahead,

1160
01:24:59,503 --> 01:24:59,983
we're listening.

1161
01:25:05,263 --> 01:25:10,738
Déborah s '

1162
01:25:10,738 --> 01:25:11,743
was in charge of sorting the children.

1163
01:25:13,343 --> 01:25:15,203
Some were adopted by wealthy families,

1164
01:25:15,883 --> 01:25:16,723
and others,

1165
01:25:19,023 --> 01:25:20,083
for the circle,

1166
01:25:21,403 --> 01:25:22,423
l ' importance n '

1167
01:25:22,423 --> 01:25:23,423
was not the children themselves,

1168
01:25:24,243 --> 01:25:25,383
but their organs.

1169
01:25:26,743 --> 01:25:27,383
Kidneys,

1170
01:25:27,603 --> 01:25:28,323
livers,

1171
01:25:28,423 --> 01:25:29,603
pancreas,

1172
01:25:29,643 --> 01:25:30,743
eyes,

1173
01:25:30,863 --> 01:25:32,383
hair.

1174
01:25:33,483 --> 01:25:34,623
The younger they were,

1175
01:25:35,263 --> 01:25:36,263
and the more it sold for.

1176
01:25:38,083 --> 01:25:39,823
Deborah is a former surgeon.

1177
01:25:40,863 --> 01:25:41,328
C'

1178
01:25:41,328 --> 01:25:41,851
is how

1179
01:25:41,851 --> 01:25:42,703
she created her own traffic.

1180
01:25:44,063 --> 01:25:47,583
People were saying that Deborah's dexterity was

1181
01:25:47,583 --> 01:25:51,643
that the cruelty was almost beautiful.

1182
01:25:53,143 --> 01:25:53,583
Damn,

1183
01:25:53,603 --> 01:25:54,363
what is it?

1184
01:25:54,823 --> 01:25:55,063
C'

1185
01:25:55,063 --> 01:25:56,063
is the devil's business.

1186
01:25:56,523 --> 01:25:58,403
Can you meet her?

1187
01:26:00,543 --> 01:26:01,903
I could take you as far as

1188
01:26:01,903 --> 01:26:02,103
to her,

1189
01:26:02,143 --> 01:26:02,543
if you like.

1190
01:26:04,443 --> 01:26:05,243
You'll discover.

1191
01:26:05,263 --> 01:26:06,543
You'll discover the truth for yourself.

1192
01:26:09,463 --> 01:26:10,823
Where is it?

1193
01:26:12,883 --> 01:26:13,398
At the

1194
01:26:13,398 --> 01:26:15,943
where your daughter breathed her last.

1195
01:26:20,623 --> 01:26:21,003
C'

1196
01:26:21,003 --> 01:26:21,883
is where you'll find it.

1197
01:26:22,943 --> 01:26:24,303
And Christian will be there too.

1198
01:26:26,383 --> 01:26:26,763
N'

1199
01:26:26,763 --> 01:26:27,243
anything.

1200
01:26:27,483 --> 01:26:27,863
C'

1201
01:26:27,863 --> 01:26:28,243
is a trap,

1202
01:26:28,243 --> 01:26:28,383
this,

1203
01:26:28,403 --> 01:26:28,623
Yuko.

1204
01:26:28,843 --> 01:26:30,003
We can't believe his story.

1205
01:26:30,383 --> 01:26:30,838
But it's

1206
01:26:30,838 --> 01:26:31,536
is the only lead

1207
01:26:31,536 --> 01:26:31,943
for the

1208
01:26:31,943 --> 01:26:32,103
instant.

1209
01:26:35,263 --> 01:26:35,263
Me,

1210
01:26:35,263 --> 01:26:36,383
was it because of Deborah?

1211
01:26:51,205 --> 01:26:57,545
Maybe Lola will be with her.

1212
01:26:59,665 --> 01:27:00,525
Lola?

1213
01:27:01,725 --> 01:27:02,210
C'

1214
01:27:02,210 --> 01:27:02,565
is my wife.

1215
01:27:05,145 --> 01:27:07,245
She occupied an important place.

1216
01:27:10,165 --> 01:27:11,125
In the circle.

1217
01:27:12,545 --> 01:27:13,374
From arms to

1218
01:27:13,374 --> 01:27:13,665
enjoy.

1219
01:27:14,705 --> 01:27:15,885
They were all together.

1220
01:27:16,145 --> 01:27:17,020
My wife became the

1221
01:27:17,020 --> 01:27:17,745
one of her followers,

1222
01:27:17,745 --> 01:27:18,565
without realizing it.

1223
01:27:20,025 --> 01:27:20,996
But she

1224
01:27:20,996 --> 01:27:21,865
would never have let him take Marie.

1225
01:27:22,465 --> 01:27:23,738
And if I

1226
01:27:23,738 --> 01:27:24,045
had known,

1227
01:27:24,165 --> 01:27:26,445
I would have prevented it too.

1228
01:27:26,505 --> 01:27:28,865
But why?

1229
01:27:42,359 --> 01:27:47,524
It doesn't

1230
01:27:47,524 --> 01:27:48,229
is not very good at

1231
01:27:48,229 --> 01:27:48,439
era,

1232
01:27:48,579 --> 01:27:49,359
with my wife.

1233
01:27:51,579 --> 01:27:53,559
And Marie often found herself alone because of

1234
01:27:53,559 --> 01:27:53,739
us.

1235
01:27:55,579 --> 01:27:55,964
J'

1236
01:27:55,964 --> 01:27:57,239
should have been more present for her.

1237
01:29:23,955 --> 01:29:28,705
C'

1238
01:29:28,705 --> 01:29:29,220
is really the

1239
01:29:29,220 --> 01:29:30,630
ideal location for

1240
01:29:30,630 --> 01:29:30,915
children.

1241
01:29:39,915 --> 01:29:40,935
They should be there,

1242
01:29:40,975 --> 01:29:42,115
Déborah and Christian.

1243
01:29:43,115 --> 01:29:44,555
Probably with several armed guys.

1244
01:29:46,735 --> 01:29:47,290
You are

1245
01:29:47,290 --> 01:29:48,035
wait here?

1246
01:29:48,035 --> 01:29:48,981
I'm going to

1247
01:29:48,981 --> 01:29:51,595
first to talk to them alone, and then I'll make you

1248
01:29:51,595 --> 01:29:52,090
sign as soon as

1249
01:29:52,090 --> 01:29:52,215
is good.

1250
01:29:52,855 --> 01:29:55,015
You think you can take us that easily?

1251
01:29:56,115 --> 01:29:57,315
You may not believe me,

1252
01:29:57,395 --> 01:29:59,495
but do you have a choice?

1253
01:29:59,955 --> 01:30:01,215
We'll give you five minutes,

1254
01:30:01,275 --> 01:30:01,595
Papyrus.

1255
01:30:02,415 --> 01:30:03,095
After that,

1256
01:30:03,155 --> 01:30:06,075
we set fire to the building and shoot everyone in sight

1257
01:30:06,075 --> 01:30:06,695
those who leave.

1258
01:30:07,195 --> 01:30:08,455
One after the other.

1259
01:30:11,515 --> 01:30:11,937
D'

1260
01:30:11,937 --> 01:30:12,095
agreement.

1261
01:30:13,775 --> 01:30:14,175
Christian,

1262
01:30:14,175 --> 01:30:14,855
five minutes,

1263
01:30:14,915 --> 01:30:15,275
Papyrus.

1264
01:30:15,595 --> 01:30:15,995
Yes.

1265
01:30:16,275 --> 01:30:16,675
What,

1266
01:30:16,675 --> 01:30:17,295
Christian?

1267
01:30:22,215 --> 01:30:22,478
C'

1268
01:30:22,478 --> 01:30:23,055
was you?

1269
01:30:23,555 --> 01:30:23,875
No.

1270
01:30:25,195 --> 01:30:25,550
C'

1271
01:30:25,550 --> 01:30:26,395
Did you kill Marie?

1272
01:30:26,395 --> 01:30:26,575
No,

1273
01:30:26,615 --> 01:30:27,135
I didn't kill anyone.

1274
01:30:29,535 --> 01:30:29,988
I don't

1275
01:30:29,988 --> 01:30:30,435
all I did was film.

1276
01:30:31,855 --> 01:30:32,295
Filming?

1277
01:30:32,295 --> 01:30:33,395
Filming what?

1278
01:30:34,435 --> 01:30:34,755
Stop.

1279
01:30:34,875 --> 01:30:36,038
You know very well what it's about

1280
01:30:36,038 --> 01:30:36,155
act.

1281
01:30:37,615 --> 01:30:38,195
The children,

1282
01:30:38,275 --> 01:30:38,815
is that it?

1283
01:30:48,115 --> 01:30:48,545
While

1284
01:30:48,545 --> 01:30:49,595
they harvested their organs,

1285
01:30:49,595 --> 01:30:50,915
they filmed them.

1286
01:30:52,855 --> 01:30:54,515
And they sold these images to perverts.

1287
01:30:57,895 --> 01:30:58,290
C'

1288
01:30:58,290 --> 01:30:59,755
is also how your daughter was killed.

1289
01:31:02,475 --> 01:31:04,465
I know because

1290
01:31:04,465 --> 01:31:05,041
is me who

1291
01:31:05,041 --> 01:31:05,415
filmed.

1292
01:31:07,235 --> 01:31:09,055
I still remember his face.

1293
01:31:11,095 --> 01:31:11,815
Completely disfigured.

1294
01:31:15,875 --> 01:31:17,175
Stop bullshitting me.

1295
01:31:19,555 --> 01:31:19,915
Damn.

1296
01:31:21,195 --> 01:31:21,985
It doesn't

1297
01:31:21,985 --> 01:31:22,195
air exceeding.

1298
01:31:22,215 --> 01:31:22,655
That asshole.

1299
01:31:24,315 --> 01:31:24,555
Now,

1300
01:31:24,595 --> 01:31:24,881
WHAT IS

1301
01:31:24,881 --> 01:31:26,215
what are we going to do in this godforsaken hole?

1302
01:31:32,935 --> 01:31:33,375
This is it,

1303
01:31:33,375 --> 01:31:33,555
course.

1304
01:31:34,595 --> 01:31:35,055
Plus,

1305
01:31:35,135 --> 01:31:36,915
he took us for a ride with his video story.

1306
01:31:37,055 --> 01:31:37,315
C'

1307
01:31:37,315 --> 01:31:38,075
was to make us walk,

1308
01:31:38,095 --> 01:31:38,195
this.

1309
01:31:39,035 --> 01:31:39,355
He

1310
01:31:39,355 --> 01:31:39,835
well deserved.

1311
01:31:46,842 --> 01:31:48,842
Shall we?

1312
01:31:49,622 --> 01:31:50,702
But where?

1313
01:31:51,522 --> 01:31:52,022
You

1314
01:31:52,022 --> 01:31:52,734
said that your wife

1315
01:31:52,734 --> 01:31:53,062
was waiting for.

1316
01:32:57,351 --> 01:33:00,631
Taiko,

1317
01:33:00,831 --> 01:33:02,571
taiko,

1318
01:33:02,671 --> 01:33:02,891
taiko.

1319
01:35:11,918 --> 01:35:12,358
Marie.

1320
01:35:42,058 --> 01:35:45,078
The cause of your decision may be a hemorrhage

1321
01:35:45,078 --> 01:35:47,258
and global dysfunction.

1322
01:36:15,039 --> 01:36:15,599
Hello?

1323
01:36:16,779 --> 01:36:17,139
No,

1324
01:36:17,139 --> 01:36:18,079
you haven't been there.

1325
01:36:19,519 --> 01:36:19,903
T '

1326
01:36:19,903 --> 01:36:20,259
don't worry,

1327
01:36:20,319 --> 01:36:21,719
I won't let it go any further.

1328
01:36:28,505 --> 01:36:32,285
Jake,

1329
01:36:32,505 --> 01:36:34,045
do you hear me?

1330
01:36:34,645 --> 01:36:35,085
Jake?

1331
01:36:35,865 --> 01:36:37,022
Do you

1332
01:36:37,022 --> 01:36:37,525
hear?

1333
01:36:38,345 --> 01:36:39,385
Jake?

1334
01:36:58,505 --> 01:36:59,125
All in all,

1335
01:36:59,205 --> 01:37:00,571
c ' est du coup de couteau sur l '

1336
01:37:00,571 --> 01:37:01,385
the whole body.

1337
01:37:28,237 --> 01:37:28,757
...

1338
01:37:43,217 --> 01:37:44,557
I don't know.

1339
01:37:46,497 --> 01:37:48,537
Your daughter was also killed here.

1340
01:37:50,057 --> 01:37:50,857
My daughter,

1341
01:37:51,057 --> 01:37:53,297
she was killed here.

1342
01:38:25,177 --> 01:38:25,897
My daughter,

1343
01:38:26,097 --> 01:38:28,257
she was killed here.

1344
01:38:29,737 --> 01:38:30,597
My daughter,

1345
01:38:31,757 --> 01:38:33,017
she was killed here.

1346
01:38:34,797 --> 01:38:35,717
My daughter,

1347
01:38:36,657 --> 01:38:38,017
she was killed here.

1348
01:38:39,737 --> 01:38:40,577
My daughter,

1349
01:38:41,617 --> 01:38:42,897
she was killed here.

1350
01:38:43,057 --> 01:38:43,417
My daughter,

1351
01:38:43,417 --> 01:38:43,417
she was killed here.

1352
01:38:43,417 --> 01:38:45,517
Your daughter,

1353
01:38:45,877 --> 01:38:47,917
she was killed here.

1354
01:38:47,977 --> 01:38:48,517
Your daughter,

1355
01:38:48,517 --> 01:38:48,517
she was killed here.

1356
01:38:49,277 --> 01:38:50,097
My daughter,

1357
01:38:51,057 --> 01:38:52,437
she was killed here.

1358
01:38:55,297 --> 01:38:56,579
All that remained was the

1359
01:38:56,579 --> 01:38:58,437
foreigner than grilled in the great hall

1360
01:38:58,437 --> 01:38:59,137
capitular.

1361
01:38:59,597 --> 01:39:01,237
The breeze began to blow.

1362
01:39:01,697 --> 01:39:02,217
Grilled.

1363
01:39:05,217 --> 01:39:06,257
Lola?

1364
01:39:07,337 --> 01:39:07,977
Don't come any closer.

1365
01:39:11,957 --> 01:39:12,757
Why don't you

1366
01:39:12,757 --> 01:39:13,517
come here?

1367
01:39:14,357 --> 01:39:15,537
Where is Déborah?

1368
01:39:16,117 --> 01:39:16,977
She's dead.

1369
01:39:16,977 --> 01:39:17,977
And a long time ago,

1370
01:39:18,977 --> 01:39:19,937
she committed suicide.

1371
01:39:22,977 --> 01:39:23,437
I'm fine.

1372
01:39:24,897 --> 01:39:25,977
Where's Jake?

1373
01:39:27,077 --> 01:39:27,617
Jake?

1374
01:39:28,477 --> 01:39:29,477
The strong one?

1375
01:39:30,057 --> 01:39:30,437
Yeah.

1376
01:39:30,917 --> 01:39:31,537
He's dead.

1377
01:39:57,096 --> 01:40:02,081
C'

1378
01:40:02,081 --> 01:40:03,576
are you Theora's successor?

1379
01:40:04,056 --> 01:40:05,036
You wouldn't understand.

1380
01:40:07,896 --> 01:40:08,316
And it's

1381
01:40:08,316 --> 01:40:09,436
is also you who started here.

1382
01:40:17,691 --> 01:40:22,871
You know,

1383
01:40:22,971 --> 01:40:24,651
I think you didn't really like him.

1384
01:40:26,931 --> 01:40:27,441
and

1385
01:40:27,441 --> 01:40:27,531
elsewhere,

1386
01:40:27,591 --> 01:40:28,751
she didn't really like them either.

1387
01:40:32,111 --> 01:40:32,871
In any case,

1388
01:40:32,951 --> 01:40:34,651
how could i have done otherwise?

1389
01:40:36,411 --> 01:40:36,791
You,

1390
01:40:36,791 --> 01:40:38,331
you thought she was innocent and pure.

1391
01:40:40,391 --> 01:40:41,411
But with me,

1392
01:40:41,451 --> 01:40:42,551
she was very different.

1393
01:40:43,991 --> 01:40:47,111
She was always staring at me with her icy, cold gaze.

1394
01:40:47,111 --> 01:40:47,891
reproving.

1395
01:40:51,171 --> 01:40:51,531
C'

1396
01:40:51,531 --> 01:40:52,467
is your idea of

1397
01:40:52,467 --> 01:40:53,551
to see Déborah?

1398
01:40:58,591 --> 01:40:59,091
You know,

1399
01:40:59,131 --> 01:41:01,471
I don't know exactly what happened to Marie,

1400
01:41:01,631 --> 01:41:02,191
but in the background,

1401
01:41:02,271 --> 01:41:03,471
I think this is what you wanted.

1402
01:41:03,611 --> 01:41:03,711
You,

1403
01:41:03,751 --> 01:41:03,831
me,

1404
01:41:03,911 --> 01:41:04,691
I just let you do it.

1405
01:41:08,031 --> 01:41:08,559
How I

1406
01:41:08,559 --> 01:41:09,771
could have done more?

1407
01:41:14,611 --> 01:41:15,231
The children,

1408
01:41:15,391 --> 01:41:16,331
we're going to do something.

1409
01:41:16,671 --> 01:41:17,056
C'

1410
01:41:17,056 --> 01:41:17,291
is that

1411
01:41:17,291 --> 01:41:18,031
we'll go,

1412
01:41:18,131 --> 01:41:18,311
uh,

1413
01:41:18,731 --> 01:41:19,651
uh,

1414
01:41:19,711 --> 01:41:22,051
we'll go to the back,

1415
01:41:22,171 --> 01:41:22,271
there.

1416
01:41:23,071 --> 01:41:24,031
Just in the side room.

1417
01:41:25,031 --> 01:41:25,611
And Yves,

1418
01:41:25,671 --> 01:41:27,231
go ahead,

1419
01:41:27,331 --> 01:41:27,411
there.

1420
01:41:29,871 --> 01:41:31,024
And you play the game

1421
01:41:31,024 --> 01:41:31,351
we know,

1422
01:41:31,351 --> 01:41:31,991
OK?

1423
01:41:33,131 --> 01:41:33,591
Do this.

1424
01:41:34,331 --> 01:41:35,191
It's going to be fine.

1425
01:41:43,327 --> 01:41:48,487
You know,

1426
01:41:48,547 --> 01:41:48,987
with Jake,

1427
01:41:49,067 --> 01:41:50,547
we did what we could for a year.

1428
01:41:52,007 --> 01:41:53,122
But it's

1429
01:41:53,122 --> 01:41:55,287
is not possible to replace Déborah.

1430
01:41:56,647 --> 01:42:01,387
She was so horrible and charismatic.

1431
01:42:02,847 --> 01:42:03,227
Me,

1432
01:42:03,307 --> 01:42:04,467
I don't want to become like her.

1433
01:42:11,007 --> 01:42:11,982
Maybe it's

1434
01:42:11,982 --> 01:42:12,427
is the end,

1435
01:42:12,507 --> 01:42:12,867
now,

1436
01:42:12,867 --> 01:42:13,147
no?

1437
01:42:16,567 --> 01:42:16,797
That

1438
01:42:16,797 --> 01:42:17,220
do you

1439
01:42:17,220 --> 01:42:18,667
think about it?

1440
01:42:21,007 --> 01:42:21,637
Is this

1441
01:42:21,637 --> 01:42:21,907
is true,

1442
01:42:21,987 --> 01:42:23,227
all this?

1443
01:42:27,247 --> 01:42:27,862
But if it

1444
01:42:27,862 --> 01:42:28,267
is the end,

1445
01:42:28,387 --> 01:42:30,287
it's also the end for you.

1446
01:42:33,167 --> 01:42:33,527
Albert,

1447
01:42:33,827 --> 01:42:35,027
I'm not afraid of anything anymore,

1448
01:42:35,107 --> 01:42:35,347
now.

1449
01:42:56,366 --> 01:43:01,271
C'

1450
01:43:01,271 --> 01:43:01,546
is finite,

1451
01:43:01,626 --> 01:43:01,946
Sayoko,

1452
01:43:02,106 --> 01:43:02,626
I had no choice.

1453
01:43:03,926 --> 01:43:04,386
But it's

1454
01:43:04,386 --> 01:43:05,026
is perhaps best.

1455
01:43:07,106 --> 01:43:07,606
We will.

1456
01:43:09,706 --> 01:43:10,046
C'

1457
01:43:10,046 --> 01:43:10,526
was Lola.

1458
01:43:12,206 --> 01:43:12,561
C'

1459
01:43:12,561 --> 01:43:13,586
she's the one who brought our daughter here.

1460
01:43:14,786 --> 01:43:16,946
She was chosen by Deborah and Guérin l'

1461
01:43:16,946 --> 01:43:17,186
killed.

1462
01:43:17,946 --> 01:43:19,086
And maybe your daughter too.

1463
01:43:21,026 --> 01:43:22,266
Are you satisfied?

1464
01:43:23,646 --> 01:43:24,906
I don't know how to thank you,

1465
01:43:24,986 --> 01:43:25,266
Sayoko.

1466
01:43:29,726 --> 01:43:31,386
You're the only one left now.

1467
01:43:51,714 --> 01:43:57,994
Your last meal.

1468
01:44:05,354 --> 01:44:06,054
C'

1469
01:44:06,054 --> 01:44:07,314
is not a very funny joke,

1470
01:44:07,314 --> 01:44:07,614
it's a hit.

1471
01:44:09,294 --> 01:44:11,134
You're all the same.

1472
01:44:17,351 --> 01:44:22,291
J'

1473
01:44:22,291 --> 01:44:23,168
just served once as

1474
01:44:23,168 --> 01:44:24,771
intermediary between the circle and

1475
01:44:24,771 --> 01:44:25,031
videos.

1476
01:44:25,171 --> 01:44:25,304
C'

1477
01:44:25,304 --> 01:44:25,791
was an order.

1478
01:44:27,291 --> 01:44:29,171
You were their coordinator,

1479
01:44:29,251 --> 01:44:30,071
isn't it?

1480
01:44:30,071 --> 01:44:30,971
Of course not,

1481
01:44:31,011 --> 01:44:32,123
I didn't even know which video it was.

1482
01:44:32,123 --> 01:44:32,411
acted.

1483
01:44:34,851 --> 01:44:36,571
You sold your daughter yourself.

1484
01:44:38,231 --> 01:44:38,657
You don't

1485
01:44:38,657 --> 01:44:39,151
are not serious,

1486
01:44:39,151 --> 01:44:39,451
Yoko.

1487
01:44:39,671 --> 01:44:40,951
I'm a victim like you.

1488
01:44:42,831 --> 01:44:43,151
Stop,

1489
01:44:43,151 --> 01:44:43,671
don't do that.

1490
01:44:44,731 --> 01:44:45,076
C'

1491
01:44:45,076 --> 01:44:45,657
is why you

1492
01:44:45,657 --> 01:44:45,951
helped.

1493
01:44:45,991 --> 01:44:46,531
We're in this together.

1494
01:44:48,591 --> 01:44:51,663
The video of your daughter being cut up while

1495
01:44:51,663 --> 01:44:52,531
she's still alive.

1496
01:44:53,691 --> 01:44:54,226
J'

1497
01:44:54,226 --> 01:44:55,391
imagine you want to see it.

1498
01:44:55,751 --> 01:44:56,011
No,

1499
01:44:56,051 --> 01:44:56,891
stop,

1500
01:44:56,911 --> 01:44:57,411
don't do that.

1501
01:45:00,631 --> 01:45:01,111
Stop,

1502
01:45:01,111 --> 01:45:02,371
Yoko!

1503
01:45:08,411 --> 01:45:08,891
Albert,

1504
01:45:08,891 --> 01:45:09,371
me,

1505
01:45:09,551 --> 01:45:11,531
I saw the video.

1506
01:45:30,288 --> 01:45:35,768
Why me?

1507
01:45:36,268 --> 01:45:37,008
Why are you doing this?

1508
01:45:37,008 --> 01:45:37,988
Why me?

1509
01:45:43,088 --> 01:45:45,088
I hate you more than anyone.

1510
01:45:51,028 --> 01:45:51,728
Wait!

1511
01:45:52,428 --> 01:45:52,868
No,

1512
01:45:53,588 --> 01:45:54,428
IT'S NOT TRUE!

1513
01:45:55,008 --> 01:45:55,288
Stop,

1514
01:45:55,288 --> 01:45:55,768
please,

1515
01:45:55,808 --> 01:45:56,788
don't leave me alone!

1516
01:47:27,538 --> 01:47:39,958
やっぱりこうやって距離を取るとお互い冷静になれるもんだなちょ

1517
01:47:39,958 --> 01:47:46,638
っと懐かしいよ、パリでの暮らしが俺たちきっと相性良かったんだ

1518
01:47:46,638 --> 01:48:03,378
よ、二人は二人だけなら案外うまくやれたのかもしれないまあでも昔

1519
01:48:03,378 --> 01:48:14,098
のことは忘れようこうして時々画面越しに君の穏やかな顔を見られ

1520
01:48:14,098 --> 01:48:24,798
るだけで俺はちょっとほっとするんだちょっとキラポンじゃてぃぼ

1521
01:48:24,798 --> 01:48:28,458
かうんうんなんて言った?
