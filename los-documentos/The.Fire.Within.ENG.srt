00:01:04,209 --> 00:01:07,751
THE FIRE WITHIN

2
00:01:46,126 --> 00:01:50,334
<i>At that moment, Alain studied
Lydia's face relentlessly…</i>

3
00:01:52,917 --> 00:01:56,292
<i>as he had been doing
since she came to see him</i>

4
00:01:56,667 --> 00:01:57,917
<i>three days earlier.</i>

5
00:02:00,709 --> 00:02:02,584
<i>What was he looking for?</i>

6
00:02:04,001 --> 00:02:06,167
<i>Lydia turned her head away,</i>

7
00:02:06,917 --> 00:02:10,501
<i>lowered her eyelids,
and grew absorbed.</i>

8
00:02:12,042 --> 00:02:13,667
<i>In what?</i>

9
00:02:14,459 --> 00:02:16,209
<i>In herself?</i>

10
00:02:16,917 --> 00:02:21,084
<i>Was it her contented rage
that swelled her neck and belly?</i>

11
00:02:21,834 --> 00:02:26,167
<i>This sensation that emanated
nothing, but was so clear?</i>

12
00:02:49,209 --> 00:02:50,917
<i>Once again the feeling</i>

13
00:02:51,126 --> 00:02:53,667
<i>had eluded him.</i>

14
00:02:54,751 --> 00:02:56,834
<i>Like a snake between stones.</i>

15
00:03:43,751 --> 00:03:46,459
Poor Alain.
You look so uncomfortable.

16
00:03:59,126 --> 00:04:00,917
It's been so long.

17
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:13,292
It's my fault.

18
00:04:17,001 --> 00:04:18,667
Let me see you smile, Alain.

19
00:04:19,209 --> 00:04:22,709
It was fine. I feel satisfied.

20
00:05:04,334 --> 00:05:06,042
It's light out.

21
00:05:07,209 --> 00:05:08,792
I have to hurry.

22
00:05:10,126 --> 00:05:12,042
I have packing to do.

23
00:05:12,251 --> 00:05:14,334
Your plane isn't until 11:00.

24
00:05:14,542 --> 00:05:16,751
I have a lot to do this morning.

25
00:05:17,959 --> 00:05:20,501
Francesca is picking me up at 8:00.

26
00:05:55,459 --> 00:05:58,042
It was so good to see you again.

27
00:06:00,876 --> 00:06:01,917
You know…

28
00:06:05,834 --> 00:06:09,292
I love you in a very special way.

29
00:06:14,459 --> 00:06:16,584
Thank you for coming.

30
00:06:19,376 --> 00:06:21,251
Thank Dorothy for that.

31
00:06:22,042 --> 00:06:24,751
She's the one who asked me
to come see you.

32
00:06:25,542 --> 00:06:27,626
She gave me the clinic address.

33
00:06:43,584 --> 00:06:45,751
What shall I tell Dorothy?

34
00:06:47,251 --> 00:06:49,042
Nothing. Why?

35
00:06:51,667 --> 00:06:54,542
I said I'd phone her
when I get back to NY.

36
00:06:55,334 --> 00:06:58,042
She wants to know
how you're getting along.

37
00:07:00,917 --> 00:07:02,292
What will you say?

38
00:07:03,667 --> 00:07:07,459
The truth.
That you're completely cured.

39
00:07:09,584 --> 00:07:12,292
I'll ask her
what she has planned for you.

40
00:07:17,667 --> 00:07:19,917
- Will you tell her we —
- No, Alain.

41
00:07:20,501 --> 00:07:23,001
Unless you ask me to.

42
00:07:24,042 --> 00:07:25,667
I won't ask you to.

43
00:07:31,334 --> 00:07:33,501
She'll suspect something.

44
00:07:34,751 --> 00:07:36,959
It won't even occur to her.

45
00:07:38,292 --> 00:07:40,667
She has other things on her mind.

46
00:07:41,917 --> 00:07:42,917
Then again…

47
00:07:44,292 --> 00:07:46,876
it's more likely to suit her.

48
00:07:50,751 --> 00:07:53,792
Have you two discussed divorce?

49
00:07:55,709 --> 00:07:57,334
We did, once.

50
00:07:57,959 --> 00:08:01,709
Six months ago, just before I left.

51
00:08:03,459 --> 00:08:05,042
And since then?

52
00:08:06,709 --> 00:08:08,959
We haven't spoken since then.

53
00:08:13,334 --> 00:08:15,876
She sends the doctor
a monthly check.

54
00:08:19,042 --> 00:08:20,126
She never writes?

55
00:08:22,126 --> 00:08:24,334
She did, at first.

56
00:08:26,167 --> 00:08:27,584
And you?

57
00:08:28,876 --> 00:08:31,334
I wrote her two weeks ago.

58
00:08:32,459 --> 00:08:34,417
Didn't she mention it?

59
00:08:38,876 --> 00:08:40,834
Do you still love her?

60
00:08:46,334 --> 00:08:47,959
I don't know.

61
00:08:49,459 --> 00:08:51,917
Dorothy isn't the woman for you.

62
00:08:52,209 --> 00:08:55,667
She isn't rich enough.
She lets you do what you want.

63
00:08:56,751 --> 00:08:59,959
You need a woman
who won't let you out of her sight.

64
00:09:00,501 --> 00:09:02,751
Otherwise you get depressed

65
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:04,917
and act foolishly.

66
00:09:07,667 --> 00:09:09,751
You know me so well.

67
00:09:10,001 --> 00:09:12,917
When I get depressed,
I do foolish things.

68
00:09:14,251 --> 00:09:16,376
Of course I know you.

69
00:09:19,501 --> 00:09:23,584
In fact, I think
I've always wanted to marry you.

70
00:09:24,709 --> 00:09:26,959
Even in Dorothy's day.

71
00:10:03,751 --> 00:10:06,334
I can't take you to the airport.

72
00:10:07,334 --> 00:10:10,792
The doctor will be angry
about my spending the night out.

73
00:10:11,167 --> 00:10:14,834
If I don't go back now,
they'll throw me out.

74
00:10:15,542 --> 00:10:17,876
Francesca will drive me.

75
00:10:19,167 --> 00:10:20,876
In any case, Alain,

76
00:10:22,001 --> 00:10:24,292
we'll see each other again soon.

77
00:10:49,876 --> 00:10:51,792
How long has it been?

78
00:10:52,501 --> 00:10:54,959
Four months… or thereabouts.

79
00:10:57,167 --> 00:10:59,084
Without a drop of liquor?

80
00:11:03,167 --> 00:11:06,084
Since I finished the cure,
not a drop.

81
00:11:10,376 --> 00:11:12,917
The cure consists
of having you drink.

82
00:11:14,334 --> 00:11:16,709
Drink… drink…

83
00:11:17,792 --> 00:11:18,834
until you burst.

84
00:11:20,501 --> 00:11:21,542
Is it rough?

85
00:11:25,292 --> 00:11:28,084
Had I known,
I wouldn't have done it.

86
00:11:29,459 --> 00:11:30,834
And now?

87
00:11:31,959 --> 00:11:33,584
Now?

88
00:11:34,751 --> 00:11:35,751
Nothing.

89
00:11:50,417 --> 00:11:51,834
Lydia…

90
00:11:56,501 --> 00:11:58,042
I wanted you to know —

91
00:12:07,667 --> 00:12:09,126
What're you doing?

92
00:12:18,084 --> 00:12:21,501
I insist.
You've forgotten, but I haven't.

93
00:12:22,084 --> 00:12:25,376
A gambling debt on the Zographos'
boat, four years ago.

94
00:12:37,126 --> 00:12:39,417
This forgotten city.

95
00:12:41,876 --> 00:12:43,626
So sad.

96
00:12:46,584 --> 00:12:48,751
That strange clinic.

97
00:12:50,042 --> 00:12:51,667
You're cured, Alain.

98
00:12:52,501 --> 00:12:54,584
Why do you stay there?

99
00:12:56,376 --> 00:12:58,417
I like it there.

100
00:13:00,084 --> 00:13:02,876
A patient's life is ordered
and simple.

101
00:13:04,501 --> 00:13:06,084
It shelters us.

102
00:13:07,876 --> 00:13:10,751
I'm not eager to face life again.

103
00:13:12,459 --> 00:13:14,542
Paris scares me.

104
00:13:15,209 --> 00:13:16,626
Think I'm a coward?

105
00:13:16,917 --> 00:13:20,209
No, Alain.
I think you're unhappy.

106
00:13:24,042 --> 00:13:26,001
Come to New York.

107
00:13:27,917 --> 00:13:30,626
Promise you'll come
as soon as you can.

108
00:13:31,876 --> 00:13:34,542
To settle things with Dorothy.

109
00:13:38,042 --> 00:13:40,417
Even if you get back together.

110
00:13:44,251 --> 00:13:47,376
Don't go. Don't leave me.

111
00:13:49,542 --> 00:13:51,417
I need you.

112
00:13:53,959 --> 00:13:57,501
Don't leave, I'm begging you.
It's serious.

113
00:13:57,792 --> 00:13:59,584
I have to.

114
00:14:00,917 --> 00:14:03,459
I have to be in New York tomorrow.

115
00:14:04,209 --> 00:14:05,792
They want the designs.

116
00:14:08,001 --> 00:14:10,834
- It's important?
- Everything depends on it.

117
00:14:15,917 --> 00:14:17,959
I'm a businesswoman now.

118
00:14:29,126 --> 00:14:33,126
I know, I'm leaving you
with your worst enemy. Yourself.

119
00:14:33,709 --> 00:14:35,792
Come to New York.

120
00:14:36,501 --> 00:14:38,834
No, Lydia, and I mean no.

121
00:14:39,126 --> 00:14:40,667
I won't come to New York.

122
00:14:41,084 --> 00:14:43,042
I won't marry you.

123
00:14:43,417 --> 00:14:46,917
You'd be unhappy.
Another Dorothy.

124
00:14:47,792 --> 00:14:50,042
Anyway, you can't help me.

125
00:14:50,792 --> 00:14:52,251
It's too late.

126
00:14:54,917 --> 00:14:58,251
Take madame to Paris.
Hotel Raphael, avenue Kléber.

MEDICAL SUPERVISION

129
00:15:29,876 --> 00:15:31,876
They're all at lunch.

130
00:15:42,917 --> 00:15:45,292
<i>July 23</i>

131
00:15:49,251 --> 00:15:52,251
Thomism comes from St. Thomas.

132
00:15:52,626 --> 00:15:54,917
So "Saint" implies theology.

133
00:15:55,126 --> 00:15:59,584
Nonsense! St. Thomas separated
philosophy from theology.

134
00:16:01,917 --> 00:16:03,709
Some small-town professor

135
00:16:03,917 --> 00:16:09,584
who posits Racine's world against
that of Proust, Cocteau, Genet.

136
00:16:09,751 --> 00:16:13,417
The prig should read La Palatine.

137
00:16:13,584 --> 00:16:16,459
Believing is not knowing…

138
00:16:20,501 --> 00:16:22,917
You came in this morning.

139
00:16:28,042 --> 00:16:31,042
<i>Credo ut intelligam,</i> my dear man.

140
00:16:31,209 --> 00:16:32,917
"I believe in order to understand."

141
00:16:33,084 --> 00:16:37,376
Not if you claim St. Thomas
separated philosophy and theology.

142
00:16:37,542 --> 00:16:40,834
Don't confuse faith
and understanding. St. Thomas says,

143
00:16:41,042 --> 00:16:43,334
"Where knowledge is, faith is not."

144
00:16:48,542 --> 00:16:52,917
Some lovely persons must
have been so happy to see you again.

145
00:16:54,001 --> 00:16:58,167
- Lovely persons aren't demanding.
- But you are.

146
00:16:59,292 --> 00:17:02,042
If you weren't,
you wouldn't be here.

147
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:06,542
Ever been to America?

148
00:17:06,709 --> 00:17:09,917
No, it's hard enough getting to know
our old Europe.

149
00:17:10,584 --> 00:17:13,459
And they're so brutal there,
they might kill me.

150
00:17:14,917 --> 00:17:17,667
Our young man looks pale
after his little jaunt.

151
00:17:17,876 --> 00:17:20,709
- He was handsomer before.
- He still is.

152
00:17:22,001 --> 00:17:23,292
You stare at him enough.

153
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:25,167
Compared to Aristotle —

154
00:17:25,334 --> 00:17:28,126
I refuse to discuss Aristotle.

155
00:17:28,292 --> 00:17:31,834
But reason dominates will.
It's what determines —

156
00:17:32,001 --> 00:17:35,876
Why only talk to Mr. D'Averseau?

157
00:17:36,126 --> 00:17:38,167
We'd like to hear this.

158
00:17:38,792 --> 00:17:39,876
We sure would!

159
00:17:41,417 --> 00:17:43,584
It might be very interesting.

160
00:18:24,459 --> 00:18:25,917
Are you leaving us?

161
00:18:27,709 --> 00:18:29,334
No. Why?

162
00:18:32,126 --> 00:18:34,001
That's what the doctor implied.

163
00:18:36,209 --> 00:18:38,167
Aren't you happy with us?

164
00:18:38,667 --> 00:18:40,126
Yes, I am.

165
00:18:41,667 --> 00:18:43,542
I feel at home here.

166
00:18:44,959 --> 00:18:46,334
You're my family.

167
00:18:50,001 --> 00:18:53,167
Without it, Nothingness
wouldn't have any quality.

168
00:18:55,126 --> 00:18:57,042
Where do your parents live?

169
00:19:02,042 --> 00:19:03,084
In the provinces.

170
00:19:04,292 --> 00:19:05,834
They're very old.

171
00:19:06,959 --> 00:19:09,251
I don't see them anymore.

172
00:19:15,167 --> 00:19:16,876
Poor boy.

173
00:19:17,126 --> 00:19:18,876
Poor boy?

174
00:19:19,501 --> 00:19:22,167
A misspent youth in riotous living,

175
00:19:22,376 --> 00:19:23,834
and now, problems!

176
00:19:24,001 --> 00:19:25,917
You're not being sensible.

177
00:19:26,084 --> 00:19:29,167
You should take a nap
this afternoon.

178
00:19:32,126 --> 00:19:34,167
Go back to bed.

179
00:20:41,792 --> 00:20:43,042
What a shame.

180
00:20:59,542 --> 00:21:01,084
What a crying shame!

181
00:21:07,584 --> 00:21:11,542
Checkmate in five moves…
the great man!

00:21:52,126 --> 00:21:54,792

184
00:22:11,709 --> 00:22:13,917

187
00:22:24,209 --> 00:22:25,542
Dorothy.

188
00:23:53,209 --> 00:23:54,542
Money.

189
00:24:02,667 --> 00:24:06,126
It slips right through your fingers.

190
00:28:03,709 --> 00:28:04,792
Am I disturbing you?

191
00:28:08,001 --> 00:28:09,042
Not at all, Doctor.

192
00:28:10,251 --> 00:28:13,709
I knocked several times.
I thought you might be asleep.

193
00:28:16,584 --> 00:28:18,084
Sit down.

194
00:28:22,376 --> 00:28:24,251
You went to Paris last night?

195
00:28:25,667 --> 00:28:27,959
I never left Versailles.

196
00:28:28,167 --> 00:28:31,584
I hope you didn't do anything
foolhardy on your first time out.

197
00:28:31,751 --> 00:28:33,376
Don't worry, Doctor.

198
00:28:34,251 --> 00:28:36,251
I was with a lady.

199
00:28:37,167 --> 00:28:41,001
- Like a good little schoolboy.
- Well done. Fine. Excellent.

200
00:28:48,042 --> 00:28:49,834
Make up for lost time.

201
00:28:50,959 --> 00:28:53,917
- Once you leave here…
- Are you throwing me out?

202
00:28:54,667 --> 00:28:57,709
Not at all!
I'm delighted to have you here.

203
00:28:58,417 --> 00:29:02,001
But you've been fully cured
for quite some time now.

204
00:29:06,917 --> 00:29:10,001
I can't keep you here
without reason.

205
00:29:11,251 --> 00:29:13,501
Doctor, I'll start again.

206
00:29:15,584 --> 00:29:19,334
If I leave, I'll start
drinking again. Sooner or later.

207
00:29:21,251 --> 00:29:22,584
What else can I do?

208
00:29:22,792 --> 00:29:24,876
No news from America?

209
00:29:26,542 --> 00:29:29,167
There won't be any.
There's no connection.

210
00:29:29,334 --> 00:29:30,334
There is.

211
00:29:30,501 --> 00:29:31,709
Be patient.

212
00:29:34,917 --> 00:29:36,626
I am patient.

213
00:29:52,834 --> 00:29:54,834
I've done nothing but wait.

214
00:29:58,792 --> 00:30:00,001
All my life.

215
00:30:03,417 --> 00:30:04,792
Waiting…

216
00:30:08,251 --> 00:30:11,501
for something to happen.

217
00:30:15,042 --> 00:30:16,667
What, I don't know.

218
00:30:18,167 --> 00:30:20,251
Now you do.

219
00:30:20,917 --> 00:30:23,501
You love your wife
and she loves you.

220
00:30:25,209 --> 00:30:29,292
That's what you think.
Because that suits you.

221
00:30:30,292 --> 00:30:32,667
You insisted I write to her.

222
00:30:36,917 --> 00:30:39,667
Dorothy knows I'll never make it.

223
00:30:40,584 --> 00:30:42,834
But you have made it.

224
00:30:44,459 --> 00:30:47,126
- I haven't, and you know it.
- I can see it.

225
00:30:48,251 --> 00:30:50,209
It won't last.

226
00:30:50,459 --> 00:30:52,084
Wait for her letter.

227
00:30:53,417 --> 00:30:55,001
It could come any day now.

228
00:30:55,167 --> 00:30:57,459
She won't answer, I tell you!

229
00:31:00,126 --> 00:31:02,251
She can't have believed me.

230
00:31:03,251 --> 00:31:06,459
When we married two years ago,
I swore I'd stop.

231
00:31:06,792 --> 00:31:09,917
As if I could.
Especially in New York.

232
00:31:10,084 --> 00:31:12,709
You're on the right track now.

233
00:31:15,209 --> 00:31:18,334
You still have feelings of anxiety?

234
00:31:22,251 --> 00:31:24,584
It's not feelings
of anxiety, Doctor.

235
00:31:25,209 --> 00:31:27,959
It's a single feeling
of constant anxiety.

236
00:31:44,292 --> 00:31:46,667
If you hang on a while longer,

237
00:31:47,751 --> 00:31:50,084
it will gradually let up.

238
00:31:51,834 --> 00:31:53,292
A matter of willpower.

239
00:31:54,834 --> 00:31:56,834
A contradiction, Doctor.

240
00:31:58,334 --> 00:32:01,001
How can you talk about
my willpower?

241
00:32:02,751 --> 00:32:05,251
That's where my sickness lies.

242
00:32:06,209 --> 00:32:08,084
That's what you're treating.

243
00:32:10,751 --> 00:32:12,876
You weren't always this way.

244
00:32:17,751 --> 00:32:19,084
What do you mean?

245
00:32:19,376 --> 00:32:22,667
You were in the army.
You went to war.

246
00:32:23,459 --> 00:32:26,001
- As an officer.
- Leave that alone.

247
00:32:26,751 --> 00:32:28,626
There's no connection.

248
00:32:33,792 --> 00:32:35,542
Send her a telegram.

249
00:32:36,209 --> 00:32:37,459
Tell her to take the next plane.

250
00:32:37,626 --> 00:32:41,001
Take her down south.
Or somewhere else.

251
00:32:42,334 --> 00:32:44,542
Anywhere but Paris.

252
00:32:53,751 --> 00:32:57,334
American women are strong
and healthy. She'll help you forget.

253
00:32:57,667 --> 00:32:59,251
Don't worry.

254
00:33:00,959 --> 00:33:04,667
I'll be gone by the end of the week,
come what may.

255
00:33:06,459 --> 00:33:08,084
As you like.

256
00:33:12,542 --> 00:33:15,251
What about your shop idea?

257
00:33:16,542 --> 00:33:18,126
Selling prewar objects,

258
00:33:18,334 --> 00:33:20,501
'37 World Fair-style.

259
00:33:21,251 --> 00:33:22,251
A good idea.

260
00:33:24,251 --> 00:33:26,459
You see me running a store?

261
00:33:27,459 --> 00:33:28,959
I'm drowning in debt.

262
00:33:31,334 --> 00:33:34,751
I can see I'm wearing you out.
I'll leave.

263
00:33:38,501 --> 00:33:40,209
What about our game?

264
00:33:40,626 --> 00:33:42,501
We can play tomorrow.

265
00:33:43,001 --> 00:33:44,584
Get some rest.

266
00:33:49,542 --> 00:33:51,167
Life is good.

267
00:33:54,417 --> 00:33:56,417
Good for what, Doctor?

268
00:34:03,667 --> 00:34:05,001
Tomorrow.

269
00:34:32,584 --> 00:34:33,792
Life…

270
00:34:34,959 --> 00:34:37,542
flows too slowly in me.

271
00:34:39,042 --> 00:34:41,417
So I speed it up.

272
00:34:42,792 --> 00:34:44,834
I set it right.

273
00:35:06,376 --> 00:35:08,167
Tomorrow I kill myself.

274
00:35:51,251 --> 00:35:52,542
Good morning.

275
00:35:52,709 --> 00:35:54,751
I brought your breakfast.

276
00:36:03,042 --> 00:36:05,001
Hand me my bathrobe.

277
00:36:11,751 --> 00:36:13,292
You're in a rush today.

278
00:36:13,459 --> 00:36:15,709
- I'm going out.
- Where?

279
00:36:15,876 --> 00:36:18,584
To Paris, city of orgies,

280
00:36:19,917 --> 00:36:22,251
which I left for good —

281
00:36:24,251 --> 00:36:25,709
When will you be back?

282
00:36:26,167 --> 00:36:27,292
I won't be long.

283
00:36:29,751 --> 00:36:33,751
I have to cash a check,
see some old friends —

284
00:36:33,959 --> 00:36:35,501
And come in at dawn.

285
00:36:41,584 --> 00:36:45,292
The doctor asked me
to remind you about the telegram.

286
00:36:45,459 --> 00:36:47,042
For your wife.

287
00:36:49,251 --> 00:36:51,042
I was just thinking about it.

288
00:37:06,292 --> 00:37:07,959
Telegram.

289
00:37:10,876 --> 00:37:13,626
"Await your letter

290
00:37:14,459 --> 00:37:16,209
with impatience.

291
00:37:19,917 --> 00:37:22,501
"… with patience and hope. Stop."

292
00:37:26,501 --> 00:37:27,917
More abrupt.

293
00:37:29,001 --> 00:37:30,417
"Thank you

294
00:37:31,376 --> 00:37:34,126
for your silence. Stop.

295
00:37:40,084 --> 00:37:42,626
You have a lover

296
00:37:43,792 --> 00:37:44,834
in Versailles.

297
00:37:46,084 --> 00:37:47,084
"Stop."

298
00:37:47,584 --> 00:37:49,751
Why not shake her up a bit?

299
00:37:56,626 --> 00:37:58,501
"Send reply.

300
00:37:58,876 --> 00:38:00,167
Stop.

301
00:38:02,209 --> 00:38:04,834
Need you. Stop.

302
00:38:12,417 --> 00:38:14,126
"Minutes count. Stop."

303
00:38:15,084 --> 00:38:16,917
No, reassure her.

304
00:38:21,834 --> 00:38:24,709
"Disregard this letter.

305
00:38:25,709 --> 00:38:27,167
Stop.

306
00:38:28,501 --> 00:38:32,709
Worries over.

307
00:38:34,417 --> 00:38:35,667
Stop.

308
00:38:37,001 --> 00:38:38,792
"Be happy."

309
00:38:42,126 --> 00:38:43,959
Sure, more like that.

310
00:38:48,834 --> 00:38:52,501
"Worries over. Be happy."

311
00:39:02,334 --> 00:39:06,667
My letter? Throw it away.
It's meaningless now.

312
00:39:09,084 --> 00:39:11,084
Sure, I have plans.

313
00:39:13,417 --> 00:39:14,709
To take a trip.

314
00:39:15,042 --> 00:39:16,334
What?

315
00:39:17,334 --> 00:39:20,334
No, I won't come to New York.

316
00:39:20,542 --> 00:39:22,084
Don't worry.

317
00:39:24,459 --> 00:39:26,501
Yes, I'm cured.

318
00:39:27,042 --> 00:39:28,917
Lydia must have told you.

319
00:39:30,292 --> 00:39:31,876
She told you everything?

320
00:39:33,042 --> 00:39:34,042
That's fine.

321
00:40:32,042 --> 00:40:34,084
For New York! It's urgent?

322
00:40:34,251 --> 00:40:36,209
Telegrams usually are.

323
00:41:10,876 --> 00:41:13,292
A pack of Sweet Aftons, please.

324
00:41:15,042 --> 00:41:16,459
What's that?

325
00:41:16,626 --> 00:41:18,459
Irish cigarettes.

326
00:41:20,251 --> 00:41:21,542
We don't carry 'em.

327
00:41:26,167 --> 00:41:27,417
You should.

328
00:41:27,626 --> 00:41:28,959
Not enough demand.

329
00:41:29,876 --> 00:41:31,001
I'm asking.

330
00:41:31,834 --> 00:41:35,209
One's not enough.
The stock would go bad.

331
00:41:36,792 --> 00:41:39,334
Too bad.
A pack of Luckys, then.

332
00:41:52,626 --> 00:41:54,001
A glass of white.

333
00:41:54,209 --> 00:41:55,459
A quick one.

334
00:42:01,376 --> 00:42:03,126
Going to Paris?

335
00:42:07,792 --> 00:42:09,751
Would you give me a lift?

336
00:42:14,001 --> 00:42:15,834
It's against regulations.

337
00:42:18,001 --> 00:42:19,917
I'll buy you a drink.

338
00:42:20,376 --> 00:42:21,917
This one's on me.

339
00:42:32,334 --> 00:42:34,001
To your health.

340
00:42:34,251 --> 00:42:36,292
- What are you having?
- Nothing, thanks.

341
00:42:38,042 --> 00:42:39,751
You have to drink with us.

342
00:42:39,959 --> 00:42:41,501
I don't drink.

343
00:43:01,334 --> 00:43:03,167
You work in Versailles?

344
00:43:03,542 --> 00:43:05,001
I don't work.

345
00:43:08,709 --> 00:43:11,251
Private income?

346
00:43:18,376 --> 00:43:19,834
I'm sick.

347
00:43:20,001 --> 00:43:21,834
So that's why.

348
00:43:22,042 --> 00:43:23,459
What?

349
00:43:23,626 --> 00:43:26,542
Why you look so pale.
What's the problem?

350
00:43:27,292 --> 00:43:28,334
My heart.

351
00:43:32,584 --> 00:43:34,876
Don't you mind not having money?

352
00:43:36,584 --> 00:43:38,251
Well, I mind.

353
00:43:39,209 --> 00:43:41,417
But you look well-off.

354
00:43:41,876 --> 00:43:43,542
I only look it.

355
00:45:28,626 --> 00:45:31,626
Florence, look who's here!

356
00:45:32,376 --> 00:45:35,334
Mr. Alain! You haven't changed.

357
00:45:35,501 --> 00:45:38,084
- You put on weight, maybe.
- You're looking good.

358
00:45:38,251 --> 00:45:39,751
You just got in?

359
00:45:39,917 --> 00:45:41,542
Do you like America?

360
00:45:41,709 --> 00:45:43,334
You live in New York?

361
00:45:43,501 --> 00:45:45,834
Does Mr. Bernard still live here?

362
00:45:46,001 --> 00:45:49,584
No, he left.
Not long after you did.

363
00:45:49,751 --> 00:45:51,001
Leaving already?

364
00:45:51,167 --> 00:45:54,334
- I want to use the bar phone.
- You can phone from here.

365
00:45:55,001 --> 00:45:56,792
I must see Charlie.

366
00:45:57,834 --> 00:46:00,834
Poor guy. He's really changed.
His face!

367
00:46:01,001 --> 00:46:03,917
And his voice…
Did you notice his voice?

368
00:46:12,084 --> 00:46:15,417
- Mr. Leroy, of all people!
- Hello, Charlie.

369
00:46:15,584 --> 00:46:19,042
I was talking about you
just yesterday with René.

370
00:46:19,209 --> 00:46:22,459
"The Beach" bartender
in Monte Carlo. He's in town.

371
00:46:22,626 --> 00:46:24,792
We made a bet
about where you were.

372
00:46:25,001 --> 00:46:27,209
I bet you were still in America.

373
00:46:27,376 --> 00:46:30,501
I lost.
But I'm real glad to see you.

374
00:46:34,209 --> 00:46:36,042
The usual Scotch Sour?

375
00:46:36,834 --> 00:46:39,917
You serious?
It was your first drink of the day.

376
00:46:40,126 --> 00:46:41,667
"To tune up," you'd say.

377
00:46:46,876 --> 00:46:48,292
Mr. Lavaud, please.

378
00:46:49,334 --> 00:46:50,917
This is Alain Leroy.

379
00:46:51,084 --> 00:46:54,417
Say hello from Charlie.
Tell him he's a quitter.

380
00:46:54,667 --> 00:46:58,376
He never comes in now.
Married men are all the same.

381
00:46:58,834 --> 00:47:00,626
Is Mrs. Leroy with you?

382
00:47:02,501 --> 00:47:04,251
She stayed in America?

383
00:47:06,917 --> 00:47:09,751
Yep, Mr. Lavaud is a quitter.

384
00:47:09,917 --> 00:47:14,751
When Mr. Castellotti is in town,
he always stays here.

385
00:47:15,334 --> 00:47:16,542
We remember old times.

386
00:47:17,251 --> 00:47:20,584
"That sweet Alain," he says.
He worships you.

387
00:47:20,834 --> 00:47:22,626
He lives in Milan now.

388
00:47:22,834 --> 00:47:25,417
Married, two cute little girls.

389
00:47:25,626 --> 00:47:27,334
He showed me photos.

390
00:47:28,876 --> 00:47:31,709
He comes for business,
and a bit of fun on the side.

391
00:47:31,876 --> 00:47:36,042
The other day he brought in
this gorgeous brunette, a stripper.

392
00:47:36,209 --> 00:47:38,126
Fine. Tonight at 8:00.

393
00:47:55,209 --> 00:47:56,834
Do you want a coffee?

394
00:48:00,126 --> 00:48:02,334
No, I'm late.

395
00:48:04,417 --> 00:48:06,376
Call me tonight at 7:00.

396
00:48:15,417 --> 00:48:17,042
A beer, Charlie.

397
00:48:19,751 --> 00:48:21,626
What time did you get in?

398
00:48:21,834 --> 00:48:24,209
Late, Charlie, very late.

399
00:48:24,459 --> 00:48:26,292
Or early, if you prefer.

400
00:48:28,126 --> 00:48:30,501
Got some Alka-Seltzer?
My head's bursting.

401
00:48:35,167 --> 00:48:36,876
The Minvilles don't answer.

402
00:48:37,042 --> 00:48:39,417
- They're not home.
- Why not?

403
00:48:39,792 --> 00:48:42,459
Because they're in prison.

404
00:48:42,626 --> 00:48:43,876
Algeria again?

405
00:48:44,334 --> 00:48:48,001
The war's over,
but not for the Minville brothers.

406
00:48:59,626 --> 00:49:03,001
Don't you remember me?
Michel Bostel.

407
00:49:03,251 --> 00:49:05,876
We met at the Pamplona Feria
five or six years ago.

408
00:49:06,042 --> 00:49:07,917
You were with an American girl.

409
00:49:08,542 --> 00:49:10,626
I was only a kid then.

410
00:49:11,084 --> 00:49:13,667
Then I was called up,
and you left Paris.

411
00:49:19,376 --> 00:49:21,751
- Is Francis down yet?
- Not yet.

412
00:49:24,167 --> 00:49:25,834
I'll get him up.

413
00:49:27,626 --> 00:49:28,709
Who's that?

414
00:49:28,876 --> 00:49:32,417
Nice guy. He lives in the hotel.

415
00:49:33,376 --> 00:49:35,251
The room I used to have.

416
00:49:35,876 --> 00:49:37,709
He's my successor.

417
00:49:37,917 --> 00:49:41,376
Hardly!
We've put a plaque on the door:

418
00:49:41,584 --> 00:49:44,626
"Here, for several years,
lived Alain Leroy."

419
00:49:45,792 --> 00:49:47,751
Those were the days.

420
00:49:48,834 --> 00:49:50,126
Not like today.

421
00:49:58,834 --> 00:50:01,042
I didn't ask how you were.

422
00:50:02,001 --> 00:50:03,459
You don't look too good.

423
00:50:03,667 --> 00:50:06,084
I've been ill,
but I'm better now.

424
00:50:06,834 --> 00:50:08,542
You don't look it.

425
00:50:11,417 --> 00:50:13,292
- Problems?
- Not really.

426
00:50:14,042 --> 00:50:16,417
I've been in a Versailles clinic.

427
00:50:18,209 --> 00:50:19,417
For how long?

428
00:50:20,292 --> 00:50:21,542
Four months.

429
00:50:21,751 --> 00:50:23,126
Leaving tomorrow?

430
00:50:24,292 --> 00:50:25,792
For New York?

431
00:50:30,334 --> 00:50:31,917
You didn't touch it.

432
00:50:32,084 --> 00:50:35,334
I don't drink anymore.
Not a drop.

433
00:50:35,501 --> 00:50:37,376
If I'd known —

434
00:50:38,876 --> 00:50:41,834
I always said you drank too much.

435
00:50:42,209 --> 00:50:45,334
You used to say, "Funny thing
for a bartender to say!"

436
00:50:55,251 --> 00:50:58,709
Poor boy.
He was so full of life.

437
00:50:59,334 --> 00:51:02,376
- And depressions, too.
- But never for long.

438
00:51:12,751 --> 00:51:14,667
I don't have any change.

439
00:51:14,876 --> 00:51:17,792
Never mind. Keep the change.

440
00:51:18,584 --> 00:51:19,667
Are you nuts?

441
00:51:21,751 --> 00:51:22,834
What a dope!

442
00:51:52,001 --> 00:51:53,834
Is Mr. Dubourg in?

443
00:51:54,001 --> 00:51:56,209
Now?
They just sat down to lunch.

444
00:51:56,834 --> 00:51:58,251
Who is it, Chantal?

445
00:52:01,001 --> 00:52:02,542
It's Alain.

446
00:52:12,084 --> 00:52:13,417
Comrade Dubourg.

447
00:52:14,792 --> 00:52:16,542
I was expecting you.

448
00:52:17,626 --> 00:52:19,167
Liar.

449
00:52:22,167 --> 00:52:24,334
Faveur, say hello to Alain.

450
00:52:29,334 --> 00:52:32,834
Now run along.
Tell Mommy to come in.

451
00:52:38,584 --> 00:52:40,292
Playing Daddy now?

452
00:52:41,667 --> 00:52:43,459
I do lots of things now.

453
00:52:45,584 --> 00:52:48,542
- Still into Egyptology?
- More than ever.

454
00:52:49,376 --> 00:52:51,709
I sensed it in you from the start.

455
00:52:53,334 --> 00:52:57,167
I remember catching you in bed
with a blonde, your back to her,

456
00:52:58,167 --> 00:53:01,751
your nose buried in a book
on esoterics.

457
00:53:01,917 --> 00:53:06,709
Yes. While dissipating my youth
in St. Tropez, I studied Kabbala.

458
00:53:08,334 --> 00:53:10,001
You still find it fun?

459
00:53:10,334 --> 00:53:13,209
I don't find it fun.
I find it interesting.

460
00:53:19,001 --> 00:53:22,792
Remember the famous Alain
you stole me from?

461
00:53:25,042 --> 00:53:27,501
- Alain's staying for lunch.
- I shouldn't.

462
00:53:27,667 --> 00:53:29,501
Set another place, Fanny.

463
00:53:29,667 --> 00:53:32,334
It's done. Lunch is served.

464
00:53:35,709 --> 00:53:39,584
You never wrote or phoned,
but we knew where you were.

465
00:53:42,126 --> 00:53:44,126
La Barbinais told me.

466
00:53:44,834 --> 00:53:48,251
I call him occasionally
to ask about you.

467
00:53:48,417 --> 00:53:50,042
How good of you.

468
00:53:50,751 --> 00:53:53,001
But he wouldn't let me visit.

469
00:53:53,834 --> 00:53:55,292
Total isolation.

470
00:53:55,459 --> 00:53:57,417
I was tired.

471
00:53:58,001 --> 00:54:01,626
The cure was rough,
especially after New York.

472
00:54:02,042 --> 00:54:04,501
- It has nothing to do with NY.
- Yes, it does.

473
00:54:05,334 --> 00:54:07,626
It's no place for us.

474
00:54:08,209 --> 00:54:10,501
It's like a crazy whirlpool.

475
00:54:11,042 --> 00:54:12,376
I love New York.

476
00:54:13,334 --> 00:54:17,459
Fascinating, but hard to live in.
It gets into your system.

477
00:54:17,876 --> 00:54:21,334
People disappear into the city
like drug addicts.

478
00:54:25,167 --> 00:54:27,626
I felt good there.
It wasn't home.

479
00:54:28,459 --> 00:54:31,126
- I always felt like a visitor.
- And Paris?

480
00:54:31,292 --> 00:54:34,251
Pretty much the same,
but I prefer New York.

481
00:54:35,376 --> 00:54:37,334
People leave you alone.

482
00:54:37,501 --> 00:54:40,042
- Why come back, then?
- For treatment.

483
00:54:41,001 --> 00:54:42,626
Why not there?

484
00:54:43,459 --> 00:54:45,709
Dorothy had seen enough of me.

485
00:54:46,167 --> 00:54:47,917
She knows you're cured?

486
00:54:48,084 --> 00:54:49,792
She's been told.

487
00:54:50,584 --> 00:54:52,667
And you — do you know it?

488
00:54:52,876 --> 00:54:53,876
I feel it.

489
00:54:54,459 --> 00:54:57,917
You feel completely sterilized,
body and soul.

490
00:54:58,876 --> 00:55:00,126
That's something.

491
00:55:00,292 --> 00:55:02,501
In "sterilized" there's "sterile".

492
00:55:03,292 --> 00:55:04,376
You're telling me.

493
00:55:15,334 --> 00:55:17,042
Do you like Françoise Hardy?

494
00:55:17,209 --> 00:55:18,459
Who, then?

495
00:55:18,667 --> 00:55:20,334
Sylvie Vartan.

496
00:55:21,167 --> 00:55:22,251
What's that?

497
00:55:23,001 --> 00:55:24,334
A teen idol.

498
00:55:25,334 --> 00:55:27,959
You forget population growth,
old man.

499
00:55:28,251 --> 00:55:31,001
Young people today are hopeless.

500
00:55:31,167 --> 00:55:33,376
Good-looking, elegant, well-fed.

501
00:55:33,584 --> 00:55:36,376
They're all alike,
like California oranges.

502
00:55:36,542 --> 00:55:39,126
But you know nothing about them.

503
00:55:50,792 --> 00:55:52,626
Have you worked at all?

504
00:55:54,751 --> 00:55:57,334
I'd been keeping a diary lately.

505
00:55:58,209 --> 00:56:01,167
Of no interest whatsoever.
I tore it up today.

506
00:56:04,001 --> 00:56:05,167
How are you now?

507
00:56:08,042 --> 00:56:09,834
Feeling empty.

508
00:56:11,626 --> 00:56:13,501
With some atrocious moments.

509
00:56:14,626 --> 00:56:16,376
Can you hold out?

510
00:56:17,376 --> 00:56:20,834
Hold out? It's all over for me.

511
00:56:22,542 --> 00:56:24,167
I'm leaving.

512
00:56:25,001 --> 00:56:26,751
Don't you understand?

513
00:56:40,751 --> 00:56:43,126
There are still things in life.

514
00:56:44,917 --> 00:56:47,167
You must have
a sense of your life.

515
00:56:49,126 --> 00:56:51,584
That sense can't perish.

516
00:56:54,376 --> 00:56:56,792
I hate things
that stay locked up.

517
00:56:57,751 --> 00:57:00,042
A man's got to show
what he's made of.

518
00:57:01,709 --> 00:57:03,876
Doing something well is wonderful.

519
00:57:04,084 --> 00:57:05,709
I never knew what that meant.

520
00:57:06,459 --> 00:57:08,626
I've only run after money,

521
00:57:08,792 --> 00:57:10,626
like everybody else.

522
00:57:10,834 --> 00:57:13,209
Then you would've worked or stolen.

523
00:57:13,834 --> 00:57:18,917
No, what you call money
is an excuse for daydreaming.

524
00:57:19,084 --> 00:57:22,584
Go on. I don't want
to spoil your pleasure.

525
00:57:24,334 --> 00:57:27,251
What I love about man
is not his passions,

526
00:57:28,709 --> 00:57:31,042
but what those passions produce.

527
00:57:31,542 --> 00:57:34,917
Ideas. Gods.

528
00:57:36,376 --> 00:57:38,917
Where do you see passions here?

529
00:57:42,167 --> 00:57:43,959
You got me wrong.

530
00:57:45,042 --> 00:57:47,126
Don't judge by appearances.

531
00:57:48,167 --> 00:57:50,709
You see me as a resigned bourgeois.

532
00:57:51,667 --> 00:57:54,042
But my life's more intense now

533
00:57:54,251 --> 00:57:56,376
than when I drank
and slept around.

534
00:57:56,584 --> 00:57:58,584
I'll end up writing a book

535
00:57:59,209 --> 00:58:01,626
on the virtues of ancient Egypt.

536
00:58:02,626 --> 00:58:05,001
They run in my blood.

537
00:58:05,917 --> 00:58:07,876
Others will learn from it.

538
00:58:10,126 --> 00:58:11,542
The sun —

539
00:58:12,292 --> 00:58:14,001
you can touch it.

540
00:58:14,501 --> 00:58:16,584
Come to Egypt with us.

541
00:58:16,751 --> 00:58:19,292
Those people
have the sun inside them.

542
00:58:23,376 --> 00:58:25,459
Let's take a walk, prophet.

543
00:58:41,792 --> 00:58:43,667
The Minvilles are different.

544
00:58:43,834 --> 00:58:46,251
They're addicted to action.

545
00:58:48,126 --> 00:58:50,001
Do you ever see Eva?

546
00:58:50,834 --> 00:58:53,167
I don't see her or the others.
What for?

547
00:58:54,126 --> 00:58:56,209
You're harsh for a happy man.

548
00:58:57,376 --> 00:58:59,501
Does your life satisfy you?

549
00:58:59,876 --> 00:59:01,584
It doesn't matter.

550
00:59:02,376 --> 00:59:04,209
What if you get bored?

551
00:59:05,834 --> 00:59:07,626
Fanny and her daughters,

552
00:59:08,084 --> 00:59:09,751
the musty house —

553
00:59:10,751 --> 00:59:12,917
they're part of my passion.

554
00:59:15,042 --> 00:59:17,584
And the old glint in your eye?

555
00:59:18,417 --> 00:59:19,667
Your superb energy?

556
00:59:21,042 --> 00:59:22,126
I'm older.

557
00:59:22,334 --> 00:59:23,334
Really!

558
00:59:24,251 --> 00:59:27,917
Yes, I'm older. The hopes are gone,
but I have certainties now.

559
00:59:28,834 --> 00:59:31,626
I left my youth for another life.

560
00:59:32,417 --> 00:59:35,834
You turn your back.
You reject adulthood.

561
00:59:36,501 --> 00:59:38,792
You're stuck in adolescence.

562
00:59:44,542 --> 00:59:46,001
Hence your anxiety.

563
00:59:51,501 --> 00:59:53,459
It's hard to be a man.

564
00:59:54,459 --> 00:59:56,376
You have to want to be one.

565
00:59:57,834 --> 01:00:00,126
Aren't you sick of mirages?

566
01:00:04,001 --> 01:00:06,251
I can't stand mediocrity.

567
01:00:06,792 --> 01:00:09,501
You've just spent 10 years
in gilded mediocrity.

568
01:00:12,792 --> 01:00:15,626
And I've had enough.
I'm calling it a day.

569
01:00:18,834 --> 01:00:21,292
I refuse to grow old.

570
01:00:22,959 --> 01:00:26,167
You miss your youth
as if you'd lived it to the fullest.

571
01:00:26,917 --> 01:00:30,167
It was a promise. And a lie.

572
01:00:32,209 --> 01:00:34,167
I was the liar.

573
01:00:42,126 --> 01:00:44,834
You're tormented
by the idea of women.

574
01:00:47,626 --> 01:00:49,459
I have no power over them.

575
01:00:49,626 --> 01:00:51,334
That's a laugh.

576
01:00:52,167 --> 01:00:54,084
I was handsome at 20.

577
01:00:54,376 --> 01:00:56,792
They still find me fun and nice.

578
01:00:58,792 --> 01:01:02,542
But it's not enough.
I have no hold on them.

579
01:01:03,751 --> 01:01:07,251
And yet, it's only through women

580
01:01:07,417 --> 01:01:10,251
that I've felt some hold on life.

581
01:01:20,834 --> 01:01:23,167
It's not life itself I blame,

582
01:01:23,501 --> 01:01:26,334
but what's contemptible in it.

583
01:01:31,251 --> 01:01:33,542
Where did all this start?

584
01:01:33,917 --> 01:01:35,917
If I knew, maybe I could help you.

585
01:01:36,334 --> 01:01:39,251
Alcohol was in my blood
before I realized it.

586
01:01:39,626 --> 01:01:41,001
What do you mean?

587
01:01:42,709 --> 01:01:46,334
I started to drink
while waiting for things.

588
01:01:48,001 --> 01:01:51,042
Then one day I realized
I'd spent my life waiting.

589
01:01:52,126 --> 01:01:53,751
For women.

590
01:01:54,209 --> 01:01:55,709
Money.

591
01:01:56,417 --> 01:01:58,001
Action.

592
01:01:59,417 --> 01:02:01,542
So I drank myself stupid.

593
01:02:01,709 --> 01:02:05,417
But you had Dorothy,
and a lot of others.

594
01:02:06,292 --> 01:02:09,376
I never had them.
I don't have them now.

595
01:02:09,834 --> 01:02:14,126
You've got Dorothy. You don't have
to sleep with her to prove it.

596
01:02:14,292 --> 01:02:16,584
I don't. I wasn't a good lover.

597
01:02:16,751 --> 01:02:18,334
She fled your drinking.

598
01:02:18,501 --> 01:02:21,001
I drink because I'm a bad lover.

599
01:02:27,876 --> 01:02:30,626
Funny lives we lead,
clinging to women.

600
01:02:31,417 --> 01:02:33,959
You don't seem to cling to Fanny.

601
01:02:34,167 --> 01:02:38,042
I wallow in her warmth
like a pig in a trough.

602
01:02:48,876 --> 01:02:50,792
She makes you want to touch her.

603
01:02:50,959 --> 01:02:53,251
Paris is like her, and so is life.

604
01:02:54,834 --> 01:02:57,709
You and your mediocre certainties!

605
01:03:06,001 --> 01:03:07,959
Let that mediocrity be enough.

606
01:03:08,292 --> 01:03:10,667
You'll recover some of your verve.

607
01:03:11,167 --> 01:03:14,001
You're spineless. And weak.

608
01:03:14,917 --> 01:03:16,042
And lazy.

609
01:03:16,834 --> 01:03:18,917
Certainties frighten you.

610
01:03:19,084 --> 01:03:22,126
You defend the shadows,
since the sun hurts your eyes.

611
01:03:25,209 --> 01:03:27,251
Are you my friend?

612
01:03:28,501 --> 01:03:32,334
If you are my friend,
take me as I am. Not otherwise.

613
01:03:35,917 --> 01:03:37,626
Let me look at you.

614
01:03:40,251 --> 01:03:42,209
I wanted you to help me die.

615
01:03:45,167 --> 01:03:46,209
That's all.

616
01:03:52,334 --> 01:03:54,584
Promise to come see us again.

617
01:03:56,292 --> 01:03:58,251
We lead an organized life.

618
01:03:59,042 --> 01:04:00,542
You can write.

619
01:04:02,376 --> 01:04:03,834
Move in tomorrow.

620
01:04:04,001 --> 01:04:07,001
Dubourg,
what will you do tonight?

621
01:04:09,126 --> 01:04:13,251
I'll write a few pages
on my Egyptians…

622
01:04:15,917 --> 01:04:17,917
<i>Then I make love to Fanny.</i>

623
01:04:19,167 --> 01:04:21,917
<i>I fall into her silence
as into a well.</i>

624
01:04:22,542 --> 01:04:26,292
<i>At the bottom is a great sun
that warms the earth.</i>

625
01:04:32,001 --> 01:04:33,792
<i>I work, Alain.</i>

626
01:04:34,876 --> 01:04:36,501
<i>I'm patient.</i>

627
01:04:39,167 --> 01:04:42,251
<i>Come live with us.
You'll see what patience is.</i>

628
01:04:44,876 --> 01:04:46,751
<i>Alain, I love life.</i>

629
01:04:48,459 --> 01:04:51,417
<i>What I love in you
is that irreplaceable thing…</i>

630
01:04:52,251 --> 01:04:54,417
<i>the life inside you.</i>

631
01:05:32,084 --> 01:05:35,084
You look like death warmed over.

632
01:05:37,251 --> 01:05:40,084
You're no spring chicken yourself.

633
01:05:41,417 --> 01:05:43,417
You have lovely eyes.

634
01:06:16,834 --> 01:06:20,459
You choose your friends.
You hang out with healthy people.

635
01:06:21,501 --> 01:06:25,209
You go to see Dubourg again.
That deadbeat Dubourg.

636
01:06:25,584 --> 01:06:27,251
Manners, manners.

637
01:06:27,417 --> 01:06:29,292
How's your American witch?

638
01:06:31,251 --> 01:06:32,584
New York?

639
01:06:40,709 --> 01:06:42,834
We have amazing friends.

640
01:06:44,209 --> 01:06:46,626
They think time changes them.

641
01:06:47,626 --> 01:06:51,376
So they run around like mad,
not knowing what they're doing.

642
01:06:51,542 --> 01:06:55,084
Having children, making deals,
writing books.

643
01:06:56,334 --> 01:06:58,209
Or else they kill themselves.

644
01:06:59,209 --> 01:07:01,834
Or they get mystical, like Dubourg.

645
01:07:02,834 --> 01:07:04,584
The party's over.

646
01:07:05,792 --> 01:07:09,876
The bastards talk about sincerity
and go about their grubby lives.

647
01:07:15,917 --> 01:07:18,334
- And you?
- Me?

648
01:07:19,751 --> 01:07:22,084
Abandoned, ruined,

649
01:07:22,459 --> 01:07:25,959
utterly devastated…
unshakeable!

650
01:07:26,709 --> 01:07:30,209
I never change.
I never try to understand.

651
01:07:31,751 --> 01:07:34,501
Sleep is all I believe in.

652
01:07:34,751 --> 01:07:36,709
You have changed. You work now.

653
01:07:36,876 --> 01:07:39,042
Painting? My one weakness.

654
01:07:39,209 --> 01:07:40,667
The only one?

655
01:07:48,834 --> 01:07:50,751
And Carla? Where is she?

656
01:07:52,792 --> 01:07:56,667
She got herself killed.
It was last year in a car accident.

657
01:07:58,542 --> 01:08:00,376
Along with some fool.

658
01:08:01,584 --> 01:08:03,042
It's absurd.

659
01:08:17,667 --> 01:08:19,751
You can stay here if you like.

660
01:08:20,209 --> 01:08:22,501
Thanks, but I'm leaving.

661
01:08:22,917 --> 01:08:24,959
I came to say good-bye.

662
01:08:25,542 --> 01:08:26,959
You too?

663
01:08:35,001 --> 01:08:37,542
Disaster, honey!
The stove's died on us.

664
01:08:37,709 --> 01:08:41,501
That's Urcel. I warn you,
he's a real chatterbox.

665
01:08:49,709 --> 01:08:53,667
Detoxication. A strange thing.

666
01:08:56,167 --> 01:08:59,376
Why do we pretend
to go into detox, dear God!

667
01:09:03,001 --> 01:09:04,751
Out of kindness.

668
01:09:08,167 --> 01:09:10,751
To make a few worried
friends happy.

669
01:09:12,876 --> 01:09:17,584
So as not to leave poor mankind
alone with its misery.

670
01:09:20,209 --> 01:09:21,959
Shut up, Urcel.

671
01:09:22,209 --> 01:09:26,167
You went into detox
because you were afraid of dying.

672
01:09:28,251 --> 01:09:29,501
Wrong.

673
01:09:30,167 --> 01:09:33,876
We poets have no need for drugs

674
01:09:34,126 --> 01:09:36,876
to attain the borderline
between life and death.

675
01:09:39,459 --> 01:09:42,459
What brought me
back to drugs, in fact,

676
01:09:43,084 --> 01:09:46,292
was the love of risk in our blood.

677
01:09:48,417 --> 01:09:50,209
Where do you find death,

678
01:09:51,251 --> 01:09:53,376
the madness in all this?

679
01:09:54,001 --> 01:09:57,584
Drugs are life.
They're boring,

680
01:09:57,792 --> 01:09:59,251
just like life.

681
01:10:03,834 --> 01:10:07,084
Nice system you have
to put your mind at rest.

682
01:10:08,167 --> 01:10:10,876
Some addicts live to be 70.

683
01:10:14,417 --> 01:10:16,626
All you risk is deadening your mind.

684
01:10:17,167 --> 01:10:18,876
It's all right for you to talk.

685
01:10:19,209 --> 01:10:23,292
Urcel is taking a huge risk.
He has to produce his work.

686
01:10:25,417 --> 01:10:26,917
Oh, please, my dear.

687
01:10:30,542 --> 01:10:34,251
His work… more alibis.

688
01:10:36,126 --> 01:10:39,126
You poor man,
you have no sense of such things.

689
01:10:43,459 --> 01:10:45,667
You're empty inside.

690
01:10:49,042 --> 01:10:50,709
What a boor!

691
01:10:51,251 --> 01:10:53,209
He's become unbearable.

692
01:10:54,751 --> 01:10:59,042
Basically he's a failure,
and an envious one.

693
01:10:59,417 --> 01:11:00,667
Nonsense.

694
01:11:03,126 --> 01:11:05,292
He's a very sweet guy…

695
01:11:06,834 --> 01:11:08,667
and he's deeply unhappy.

696
01:11:11,709 --> 01:11:13,834
I shouldn't have let him go.

697
01:11:14,001 --> 01:11:15,709
Don't worry.

698
01:11:16,042 --> 01:11:18,751
He may be unhappy,
but he won't kill himself.

699
01:11:18,917 --> 01:11:20,667
How do you know?

700
01:11:23,001 --> 01:11:24,542
Just shut up.

701
01:11:45,417 --> 01:11:47,084
I know you don't like me.

702
01:11:47,751 --> 01:11:51,834
I just came for news about
Jerome Minville and his brother.

703
01:11:53,751 --> 01:11:54,917
Try the Café Flore.

704
01:12:06,876 --> 01:12:09,001
I hear you were in prison.

705
01:12:09,584 --> 01:12:12,001
I was, last week.

706
01:12:15,542 --> 01:12:17,126
It's good to see you.

707
01:12:18,042 --> 01:12:19,626
You don't look so good.

708
01:12:23,542 --> 01:12:25,167
Pretty-boy Alain!

709
01:12:29,459 --> 01:12:31,459
He says we need some mountain air.

710
01:12:31,667 --> 01:12:33,334
He hasn't changed a bit.

711
01:12:33,501 --> 01:12:36,917
What did you do over in JFK-land?
Party a lot?

712
01:12:37,167 --> 01:12:40,376
- I should've been with you.
- We did ask you.

713
01:12:44,251 --> 01:12:47,626
Your plan was doomed
from the start.

714
01:12:47,792 --> 01:12:50,709
Sure. History marches on.

715
01:12:51,001 --> 01:12:54,834
They'll hear from us again.
We're stubborn, you know.

716
01:12:55,542 --> 01:12:57,084
You won't give up?

717
01:12:57,667 --> 01:13:02,334
- Are you crazy?
- No. We're going skiing in Spain.

718
01:13:07,876 --> 01:13:10,917
Alain Leroy…
an old pal from Algeria.

719
01:13:11,126 --> 01:13:15,084
- And Left Bank dives.
- A fine officer in his day.

720
01:13:15,292 --> 01:13:17,376
- A great friend.
- A bit of a drunk.

721
01:13:17,584 --> 01:13:20,167
More than a bit.
Always with the ladies.

722
01:13:20,376 --> 01:13:21,917
No political conscience.

723
01:13:22,126 --> 01:13:24,251
- Not to be counted on.
- Too bad.

724
01:13:24,501 --> 01:13:28,376
Carrying on with your plot now
is grotesque and stupid.

725
01:13:29,001 --> 01:13:30,584
You haven't a chance.

726
01:13:33,126 --> 01:13:34,876
You're just boy scouts.

727
01:13:35,084 --> 01:13:37,792
You don't know
what you're talking about.

728
01:13:38,001 --> 01:13:39,626
We're stubborn, I said.

729
01:13:40,167 --> 01:13:41,501
When it's all over,

730
01:13:42,709 --> 01:13:45,709
we'll go on a binge,
just like old times.

731
01:16:26,376 --> 01:16:29,709
Not living there anymore?
I thought you were.

732
01:16:29,876 --> 01:16:31,751
No, I came back.

733
01:17:35,751 --> 01:17:38,209
Life is so disgraceful.

734
01:17:38,376 --> 01:17:40,667
The humiliation of it all.

735
01:17:45,376 --> 01:17:48,042
In St. Tropez,
for the whole month of June!

736
01:17:48,251 --> 01:17:50,001
What a madhouse!

737
01:17:50,209 --> 01:17:53,834
It was ten years ago. The whole
crowd was there, remember?

738
01:17:54,042 --> 01:17:55,501
It was something!

739
01:17:55,709 --> 01:17:59,501
We told Coppi, the cyclist,
his girl had killed herself.

740
01:17:59,667 --> 01:18:01,334
It wasn't funny.

741
01:18:02,209 --> 01:18:05,792
Once he hijacked
an American Express tourist bus

742
01:18:06,001 --> 01:18:07,251
and gave them
a tour of the Ritz

743
01:18:07,459 --> 01:18:09,917
while talking
about Scott Fitzgerald.

744
01:18:13,917 --> 01:18:15,001
See that face?

745
01:18:18,001 --> 01:18:19,584
Alcohol.

746
01:18:20,167 --> 01:18:21,792
He's done for.

747
01:18:22,626 --> 01:18:25,001
A shame. He was good-looking.

748
01:18:25,292 --> 01:18:27,542
Richard was in love with him.

749
01:18:33,084 --> 01:18:36,001
Go-kart racing
in the streets of Paris!

750
01:18:36,751 --> 01:18:40,292
<i>He organized it.
It drove the cops nuts.</i>

751
01:19:12,001 --> 01:19:13,209
Look out!

752
01:19:20,167 --> 01:19:21,667
Are you all right?

753
01:20:08,126 --> 01:20:09,501
Mr. Leroy!

754
01:20:20,084 --> 01:20:22,292
- Come dry off.
- Don't worry.

755
01:20:23,167 --> 01:20:24,584
You're soaked.

756
01:20:29,542 --> 01:20:31,334
I'm not feeling well.

757
01:20:39,876 --> 01:20:41,626
I'm early.

758
01:20:42,542 --> 01:20:45,334
I fainted in the street.

759
01:20:47,542 --> 01:20:49,209
Lie down until dinner.

760
01:20:51,709 --> 01:20:53,209
You've got time.

761
01:20:55,209 --> 01:20:57,376
Brancion won't be here before 10,

762
01:20:57,542 --> 01:20:58,584
as usual.

763
01:21:00,542 --> 01:21:01,917
You know Brancion?

764
01:21:02,251 --> 01:21:05,209
No. That is, yes.
Don't we all?

765
01:21:06,626 --> 01:21:10,584
He's a big man nowadays.
He's the talk of the town.

766
01:21:12,084 --> 01:21:14,834
That shock-trooper egghead
amuses me.

767
01:21:15,001 --> 01:21:16,959
Him and his strongman act.

768
01:21:17,751 --> 01:21:19,584
Don't speak ill of strongmen.

769
01:21:29,292 --> 01:21:30,667
I'll be up later.

770
01:21:41,001 --> 01:21:42,834
Ring if you need anything.

771
01:21:56,876 --> 01:21:58,626
Let him sleep.

772
01:22:00,209 --> 01:22:02,167
I know what happened.

773
01:22:03,209 --> 01:22:06,834
The first drink after detox
makes you very sick.

774
01:22:08,667 --> 01:22:09,834
And then?

775
01:22:10,667 --> 01:22:13,084
Then it's all right,
unfortunately.

776
01:22:18,751 --> 01:22:19,834
Poor Alain.

777
01:22:24,126 --> 01:22:25,792
It's nice to see him again.

778
01:22:34,251 --> 01:22:36,292
You're looking ugly today, Ma Ubu.

779
01:22:45,792 --> 01:22:47,126
Safety.

780
01:22:48,292 --> 01:22:50,501
The peace of mind of these people!

781
01:24:05,334 --> 01:24:07,376
Nobody would touch the story.

782
01:24:08,001 --> 01:24:10,542
The Anglo-American press
has more guts.

783
01:24:10,709 --> 01:24:12,126
Excuse me.

784
01:24:19,542 --> 01:24:22,917
What did my mother used to say
when I was late?

785
01:24:23,876 --> 01:24:27,792
"Alain, you'll start
with the current course."

786
01:24:28,667 --> 01:24:30,209
Sit down.

787
01:24:31,917 --> 01:24:33,584
You know everyone?

788
01:24:37,542 --> 01:24:39,751
I don't think you've met Brancion.

789
01:24:39,959 --> 01:24:43,376
Marc, may I present a revenant,
Alain Leroy.

790
01:24:44,792 --> 01:24:47,334
An old friend of Cyrille's,
and an old flame of mine.

791
01:24:57,376 --> 01:24:59,334
Hong Kong is overrated.

792
01:24:59,626 --> 01:25:04,334
Oriental eroticism,
based on my own little experience,

793
01:25:04,751 --> 01:25:06,917
is nothing like what they say.

794
01:25:07,251 --> 01:25:09,542
But there's Chinese erotica.

795
01:25:10,584 --> 01:25:13,501
There's nothing erotic about it.

796
01:25:14,292 --> 01:25:18,459
Eroticism is a Western invention,
a Christian concept

797
01:25:18,959 --> 01:25:21,626
based on ideas of good and evil,

798
01:25:22,001 --> 01:25:24,251
transgression and original sin.

799
01:25:25,376 --> 01:25:27,834
These concepts don't exist there.

800
01:25:30,917 --> 01:25:32,542
I'm not hungry, Louis.

801
01:25:32,917 --> 01:25:34,709
I'll just have cheese.

802
01:25:37,917 --> 01:25:39,042
Young as ever.

803
01:25:43,334 --> 01:25:45,167
We've met before.

804
01:25:48,334 --> 01:25:50,376
On Long Island, at the Fairmans'.

805
01:25:53,542 --> 01:25:55,376
How is Dorothy?

806
01:25:58,167 --> 01:26:00,084
I don't really know.

807
01:26:00,459 --> 01:26:02,542
I hear she's happy.

808
01:26:07,126 --> 01:26:09,292
I said something
I shouldn't have?

809
01:26:09,959 --> 01:26:11,417
Not really.

810
01:26:11,584 --> 01:26:12,917
Chinese libertines

811
01:26:13,126 --> 01:26:16,917
are pure hedonists
for whom love is a pleasure

812
01:26:17,209 --> 01:26:19,084
which they seek to refine.

813
01:26:19,459 --> 01:26:20,959
It's something esthetic,

814
01:26:21,251 --> 01:26:23,834
whereas for us it's a concept.
- Brancion!

815
01:26:25,542 --> 01:26:28,167
My friend Alain can't take
his eyes off you.

816
01:26:37,626 --> 01:26:39,709
Let me tell you a story.

817
01:26:40,501 --> 01:26:41,917
A famous one.

818
01:26:43,126 --> 01:26:45,917
One day, at 7:00 in the morning,

819
01:26:46,334 --> 01:26:51,001
a policeman finds, sleeping
the sleep of the dead drunk,

820
01:26:51,834 --> 01:26:54,876
a young man lying on the Tomb
of the Unknown Soldier.

821
01:26:58,626 --> 01:27:00,417
The said young man,

822
01:27:01,167 --> 01:27:03,126
sure he was home in bed,

823
01:27:03,417 --> 01:27:06,209
had laid his watch, wallet

824
01:27:06,417 --> 01:27:09,709
and handkerchief
next to the memorial flame,

825
01:27:10,334 --> 01:27:12,709
as if it were a night table.

826
01:27:15,167 --> 01:27:17,834
Who was the hero of our tale?

827
01:27:19,209 --> 01:27:21,084
Alain Leroy, here present.

828
01:27:43,876 --> 01:27:46,292
Brancion doesn't like drunks.

829
01:27:46,876 --> 01:27:48,959
He has a bad liver.

830
01:27:51,459 --> 01:27:54,292
In New York
I heard you were divorcing.

831
01:27:54,709 --> 01:27:56,459
Mental cruelty?

832
01:27:57,084 --> 01:27:58,584
Who's that?

833
01:28:00,167 --> 01:28:02,334
François Mignac, a model Parisian.

834
01:28:02,501 --> 01:28:05,126
In bed at 3:00 a.m.
Riding from 9:00 to 11:00.

835
01:28:06,167 --> 01:28:10,042
Then off to the stock exchange,
to win or lose a quick million.

836
01:28:11,251 --> 01:28:12,501
Business lunch.

837
01:28:12,709 --> 01:28:15,792
Some time at the office.
A woman.

838
01:28:16,501 --> 01:28:18,042
A few drinks.

839
01:28:18,251 --> 01:28:21,417
Dinner out. A nightclub.
Then he starts over again.

840
01:28:21,626 --> 01:28:24,209
Twenty years,
and he still loves it!

841
01:28:50,584 --> 01:28:52,417
It's nice to see you.

842
01:28:53,251 --> 01:28:54,959
We've missed you.

843
01:28:56,917 --> 01:28:58,417
You're sweet.

844
01:29:06,209 --> 01:29:08,209
Once he gets his divorce.

845
01:29:12,042 --> 01:29:14,167
Good for you. That's true love!

846
01:29:14,584 --> 01:29:15,709
This is all new.

847
01:29:18,042 --> 01:29:20,251
I've never felt this way.

848
01:29:22,167 --> 01:29:24,042
And you know me.

849
01:29:24,542 --> 01:29:26,167
A woman in love.

850
01:29:27,667 --> 01:29:28,834
Do I know him?

851
01:29:29,001 --> 01:29:31,459
No. He never goes out.

852
01:29:32,126 --> 01:29:35,417
But you'll meet him.
He's coming to pick me up.

853
01:29:37,459 --> 01:29:42,417
So that's the fabulous,
legendary, irresistible Alain Leroy.

854
01:29:43,292 --> 01:29:47,667
Harlequin, Watteau, gallant revels.

855
01:29:49,959 --> 01:29:51,334
Don't be mean.

856
01:29:51,917 --> 01:29:54,126
He's not himself tonight.

857
01:29:55,084 --> 01:29:56,834
Say something nice to him.

858
01:29:57,959 --> 01:30:00,251
It would wound him even more.

859
01:30:03,209 --> 01:30:04,876
We could help each other.

860
01:30:05,626 --> 01:30:07,167
Give me a call.

861
01:30:08,251 --> 01:30:09,709
Do you have my number?

862
01:30:12,084 --> 01:30:13,792
Corrupting a minor.

863
01:30:21,542 --> 01:30:23,959
You're husband's crazy.
He gave Alain a drink.

864
01:30:25,376 --> 01:30:28,209
A shame you don't get along
with Brancion.

865
01:30:28,626 --> 01:30:30,834
He's irritating, but he's someone.

866
01:30:31,001 --> 01:30:32,459
Is he?

867
01:30:33,084 --> 01:30:34,917
Go on. Shoot him down!

868
01:30:37,959 --> 01:30:39,959
A man of many parts.

869
01:30:40,792 --> 01:30:42,459
A good sport.

870
01:30:43,126 --> 01:30:45,792
Wears his dentures with confidence.

871
01:30:45,959 --> 01:30:48,001
Has had every woman here tonight.

872
01:30:48,167 --> 01:30:49,834
Except Solange.

873
01:30:53,376 --> 01:30:55,126
A real Martian!

874
01:30:56,751 --> 01:30:58,834
I envy his serenity.

875
01:31:00,959 --> 01:31:02,167
Get off my back!

876
01:31:08,167 --> 01:31:09,834
I'll do as I like!

877
01:31:12,126 --> 01:31:13,417
Cyrille…

878
01:31:16,251 --> 01:31:18,376
Your Piranesis are superb.

879
01:31:18,917 --> 01:31:21,542
The best prints I've ever seen.

880
01:31:23,501 --> 01:31:26,584
I admire what you do.

881
01:31:27,126 --> 01:31:29,542
Because you don't believe in it.

882
01:31:30,834 --> 01:31:33,376
You're wrong.
I damn well do.

883
01:31:36,001 --> 01:31:38,167
I just want to say, sir…

884
01:31:40,334 --> 01:31:43,042
that like you,
I don't find it funny

885
01:31:43,209 --> 01:31:45,209
to sleep on a tomb…

886
01:31:46,834 --> 01:31:49,751
when it's so easy to open it
and sleep inside.

887
01:31:51,376 --> 01:31:52,751
That's all.

888
01:31:55,042 --> 01:31:57,959
Forgive me. I never get drunk,

889
01:31:58,626 --> 01:32:01,167
and I hate stories about drunks.

890
01:32:01,501 --> 01:32:03,709
I'm a poor drunkard.

891
01:32:05,501 --> 01:32:07,376
Liquor is stupid.

892
01:32:08,834 --> 01:32:10,542
We drunks are poor cousins,

893
01:32:11,917 --> 01:32:12,917
and we know it.

894
01:32:21,167 --> 01:32:22,792
Anyway,

895
01:32:23,542 --> 01:32:25,209
we fade away fast.

896
01:32:25,667 --> 01:32:27,542
Alain, you're too far gone.

897
01:32:28,584 --> 01:32:30,959
I'm not gone yet, but I'm going.

898
01:32:31,459 --> 01:32:34,167
I have to go. I'm late.

899
01:32:37,334 --> 01:32:41,959
As it happens, I'm a man.
But I've never had money or women.

900
01:32:42,626 --> 01:32:44,459
Yet I'm very active.

901
01:32:45,876 --> 01:32:47,417
The thing is…

902
01:32:49,042 --> 01:32:51,709
I can't reach out with my hands.

903
01:32:53,292 --> 01:32:56,126
I can't touch things.

904
01:33:01,167 --> 01:33:03,292
And when I do touch things,

905
01:33:04,334 --> 01:33:06,042
I feel nothing.

906
01:33:12,626 --> 01:33:14,709
Come say hello to the Filolies.

907
01:33:30,084 --> 01:33:32,084
I'd like you to meet Frédéric.

908
01:33:33,751 --> 01:33:35,001
And you, sir?

909
01:33:35,667 --> 01:33:37,709
Do you believe in your actions?

910
01:33:41,792 --> 01:33:44,167
I don't like talking about myself.

911
01:33:44,376 --> 01:33:46,459
Then you don't like talking.

912
01:33:47,209 --> 01:33:49,084
I enjoy listening to you.

913
01:33:58,876 --> 01:34:00,542
You believe in Maria?

914
01:34:04,709 --> 01:34:07,376
Congratulations on finding Maria.

915
01:34:08,084 --> 01:34:09,459
You have a woman.

916
01:34:11,334 --> 01:34:13,042
I have nothing.

917
01:34:13,209 --> 01:34:14,376
Come now!

918
01:34:16,167 --> 01:34:18,209
You don't know what it's like,

919
01:34:19,209 --> 01:34:21,542
being unable to touch anything.

920
01:34:27,542 --> 01:34:29,292
I'm incapable of wanting.

921
01:34:31,917 --> 01:34:33,417
I can't even desire.

922
01:34:35,209 --> 01:34:37,209
The women here tonight…

923
01:34:39,126 --> 01:34:40,917
I can't desire them.

924
01:34:41,751 --> 01:34:43,376
They scare me.

925
01:34:45,334 --> 01:34:46,709
Scare me!

926
01:34:47,626 --> 01:34:49,417
Take Solange, for instance.

927
01:34:50,834 --> 01:34:54,001
Five minutes with her
and I'd feel like an insect.

928
01:34:55,584 --> 01:34:57,167
I'd vanish into the woodwork.

929
01:34:57,959 --> 01:35:00,834
What's wrong, Alain?
You're a bit tipsy.

930
01:35:01,084 --> 01:35:03,209
And so sad. What is it now?

931
01:35:10,167 --> 01:35:11,667
You're life itself.

932
01:35:13,292 --> 01:35:14,959
Yes, life.

933
01:35:16,417 --> 01:35:19,376
But I can't touch you.
It's horrible.

934
01:35:20,709 --> 01:35:24,042
You're here in front of me,
but there's no way.

935
01:35:26,042 --> 01:35:27,251
There's no way.

936
01:35:35,501 --> 01:35:37,626
So I'll try with death.

937
01:35:38,792 --> 01:35:41,042
She should be more accommodating.

938
01:35:48,209 --> 01:35:49,959
Life is strange.

939
01:35:51,501 --> 01:35:54,751
You're a beautiful woman.
A good woman.

940
01:35:56,292 --> 01:35:58,292
You love making love.

941
01:36:00,459 --> 01:36:01,876
And yet…

942
01:36:02,959 --> 01:36:05,667
between the two of us
nothing's possible.

943
01:36:16,834 --> 01:36:18,876
To leave without having
touched anything.

944
01:36:19,626 --> 01:36:22,001
Beauty. Goodness.

945
01:36:22,834 --> 01:36:24,709
All their lies.

946
01:36:26,417 --> 01:36:28,709
You can work miracles.

947
01:36:29,626 --> 01:36:30,792
Touch the leper.

948
01:36:31,459 --> 01:36:36,001
It's a matter of timing
between a man and a woman.

949
01:36:39,292 --> 01:36:42,376
And your beauties —
Dorothy, Lydia and the others.

950
01:36:42,584 --> 01:36:44,626
They're lovely.
They adore you.

951
01:36:44,876 --> 01:36:48,001
Not lovely enough.
Not good enough.

952
01:36:48,334 --> 01:36:49,834
They've gone.

953
01:36:50,167 --> 01:36:51,959
They're waiting for you.

954
01:36:56,126 --> 01:37:00,292
They love making love
as much as I do. Things well done.

955
01:37:02,792 --> 01:37:04,251
That's it.

956
01:37:05,001 --> 01:37:06,709
Things well done.

957
01:37:10,792 --> 01:37:12,209
I'm leaving.

958
01:37:14,126 --> 01:37:16,376
Stay with us. Talk to me.

959
01:37:20,542 --> 01:37:22,167
I'll be back.

960
01:37:23,209 --> 01:37:25,376
But I have to go now.

961
01:37:26,584 --> 01:37:29,667
Without a word.
Enough humiliation.

962
01:37:29,834 --> 01:37:31,876
You'll be back?

963
01:37:42,584 --> 01:37:44,834
- Need any money?
- I'm loaded.

964
01:37:45,792 --> 01:37:48,417
Let's lunch tomorrow
and we'll talk.

965
01:37:49,167 --> 01:37:52,167
Good-bye, Alain.
We're very fond of you.

966
01:37:53,042 --> 01:37:54,959
Good-bye, Solange, Cyrille.

967
01:37:55,209 --> 01:37:58,167
Don't forget: lunch tomorrow.

968
01:38:34,792 --> 01:38:37,042
Cyrille has a hold on Solange.

969
01:38:37,751 --> 01:38:40,501
He's a good lover
and he's worth millions.

970
01:38:41,459 --> 01:38:44,084
Brancion hasn't much of a chance.

971
01:38:49,667 --> 01:38:52,376
When I was 18
and fairly good-looking,

972
01:38:52,667 --> 01:38:54,459
my first mistress cheated on me.

973
01:38:54,626 --> 01:38:57,167
Eighteen is an age
for being two-timed.

974
01:38:57,334 --> 01:39:00,459
At 18 or at 30.
They're always nice,

975
01:39:00,834 --> 01:39:03,626
but they all leave
or they let me go.

976
01:39:03,959 --> 01:39:07,542
You really surprise me.
Call it what you like,

977
01:39:07,751 --> 01:39:09,417
but you attract them.

978
01:39:10,959 --> 01:39:13,709
I'm awkward, inept.

979
01:39:15,251 --> 01:39:17,709
The sensitivity was in my heart,

980
01:39:17,917 --> 01:39:19,417
not my hands.

981
01:39:25,376 --> 01:39:28,376
When you care about people,
Milou, they're nice.

982
01:39:29,376 --> 01:39:31,001
They give you everything.

983
01:39:33,417 --> 01:39:34,876
Love.

984
01:39:36,042 --> 01:39:37,501
Money.

985
01:39:40,751 --> 01:39:43,626
You must make people feel
you want them

986
01:39:44,417 --> 01:39:46,751
and that you'll hold on to them.

987
01:39:54,542 --> 01:39:57,584
You're sensitive, Milou,
but you don't want them.

988
01:39:58,667 --> 01:40:00,501
I don't love them.

989
01:40:01,042 --> 01:40:03,001
I never could love them.

990
01:40:06,251 --> 01:40:08,751
I can't touch. I can't take.

991
01:40:09,667 --> 01:40:11,626
It has to come from the heart.

992
01:40:12,876 --> 01:40:14,376
What is it you wanted?

993
01:40:16,709 --> 01:40:19,084
I'd have liked to captivate people,

994
01:40:19,792 --> 01:40:21,376
hold on to them,

995
01:40:22,251 --> 01:40:23,876
bind them close.

996
01:40:24,959 --> 01:40:27,501
So that things would stay still
around me.

997
01:40:28,542 --> 01:40:30,626
But it always went to hell.

998
01:40:31,084 --> 01:40:33,834
You really love people that much?

999
01:40:36,167 --> 01:40:38,376
I wanted so much to be loved…

1000
01:40:39,792 --> 01:40:41,584
that I feel love.

1001
01:42:57,542 --> 01:42:58,792
Want some breakfast?

1002
01:43:00,417 --> 01:43:01,792
No, thanks.

1003
01:43:16,834 --> 01:43:19,251
I'm not to be disturbed before noon.

1004
01:45:11,959 --> 01:45:13,417
<i>Is that you, Alain?</i>

1005
01:45:14,459 --> 01:45:16,376
<i>Did I wake you?</i>

1006
01:45:17,084 --> 01:45:18,084
Solange.

1007
01:45:18,251 --> 01:45:21,501
<i>Dearest Alain, I'm calling
to remind you about lunch.</i>

1008
01:45:21,667 --> 01:45:25,251
<i>We're expecting you without fail.
Don't be late.</i>

1009
01:45:25,751 --> 01:45:27,501
<i>We'll have a nice chat.</i>

1010
01:45:29,167 --> 01:45:30,751
<i>How are you today?</i>

1011
01:45:30,917 --> 01:45:31,917
Not bad.

1012
01:45:32,042 --> 01:45:35,959
<i>With that tone of voice?
We can count on you?</i>

1013
01:45:36,126 --> 01:45:37,792
Sure you can.

1014
01:45:39,876 --> 01:45:41,584
That's sweet of you.

1015
01:45:41,876 --> 01:45:43,542
<i>I care for you.</i>

1016
01:45:44,417 --> 01:45:46,042
You care for me.

1017
01:45:46,917 --> 01:45:48,292
And Brancion?

1018
01:45:48,459 --> 01:45:51,251
<i>Brancion is your opposite.</i>

1019
01:45:53,542 --> 01:45:55,417
<i>He's a force of nature.</i>

1020
01:45:56,667 --> 01:45:59,209
And you like forces of nature?

1021
01:46:00,042 --> 01:46:02,417
<i>I like all sorts of people.</i>

1022
01:46:04,167 --> 01:46:06,667
I'm not a force of nature.

1023
01:46:06,834 --> 01:46:08,542
<i>You have heart.</i>

1024
01:46:10,334 --> 01:46:12,584
I don't understand any of this.

1025
01:46:14,042 --> 01:46:15,501
Good-bye, Solange.

1026
01:46:20,459 --> 01:46:22,876
Solange answers for Dorothy.

1027
01:47:43,084 --> 01:47:44,709
<i>I'm killing myself</i>

1028
01:47:44,876 --> 01:47:47,167
<i>because you didn't love me,</i>

1029
01:47:47,334 --> 01:47:49,501
<i>because I didn't love you.</i>

1030
01:47:49,667 --> 01:47:51,917
<i>Because our ties were loose,</i>

1031
01:47:52,084 --> 01:47:54,501
<i>I'm killing myself to tighten them.</i>

1032
01:47:54,667 --> 01:47:56,001
<i>I leave you</i>

1033
01:47:56,167 --> 01:47:58,251
<i>with an indelible stain.</i>

1034
01:47:58,792 --> 01:48:00,001
