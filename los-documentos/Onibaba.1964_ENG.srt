deep and dark

00:00:42,543 --> 00:00:48,423

Ushi, are you there?

17
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:19,679
Get something?

18
00:11:58,676 --> 00:12:00,553
Nothing butjunk.

19
00:12:00,678 --> 00:12:03,139
Is this the best you can do?

20
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:08,436
Kyoto's been burned to the ground.

21
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:11,606
They say the emperor has escaped
to mount yoshino.

22
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:16,319
So no more big battles.
Just skirmishes now.

23
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:22,992
I can't do any business.

24
00:12:26,496 --> 00:12:28,498
This is good millet.

25
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:38,049
- Give us one more bag.
- Take it or leave it.

26
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:12,750
Hey! You want one more?

27
00:13:19,674 --> 00:13:21,467
Sleep with me, then!

28
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:25,221
I'd never sleep with you,
you bastard!

29
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:49,138
Hachh what are you doing here?

30
00:14:57,397 --> 00:15:00,066
I'm so hungry.
Give me some food.

31
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,777
Get him a bowl.

32
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:15,456
It's a wonder you made it back.

33
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:31,597
Where's my husband?

34
00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:33,808
Just wait a moment.

35
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:44,735
You came back alone?

36
00:15:44,861 --> 00:15:46,737
I escaped.

37
00:15:48,281 --> 00:15:50,366
So where's my son?

38
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:07,133
It was the ashikaga army
that forced us to go with them.

39
00:16:10,845 --> 00:16:12,722
We fought in two of their battles.

40
00:16:12,847 --> 00:16:16,893
In the third, we got caught
by the kusunoki army.

41
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,440
My son too?

42
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:29,405
Yes, both of us.
So then we became kusunoki men.

43
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:31,616
It was all the same to us.

44
00:16:31,741 --> 00:16:35,578
It's the generals' war, not ours.

45
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:39,081
We didn't even know
what they were fighting about.

46
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:44,003
There are two emperors now.

47
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:47,340
Kusunoki fights for the emperor
at mount yoshino,

48
00:16:47,465 --> 00:16:50,551
and ashikaga for the emperor
in Kyoto.

49
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:54,096
That means the two emperors
are quarrelling.

50
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:02,313
At first, we wanted to be heroes,

51
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:05,983
but killing's not easy.

52
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:08,528
I could've been killed myself.

53
00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:13,241
Once I stabbed a man
in the back with a spear.

54
00:17:13,366 --> 00:17:17,537
He was taking a shit in the bushes,
and I killed him!

55
00:17:20,957 --> 00:17:22,792
What happened to my son?

56
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:27,421
It was three days ago.

57
00:17:27,547 --> 00:17:32,009
The kusunoki army got routed
at minatogawa.

58
00:17:33,094 --> 00:17:37,181
Ashikaga's men completely
wiped them out.

59
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:40,351
It was a hellish battle.

60
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:45,314
We couldn't tell friend from foe.
It lasted two days and two nights.

61
00:17:50,111 --> 00:17:55,032
We tried to keep away
from anywhere dangerous.

62
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:58,452
The general ordered us to advance,

63
00:17:58,578 --> 00:18:04,417
but we ran around till
they chased us into a paddy field.

64
00:18:04,542 --> 00:18:11,007
There was nothing to do
but play dead in the mud.

65
00:18:11,132 --> 00:18:13,718
We fooled them.

66
00:18:13,843 --> 00:18:17,471
We waited for our chance
and then ran for the mountains.

67
00:18:17,597 --> 00:18:22,935
We hid in the bushes all night.
I thought we'd starve.

68
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:25,563
So we went hunting for food.

69
00:18:25,688 --> 00:18:29,066
We thought we'd steal
from farmhouses,

70
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:31,360
but they were all empty.

71
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:33,529
There was nothing to eat.

72
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:38,909
Soon, farmers with sticks
came from out from nowhere

73
00:18:39,035 --> 00:18:42,288
and beat the hell out of us.

74
00:18:42,413 --> 00:18:44,957
They beat kichi to death.

75
00:18:45,082 --> 00:18:47,168
I barely escaped with my life!

76
00:19:03,017 --> 00:19:05,061
My son was killed?

77
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:20,451
And then? What happened
to the samurai who took you two?

78
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:25,373
Well, he was killed right afterwards.
An arrow right through his throat.

79
00:19:25,498 --> 00:19:28,084
He flailed around
and then keeled over.

80
00:19:28,209 --> 00:19:31,462
- Right here.
- Serves him right!

81
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:34,173
He had it coming!

82
00:19:38,344 --> 00:19:44,350
They took my son so suddenly
that we had a hard time surviving.

83
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:51,232
I was looking forward
to the day of his return.

84
00:19:52,817 --> 00:19:54,777
But only you made it back.

85
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:59,031
It's a wonder you're both still alive.

86
00:20:01,784 --> 00:20:03,619
How do you eat?

87
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:07,790
There was frost last summer.

88
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:10,751
Hail fell.

89
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:13,504
Frost and hail in summer!

90
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:15,715
All our crops failed.

91
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:19,510
Strange things going on
in Kyoto too.

92
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:21,846
A horse gave birth to a calf.

93
00:20:21,971 --> 00:20:25,641
The sun Rose black in the sky,
and the day was dark as night.

94
00:20:27,101 --> 00:20:29,061
How terrifying!

95
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:33,357
As if the earth had been
turned upside down!

96
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:36,819
All the farmers are starving.

97
00:20:36,944 --> 00:20:39,405
With all the fighting,
they can't work,

98
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:42,992
and the fields run wild
without men to till them.

99
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:51,459
How do you eat?

100
00:20:52,835 --> 00:20:54,754
Never you mind!

101
00:20:54,879 --> 00:20:57,047
We're beggars.

102
00:20:59,467 --> 00:21:03,137
Kyoto's been burnt to the ground.
Not even a dog around.

103
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:06,056
Everything becomes food,

104
00:21:06,182 --> 00:21:09,393
people are eating snakes,
even earthworms and mice.

105
00:21:11,395 --> 00:21:15,191
You're wearing nice things.
Did you steal them?

106
00:21:15,316 --> 00:21:17,735
You're dressed oddly yourself.

107
00:21:18,861 --> 00:21:24,074
I killed a priest on the way back
and put on his clothes.

108
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:28,662
People trust priests.
It makes it easier to get around.

109
00:21:29,455 --> 00:21:33,626
- What'll you do now?
- Is my hut still standing?

110
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:38,172
- I suppose so.
- I see.

111
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:42,009
I'm going to get some sleep.

112
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:44,136
I'm exhausted.

113
00:21:55,397 --> 00:21:57,983
Sorry I came back alone.

114
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:12,957
What is it?

115
00:22:16,252 --> 00:22:18,045
It's upsetting!

116
00:24:07,154 --> 00:24:09,740
What a fine day.

117
00:24:14,244 --> 00:24:17,790
Makes war seem so far away.

118
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:21,752
That's a big fish you caught.

119
00:24:23,963 --> 00:24:26,048
I have nothing to eat.

120
00:24:26,173 --> 00:24:28,175
What do you do for food?

121
00:24:31,553 --> 00:24:34,139
You don't seem to grow anything.

122
00:24:34,264 --> 00:24:35,975
What do you do?

123
00:24:44,358 --> 00:24:45,985
Do you steal?

124
00:24:48,529 --> 00:24:51,073
I see. 50 that's it?

125
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:55,285
Everyone does
where there's fighting going on.

126
00:24:55,411 --> 00:24:57,371
They all steal in Kyoto.

127
00:24:58,747 --> 00:25:01,959
You steal too? Right?

128
00:25:05,379 --> 00:25:07,631
Why didn't you save my husband?

129
00:25:07,756 --> 00:25:10,884
I had no time to save him!

130
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:14,596
We were attacked
by about twenty farmers.

131
00:25:14,722 --> 00:25:17,307
I barely got away myself.

132
00:25:21,478 --> 00:25:25,232
You've been waiting for him?
Poor girl.

133
00:25:31,071 --> 00:25:35,200
What are you going to do?
He's dead.

134
00:25:35,325 --> 00:25:38,037
No use staying
with that old woman, is there?

135
00:25:38,954 --> 00:25:40,706
Mind your tongue!

136
00:25:41,665 --> 00:25:43,959
You're still young.

137
00:25:48,881 --> 00:25:52,176
How about coming over to see me?

138
00:26:14,531 --> 00:26:16,492
Lovely day!

139
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:22,372
Hachi, what are you doing here?

140
00:26:22,498 --> 00:26:25,918
Catching fish. Got to eat.

141
00:26:29,254 --> 00:26:31,090
You have it.

142
00:26:36,887 --> 00:26:39,556
Better to take what's offered.

143
00:26:46,563 --> 00:26:48,482
It looks good!

144
00:26:50,317 --> 00:26:52,319
What did hachi have to say?

145
00:26:53,362 --> 00:26:54,905
Nothing at all.

146
00:26:56,198 --> 00:27:00,452
That bastard! Not even sorry
he came back alone.

147
00:27:00,577 --> 00:27:04,248
He might've killed my son himself.
No different than an enemy.

148
00:27:04,373 --> 00:27:06,667
Don't be too friendly with him.

149
00:28:13,775 --> 00:28:15,527
Help me!

150
00:28:26,997 --> 00:28:28,540
Help!

151
00:28:29,833 --> 00:28:32,294
Help me!

152
00:28:38,091 --> 00:28:40,302
Get the one floating away!

153
00:28:56,652 --> 00:28:58,487
He's still alive!

154
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:10,290
We can eat now!

155
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:12,834
This is expensive stuff.

156
00:29:56,169 --> 00:29:58,171
How about it?

157
00:29:58,297 --> 00:30:00,424
Good stuff, eh?

158
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:34,249
Is that all?

159
00:30:34,374 --> 00:30:37,127
The farmers are all hiding
in the mountains.

160
00:30:37,252 --> 00:30:41,381
It was hard enough
finding this much.

161
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:43,342
It's risky work.

162
00:30:44,634 --> 00:30:46,261
Bring me sake.

163
00:31:10,911 --> 00:31:13,288
You've been lucky.

164
00:31:13,413 --> 00:31:16,208
It's a wonder you made it back.

165
00:31:16,333 --> 00:31:19,628
It's a good business you have here.

166
00:31:21,797 --> 00:31:27,177
Only while the war lasts.
I don't know how much longer it'll last.

167
00:31:27,928 --> 00:31:30,347
They won't stop fighting
for a long time yet.

168
00:31:30,472 --> 00:31:32,849
Not until one side's beaten.

169
00:31:32,974 --> 00:31:36,103
They'll carry on
even if it ruins the country.

170
00:31:36,228 --> 00:31:39,022
It's a business with them.

171
00:31:39,147 --> 00:31:41,400
I'll take these birds too.

172
00:31:41,525 --> 00:31:43,819
Bring me some good stuff.

173
00:32:17,102 --> 00:32:21,148
Ushi's got himself
a good business going there.

174
00:32:22,482 --> 00:32:25,819
Armies will snap up
swords, halberds and armour.

175
00:32:27,112 --> 00:32:29,531
There's not enough to go around.

176
00:32:29,656 --> 00:32:32,200
There's nothing for common soldiers,

177
00:32:32,325 --> 00:32:34,744
so they use wooden
or bamboo Spears.

178
00:32:36,997 --> 00:32:39,708
That's a good business, all right.

179
00:32:44,129 --> 00:32:48,383
I heard you two do good work.

180
00:32:48,508 --> 00:32:51,094
How many have you killed?

181
00:32:51,219 --> 00:32:53,013
That's our business!

182
00:32:53,847 --> 00:32:56,475
You stay out of it!

183
00:32:58,518 --> 00:33:01,062
Don't you think
we should join forces?

184
00:33:02,522 --> 00:33:04,483
I've been trained in war.

185
00:33:06,318 --> 00:33:08,320
I could come in handy.

186
00:33:13,116 --> 00:33:16,912
That's our business.
We can manage on our own.

187
00:33:17,037 --> 00:33:19,956
You hate me for returning alone?

188
00:33:20,081 --> 00:33:22,751
I don't care what you do.
You're on your own.

189
00:33:24,711 --> 00:33:27,214
How about making me her husband?

190
00:33:27,339 --> 00:33:30,175
Idiot! Don't be so stupid!

191
00:33:41,102 --> 00:33:43,396
We're turning in.

192
00:33:43,522 --> 00:33:45,232
Go on home.

193
00:34:17,305 --> 00:34:19,057
That good-for-nothing!

194
00:34:19,182 --> 00:34:21,059
He's after you.

195
00:34:27,691 --> 00:34:31,778
You see his eyes?
Like a dog after a bitch.

196
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:34,281
He's sniffing after you.

197
00:34:35,198 --> 00:34:37,867
You just stay away from him!

198
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:40,824
That bastard's in heat!

199
00:37:12,897 --> 00:37:14,899
I want a woman.

200
00:38:21,341 --> 00:38:23,259
Come to mine.

201
00:38:29,641 --> 00:38:31,309
I'll be waiting tonight.

202
00:39:07,095 --> 00:39:09,639
Hachi's got his eyes on you.

203
00:39:11,516 --> 00:39:13,226
Don't let him catch you.

204
00:41:59,017 --> 00:42:00,560
Who's there?

205
00:42:14,741 --> 00:42:16,159
Who's there?

206
00:42:18,745 --> 00:42:20,705
So it's you.

207
00:42:23,499 --> 00:42:25,334
So you came.

208
00:45:25,556 --> 00:45:27,016
Hachh

209
00:45:32,647 --> 00:45:34,065
Hurry!

210
00:45:51,123 --> 00:45:54,794
I get scared
running through the reeds.

211
00:45:54,919 --> 00:45:57,129
Don't be silly.

212
00:45:57,255 --> 00:46:00,716
What are you saying?
You kill people for a living.

213
00:49:36,807 --> 00:49:39,810
Lazy bastard, enjoying his nap!

214
00:49:48,819 --> 00:49:51,363
Oh, it's just you.

215
00:49:54,074 --> 00:49:55,993
You like to sleep?

216
00:49:59,121 --> 00:50:02,166
Yes, it's nice to have a little nap.

217
00:50:02,291 --> 00:50:03,876
It's too hot.

218
00:50:04,877 --> 00:50:07,129
Best to sleep in the daytime.

219
00:50:08,923 --> 00:50:10,508
Want to sleep with me?

220
00:50:15,095 --> 00:50:17,681
An old woman like you?

221
00:50:17,806 --> 00:50:19,642
You fool!

222
00:50:25,231 --> 00:50:27,316
I'm not old on the inside.

223
00:50:29,151 --> 00:50:30,861
Come on.

224
00:50:32,238 --> 00:50:34,073
Try me.

225
00:50:36,784 --> 00:50:39,411
I'm going for a swim.

226
00:50:40,287 --> 00:50:41,872
Hachi, wait!

227
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,919
What is it?

228
00:50:47,044 --> 00:50:49,004
Something good?

229
00:50:49,129 --> 00:50:51,757
Don't act so innocent!

230
00:50:51,882 --> 00:50:54,969
What are you doing
with my daughter-in-law every night?

231
00:50:55,094 --> 00:50:56,762
What do you mean?

232
00:50:57,846 --> 00:51:01,725
I'll slap you. I saw you both!

233
00:51:03,519 --> 00:51:05,396
What do you plan to do with her?

234
00:51:05,521 --> 00:51:07,565
She's the one who comes to my place.

235
00:51:07,690 --> 00:51:10,693
- You asked her to!
- What's wrong with that?

236
00:51:12,778 --> 00:51:15,948
I'm a red-blooded man.
I can't stand it.

237
00:51:16,073 --> 00:51:17,950
She's another man's wife.

238
00:51:18,075 --> 00:51:19,868
Your son's dead.

239
00:51:20,786 --> 00:51:24,999
You worthless bastard,
coming back here alone!

240
00:51:25,124 --> 00:51:28,210
You'd take your friend's wife?

241
00:51:28,335 --> 00:51:30,129
She's not your daughter-in-law
anymore.

242
00:51:30,254 --> 00:51:33,007
Your son's dead. She needs a man.

243
00:51:33,132 --> 00:51:37,136
And no wonder, she's still young.

244
00:51:37,261 --> 00:51:38,721
It's only natural.

245
00:51:39,471 --> 00:51:42,057
Not if you leave! Go away!

246
00:51:44,310 --> 00:51:48,272
If! Left,
they'd take me back to the war.

247
00:51:48,397 --> 00:51:50,482
I'll stay here.

248
00:51:50,608 --> 00:51:52,610
Then leave her alone!

249
00:51:53,736 --> 00:51:55,654
I'll make you an offer.

250
00:51:57,114 --> 00:51:59,283
Let her be my bride.

251
00:51:59,742 --> 00:52:03,037
You've got a nerve!

252
00:52:03,162 --> 00:52:05,289
My poor son must be
turning in his grave!

253
00:52:05,414 --> 00:52:08,500
You can't ask a young man
and woman who are neighbours

254
00:52:08,626 --> 00:52:11,295
not to be friends.

255
00:52:12,212 --> 00:52:17,009
Hachi, if my son's dead,
she's all I've got!

256
00:52:17,134 --> 00:52:21,180
I can't get along alone.
I couldn't even kill!

257
00:52:21,305 --> 00:52:23,557
Take her and I'll starve!

258
00:52:23,682 --> 00:52:26,977
Don't worry, I won't.
We'll just be friends.

259
00:52:27,102 --> 00:52:29,980
She'll end up deserting me.

260
00:52:30,105 --> 00:52:31,899
I'll tell her not to.

261
00:52:32,024 --> 00:52:34,318
Hachi, I'm begging you!

262
00:52:34,443 --> 00:52:37,988
I can't kill without her!

263
00:52:38,113 --> 00:52:40,366
You ask too much.

264
00:52:40,491 --> 00:52:44,536
Your son's gone.
It's selfish to hold on to her!

265
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:49,917
When the war ends,
I can farm and manage on my own.

266
00:52:50,042 --> 00:52:51,835
Just till then.

267
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:54,713
There's no telling
when the war will end.

268
00:52:54,838 --> 00:52:59,093
If all you want is a woman, I'll do.

269
00:52:59,218 --> 00:53:02,096
How about me?

270
00:53:02,221 --> 00:53:05,766
I'm not interested.

271
00:53:05,891 --> 00:53:10,354
So you intend to take her?

272
00:53:10,479 --> 00:53:14,316
Don't you understand yet?
I won't take her! We'll just be friends!

273
00:53:14,441 --> 00:53:17,486
You say that now,
but she'll end up leaving me!

274
00:53:17,611 --> 00:53:19,780
That's not my problem.

275
00:53:19,905 --> 00:53:25,369
- Remember those words, you bastard!
- What are you going to do?

276
00:53:25,494 --> 00:53:30,165
I'll spear the two of you
in your sleep.

277
00:53:30,290 --> 00:53:32,543
Then she'll be dead too.

278
00:53:46,306 --> 00:53:47,933
Old hag!

279
00:54:20,841 --> 00:54:22,509
Where are you going?

280
00:54:24,094 --> 00:54:26,138
I can't sleep.

281
00:54:26,263 --> 00:54:28,766
I thought I'd get some fresh air.

282
00:54:30,559 --> 00:54:33,854
Yes, it's hard to sleep tonight.

283
00:54:46,909 --> 00:54:49,244
There's no breeze at all.

284
00:54:57,544 --> 00:54:59,671
I dreamt that kichi came back.

285
00:55:02,674 --> 00:55:05,511
My son may return.

286
00:55:05,636 --> 00:55:09,431
Hachi saw him die.
He won't be coming back.

287
00:55:09,556 --> 00:55:13,435
Hachi's a bad man.
He might've been lying.

288
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:15,229
He wouldn't lie.

289
00:55:15,354 --> 00:55:18,273
If kichi were alive,
he'd have come back.

290
00:55:18,398 --> 00:55:20,651
There'd be no point lying about it.

291
00:55:24,196 --> 00:55:27,199
Aren't you sad my son is dead?

292
00:55:28,492 --> 00:55:31,286
I am, but he's not coming back.

293
00:55:33,121 --> 00:55:37,084
I'll find you a good husband.

294
00:55:37,209 --> 00:55:39,336
Just be patient.

295
00:55:44,007 --> 00:55:47,511
When the war ends,
the men will come back.

296
00:55:48,595 --> 00:55:53,183
We'll find you a good husband
and farm again like we used to.

297
00:55:56,395 --> 00:55:57,855
Fighting!

298
00:56:09,533 --> 00:56:13,328
There'll be more prey
coming our way.

299
00:56:52,743 --> 00:56:54,745
I'll lend you a hand.

300
00:58:57,325 --> 00:58:59,745
Is that a wild dog?

301
00:59:02,581 --> 00:59:06,043
Not much spirit for a wild dog.

302
00:59:08,545 --> 00:59:10,714
It's after a mate.

303
00:59:18,096 --> 00:59:20,015
Damned pest!

304
00:59:20,140 --> 00:59:22,642
We'll skin you and eat you!

305
00:59:51,213 --> 00:59:54,382
It's a terrible thing.

306
01:00:00,472 --> 01:00:02,641
Once, in Kyoto...

307
01:00:05,435 --> 01:00:09,981
I heard a great priest talk.

308
01:00:12,025 --> 01:00:15,112
"Those who sin in this world

309
01:00:15,237 --> 01:00:18,240
"go to purgatory when they die."

310
01:00:18,365 --> 01:00:22,244
What's purgatory?
The dead are just ashes.

311
01:00:23,078 --> 01:00:26,081
No, that's not true.

312
01:00:26,998 --> 01:00:29,918
They say hell really exists.

313
01:00:32,003 --> 01:00:36,174
A hell of fire, a hell of fury,
a hell for sinners.

314
01:00:37,467 --> 01:00:41,012
The terrible mountain of needles,
the lake of blood.

315
01:00:43,348 --> 01:00:48,103
The punishment for sinful lust
is the worst of all.

316
01:00:49,938 --> 01:00:55,527
Souls with human faces
grow four legs

317
01:00:55,652 --> 01:00:58,613
and fall into a sinners' hell.

318
01:00:58,738 --> 01:01:03,702
There, they're tortured
day and night with red-hot irons.

319
01:01:03,827 --> 01:01:06,496
That's a lie! There is no hell!

320
01:01:07,831 --> 01:01:14,171
Hell must exist.
A great priest said so.

321
01:01:14,296 --> 01:01:18,091
It's no sin what men and women do.
Everyone does it!

322
01:01:19,176 --> 01:01:22,429
If it's man and wife, it's all right.

323
01:01:22,554 --> 01:01:28,101
With couples...
It's quite all right.

324
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:36,484
It's a terrible thing.

325
01:01:38,153 --> 01:01:42,032
Merciful Buddha...

326
01:01:50,582 --> 01:01:53,043
Now, let's go to bed.

327
01:04:54,599 --> 01:04:56,226
Don't be afraid.

328
01:04:57,769 --> 01:05:01,106
I'm a human being, not a demon.

329
01:05:01,231 --> 01:05:04,192
I have my reasons
for wearing a mask.

330
01:05:04,317 --> 01:05:08,488
I'm a samurai from a good family.

331
01:05:12,575 --> 01:05:16,079
As you can see,
I've escaped from the battle.

332
01:05:17,539 --> 01:05:21,334
I got separated from my men.

333
01:05:22,836 --> 01:05:24,963
I hope to return to Kyoto,

334
01:05:25,088 --> 01:05:28,258
but I'm lost in this field of grass.

335
01:05:29,300 --> 01:05:32,011
Show me the road to Kyoto.

336
01:05:33,596 --> 01:05:35,682
Go due north.

337
01:05:35,807 --> 01:05:38,601
That will take you straight there.

338
01:05:39,602 --> 01:05:43,231
Show me the way out of this grass.

339
01:05:43,940 --> 01:05:46,025
After I show you the way,

340
01:05:47,360 --> 01:05:49,237
you'll kill me.

341
01:05:51,114 --> 01:05:55,118
What good is there
in killing the likes of you?

342
01:05:56,077 --> 01:05:57,996
Find the way yourself!

343
01:06:01,374 --> 01:06:03,126
Old woman!

344
01:06:07,547 --> 01:06:09,382
Do you refuse?

345
01:06:10,717 --> 01:06:14,053
All right. I'll take you.

346
01:06:22,187 --> 01:06:25,398
I've missed you so.

347
01:06:25,523 --> 01:06:28,818
That old woman,
trying to come between us!

348
01:06:31,696 --> 01:06:35,492
If we sin,
do we go to purgatory?

349
01:06:37,285 --> 01:06:39,370
Sin?

350
01:06:39,496 --> 01:06:43,082
People have been doing this
for thousands of years.

351
01:06:43,208 --> 01:06:45,627
But I'm willing
to go to hell for you!

352
01:07:21,621 --> 01:07:24,082
It's a vast field of grass.

353
01:07:24,207 --> 01:07:27,669
There's no telling
what demons and snakes live here.

354
01:07:27,794 --> 01:07:31,464
And monsters like you stray in.

355
01:07:32,549 --> 01:07:35,385
That's right. I'm a demon.

356
01:07:38,805 --> 01:07:42,225
Why do you wear a mask?

357
01:07:43,309 --> 01:07:46,271
It makes me look fierce.

358
01:07:47,730 --> 01:07:50,733
You were defeated,
and now you're running from the war.

359
01:07:51,776 --> 01:07:55,321
There's no use looking fierce now.

360
01:07:56,281 --> 01:07:58,116
You're right.

361
01:07:58,950 --> 01:08:04,038
Many of my men were killed,
and many others left me.

362
01:08:05,248 --> 01:08:07,375
I was left all alone.

363
01:08:12,755 --> 01:08:14,966
I was left all alone.

364
01:08:19,470 --> 01:08:22,015
It's your punishment
for starting the war!

365
01:08:32,609 --> 01:08:34,068
Old woman.

366
01:08:39,741 --> 01:08:43,911
Would you like to know
why I wear a mask?

367
01:08:47,749 --> 01:08:52,253
I feared marring my face.

368
01:08:52,378 --> 01:08:54,464
My face is beautiful.

369
01:08:54,589 --> 01:08:57,800
The most handsome face in Kyoto.

370
01:08:58,760 --> 01:09:02,347
To protect it in the war,

371
01:09:02,472 --> 01:09:07,894
I wore this mask
into the thick of battle.

372
01:09:09,729 --> 01:09:12,440
As a reward
for showing you the road,

373
01:09:12,565 --> 01:09:15,902
show me your beautiful face.

374
01:09:20,073 --> 01:09:25,203
You'd feel faint
if you saw my beautiful face.

375
01:09:28,164 --> 01:09:32,502
I've never seen
anything really beautiful

376
01:09:32,627 --> 01:09:36,714
since the day I was born.

377
01:09:38,341 --> 01:09:40,385
Show me your face.

378
01:09:41,386 --> 01:09:45,014
You wish to see it so badly?

379
01:09:45,139 --> 01:09:46,974
Show me.

380
01:09:48,393 --> 01:09:52,271
You want to see a face
you could fall in love with?

381
01:09:52,397 --> 01:09:57,610
I've never seen anyone
so handsome

382
01:09:57,735 --> 01:10:00,238
that it would take my breath away.

383
01:10:07,870 --> 01:10:10,248
Walk on, old woman!

384
01:10:12,375 --> 01:10:15,378
This is not a face
to show peasants.

385
01:10:20,299 --> 01:10:24,345
Walk faster or I'll cut you down!

386
01:10:30,977 --> 01:10:34,897
Did you cause many soldiers to die?

387
01:10:36,399 --> 01:10:38,317
What a cruel thing.

388
01:10:40,069 --> 01:10:42,447
The dead died in vain.

389
01:10:53,207 --> 01:10:58,546
The dead can never
come back to life.

390
01:10:58,671 --> 01:11:00,965
Be silent and walk!

391
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:23,446
Serves you right!

392
01:11:23,571 --> 01:11:26,449
Men like you killed my son!

393
01:15:00,621 --> 01:15:03,290
Now let's see
just how beautiful you are.

394
01:15:48,711 --> 01:15:51,589
So this is the most handsome face?

395
01:15:55,926 --> 01:15:58,971
This is a samurai general's face?

396
01:16:10,649 --> 01:16:13,444
Rest in peace in this hole.

397
01:16:14,278 --> 01:16:16,363
You have friends here.

398
01:16:18,532 --> 01:16:20,951
You made others die.

399
01:16:22,745 --> 01:16:25,748
Now it's your turn.

400
01:17:41,031 --> 01:17:43,868
- Isn't it heavy?
- No, not very.

401
01:17:43,993 --> 01:17:45,870
Shall I go along too?

402
01:17:45,995 --> 01:17:48,706
No, I'll go by myself.

403
01:17:48,831 --> 01:17:51,876
But it'll be night when you return.

404
01:17:52,835 --> 01:17:57,006
If it's dark,
it can't grow darker.

405
01:17:57,965 --> 01:18:01,177
I'll be late.
Eat early and go to bed.

406
01:18:17,109 --> 01:18:18,986
Be careful.

407
01:20:28,699 --> 01:20:30,826
What's the matter?

408
01:20:31,827 --> 01:20:35,205
You'll catch cold
going to sleep there.

409
01:20:36,999 --> 01:20:40,252
What is it? Are you sick?

410
01:20:40,377 --> 01:20:42,463
Your face is pale.

411
01:20:46,300 --> 01:20:48,010
Is anything wrong?

412
01:20:49,845 --> 01:20:52,556
No, it's nothing.

413
01:21:02,941 --> 01:21:05,527
Why's she so late?

414
01:21:58,497 --> 01:22:00,499
Are there really demons?

415
01:22:01,708 --> 01:22:06,422
Well, in hell, I guess.

416
01:22:06,547 --> 01:22:09,216
They exist in this world too.

417
01:22:10,134 --> 01:22:12,261
Did you see one?

418
01:22:14,012 --> 01:22:16,140
No, I didn't.

419
01:22:17,724 --> 01:22:21,937
We've done nothing wrong.
No demon can come after us.

420
01:22:23,480 --> 01:22:27,568
They might come after someone
who's bad, though.

421
01:23:15,574 --> 01:23:18,368
Shall we eat?

422
01:23:45,687 --> 01:23:48,565
Shall I go to ushi's place?

423
01:23:53,028 --> 01:23:55,739
It's too hot in the daytime.

424
01:23:55,864 --> 01:23:58,200
Night's the best time to go out.

425
01:24:00,619 --> 01:24:03,205
Ushi's a sly one.

426
01:24:04,414 --> 01:24:07,543
If I take too many at once,
he knocks down the price.

427
01:24:07,668 --> 01:24:11,380
Better to take a few at a time.

428
01:24:14,633 --> 01:24:19,012
We'll make more that way.

429
01:24:23,392 --> 01:24:26,103
Well, I'll be back shortly.

430
01:24:27,729 --> 01:24:29,565
Be careful.

431
01:27:40,255 --> 01:27:41,965
What's the matter?

432
01:27:44,676 --> 01:27:46,386
Did you have a dream?

433
01:27:51,016 --> 01:27:52,517
What kind of dream?

434
01:28:00,776 --> 01:28:04,529
You woke me up.

435
01:28:49,366 --> 01:28:51,117
Hey.

436
01:28:52,869 --> 01:28:56,122
You stood me up.
What's going on?

437
01:28:59,626 --> 01:29:01,628
You tired of me?

438
01:30:36,181 --> 01:30:38,642
It's raining, you shouldn't go.

439
01:30:39,601 --> 01:30:42,604
I can't let ushi get the better of me.

440
01:30:43,647 --> 01:30:47,400
Last night, he said
he didn't have the millet on hand

441
01:30:47,525 --> 01:30:51,738
and that I should pick it up tonight.

442
01:30:52,656 --> 01:30:56,284
It's just a shower. It'll soon stop.

443
01:30:57,285 --> 01:30:59,454
It'll become nice and cool.

444
01:31:01,331 --> 01:31:03,833
I'll be back soon.

445
01:32:46,394 --> 01:32:47,604
Hachh

446
01:32:54,027 --> 01:32:55,612
- Hachi!
- What is it?

447
01:32:55,737 --> 01:32:57,155
- A demon!
- What?

448
01:32:57,280 --> 01:33:00,867
- A demon!
- There's no such thing, you fool!

449
01:33:35,068 --> 01:33:39,030
There's no such things as demons.
You just imagined it.

450
01:33:39,155 --> 01:33:41,616
There is.
I saw it with my own eyes!

451
01:33:42,492 --> 01:33:45,411
Maybe it was a fox or a badger.

452
01:33:45,537 --> 01:33:47,580
Even weasels fool people.

453
01:33:49,707 --> 01:33:53,419
My head's clear again!

454
01:33:53,545 --> 01:33:56,881
I wish we could live together.

455
01:33:57,006 --> 01:34:00,760
I told you so.
Come and live at my place.

456
01:34:00,885 --> 01:34:03,638
There's a bug on my back!

457
01:34:05,598 --> 01:34:07,642
Set yourself free
from that old woman.

458
01:34:07,767 --> 01:34:10,854
I can't. I might be punished.

459
01:34:12,397 --> 01:34:13,940
For what?

460
01:34:14,065 --> 01:34:16,818
It's Buddha's punishment.

461
01:34:16,943 --> 01:34:19,404
There is no Buddha.

462
01:34:19,529 --> 01:34:21,823
I'll come for you tomorrow.

463
01:36:11,933 --> 01:36:13,977
Wait!

464
01:36:14,102 --> 01:36:15,520
Wait!

465
01:36:17,605 --> 01:36:19,315
It's Mel

466
01:36:19,440 --> 01:36:22,026
I'm not a demon! It's me!

467
01:36:23,319 --> 01:36:25,029
It's Mel

468
01:36:27,657 --> 01:36:30,326
- it's you!
- It's me!

469
01:36:31,327 --> 01:36:33,621
It's your mother!

470
01:36:34,414 --> 01:36:37,166
Then that demon every night...

471
01:36:37,292 --> 01:36:40,044
Yes, it was me!

472
01:36:41,546 --> 01:36:45,174
It was wrong of me. Forgive me.

473
01:36:46,009 --> 01:36:51,014
I wore the mask
to scare you away from him.

474
01:36:53,558 --> 01:36:56,436
Now I'm being punished for it!

475
01:36:56,561 --> 01:36:59,105
The mask won't come off!

476
01:37:01,024 --> 01:37:03,901
Why won't it come off?
Why won't it come off?

477
01:37:04,861 --> 01:37:07,363
Why won't it come off?

478
01:37:07,488 --> 01:37:10,950
It got wet in the rain
and won't come off.

479
01:37:12,327 --> 01:37:14,203
Pull it off for me.

480
01:37:15,121 --> 01:37:18,291
Why won't it come off?

481
01:37:26,549 --> 01:37:28,968
Serves you right!
It's your punishment!

482
01:37:30,678 --> 01:37:32,347
I beg you!

483
01:37:37,352 --> 01:37:39,062
Please!

484
01:37:40,855 --> 01:37:44,233
I didn't sin. This proves it.

485
01:37:44,359 --> 01:37:48,279
Old meddler! This proves it!

486
01:37:49,822 --> 01:37:54,035
It was wrong of me.
I was wrong to meddle.

487
01:37:55,078 --> 01:37:56,954
Pull the mask off!

488
01:37:57,080 --> 01:38:00,625
You became a demon!
Now you can stay that way!

489
01:38:00,750 --> 01:38:03,294
Please get it off me.

490
01:38:04,587 --> 01:38:07,590
I'm begging you!

491
01:38:09,092 --> 01:38:13,137
All right,
but will you do everything I say?

492
01:38:16,599 --> 01:38:17,934
I will, I will.

493
01:38:18,059 --> 01:38:20,228
Exactly as I say?

494
01:38:20,353 --> 01:38:23,773
Yes, I will!

495
01:38:23,898 --> 01:38:26,317
Can I see hachi every night?

496
01:38:28,027 --> 01:38:29,654
Daytime too?

497
01:38:31,239 --> 01:38:35,701
- You won't complain about us?
- No, I won't.

498
01:38:35,827 --> 01:38:39,163
- Day and night?
- Yes.

499
01:38:40,206 --> 01:38:41,916
You sure?

500
01:38:42,041 --> 01:38:43,876
I'm sure!

501
01:38:44,001 --> 01:38:46,796
All right, I'll take it off.

502
01:38:49,757 --> 01:38:51,426
It hurts!

503
01:39:09,068 --> 01:39:12,029
- It hurts...
- Why is this happening?

504
01:39:12,155 --> 01:39:15,700
- Hurry, take it off.
- Bear with it, even if it hurts!

505
01:39:19,787 --> 01:39:21,330
It hurts!

506
01:39:24,292 --> 01:39:26,127
It hurts.

507
01:39:32,508 --> 01:39:35,428
- The rain did this?
- It hurts!

508
01:39:39,307 --> 01:39:40,975
It's punishment!

509
01:39:53,905 --> 01:39:57,617
It hurts... it hurts so!

510
01:39:59,994 --> 01:40:03,206
It's that samurai's curse.

511
01:40:03,331 --> 01:40:05,124
What did you say?

512
01:40:05,249 --> 01:40:07,585
It hurts!

513
01:40:08,294 --> 01:40:11,172
Hold on now, even if it hurts!

514
01:40:58,761 --> 01:41:00,638
I'm going to die.

515
01:41:17,238 --> 01:41:19,240
It came off.

516
01:41:22,410 --> 01:41:24,120
The mask came off!

517
01:41:28,124 --> 01:41:29,458
Demon!

518
01:41:31,544 --> 01:41:34,130
Thank you for pulling it off.

519
01:41:35,214 --> 01:41:36,549
What's wrong?

520
01:41:38,759 --> 01:41:40,303
Wait!

521
01:41:41,971 --> 01:41:45,766
I'm not a demon,
I'm a human being!

522
01:42:12,752 --> 01:42:16,505
I'm a human being!
