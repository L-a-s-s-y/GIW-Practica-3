1
00:01:10,958 --> 00:01:15,247
Nosferatu the vampyre

2
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:34,250
Lucy.

3
00:02:35,833 --> 00:02:37,744
Calm down.

4
00:02:37,833 --> 00:02:39,448
Lucy, calm down.

5
00:02:40,833 --> 00:02:43,370
I see something horrible.

6
00:02:47,792 --> 00:02:49,578
Calm down, Lucy.

7
00:02:54,375 --> 00:02:57,742
Be calm, Lucy. All is well.

8
00:05:00,583 --> 00:05:04,496
Jonathan, you know, it's not good for you -

9
00:05:04,583 --> 00:05:06,539
always eating your breakfast
with such haste.

10
00:05:07,167 --> 00:05:08,623
It worries me.

11
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:00,623
Good morning.

12
00:06:04,208 --> 00:06:07,371
Ah, harker. Please come here.

13
00:06:14,458 --> 00:06:15,618
Yes, mr renfield?

14
00:06:19,833 --> 00:06:21,744
I have a task for you.

15
00:06:23,958 --> 00:06:27,496
It's something I don't dare entrust
to anyone else.

16
00:06:27,958 --> 00:06:29,664
You're very kind, mr renfield.

17
00:06:30,792 --> 00:06:32,282
Count Dracula

18
00:06:34,208 --> 00:06:36,620
has sent me a letter from transylvania.

19
00:06:37,542 --> 00:06:39,749
He wants to buy a house here.

20
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:44,697
Of course, it's a long journey
to go and see him.

21
00:06:45,375 --> 00:06:49,618
Where is that?
Over the carpathian mountains, isn't it?

22
00:06:50,583 --> 00:06:53,450
Yes,

23
00:06:53,917 --> 00:06:56,750
but be assured, there will be
a large commission.

24
00:06:57,542 --> 00:07:00,079
Oh, then I could get a
nicer house for Lucy.

25
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,206
She deserves something better.

26
00:07:03,292 --> 00:07:04,748
Yes.

27
00:07:04,833 --> 00:07:07,950
Well, this won't be easy.

28
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:10,456
It may take you a long time,

29
00:07:11,458 --> 00:07:14,825
and cause you a fair amount of sweat,

30
00:07:16,542 --> 00:07:18,032
and also, possibly,

31
00:07:19,417 --> 00:07:20,532
a little blood.

32
00:07:29,417 --> 00:07:31,783
It'll be good to get out
of the city for a while,

33
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:37,286
away from these canals,

34
00:07:39,042 --> 00:07:41,283
which go nowhere
apart from back on themselves.

35
00:07:42,333 --> 00:07:47,453
Transylvania... there it is!
Deep in the forests.

36
00:07:49,042 --> 00:07:50,578
A wonderful place.

37
00:07:51,875 --> 00:07:54,366
A little gloomy, but very exciting.

38
00:07:57,333 --> 00:07:59,915
The count is looking
for a beautiful old house.

39
00:08:00,708 --> 00:08:03,666
I thought about the big
one near your place.

40
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:07,621
But it's almost in ruins,
it's been abandoned for years.

41
00:08:08,542 --> 00:08:11,500
I'm sure he will be able to restore it.

42
00:08:12,792 --> 00:08:14,373
Anyway, we'll offer it to him.

43
00:08:15,083 --> 00:08:18,621
- You'll leave at once?
- At once? Today?

44
00:08:19,417 --> 00:08:24,081
Certainly. I've got all the papers here.
We mustn't make him wait.

45
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:34,074
All right, if you insist, then
it shall be today. I'm ready.

46
00:08:39,875 --> 00:08:40,955
Today? Right away?

47
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:43,660
Yes, to transylvania.

48
00:08:44,375 --> 00:08:46,661
It's a strange place
where there are still some wolves,

49
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:48,331
and people believe in ghosts.

50
00:08:48,708 --> 00:08:50,414
Jonathan, don't go!

51
00:08:51,417 --> 00:08:53,874
- I have this awful feeling.
- That's ridiculous.

52
00:08:53,958 --> 00:08:58,201
You'll be in danger. Don't go.

53
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:12,163
Wolves, robbers, and ghosts.

54
00:09:13,667 --> 00:09:16,500
You mustn't leave like this.
I cannot permit it.

55
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:20,878
Let's at least spend some time
by the sea first -

56
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:23,199
that place we always liked so much.

57
00:09:26,667 --> 00:09:27,667
Lucy...

58
00:09:31,458 --> 00:09:34,120
I don't know. Sometimes I'm so blind.

59
00:10:36,375 --> 00:10:39,333
Jonathan, I have to say this,

60
00:10:40,417 --> 00:10:42,908
even if you think it's foolish,

61
00:10:44,375 --> 00:10:48,698
coming from the feeble,
defenceless heart of your wife.

62
00:10:49,667 --> 00:10:50,667
Yes?

63
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:56,367
I feel it like a force,

64
00:11:00,458 --> 00:11:03,575
an inner, nameless,

65
00:11:04,625 --> 00:11:05,990
deadly fear.

66
00:11:24,167 --> 00:11:28,786
Lucy is the dearest thing in the
world to me. Take care of her.

67
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,740
Mina, treat her like a sister.

68
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,240
- Yes.
- Goodbye.

69
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:16,780
Innkeeper! Quick, my supper.
I must go to the castle tonight.

70
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:38,908
Must you really go there?

71
00:14:40,042 --> 00:14:41,248
Yes. Why?

72
00:14:42,833 --> 00:14:45,449
Do you have any idea
what that place is like?

73
00:14:46,208 --> 00:14:49,621
Do you wish to bring ruin upon yourself?

74
00:14:51,792 --> 00:14:53,032
Do you know that

75
00:14:53,417 --> 00:14:57,239
at midnight, all kinds of evil spirits
are set loose?

76
00:14:57,875 --> 00:15:01,697
- People disappear without a trace.
- Oh, come on. That's all superstition.

77
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:03,750
Oh, no.

78
00:15:04,083 --> 00:15:09,532
You will not find a coach
which will take you there.

79
00:15:10,167 --> 00:15:11,782
And your own horse

80
00:15:12,542 --> 00:15:15,955
needs to be taken care of here

81
00:15:16,042 --> 00:15:17,452
for a few days.

82
00:15:18,333 --> 00:15:19,698
I'll find another horse.

83
00:15:23,542 --> 00:15:26,454
Don't go there, sir.

84
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:34,075
The gypsies, some of them have been
to the other side.

85
00:15:36,708 --> 00:15:38,039
They know.

86
00:16:15,167 --> 00:16:18,159
He says you shouldn't go there, young man.

87
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:43,826
He says that you have to pass a great chasm
which swallows the unwary.

88
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,790
Then come towering crags,
then the borgo pass,

89
00:16:50,625 --> 00:16:53,537
where the light suddenly divides,
and there, he says,

90
00:16:53,792 --> 00:16:57,660
one land rises up towards
heaven and one falls.

91
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,833
No one has ever come back from there.

92
00:17:17,417 --> 00:17:21,660
The gypsies here say
that no such castle exists,

93
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:24,824
except perhaps in the minds of men.

94
00:17:26,167 --> 00:17:30,410
Just a ruin, they say. A ghost castle.

95
00:17:31,625 --> 00:17:33,581
And whoever enters

96
00:17:33,667 --> 00:17:36,124
that land of phantoms

97
00:17:37,208 --> 00:17:38,744
is lost, never to return.

98
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:14,365
For me?

99
00:18:28,958 --> 00:18:32,621
'Of vampires and bloodsuckers,

100
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:36,037
'of corpses which devour their own flesh,

101
00:18:36,125 --> 00:18:39,947
'of incubi and succubi,

102
00:18:40,542 --> 00:18:44,205
'of the living dead
who follow strangers in the night

103
00:18:44,833 --> 00:18:46,414
'and jump on their backs.'

104
00:18:54,208 --> 00:18:57,621
"Transylvania... nosferatu, the undead.

105
00:18:59,875 --> 00:19:06,246
'The curse will weigh heavily on the people,
the curse of the vampire, nosferatu...'

106
00:19:23,208 --> 00:19:26,655
Coachman, could you take me
to the borgo pass? I'll pay you well.

107
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:28,581
There is no road to the borgo pass.

108
00:19:31,417 --> 00:19:33,078
But it's right there.

109
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:36,115
I need your coach.

110
00:19:36,292 --> 00:19:37,623
I haven't got a coach.

111
00:19:41,208 --> 00:19:44,288
Could I have at least one of your horses?
I'm willing to pay double the price.

112
00:19:44,333 --> 00:19:46,870
Sorry, sir, but can't you see?
I haven't any horses.

113
00:19:53,667 --> 00:19:57,455
Well, then, I'll have to walk.

114
00:26:32,417 --> 00:26:34,373
Count Dracula?

115
00:26:39,208 --> 00:26:42,280
I am count Dracula
and I welcome you to my castle.

116
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:45,910
I've been waiting for you,
you must be Jonathan harker.

117
00:26:46,417 --> 00:26:47,417
Yes.

118
00:26:49,375 --> 00:26:50,375
Come in.

119
00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:55,322
The night is cold,
and you must be tired and hungry.

120
00:27:35,625 --> 00:27:37,365
These are the papers.

121
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,618
The folded document contains
the floorplan of the house,

122
00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:45,990
which I'm sure you will want to see.

123
00:27:55,417 --> 00:27:58,250
Yes, yes. Please help yourself.

124
00:28:00,625 --> 00:28:01,956
Go ahead.

125
00:28:03,458 --> 00:28:05,119
I'm afraid you must dine alone.

126
00:28:05,917 --> 00:28:09,489
It's nearly midnight,
and I partake of nothing at this hour.

127
00:28:23,375 --> 00:28:26,663
Unfortunately, the servants are not
at our disposal either,

128
00:28:27,667 --> 00:28:29,248
so allow me

129
00:28:30,292 --> 00:28:32,704
to attend to your comfort.

130
00:29:25,458 --> 00:29:26,458
Listen.

131
00:29:30,458 --> 00:29:31,458
Listen.

132
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:34,741
The children of the night make their music.

133
00:29:40,042 --> 00:29:41,157
Ah, young man,

134
00:29:42,917 --> 00:29:46,865
town-dwellers cannot feel empathy
for the soul of a hunter.

135
00:31:33,583 --> 00:31:35,369
The knife might be dirty.

136
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:39,707
It could give you blood poisoning.

137
00:31:40,667 --> 00:31:41,873
Please let me do it.

138
00:31:42,250 --> 00:31:46,289
- It's the oldest remedy in the world.
- It's nothing. It's hardly worth mentioning.

139
00:32:01,417 --> 00:32:03,874
It's only for the best, you understand.

140
00:32:43,583 --> 00:32:45,448
Let's sit up a while.

141
00:32:54,083 --> 00:32:55,994
It's still many hours till dawn,

142
00:32:57,833 --> 00:32:59,915
and during the daytime, I'm always away.

143
00:40:02,958 --> 00:40:05,040
Lucy, my love.

144
00:40:08,375 --> 00:40:11,162
There is no postal service from here,

145
00:40:11,708 --> 00:40:13,414
but I shall write a diary,

146
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:17,948
preserving all my thoughts
and feelings for you.

147
00:40:18,292 --> 00:40:23,116
Last night, after a tiresome journey,
I finally reached my destination,

148
00:40:23,958 --> 00:40:25,744
the castle of count Dracula.

149
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,492
I had a bad dream, but I hope it'll pass.

150
00:40:31,417 --> 00:40:33,533
I still feel a little weariness.

151
00:40:34,625 --> 00:40:37,788
Everything about this castle looks
so unreal. It is so strange,

152
00:40:38,167 --> 00:40:40,579
that at times I wonder
if I haven't dreamed it.

153
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:22,742
I no longer attach any importance
to sunshine or the glittering fountains

154
00:41:23,750 --> 00:41:25,706
that youth is so fond of.

155
00:41:28,542 --> 00:41:30,373
I love the darkness and the shadows,

156
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:34,991
where I can be alone with my thoughts.

157
00:41:43,833 --> 00:41:45,915
I am the descendant of an old family.

158
00:41:50,417 --> 00:41:54,160
Time is an abyss,
as deep as a thousand nights.

159
00:41:56,833 --> 00:41:58,664
Centuries come and go.

160
00:42:01,125 --> 00:42:03,286
To be unable to grow old is terrible.

161
00:42:04,667 --> 00:42:08,330
Death is not the worst thing,
there are things much more horrible.

162
00:42:10,125 --> 00:42:13,322
Can you imagine enduring centuries,

163
00:42:15,208 --> 00:42:18,371
each day experiencing
the same futile things?

164
00:42:22,625 --> 00:42:25,697
I'm glad you found
such a large old house for me.

165
00:42:26,292 --> 00:42:28,658
Very near to your own place,
I understand?

166
00:42:29,125 --> 00:42:31,286
Yes, it's just around the corner.

167
00:42:34,417 --> 00:42:36,123
May I have a look at the contract?

168
00:42:47,917 --> 00:42:48,952
What a

169
00:42:50,167 --> 00:42:51,623
lovely throat.

170
00:42:53,625 --> 00:42:55,786
It's my wife, Lucy.

171
00:43:00,417 --> 00:43:01,417
Your hand...

172
00:43:07,917 --> 00:43:10,397
The documents, the contract for the house.
I will sign at once.

173
00:43:12,792 --> 00:43:14,783
Yes, but we haven't settled a price...

174
00:43:14,875 --> 00:43:16,706
It's a small matter between gentlemen.

175
00:43:16,792 --> 00:43:18,783
I will accept whatever
you consider to be fair.

176
00:43:34,208 --> 00:43:36,995
How long did it take you
to get here from wismar?

177
00:43:37,833 --> 00:43:39,198
Four weeks.

178
00:43:44,792 --> 00:43:45,872
Ah, yes...

179
00:43:49,667 --> 00:43:51,953
It takes a while to travel by land.

180
00:44:43,458 --> 00:44:46,291
'From the seed of belial
is the vampire born,

181
00:44:47,875 --> 00:44:50,617
'he who feeds on the blood of mankind,

182
00:44:51,875 --> 00:44:57,495
'who, unredeemed, taketh his refuge
in caves, tombs, coffins,

183
00:44:58,750 --> 00:45:03,323
filled with the cursed soil of cemeteries

184
00:45:04,333 --> 00:45:06,494
'wherein the black death
hath reaped his harvest,

185
00:45:07,958 --> 00:45:08,993
'the plague.'

186
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,331
Jonathan!

187
00:47:47,208 --> 00:47:49,324
She has a sudden fever.

188
00:47:52,167 --> 00:47:54,533
And her pulse is very fast.

189
00:47:56,500 --> 00:47:57,956
She needs to rest.

190
00:48:00,333 --> 00:48:03,450
Call me at once if you
think it is necessary.

191
00:48:04,333 --> 00:48:06,324
But I don't think it is
really that serious.

192
00:50:54,833 --> 00:50:56,698
Oh, god, he must be going to wismar.

193
00:50:57,708 --> 00:50:58,788
Lucy!

194
00:51:00,083 --> 00:51:03,871
Lucy is in danger. I've
got to get out of here.

195
00:53:09,500 --> 00:53:10,910
It's strange,

196
00:53:14,167 --> 00:53:16,249
but the papers are all in order.

197
00:53:17,042 --> 00:53:18,532
It reads,

198
00:53:19,208 --> 00:53:23,872
'from varna to wismar.
Garden soil for botanical experiments."

199
00:53:26,958 --> 00:53:28,164
Open one of them.

200
00:53:29,792 --> 00:53:32,704
I want to make sure. This one.

201
00:54:00,583 --> 00:54:01,914
Mother superior.

202
00:54:03,042 --> 00:54:05,203
Stop the black coffins.

203
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:03,116
The patient we got
yesterday is having a fit.

204
00:55:03,333 --> 00:55:05,949
- Which one?
- The one who bit the cow.

205
00:55:06,208 --> 00:55:08,449
- We have him in solitary confinement.
- I'm coming.

206
00:55:12,125 --> 00:55:13,285
Blood is life!

207
00:55:18,250 --> 00:55:21,117
- Blood is life.
- Has he done this before?

208
00:55:21,250 --> 00:55:25,493
Yes, he did the same a few hours ago. Instead
of taking food, he tries to eat flies.

209
00:55:25,583 --> 00:55:28,495
- Blood is life.
- Give it to me, let go!

210
00:55:31,750 --> 00:55:32,750
Help!

211
00:55:42,750 --> 00:55:43,750
Now!

212
00:55:55,458 --> 00:55:59,531
Quiet. I hear the rustling of sails.

213
00:56:24,208 --> 00:56:25,448
Still there's no letter.

214
00:56:26,833 --> 00:56:28,744
But Lucy, you mustn't worry.

215
00:56:29,667 --> 00:56:31,703
The post from transylvania
is very slow.

216
00:56:31,875 --> 00:56:33,411
Even the postman says as much.

217
00:56:34,917 --> 00:56:36,828
Something has happened to Jonathan...

218
00:56:37,625 --> 00:56:39,035
Lucy, have faith.

219
00:56:39,375 --> 00:56:41,081
The lord will hear our prayers.

220
00:56:43,083 --> 00:56:46,371
The lord is so far away from us
in our hour of distress.

221
00:56:57,292 --> 00:56:59,908
The young gentleman is quite ill,
he mustn't travel yet.

222
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,240
The black coffins.

223
00:57:01,833 --> 00:57:03,713
I must get to wismar
before the black coffins...

224
00:57:03,792 --> 00:57:06,784
The young gentleman should wait at least
until the doctor comes tomorrow.

225
00:57:07,208 --> 00:57:10,871
But Lucy is in danger. I have to go.

226
00:57:13,208 --> 00:57:16,530
The black coffins... evil is on its way.

227
00:57:17,792 --> 00:57:18,792
Yes.

228
00:57:59,375 --> 00:58:02,492
The ship seems burdened by a curse.

229
00:58:02,583 --> 00:58:05,120
Since we left the black sea,

230
00:58:06,333 --> 00:58:09,405
one after another, four sailors and a mate

231
00:58:09,500 --> 00:58:11,707
have taken ill and passed away.

232
00:58:13,417 --> 00:58:16,739
One sailor and our cook have disappeared
without a trace.

233
00:58:18,333 --> 00:58:21,780
A rumour circulated, terrifying everyone,

234
00:58:22,292 --> 00:58:24,157
that there was a stranger on board.

235
00:58:25,083 --> 00:58:27,165
We searched everywhere.

236
00:58:28,417 --> 00:58:31,250
Only the rats are a real plague.

237
00:58:32,250 --> 00:58:35,117
We are still trying to maintain
a north-westerly course.

238
00:58:35,208 --> 00:58:38,371
Wind is steady, 12 knots.

239
00:59:00,417 --> 00:59:01,827
Mr renfield.

240
00:59:02,208 --> 00:59:06,907
You sent my husband to transylvania.

241
00:59:08,208 --> 00:59:10,415
I haven't heard from him in weeks

242
00:59:11,167 --> 00:59:12,782
and I am deeply worried.

243
00:59:14,542 --> 00:59:16,783
I'm ready to set out for
transylvania myself.

244
00:59:21,250 --> 00:59:22,581
Stay here.

245
00:59:22,667 --> 00:59:23,747
The master comes.

246
00:59:25,167 --> 00:59:26,782
Who is coming? Tell us more.

247
00:59:27,625 --> 00:59:28,956
The master of the rats.

248
00:59:31,250 --> 00:59:35,448
The army of rats is hungry
and 400,000 strong.

249
00:59:40,250 --> 00:59:42,866
We had better leave now.

250
01:00:03,333 --> 01:00:04,333
'Plague

251
01:00:05,500 --> 01:00:06,535
"n varna...

252
01:03:47,917 --> 01:03:49,282
The master is here.

253
01:04:00,333 --> 01:04:01,618
The master is here.

254
01:04:32,250 --> 01:04:35,697
Lay a plank across.
The ship must be fully checked.

255
01:05:01,167 --> 01:05:02,247
Untie him.

256
01:05:21,625 --> 01:05:23,035
Not a soul on board,

257
01:05:23,750 --> 01:05:25,035
very little freight,

258
01:05:26,500 --> 01:05:28,912
and the hold is teeming with rats.

259
01:05:29,583 --> 01:05:31,244
But here is the log.

260
01:06:20,833 --> 01:06:22,243
It is truly a mystery.

261
01:06:25,167 --> 01:06:26,657
Perhaps, gentlemen,

262
01:06:27,375 --> 01:06:29,957
the ship's log may hold the clue to it.

263
01:06:33,542 --> 01:06:35,203
"Varna, sixth of June.

264
01:06:35,292 --> 01:06:39,456
'Crew, apart from me, the captain:
Two mates, five sailors,

265
01:06:39,542 --> 01:06:41,828

'Rats everywhere. Could it be the plague?'

274

go home quietly, please.

275
01:07:21,708 --> 01:07:23,289
Shut the doors and windows.

276
01:07:25,708 --> 01:07:26,708
Gentlemen...

277
01:11:45,833 --> 01:11:50,623
Madam, we are delivering this man,
who says he lives here.

278
01:11:51,583 --> 01:11:52,618
Lucy!

279
01:11:54,833 --> 01:11:55,913
Jonathan!

280
01:12:09,292 --> 01:12:10,327
Who is this woman?

281
01:12:12,708 --> 01:12:13,708
That one...

282
01:12:21,750 --> 01:12:22,990
Let's bring him in.

283
01:12:37,292 --> 01:12:38,657
He must be suffering from

284
01:12:39,625 --> 01:12:42,412
a severe brain fever.

285
01:12:49,792 --> 01:12:50,998
The sun is hurting me.

286
01:13:09,458 --> 01:13:13,906
Dr Van Helsing, do you think it is possible
that we have all gone mad

287
01:13:15,167 --> 01:13:17,687
and one day we will all wake
to find ourselves in straitjackets?

288
01:15:45,625 --> 01:15:48,037
Excuse my uninvited entrance.

289
01:15:49,583 --> 01:15:50,663
I am count Dracula.

290
01:15:53,750 --> 01:15:54,865
I know about you.

291
01:15:56,500 --> 01:15:58,866
I read Jonathan's diary.

292
01:16:00,958 --> 01:16:03,916
Since being with you, he is ruined.

293
01:16:05,250 --> 01:16:07,662
- He will not die.
- Yes, he will.

294
01:16:09,583 --> 01:16:10,789
Death is overwhelming.

295
01:16:12,917 --> 01:16:14,453
We are all at his command.

296
01:16:20,667 --> 01:16:23,329
The rivers continue to flow without us.

297
01:16:25,708 --> 01:16:27,118
Time trickles away.

298
01:16:29,042 --> 01:16:30,407
And look outside.

299
01:16:31,583 --> 01:16:33,790
The stars spin and turn in confusion.

300
01:16:36,500 --> 01:16:40,618
Only death is cruelly certain.

301
01:16:43,292 --> 01:16:48,207
Death is cruel to the unsuspecting.
But death is not everything.

302
01:16:50,333 --> 01:16:53,370
It is crueller to be unable to die.

303
01:16:54,542 --> 01:16:59,115
I wish I could partake of the love
which exists between you and Jonathan.

304
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:06,494
Nothing in this world, not even god,
can touch that.

305
01:17:08,625 --> 01:17:12,368
Even though, since his return,
Jonathan does not recognise me any more.

306
01:17:13,417 --> 01:17:14,782
I could change everything.

307
01:17:15,583 --> 01:17:18,541
If you were to come and join me,

308
01:17:19,708 --> 01:17:22,165
there would be salvation for your husband

309
01:17:22,250 --> 01:17:23,456
and for me.

310
01:17:25,833 --> 01:17:28,165
The absence of love, you know,

311
01:17:29,958 --> 01:17:31,914
is the most abject pain.

312
01:17:35,167 --> 01:17:37,749
Salvation comes from ourselves alone.

313
01:17:40,208 --> 01:17:41,698
And you may rest assured

314
01:17:43,375 --> 01:17:47,539
that I am not afraid to
think the unthinkable.

315
01:18:03,917 --> 01:18:04,917
Good night.

316
01:19:06,583 --> 01:19:07,583
Stop!

317
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:12,206
Help!

318
01:19:12,625 --> 01:19:14,581
Help!

319
01:19:35,250 --> 01:19:37,457
'Nosferatu, the undead.

336
01:21:14,250 --> 01:21:16,536
What is your command, master?

337
01:21:21,917 --> 01:21:23,373
Go north.

338
01:21:25,750 --> 01:21:26,750
To Riga.

339
01:21:28,625 --> 01:21:32,573
The army of rats and the black death
are with you.

340
01:21:34,958 --> 01:21:38,075
Thy will be done. Amen.

341
01:21:38,583 --> 01:21:39,583
Amen!

342
01:22:22,125 --> 01:22:24,867
The plague! The plague!
What are you doing here?

343
01:22:24,958 --> 01:22:28,997
- I must go to the town council.
- It no longer exists. It's been dissolved.

344
01:22:29,667 --> 01:22:31,953
- Then I have to see the mayor.
- He is dead.

345
01:22:32,042 --> 01:22:33,748
Go home as quickly as you can.

346
01:22:34,917 --> 01:22:37,533
I know the reason for all this evil.

347
01:22:38,667 --> 01:22:41,784
I know the reason for all this evil.

348
01:22:42,958 --> 01:22:45,199
Why won't you listen to me?

349
01:22:47,500 --> 01:22:48,910
I know the reason...

350
01:23:09,042 --> 01:23:12,079
But, my child, these are just figments
of your imagination.

351
01:23:12,917 --> 01:23:14,623
But dr Van Helsing,

352
01:23:15,708 --> 01:23:18,780
you have read Jonathan's diary.

353
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,286
You have seen it with your own eyes.

354
01:23:23,625 --> 01:23:28,790
It's getting worse out there every day.
The plague, the rats...

355
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:34,367
And this book about the vampire.

356
01:23:36,500 --> 01:23:38,741
You must see it.

357
01:23:41,083 --> 01:23:44,996
We live in a most enlightened era.
Superstitions such as you mentioned

358
01:23:45,625 --> 01:23:47,206
have been refuted by science.

359
01:23:47,708 --> 01:23:49,790
I am absolutely certain it exists.

360
01:23:49,875 --> 01:23:51,991
I believe what I see with my own eyes.

361
01:23:52,750 --> 01:23:54,615
Faith, faith...

362
01:23:55,125 --> 01:23:56,125
Yes, faith.

363
01:23:57,583 --> 01:23:59,323
Yes. Faith, dr Van Helsing.

364
01:23:59,917 --> 01:24:00,917
Faith.

365
01:24:02,042 --> 01:24:06,786
Faith is the amazing faculty of men
which enables us to believe things

366
01:24:07,208 --> 01:24:10,041
which we know to be untrue.

367
01:24:14,208 --> 01:24:17,041
You must come and help me
destroy this monster.

368
01:24:18,458 --> 01:24:20,619
We must find his lair.

369
01:24:21,667 --> 01:24:23,532
Coffins have arrived by boat.

370
01:24:24,208 --> 01:24:26,745
Let us start searching tonight.

371
01:24:27,167 --> 01:24:28,373
My child,

372
01:24:29,458 --> 01:24:31,790
you need to rest and recuperate.

373
01:24:32,917 --> 01:24:35,624
This business with your husband
has completely worn you out.

374
01:24:35,958 --> 01:24:37,789
No, dr Van Helsing. Tonight!

375
01:24:37,875 --> 01:24:41,538
This has got to be studied
first, scientifically.

376
01:24:41,958 --> 01:24:46,531
No, tonight! There is no time to lose!

377
01:24:47,583 --> 01:24:51,326
The good farmer knows that everything
must happen in its own time.

378
01:24:51,750 --> 01:24:57,074
He doesn't dig up the wheat
to make sure it is growing.

379
01:24:57,167 --> 01:25:00,739
Only children playing at being farmers
do such things.

380
01:25:06,958 --> 01:25:10,030
Then I shall destroy the monster alone.

381
01:25:18,167 --> 01:25:19,282
Well, then...

382
01:25:52,250 --> 01:25:54,536
Mother superior, my medicine...

383
01:26:06,417 --> 01:26:09,454
How did I come to make
your acquaintance, madam?

384
01:29:03,958 --> 01:29:06,119
God, forgive me for what I do.

385
01:32:47,042 --> 01:32:50,614
- Join us, please.
- Drink with us. Be our guest.

386
01:32:51,458 --> 01:32:55,371
We've all caught the plague.
We are enjoying each day that's left.

387
01:33:15,583 --> 01:33:16,789
Madame Lucy!

388
01:33:16,875 --> 01:33:18,957
Madame Lucy! Open the door!

389
01:33:22,167 --> 01:33:25,284
Are you all right?
Come quickly to the schraders'.

390
01:33:25,708 --> 01:33:27,539
Something terrible has happened.

391
01:33:56,500 --> 01:33:58,957
Lucy, compose yourself.

392
01:33:59,708 --> 01:34:02,666
You can come closer,
it is certainly not the plague.

393
01:34:05,958 --> 01:34:08,950
My god, what has happened?

394
01:34:09,500 --> 01:34:11,115
We don't know exactly.

395
01:34:11,375 --> 01:34:14,447
Except that this morning,
schrader found Mina dead.

396
01:34:16,208 --> 01:34:19,120
Yes. He lost his mind.

397
01:34:19,292 --> 01:34:20,327
He was raving.

398
01:34:23,750 --> 01:34:27,618
The matter will be explored
with scientific thoroughness,

399
01:34:28,208 --> 01:34:31,826
without superstition or prejudice.

400
01:34:35,083 --> 01:34:36,083
Enough.

401
01:34:36,792 --> 01:34:38,908
Enough of your science!

402
01:34:40,875 --> 01:34:43,662
I know now what I have to do.

403
01:35:14,875 --> 01:35:18,367
A consecrated host may bar the vampire.

404
01:35:41,500 --> 01:35:46,244
And should a woman pure of heart
cause him to forget the crow of the cock,

405
01:35:47,958 --> 01:35:50,074
the first light of day will destroy him.

406
01:42:19,667 --> 01:42:21,658
Now I know everything.

407
01:42:22,875 --> 01:42:25,412
Oh, god,
I should have listened to her before.

408
01:42:36,583 --> 01:42:39,495
A stake, and a hammer, quickly.

409
01:42:40,917 --> 01:42:43,829
I have to destroy this fiend forever.

410
01:42:58,667 --> 01:42:59,702
Stop!

411
01:43:00,917 --> 01:43:01,917
Don't do it!

412
01:43:23,625 --> 01:43:24,625
No.

413
01:43:26,917 --> 01:43:27,917
Help!

414
01:43:33,375 --> 01:43:34,375
Van Helsing!

415
01:43:35,458 --> 01:43:38,780
Seize him.
That man has murdered the count!

416
01:43:41,417 --> 01:43:42,417
Have you?

417
01:43:45,917 --> 01:43:48,033
With that stake? Yes.

418
01:43:49,417 --> 01:43:51,453
But I can explain.

419
01:43:51,542 --> 01:43:53,032
I don't need an explanation.

420
01:43:53,250 --> 01:43:55,662
You are under arrest, dr Van Helsing.

421
01:43:56,708 --> 01:43:57,708
Arrest this man!

422
01:43:59,083 --> 01:44:01,165
Arrest? You are asking to arrest him?

423
01:44:01,958 --> 01:44:04,449
- Go and get the police.
- The police are no more.

424
01:44:05,208 --> 01:44:06,948
Then... then take the man to prison!

425
01:44:07,500 --> 01:44:09,741
There is no one there
to guard him any more.

426
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:11,536
Then you must arrest him yourself.

427
01:44:11,833 --> 01:44:13,744
How am I to do that? I need weapons.

428
01:44:13,917 --> 01:44:16,249
Arrest him! You are a town employee!

429
01:44:17,792 --> 01:44:19,657
Well, where will you take me, then?

430
01:44:24,333 --> 01:44:25,869
I wonder myself...

431
01:44:26,042 --> 01:44:29,159
Take me wherever you want,
or can.

432
01:44:31,917 --> 01:44:33,373
What are you doing standing there?

433
01:44:34,917 --> 01:44:36,453
Fetch a broom.

434
01:44:36,542 --> 01:44:39,329
Can't you see everything
is covered in dust?

435
01:45:03,792 --> 01:45:06,955
Seal the bedroom
for the official investigation.

436
01:45:08,333 --> 01:45:10,164
And bring me my horse.

437
01:45:11,958 --> 01:45:13,539
I have much to do

438
01:45:14,833 --> 01:45:15,833
now.
