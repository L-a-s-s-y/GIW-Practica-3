00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:31,880
CLASS RELATIONS

4
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:03,120
My umbrella!

5
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:29,600
Why are you pounding
on the door like a madman?

6
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:31,160
I got lost.

7
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,600
I didn't notice it so much
during the crossing

8
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,800
but this is
a terribly big ship.

9
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,080
I'm not disturbing you?

10
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,760
How could you be disturbing?

11
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:44,960
You are a German?

12
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:48,880
I am, I am.
Sit down on the bed.

13
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:03,560
I've completely
forgotten my suitcase!

14
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:05,880
Up on the deck.

15
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,960
Do you really need the suitcase?

16
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,040
Then why did you leave it?

17
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:15,480
I'd forgotten my umbrella
and rushed off to get it,

18
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,800
but I didn't want to drag
the suitcase along.

19
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,880
Then I got lost, too.

20
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,480
You are alone?

21
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,640
Yes, alone.

22
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:27,040
And now
you've even lost the suitcase.

23
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,800
Not to mention the umbrella.

24
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
But I believe
the suitcase is not lost yet.

25
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,800
Happy the believers...

26
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:51,680
I'm leaving, too, in a little
while, so we'll go together.

27
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,240
Either the suitcase
has been stolen,

28
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,360
then nothing can be done,

29
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,440
or they left it standing.

30
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Then when the ship
is completely empty,

31
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:04,480
we'll find it all the better.

32
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,560
The same with your umbrella.

33
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,440
Do you know the ship well?

34
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,160
I'm a ship's stoker.

35
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,400
I've always been
interested in machinery

36
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,760
and I would surely
have become an engineer later,

37
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:22,160
if I hadn't had
to go to America.

38
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,640
So why did you have to go?

39
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,200
There must have been a reason.

40
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,080
Now I could also
become a stoker.

41
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:36,320
To my parents
it's quite indifferent now.

42
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,200
My place will be free.

43
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:40,240
You're leaving the ship?

44
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,440
Yes, we break camp today.

45
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:47,160
But why?
Don't you like it?

46
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,840
That's how relations stand.

47
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:54,800
It isn't always decisive
whether a man likes it or not.

48
00:03:56,440 --> 00:04:00,480
But you're right,
I don't like it either.

49
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:05,200
You're probably not seriously
thinking of becoming a stoker

50
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:10,080
but that's just when
it's easiest to become one.

51
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:14,600
So I advise you
decidedly against it.

52
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,640
If in Europe

53
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:20,480
you wanted to study,
why don't you want to here?

54
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:24,600
The American universities
are incomparably better.

55
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:29,600
That's possible,
but I have almost no money

56
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,520
for studying.
Besides,

57
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,720
I wasn't
particularly good in school.

58
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:43,080
And the schools here
might be even stricter.

59
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:47,880
I hardly know any English.
Besides, people here

60
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,800
have a prejudice
against foreigners, I believe.

61
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Have you
learned that, too, already?

62
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,280
Well, then that's good.
Then you're my man.

63
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:59,480
You see, we
are on a German ship,

64
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:04,560
why aren't we
all Germans here?

65
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,960
Why is the chief
machinist a Rumanian?

66
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,720
His name is Schubal.
It is not to be believed.

67
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,400
And this dirty dog torments us,

68
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,800
us Germans,
on a German ship!

69
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:21,320
I know that you have
no influence and are

70
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:25,320
yourself a poor boy.
But it's too much!

71
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,040
I've already served
on so many ships

72
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:32,680
and have distinguished myself,
been praised,

73
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:36,160
was a worker
to the taste of my captains,

74
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,400
and here on this tub,

75
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:47,280
where everything is by the line
and no wits are needed at all,

76
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,600
here I am worth nothing,

77
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:52,720
here I am always
in Schubal's way,

78
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,600
am a loafer,
deserve to be thrown out,

79
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,040
and only receive my pay
out of mercy.

80
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:02,720
Do you understand that?
I don't.

81
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,440
Were you already
to see the captain?

82
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:15,400
Have you already
sought justice from his part?

83
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:18,080
Oh, go on,
just go away.

84
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:22,320
You don't listen to what I say
and give me advice.

85
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:25,760
How should I go
to the captain then?

86
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:59,240
Now everything is finished
and we can go.

87
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,800
Now I am going to the office

88
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,680
and I will tell my opinion
to these gentlemen.

89
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:44,240
It's time for pay,
do you want to come?

90
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:47,400
Bring the money
to me here rather.

91
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:52,080
Where did you find
this handsome lad?

92
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,840
I permit myself to say
that in my opinion

93
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:48,120
the stoker
has been done an injustice.

94
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:51,040
There is a certain Schubal here
who bullies him.

95
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:56,040
He himself has already served
and given full satisfaction

96
00:09:56,200 --> 00:10:00,440
on numerous ships, all of
which he can name to you,

97
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:04,200
and one cannot see why,
just on this ship,

98
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,560
where the service is not
excessively difficult,

99
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,280
he should be badly suited.

100
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:13,280
It can be nothing but slander

101
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,640
that hinders his advancement

102
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:18,920
and deprives him of the esteem
which he surely would not lack.

103
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:28,640
All that is word for word correct.

104
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:37,480
The man
is a notorious quarreler.

105
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:41,600
He is in the cashier's
more than in the engine room.

106
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:57,320
How many times have you
been thrown out of the pay rooms

107
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:00,080
as you deserve
with your wholly,

108
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:05,240
completely and without
exception unjustified demands!

109
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:14,360
How many times have you been told
for your own good that Schubal

110
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:17,760
is your immediate superior
and that it is with him alone

111
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,560
you as a subordinate
must come to terms.

112
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:26,120
And now you come here
while the captain is present;

113
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:29,440
you aren't even ashamed
to bring as a mouthpiece,

114
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,920
to recite by heart your insipid
accusations, this little one,

115
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,960
whom I now see for the
first time on this ship!

116
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,560
Let us listen to the man once.

117
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:47,760
Schubal
is getting much too independent

118
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,760
for me anyway
as time goes on.

119
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,800
Mr. Schubal is unjust!

120
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:55,400
Mr. Schubal favors
foreigners!

121
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,000
Mr. Schubal

122
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,400
expelled me
from the engine room

123
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,520
and made me clean waterclosets,

124
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,880
which was certainly
not my business!

125
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:06,680
You must recount that
more clearly.

126
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,880
The captain
cannot appreciate that

127
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,360
as you are recounting it to him.

128
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,840
To me you have always
depicted it so clearly.

129
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,680
What is your name actually?

130
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:35,600
I come because I believe
that the stoker

131
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:40,440
is accusing me
of certain improbities.

132
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:45,680
A girl from the kitchen
told me she had seen him

133
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,920
on the way here.

134
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,120
Captain, sir,
and all you gentlemen,

135
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:57,200
I am ready
to refute each accusation

136
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,120
with the aid of my writings,

137
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,120
if necessary
with depositions by witnesses

138
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:11,040
who are not prejudiced
or influenced.

139
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:28,040
Then I am your uncle Jakob
and you are my dear nephew.

140
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,440
What is your name?

141
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:33,520
Comprehend, young man,
your luck.

142
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:37,240
It is Senator Edward Jakob

143
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:43,040
who has made himself known
to you as your uncle.

144
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,760
I really do have
an uncle Jakob in America,

145
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:49,960
but if I have well understood,
Jakob

146
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,280
is only the last name
of the Senator.

147
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:58,720
Well, my uncle Jakob,
who is the brother of my mother,

148
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:03,600
has the first name of Jakob,
while his last name naturally

149
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,540
would have to be the same
as that of my mother,

150
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,800
who was born a Bendelmayer.

151
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:17,040
I have lived for all the long
years of my sojourn in America -

152
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:20,120
the word sojourn
is assuredly ill fitting here

153
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:23,200
to the American citizen
which I am with all my soul -

154
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,680
for all the long years

155
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:30,560
I have lived completely separated
from my European relatives

156
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:33,960
for reasons which, first,
do not belong here and which,

157
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:38,840
second, it would truly
affect me too much to recount.

158
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:49,280
My dear nephew
has been simply

159
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,240
put aside by his parents

160
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,800
as one throws a cat
out the door when it annoys.

161
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,240
I do not wish to gild over
what my nephew did

162
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,240
to be so punished,

163
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:08,040
but his fault is such
that simply naming it

164
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,880
already contains excuses enough.

165
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,760
He was in fact
seduced by a servant,

166
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:19,640
Johanna Brummer,
a person of about 35 years.

167
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:24,360
Now this Brummer
has had a child by my nephew,

168
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:28,680
which has received at baptism
the name Jakob,

169
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:32,600
doubtless with a thought of
my humble person, which,

170
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:36,640
even in surely quite peripheral
mentions by my nephew

171
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:40,520
must have made a great
impression on the girl.

172
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:45,000
Happily, say I.
For, as the parents,

173
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:50,200
in order to avoid the alimentary
payments or all other scandal,

174
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:54,560
transported their son,
my dear nephew, to America

175
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:58,120
with irresponsibly
insufficient equipment,

176
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,000
so that, without

177
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:03,440
the signs and miracles
still alive in America, the boy

178
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:08,920
would already be in perdition in
an alley of the port of New York,

179
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:13,120
if this servant
had not communicated to me

180
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,840
the whole story
in a letter, which arrived

181
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:19,240
in my possession
the day before yesterday,

182
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:22,200
and included a description
of my nephew's person and,

183
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:26,760
judiciously,
the name of the ship.

184
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:30,760
And now I want to hear from you
if I am your uncle or not.

185
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,720
You are my uncle. But...

186
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:48,560
It is a special honor
for my ship

187
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:52,840
to have supplied the place
for such a meeting.

188
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,640
But the crossing
in steerage

189
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,080
was no doubt very hard.

190
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:05,400
We do everything possible

191
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:09,200
to ease the crossing
for the people in steerage,

192
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:14,800
much more, for example,
than the American lines,

193
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:20,120
but we surely
have not yet succeeded

194
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:22,560
in transforming such a crossing
into a pleasure.

195
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,360
It did me no harm.

196
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26,600
It did him no harm.

197
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,640
What will happen
to the stoker now?

198
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:32,240
What he deserves

199
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:35,160
and what the captain
deems good.

200
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:38,280
I believe we have had enough and
more than enough of the stoker.

201
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:45,920
But that isn't important
in a matter of justice.

202
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:52,440
Perhaps it is a
matter of justice, but

203
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:55,320
at the same time
it is a matter of discipline.

204
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:58,920
Both,
and particularly the latter,

205
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,040
depend here on the judgement
of the captain.

206
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,480
It is so.

207
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:05,400
Furthermore, we have already
disturbed the captain so much

208
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,120
in the business of his charge

209
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:14,560
that it is high time
for us to leave the ship

210
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:20,120
to avoid in addition
making an incident of

211
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:25,040
this futile dispute
between two machinists.

212
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:29,800
For the rest, I understand
perfectly your way of acting,

213
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:32,240
but precisely that
gives me the right

214
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:34,560
to conduct you hence
most quickly.

215
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:44,680
Why do you say nothing?
Why do you stand for all this?

216
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:48,960
You have been done an injustice
as no one else on this ship.

217
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,840
But you must
defend yourself,

218
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:54,320
say yes and no;
otherwise people

219
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:56,720
have no idea of the truth.

220
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,480
You must promise me

221
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:01,960
that you will obey me, because
I have reason to believe

222
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,640
I will no longer myself
be able to help you at all.

223
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:11,320
You felt abandoned,
there you met the stoker,

224
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,960
and now you are grateful to him;
that is very laudable.

225
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:17,200
But don't push that too far,
if only out of love for me,

226
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:20,360
and learn
to comprehend your place.

227
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:44,240
You have really come far.

228
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:50,440
And I set it all up myself
thirty years ago.

229
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:55,600
At that time I had
a small business and if

230
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:58,840
five crates
were unloaded in one day

231
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:02,720
that was a lot and
I would go home inflated.

232
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:07,880
Today I have
the third-largest warehouses

233
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,720
and the shop from that time

234
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:15,600
is the dining room of the
65th group of my porters.

235
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,240
That borders on the miraculous.

236
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:23,080
All developments here
go on that fast.

237
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:39,720
Mr. Pollunder

238
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:42,440
has come to take you
to his country house.

239
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:50,320
I didn't know
it was to be today already,

240
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,280
otherwise I would
already be prepared.

241
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,480
If you are not prepared
perhaps we'd better

242
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:59,520
put off the visit
for the time being.

243
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:03,920
What preparations! A young man
is always prepared.

244
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:10,200
He would still have to go to his
room and you would be detained.

245
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:17,280
I foresaw a delay also
and closed my office early.

246
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:20,400
You see what inconveniences
your visit

247
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,640
is causing even now.

248
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,680
You will miss your
riding lesson tomorrow;

249
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,320
have you cancelled it already?

250
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:41,880
No, I didn't know...

251
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:44,720
And in spite of that
you want to go?

252
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,720
On the way we will stop

253
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:49,440
at the riding school
and put the matter in order.

254
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:56,160
But Mack will still
wait for you.

255
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:59,760
He won't wait for me
but he will surely come.

256
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:05,280
But Klara is waiting
for him, too,

257
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:10,040
and this very evening, and surely
she has precedence over Mack?

258
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:14,640
Assuredly.
So run to your room.

259
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:18,040
You will be back in the morning
for your English lesson?

260
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:26,000
Can't he stay out there
at least for the day tomorrow?

261
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:29,520
I'll bring him back in the
morning the day after tomorrow?

262
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:31,160
That can't be in any case.

263
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:35,120
I cannot let his studies
fall into disorder.

264
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:39,840
Later, when he has
a regulated professional life,

265
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:42,120
I will very gladly allow him

266
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:46,640
to defer to an invitation
so kind and so honourable.

267
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,000
One must take
what one gets.

268
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,360
It is strange
how unreadily

269
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:22,000
he gave me
permission to visit you,

270
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,040
even though you are his friend.

271
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:27,680
He didn't mean all that
so seriously. Your education

272
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:29,480
is close to his heart.

273
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:32,920
Did he tell you himself
that he did not mean

274
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,200
the earlier things so seriously?

275
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:16,840
Here is Mr. Jakob at last.

276
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:18,160
My name is Rossmann.

277
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:19,960
He is only Jakob's nephew.

278
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:22,640
That changes nothing
in our joy to have him here.

279
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:24,440
You are Miss Klara?

280
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:28,480
We also have one more
guest this evening. Mr. Green.

281
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:35,840
It does no good at all
to live just outside New York;

282
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,480
one is not spared
the disturbances.

283
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,960
We absolutely must
move our residence

284
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:44,560
still further away.
Even if I would have to

285
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:47,760
drive half the night
before I get home.

286
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:55,480
Perhaps he will leave soon.

287
00:25:56,840 --> 00:26:00,160
He has some grand business
for Papa, and the discussion

288
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:04,160
will last a long time, for he
already threatened me jokingly

289
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:07,520
that if I want to be a
polite mistress of the house,

290
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:09,640
I will have to listen
until morning.

291
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:12,600
So now that, too.
He will stay all night!

292
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:27,880
After supper, if it is
all right with you, we will go

293
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:30,080
immediately
to my rooms

294
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:33,360
and you will do me the kindness
of playing for me on the piano,

295
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:37,360
for Papa has already told me
how well you do that,

296
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:40,400
but I am sadly incapable

297
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:43,320
of making music
and do not touch my piano,

298
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:46,720
although in fact
I love music very much.

299
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:14,840
She is so old
that even the way from the door

300
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:18,360
to my table is difficult for her...

301
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:32,160
Only recently have I succeeded
in getting the servant

302
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:35,960
to carry the platters as far as
the door of the dining room,

303
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:39,160
but the way
from the door to my table

304
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:42,160
belongs to her,
as far as I understand her.

305
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:46,120
My God, that is loyalty!

306
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:57,040
Yes, there is still
loyalty in this world.

307
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:31,920
Don't you like it
at all with us?

308
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:42,560
Come,
I want to make the last attempt.

309
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,600
So far
the new electric wiring

310
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:00,320
has only been
introduced downstairs.

311
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:03,640
We bought this house
only recently.

312
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:06,880
There are already old houses
in America, too.

313
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:10,400
You will sleep here.

314
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:29,000
Well, do you want
to come with me or not?

315
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:30,600
Now I might have fallen out!

316
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,520
A pity
that it didn't happen!

317
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:45,880
It tempts me enormously
to slap you

318
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:48,440
as you are lying there now.

319
00:29:56,920 --> 00:30:00,880
And I naturally won't
content myself with a slap,

320
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:04,600
but will hit to the right and
left until your cheeks swell up.

321
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:08,480
And perhaps
you are a man of honour

322
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:10,040
and you wouldn't want

323
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:13,040
to continue to live
with these slaps.

324
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:17,200
But why
were you so against me?

325
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:19,480
Don't you like me perhaps?

326
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:33,800
Perhaps you'll get the desire
to come see me later.

327
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:36,280
The door to my rooms

328
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,680
is the fourth
counting from this door,

329
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,840
on this side of the corridor.

330
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:50,960
I won't exactly
wait for you,

331
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:53,240
but if you want to come,
then come.

332
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:54,720
Remember

333
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:57,680
that you promised
to play the piano for me.

334
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:00,320
Yes, a lantern
is much more practical.

335
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:02,800
Why is there
such a draft here?

336
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:07,160
There is still
much to build here;

337
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:10,120
especially
near the chapel

338
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:19,640
the draft
is unbearable.

339
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:25,040
If I did not have
my ears full of cotton,

340
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:28,200
I could not endure.

341
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:29,800
Then I must speak louder?

342
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,160
No, you have a clear voice.

343
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:38,480
The chapel
is worth seeing;

344
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:42,760
if it hadn't been for that,
Mr. Mack

345
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:45,280
would not have bought the house.

346
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:50,160
I thought the house
belonged to Mr. Pollunder?

347
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:56,800
Assuredly, but Mr. Mack made
the decision for the purchase.

348
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:59,960
You do not know
Mr. Mack?

349
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:06,400
But what connection does
he have to Mr. Pollunder?

350
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:10,560
He is the fiancé
of the young lady.

351
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:15,600
Does that put you
in such astonishment?

352
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:20,640
When one doesn't
know of such relationships

353
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:23,400
one can make
the biggest mistakes.

354
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:26,920
Apparently
it was thought that you knew,

355
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:31,040
for it is no novelty.

356
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:38,000
If you will,
I shall wait for you here

357
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:41,000
and will then
take you to your room.

358
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,200
I will not return
to my room.

359
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:47,280
But I think that
I will still need your help.

360
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:53,320
So I will wait here.

361
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:56,000
The candle
you can also leave with me.

362
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,760
I am quite distracted.

363
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:11,600
I have a request
which you must not misunderstand.

364
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:15,680
It is naturally
already fulfilled.

365
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,840
I request that you let me -
now in the night -

366
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:19,320
return home.

367
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:22,480
You know that my uncle

368
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:25,400
did not readily give me
permission for this visit.

369
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:34,200
And as long as
my English studies

370
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,800
are not finished and I
have not looked around enough

371
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,400
in practical dealings
I am completely dependent

372
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:41,280
on the goodness of my uncle.

373
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:43,880
You cannot believe
that I could already

374
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:46,000
earn my bread
honestly somewhere

375
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:49,360
- and God preserve me
from all else.

376
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:56,640
That is why, to repair
only halfway

377
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:59,000
the error
I have committed,

378
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:00,800
I must go home immediately.

379
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:04,120
Don't you want to
say something to him?

380
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,840
It is very laudable

381
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:17,920
that he wishes to return to his
uncle, and one could believe

382
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:22,400
that he would thereby give
his uncle a special joy.

383
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:28,560
Unless his disobedience had

384
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:31,880
already made his uncle
too angry...

385
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:36,520
I hear from your words that

386
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:40,000
you, too, think it best
that I return right away.

387
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:42,840
I did not say that at all.

388
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:46,160
Dear Mr. Rossmann,
you will not believe

389
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:50,720
that I would hold you
here against your will.

390
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:57,520
I cannot put the automobile
at your disposal

391
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:01,560
because it is far from here
in a public garage,

392
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,720
since I have not yet
had the time

393
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:08,240
to set up
a personal garage here.

394
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:12,520
The chauffeur does not sleep
here at the house either,

395
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:17,320
but near the garage;
I don't know myself where.

396
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:30,240
But all that
would be no obstacle

397
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:35,360
to your momentary return,
for if you insist,

398
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:39,800
I will accompany you immediately
to the nearest subway station.

399
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:43,560
I had not even thought
of the subway.

400
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:47,200
But you must not
accompany me in any case.

401
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:51,800
Outside is a servant
who will readily accompany me.

402
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:55,080
Now I must only
look for my hat.

403
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:00,760
Could I help you out
with a cap?

404
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:10,440
But I won't
take your cap from you!

405
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:15,160
I can go bareheaded very well.

406
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:19,800
It is not my cap.
Just take it.

407
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:22,200
Then I thank you.

408
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:43,800
It fits so well!

409
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:02,440
Now it is eleven-fifteen.
Before you go

410
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:05,200
you must take leave
of Miss Klara.

411
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:11,400
I have something interesting
to tell you

412
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:17,160
which could be decisive
also for your return.

413
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:22,520
Unfortunately I am bound
by higher orders

414
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:25,720
to betray nothing to you
before midnight.

415
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:30,240
I can finish discussing
my business with Mr. Pollunder

416
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,520
and you can

417
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:42,000
spend a nice while
with Miss Klara.

418
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:48,040
At twelve sharp
you will present yourself here,

419
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:51,520
where you will learn
what is necessary.

420
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:55,880
Conduct this young man
to Miss Klara.

421
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:25,200
No, you must
go to Miss Klara.

422
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:32,160
I would
stay here only a moment.

423
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:37,400
Don't hinder me in
carrying out my charge.

424
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:40,800
Come along, young man.

425
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:44,360
Not everything goes
as one wishes.

426
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:19,240
You will wait for me
right outside this door.

427
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,840
Permit me to take my leave,

428
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:28,520
for at twelve sharp
I must be downstairs.

429
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:31,280
What urgent affairs you have!

430
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:36,080
Couldn't you still
play the piano a little?

431
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:39,040
But isn't it too late by now?

432
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,600
I definitely hope to come again,

433
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:46,440
or you should visit my uncle
some time and at that opportunity

434
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:50,880
look in at my room.
I have a magnificent piano.

435
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:54,520
My uncle gave it to me
and he will soon engage

436
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:57,040
a famous teacher for me
since I can't play at all yet.

437
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:06,240
Perhaps you should play now
anyway. Wait.

438
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:24,720
Pardon me, I have just been
recalled and can no longer wait.

439
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:51,480
Do you want to have music?

440
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:55,480
Thank you, but I can't
even read music properly.

441
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:42,040
There is still someone listening!

442
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:50,680
Until now I knew

443
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:53,320
only your riding talents.

444
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:55,760
I am as bad
at one as the other.

445
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:59,880
If I had known you were listening
I would not have played.

446
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:14,720
You play quite like a beginner,
but it pleased me very much,

447
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:19,520
aside from the fact that
I scorn the playing of no one.

448
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:25,200
But won't you
sit down and stay with us?

449
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:30,360
I thank you.
I cannot stay,

450
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:33,800
as much as
I would like to stay.

451
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:48,480
I promised you something
interesting for midnight

452
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:51,200
and am already here with it.

453
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:58,320
From my uncle!
I expected it.

454
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:05,160
Just read.

455
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:41,040
Are you finished?

456
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:53,160
Have you brought me
the suitcase and umbrella?

457
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:59,480
What kind of strange
suitcase is that?

458
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:02,880
It is my father's
old army suitcase.

459
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:04,760
Besides, it is quite practical.

460
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:07,000
I am also giving you

461
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:11,560
a third class ticket
to San Francisco.

462
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:18,120
I decided on this trip for you

463
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:20,560
because the earning opportunities

464
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:23,880
are much better
for you in the west,

465
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:27,880
and because your uncle has

466
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:30,160
his hands in all the things

467
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:33,080
that could come into
consideration for you here...

468
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:41,800
In Frisco you can
work undisturbed.

469
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:47,000
Start
at the very bottom and try

470
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:50,000
to work your way up gradually.

471
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:59,640
You must explain to me
one thing: on the envelope

472
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:01,760
it only says that
I am to receive it at midnight,

473
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:04,080
wherever I am found.

474
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:09,720
Why did you hold me back then,
on the grounds of this letter,

475
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:13,920
when I wanted to leave
at eleven-fifteen?

476
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:18,160
There you went beyond
your charge.

477
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:33,080
If I had not held you back,
I would have had

478
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:36,640
to deliver the letter to you
at midnight on the highway.

479
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:42,480
That is not quite so.

480
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:46,040
On the envelope it says,
"To be delivered at midnight."

481
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:49,880
If you were too tired, you may
not have been able to follow me,

482
00:46:50,080 --> 00:46:53,640
or I might have already arrived
at my uncle's by midnight,

483
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:56,520
or in the end it might
have been your duty

484
00:46:56,720 --> 00:47:01,520
to bring me back
to my uncle in your automobile,

485
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:04,600
since I desired it so.

486
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:07,600
Doesn't the inscription
say quite distinctly

487
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:11,480
that midnight was
to be my last reprieve?

488
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:15,040
And you are the one who bears
the guilt for my missing it.

489
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:19,840
Would you be so kind
as to show me the way out

490
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:22,400
and then lead me onto the way

491
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:24,360
by which I will come
to the nearest inn?

492
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:28,160
But quickly. You
are giving me no small bother.

493
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:16,920
My name is Karl Rossmann
and I am a German.

494
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:18,240
Please tell me,

495
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:20,640
since we have
a common room,

496
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:23,520
your name and
your nationality also.

497
00:48:24,120 --> 00:48:28,040
I declare as well
that I have no claim to a bed

498
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:32,400
and that I have absolutely
no intention of sleeping.

499
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:35,360
Furthermore, you must not
be put off by my handsome suit.

500
00:48:35,560 --> 00:48:38,280
I am fully poor
and without prospects.

501
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:41,360
That one is called Robinson
and is Irish.

502
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:43,280
My name is Delamarche.

503
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:46,080
I am French
and now demand quiet.

504
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:05,000
Why did you
become a machinist

505
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:06,720
if you now want
to go pan for gold?

506
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:09,400
Why I
became a machinist?

507
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,480
Certainly not
so that my mother's son

508
00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:17,840
should starve at it. There are
fine earnings in the placer mines.

509
00:51:18,040 --> 00:51:19,360
Were once.

510
00:51:19,560 --> 00:51:20,960
Still are.

511
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:26,440
We will be sure to
find jobs in Butterford.

512
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:52,800
You are a German,
aren't you, little one?

513
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:55,720
I have not been
in America long.

514
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:02,080
Bacon, bread and beer.

515
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:05,240
No, thank you,
but for three persons.

516
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:07,720
But that is a meal
for convicts!

517
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:20,480
Do you still have a long march?

518
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:21,800
As far as Butterford.

519
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,080
That is still very far?

520
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:24,280
One more day's journey.

521
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:36,320
Why do you want
to spend the night outdoors?

522
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:40,240
Sleep here in the hotel.

523
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:41,960
I have my baggage outside.

524
00:52:42,120 --> 00:52:44,200
You have only to bring it here.

525
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:45,760
But my comrades!

526
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:50,080
They naturally can
spend the night here, too.

527
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:52,280
For the rest, my comrades

528
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:54,480
are good people,
but they are not clean.

529
00:52:54,680 --> 00:52:56,440
To us really
the worst can come.

530
00:52:56,720 --> 00:52:59,320
I will have
three beds prepared.

531
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:02,840
I cannot bring my comrades along.

532
00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:09,320
Then leave
your comrades outside

533
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:11,520
and come in alone.

534
00:53:11,720 --> 00:53:14,480
I can't do that, I can't do that;
they are my comrades

535
00:53:14,680 --> 00:53:16,000
and I must remain with them.

536
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:23,320
You are headstrong.
One means well by you

537
00:53:23,720 --> 00:53:26,240
and you defend yourself
with all your might.

538
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:29,600
My best thanks
for your kindness.

539
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:30,880
What sum do I owe you?

540
00:53:31,080 --> 00:53:34,080
Pay it when
you return the basket to me.

541
00:53:38,080 --> 00:53:41,880
Good night.
But you are not acting rightly.

542
00:54:11,640 --> 00:54:12,640
Get up!

543
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:14,920
You sleep and in the meantime
thieves have been there.

544
00:54:17,720 --> 00:54:18,800
Is something missing?

545
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:20,880
I don't know,
but the suitcase is open.

546
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:27,840
We were hungry,

547
00:54:28,040 --> 00:54:30,560
thought
that in your suitcase

548
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:33,920
you could have something
to eat, and tickled

549
00:54:34,560 --> 00:54:37,400
the lock
until it opened.

550
00:54:44,200 --> 00:54:46,120
He seems to be moody.

551
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:50,760
I am not moody,

552
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,800
but I will spend
the night at the hotel

553
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:54,480
and am not going to Butterford.

554
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:57,240
Eat quickly,
I have to give back the basket.

555
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:28,040
You see, Robinson,

556
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:32,120
we gave him
our trust,

557
00:55:32,320 --> 00:55:35,280
we dragged him with us
a whole day,

558
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:42,280
and now - because someone
down at the hotel lured him on -

559
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:45,600
he simply takes his leave.

560
00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:50,160
But because he is
a deceitful German

561
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:52,760
he doesn't do this
openly but

562
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:55,520
looks for
the pretext of the suitcase.

563
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:08,440
You have nothing,
and that lowers you

564
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:10,840
in my eyes
not in the least,

565
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:12,600
but you begrudge me

566
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:15,680
my little property and
therefore try to humiliate me.

567
00:56:18,080 --> 00:56:20,520
And now,
after breaking open my suitcase,

568
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:23,120
you haven't a word
to excuse yourselves,

569
00:56:23,320 --> 00:56:26,320
but yet you insult me
and insult my people.

570
00:56:28,600 --> 00:56:34,720
We envy him
his property, he thinks.

571
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:46,640
One day of work in Butterford

572
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:49,920
- to say nothing
of California -

573
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:52,340
and we will have ten times
more than you could have

574
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:55,400
still hidden
in your coat lining.

575
00:56:57,840 --> 00:56:59,520
So, watch your mouth!

576
00:57:09,240 --> 00:57:11,080
You seem as if you'd like
to give me a beating.

577
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:14,480
All patience has an end.

578
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:17,480
You had better be quiet,
Robinson.

579
00:57:18,200 --> 00:57:21,800
Inwardly
you give me the right,

580
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:23,840
but on the outside

581
00:57:24,120 --> 00:57:26,320
you must
hold with Delamarche!

582
00:57:26,520 --> 00:57:28,760
Do you want to
bribe him perhaps?

583
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:31,920
Wouldn't think of it.
I am glad

584
00:57:32,120 --> 00:57:36,240
to leave and want to have
no more to do with either of you.

585
00:57:40,120 --> 00:57:42,600
The Head Cook
says to tell you

586
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:47,160
that she urgently needs
the basket she lent you.

587
00:57:57,320 --> 00:57:59,800
Then the Head Cook
says to ask you

588
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:05,880
if you don't want to spend
the night at the hotel after all.

589
00:58:12,560 --> 00:58:14,520
The night is warm

590
00:58:14,840 --> 00:58:17,960
but it is not without danger
to sleep here on the slope.

591
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:19,360
One often finds snakes.

592
00:58:24,920 --> 00:58:27,240
In this case it is my charge

593
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:32,360
to conduct you to the hotel
and to carry your baggage.

594
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,080
I cannot find
the photograph.

595
00:58:56,680 --> 00:58:57,920
The photograph of my parents.

596
00:58:58,600 --> 00:59:00,920
We have seen
no photograph.

597
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:03,040
There was no photograph
inside, Mr. Rossmann.

598
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:05,640
But that is impossible.
It was lying on top

599
00:59:06,120 --> 00:59:07,200
and now it is gone.

600
00:59:08,560 --> 00:59:10,920
If only you had not
fooled with the suitcase.

601
00:59:11,120 --> 00:59:15,160
All error is out of the question.
There was no photograph.

602
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:23,400
It is irreplaceable.
I will not get another.

603
00:59:26,200 --> 00:59:29,440
It was the only picture
I possessed of my parents.

604
00:59:34,080 --> 00:59:37,520
Perhaps
we could still search

605
00:59:38,760 --> 00:59:40,120
the pockets of these gentlemen?

606
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:43,800
They probably have

607
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,560
torn up the photograph
and thrown away the pieces.

608
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:53,400
I thought they were friends,
but in secret

609
00:59:53,640 --> 00:59:55,560
they only wanted to harm me.

610
01:00:08,920 --> 01:00:12,080
Listen!
If one of you should

611
01:00:12,280 --> 01:00:15,360
still have the photograph
and would bring it to me,

612
01:00:15,560 --> 01:00:18,320
he will get
the whole suitcase full and,

613
01:00:19,360 --> 01:00:21,440
I swear it,
will not be reported.

614
01:00:55,960 --> 01:00:59,120
It is nice
that you have come after all.

615
01:00:59,880 --> 01:01:01,360
And your comrades?

616
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:04,400
We have parted
in discord.

617
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:06,400
Then you are free?

618
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:08,720
Yes, free I am.

619
01:01:11,120 --> 01:01:14,240
Won't you accept
a place here in the hotel

620
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:17,920
instead of rambling
through the world that way?

621
01:01:18,120 --> 01:01:22,240
For example, would you like
to become an elevator boy?

622
01:01:22,440 --> 01:01:24,600
Just say yes
and you are one.

623
01:01:35,040 --> 01:01:37,120
You come into contact
with all the guests,

624
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:40,200
you are always seen, you
are given small charges;

625
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:44,200
in short, every day you have
the possibility of advancement.

626
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,240
I would quite gladly
be an elevator boy.

627
01:01:50,440 --> 01:01:54,120
Isn't a knowledge
of languages required?

628
01:01:54,320 --> 01:01:58,400
You speak German and English.
That suffices fully.

629
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:04,800
English I have only learned
in two months in America.

630
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:08,040
That alone speaks for you enough.
When I think

631
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:11,280
what difficulties
English gave me!

632
01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:16,560
Only yesterday

633
01:02:16,760 --> 01:02:20,560
I was talking about it.
Yesterday was my 50th birthday.

634
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,240
Then I wish you
much luck.

635
01:02:24,160 --> 01:02:26,200
That one can always use.

636
01:02:28,920 --> 01:02:32,600
Come, I will
take you to your room.

637
01:03:15,400 --> 01:03:18,080
A work period
of ten to twelve hours

638
01:03:18,600 --> 01:03:21,480
is a little too much
for such a boy.

639
01:03:22,080 --> 01:03:23,880
He arrived
only six months ago

640
01:03:24,080 --> 01:03:26,360
with his parents.
He is Italian.

641
01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:31,360
But you are a strong
boy, so take courage!

642
01:04:02,120 --> 01:04:05,200
If you had come with
your comrades, I would have

643
01:04:05,360 --> 01:04:09,440
had beds given you
in the servants' dormitory,

644
01:04:09,720 --> 01:04:11,320
but since you are alone

645
01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:14,080
I think that
it will suit you better here...

646
01:04:23,840 --> 01:04:25,480
When you come
to wake me in the morning,

647
01:04:25,680 --> 01:04:27,440
you must come
through the corridor.

648
01:04:27,640 --> 01:04:31,120
There is a guest sleeping here.
He is dead tired.

649
01:04:38,320 --> 01:04:41,520
For several years I have been
sleeping uncommonly badly.

650
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:44,960
Now I can be
satisfied with my position

651
01:04:45,120 --> 01:04:47,600
and need have no more worries.

652
01:04:47,880 --> 01:04:50,840
But it must be the effects
of my earlier worries

653
01:04:51,040 --> 01:04:53,400
that cause me this insomnia.

654
01:04:53,600 --> 01:04:56,680
If I fall asleep at three o'clock
I can be glad.

655
01:04:56,880 --> 01:04:58,080
But since I must be

656
01:04:58,280 --> 01:05:01,120
at my place at half
past five at the latest,

657
01:05:01,320 --> 01:05:04,240
I must have someone wake me,
and with special care,

658
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:07,240
in order not to become
even more nervous.

659
01:05:07,440 --> 01:05:09,720
And so it is Therese
who wakes me.

660
01:05:41,160 --> 01:05:42,600
Do you wish something?

661
01:05:42,840 --> 01:05:44,400
Won't you open the door?

662
01:05:47,320 --> 01:05:49,440
I must get dressed first.

663
01:05:49,600 --> 01:05:52,800
That is not necessary. Open
the door and get into bed.

664
01:05:53,040 --> 01:05:54,720
I will wait a little.

665
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:28,560
Pardon me and
don't betray me, please.

666
01:06:38,360 --> 01:06:39,560
Will you stay here long?

667
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,080
It is not yet wholly
decided, but I think

668
01:06:42,280 --> 01:06:43,280
that I will stay.

669
01:06:43,480 --> 01:06:47,480
That would be very good.
I am so alone here.

670
01:06:48,360 --> 01:06:51,600
The Head Cook
is very kind to you.

671
01:06:55,840 --> 01:06:58,840
You must not believe
that I am ungrateful.

672
01:06:59,400 --> 01:07:01,440
Without the Head Cook

673
01:07:01,800 --> 01:07:03,560
it would
be much worse for me.

674
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:06,160
Earlier, I was a kitchen girl
here at the hotel and already

675
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:08,560
in great danger of being let go

676
01:07:09,120 --> 01:07:12,280
because I could not
perform the heavy work.

677
01:07:21,600 --> 01:07:23,760
But there
I really had luck.

678
01:07:25,520 --> 01:07:27,680
The Head Cook
needed a girl once

679
01:07:27,880 --> 01:07:30,240
to arrange
the serviettes for a banquet.

680
01:07:33,640 --> 01:07:37,160
I was right at hand
and gave her full satisfaction

681
01:07:37,320 --> 01:07:39,880
for I've always
known about preparing serviettes.

682
01:07:40,080 --> 01:07:42,360
And so from there on she has

683
01:07:42,520 --> 01:07:46,640
kept me near her and gradually
trained me as her secretary.

684
01:07:47,560 --> 01:07:49,680
I have learned much at it.

685
01:07:50,080 --> 01:07:51,720
Is there
so much to write?

686
01:07:51,920 --> 01:07:53,000
Oh, very much...

687
01:07:56,520 --> 01:07:59,800
Of course I don't write
continuously, but I also have

688
01:08:00,280 --> 01:08:02,560
many purchases
to make in the city.

689
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:05,480
Is it a large city?

690
01:08:05,680 --> 01:08:06,680
Very large,

691
01:08:08,160 --> 01:08:11,080
I don't go there gladly.
But don't you want to sleep?

692
01:08:11,280 --> 01:08:14,640
No, no, I still don't know
why you came in.

693
01:08:19,480 --> 01:08:21,560
Because I can talk
with no one.

694
01:08:23,840 --> 01:08:26,160
I only wanted to say
that the Head Cook

695
01:08:26,360 --> 01:08:29,640
is kind to me
as only my mother was.

696
01:08:29,880 --> 01:08:32,800
But there is too great
a difference in our position

697
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,800
for me to be able
to talk freely with her.

698
01:08:36,080 --> 01:08:38,920
And it sometimes seems to me that
my present work is more strain

699
01:08:39,120 --> 01:08:40,800
on me than what I did earlier,

700
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:44,520
that I don't even carry it out
as well as what I did earlier,

701
01:08:44,760 --> 01:08:46,160
and that the Head Cook

702
01:08:46,360 --> 01:08:49,120
keeps me in my place
only out of pity.

703
01:08:59,240 --> 01:09:01,240
It is a sin to say it,

704
01:09:02,400 --> 01:09:05,880
but often and often
I am afraid of becoming insane.

705
01:09:14,800 --> 01:09:16,600
For the love of God,

706
01:09:16,800 --> 01:09:19,760
you must not say a word
of this to the Head Cook.

707
01:09:20,160 --> 01:09:22,960
It goes without saying
that I will tell her nothing.

708
01:09:30,560 --> 01:09:32,520
From the moment I saw you

709
01:09:34,680 --> 01:09:38,080
I had trust in you.
And in spite of that

710
01:09:46,840 --> 01:09:48,880
I was afraid
that the Head Cook

711
01:09:49,080 --> 01:09:52,040
could make you secretary
in my place and let me go.

712
01:09:53,080 --> 01:09:55,000
The matter is already in order.

713
01:09:55,200 --> 01:09:58,840
I will be an elevator boy
and you will remain secretary.

714
01:10:08,680 --> 01:10:12,600
These snowstorms in the
long, straight New York streets!

715
01:10:15,960 --> 01:10:19,000
If you walk against the wind

716
01:10:20,760 --> 01:10:22,680
you cannot open your eyes.

717
01:10:22,880 --> 01:10:26,400
Continuously the wind
grinds the snow on your face.

718
01:10:27,720 --> 01:10:31,760
You run but you don't go forward.
It is something desperate.

719
01:10:32,720 --> 01:10:39,200
Mother had already been
two days without work.

720
01:10:44,480 --> 01:10:47,280
The day was passed
in the open and in

721
01:10:47,480 --> 01:10:51,080
our bundles we dragged
unusable rags around with us.

722
01:10:55,360 --> 01:10:57,960
For the following morning
she had been given

723
01:10:58,840 --> 01:11:03,320
the prospect of work on a
building site, but she feared

724
01:11:04,080 --> 01:11:09,200
being unable to make use
of the favourable opportunity,

725
01:11:10,280 --> 01:11:12,760
for already that morning, to the
fright of passers-by, she had

726
01:11:12,960 --> 01:11:15,280
coughed a lot of blood,
and her only desire was

727
01:11:17,480 --> 01:11:22,280
to get into the warm somewhere
and rest herself.

728
01:11:24,720 --> 01:11:29,200
And just on that evening it was
impossible to find a place.

729
01:11:34,560 --> 01:11:37,480
Certainly we would have been able,
late in the night

730
01:11:38,760 --> 01:11:42,760
when no one insisted
on his rights any more,

731
01:11:43,040 --> 01:11:47,280
to find a way into
one of the public dormitories

732
01:11:47,480 --> 01:11:49,680
rented by entrepreneurs,

733
01:11:50,160 --> 01:11:53,080
but I did not understand it
and Mother no longer wanted rest.

734
01:11:53,880 --> 01:11:56,840
In the morning, the beginning
of a beautiful winter's day,

735
01:11:58,720 --> 01:12:01,040
we were leaning
against the wall of a house,

736
01:12:01,640 --> 01:12:03,520
and there perhaps we had
slept a little,

737
01:12:03,720 --> 01:12:05,920
or perhaps, with eyes open,
only stared around us.

738
01:12:06,600 --> 01:12:09,880
We continued through
the streets coming to life,

739
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:12,680
passed over a bridge,

740
01:12:13,520 --> 01:12:16,080
and finally arrived at
the building site where Mother

741
01:12:16,280 --> 01:12:18,480
had been summoned
for that morning.

742
01:12:24,680 --> 01:12:29,120
I sat on a pile of bricks
and watched her

743
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,920
take a multi-coloured rag
and wrap it around the scarf

744
01:12:35,120 --> 01:12:37,640
that she had worn
on her head all night.

745
01:12:44,680 --> 01:12:46,720
Without reporting
at the building hut

746
01:12:55,960 --> 01:12:58,000
she climbed up a ladder

747
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:03,360
as if she already knew
what work had been assigned her.

748
01:13:05,600 --> 01:13:08,480
I was astonished,
for the female labourers

749
01:13:08,680 --> 01:13:12,080
are usually occupied
with simple work below.

750
01:13:12,280 --> 01:13:14,160
That made me think
that she wanted to carry out

751
01:13:14,360 --> 01:13:17,920
better paid work,
and I smiled sleepily up at her...

752
01:13:43,240 --> 01:13:47,720
Above she went
ably around the masons

753
01:13:48,080 --> 01:13:50,920
who were laying brick upon brick
and incomprehensibly

754
01:13:51,120 --> 01:13:53,120
demanded no
explanation of her.

755
01:13:55,400 --> 01:13:57,880
She held on cautiously
to a wooden partition

756
01:13:58,080 --> 01:13:59,760
that served as a railing.

757
01:14:05,040 --> 01:14:07,080
But now she came
to a small pile of bricks

758
01:14:07,280 --> 01:14:09,120
in front of which the railing

759
01:14:10,480 --> 01:14:13,400
and probably also
the walkway ended.

760
01:14:16,560 --> 01:14:19,960
She took no notice of that, went
right onto the pile of bricks.

761
01:14:21,560 --> 01:14:24,040
Her ability
appeared to have abandoned her.

762
01:14:24,200 --> 01:14:27,640
She knocked over the pile
of bricks and fell over it

763
01:14:28,600 --> 01:14:32,280
into the depths. Many bricks
rolled after her

764
01:14:36,480 --> 01:14:41,000
and a long while later
a heavy plank came loose

765
01:14:44,240 --> 01:14:46,480
and crashed down on her.

766
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:51,040
Now people
ran together from all sides

767
01:14:51,280 --> 01:14:54,760
and from the building above
a man furiously

768
01:14:55,640 --> 01:14:58,080
shouted something
downwards.

769
01:15:19,200 --> 01:15:23,240
Good evening, Mr. Rossmann,
it's me, Robinson.

770
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:25,440
But you have changed!

771
01:15:25,680 --> 01:15:27,040
Yes, it's going well for me.

772
01:15:27,240 --> 01:15:28,240
But you drink.

773
01:15:28,320 --> 01:15:31,520
It is only to fortify myself
when I am on the road.

774
01:15:40,720 --> 01:15:42,040
I no longer want
to better you.

775
01:15:42,240 --> 01:15:45,520
Rossmann, won't you
come visit us once?

776
01:15:45,840 --> 01:15:50,840
We live with Brunelda,
a splendid singer.

777
01:15:51,760 --> 01:15:55,400
Are you inviting me,
or Delamarche?

778
01:15:57,680 --> 01:16:01,760
I and Delamarche.
In that we are agreed.

779
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:06,040
Then I say to you and ask you
to communicate to Delamarche:

780
01:16:06,360 --> 01:16:12,160
Our parting
was final.

781
01:16:13,440 --> 01:16:16,480
You two
have done me more hurt

782
01:16:16,920 --> 01:16:18,040
than anyone.

783
01:16:18,440 --> 01:16:21,400
But we are
your comrades.

784
01:16:21,800 --> 01:16:25,320
And you have
such a fine position here.

785
01:16:26,400 --> 01:16:28,280
Could you
let me have some money?

786
01:16:28,880 --> 01:16:30,840
You have received from Delamarche

787
01:16:31,320 --> 01:16:33,600
the charge
of bringing back money.

788
01:16:34,480 --> 01:16:38,680
I will give you money
but only on the condition

789
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:41,640
that you leave immediately
and never again

790
01:16:41,840 --> 01:16:43,640
visit me here.

791
01:16:48,440 --> 01:16:52,200
Do you want money
on this condition? Yes or no?

792
01:16:52,880 --> 01:16:57,280
Rossmann,
I feel very sick.

793
01:17:00,840 --> 01:17:04,400
I will not be able to leave.
I will die here.

794
01:17:09,600 --> 01:17:11,800
When I sit like this
I can still bear it,

795
01:17:12,320 --> 01:17:14,560
but I cannot stand up.

796
01:17:15,200 --> 01:17:18,600
Robinson, if you want
me to take care of you,

797
01:17:18,920 --> 01:17:21,040
then make an effort.

798
01:17:32,720 --> 01:17:35,160
You are really a good boy.

799
01:17:38,240 --> 01:17:41,040
I will do
everything you consider right...

800
01:17:41,240 --> 01:17:44,640
You must please
replace me here a while.

801
01:19:13,520 --> 01:19:17,080
Why did you leave?
Why didn't you report it?

802
01:19:19,240 --> 01:19:22,160
But I did tell him
that he had to replace me.

803
01:19:23,760 --> 01:19:27,680
Don't you know
that one must report

804
01:19:28,240 --> 01:19:30,560
even the shortest absence
in the office of the Head Waiter?

805
01:19:34,280 --> 01:19:37,200
Well, just then
the Head Waiter passes by,

806
01:19:37,400 --> 01:19:42,320
asks me where you're hiding.
I have no idea -

807
01:19:42,520 --> 01:19:48,200
you didn't tell me where you went -
so he telephones the dormitory

808
01:19:48,400 --> 01:19:51,560
that another boy
should come right away.

809
01:19:52,400 --> 01:19:56,960
I said that you
asked me to replace you,

810
01:19:57,440 --> 01:20:00,880
but apparently you
do not know him yet.

811
01:20:01,160 --> 01:20:06,160
I am to tell you that you should
go to the office right away.

812
01:20:12,880 --> 01:20:16,720
It is the first time
I have abandoned my post.

813
01:20:17,360 --> 01:20:20,760
That is always so,
only no one believes it.

814
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:27,000
By no means say

815
01:20:27,280 --> 01:20:30,840
that you suddenly felt sick.
He will laugh in your face.

816
01:20:31,360 --> 01:20:34,840
It is better to say
that a guest gave you

817
01:20:35,040 --> 01:20:38,120
an urgent message
for another guest

818
01:20:38,480 --> 01:20:43,080
and that you no longer know
who the first guest was

819
01:20:43,560 --> 01:20:46,720
and could not
find the second.

820
01:20:54,600 --> 01:20:57,360
You have abandoned
your post without permission.

821
01:20:57,560 --> 01:21:01,360
Do you know what that means?
That means dismissal.

822
01:21:02,120 --> 01:21:04,440
Did you perhaps feel sick?

823
01:21:08,760 --> 01:21:11,400
I did not know that one must
ask for permission.

824
01:21:13,680 --> 01:21:15,560
I know the paragraph.

825
01:21:15,720 --> 01:21:18,680
I received and closely read
the regulations.

826
01:21:19,200 --> 01:21:22,240
But precisely such a
disposition one never uses -

827
01:21:22,440 --> 01:21:23,480
one forgets it.

828
01:21:24,520 --> 01:21:26,720
I have never
abandoned my post.

829
01:21:26,920 --> 01:21:29,360
For that you will
abandon it now.

830
01:21:29,560 --> 01:21:32,720
Besides, I also know you.

831
01:21:33,360 --> 01:21:38,840
You are the only boy who
on principle doesn't salute me.

832
01:21:48,720 --> 01:21:51,120
Mr. Head Porter, sir,
I salute you most certainly.

833
01:21:51,320 --> 01:21:54,120
I have saluted you
every day several times.

834
01:21:54,320 --> 01:21:56,960
But naturally not
every time I have seen you,

835
01:21:57,200 --> 01:22:00,680
since I pass by you
a hundred times a day.

836
01:22:01,880 --> 01:22:07,760
You are to salute me
each time without exception.

837
01:22:08,240 --> 01:22:14,560
You are to address me always
as "Head Porter" and not "you."

838
01:22:15,560 --> 01:22:18,720
And all that
each time and each time.

839
01:22:24,280 --> 01:22:28,880
In your next situation you will
know how to salute the porter,

840
01:22:29,080 --> 01:22:33,800
even if it is
perhaps in some miserable hole.

841
01:22:55,760 --> 01:22:59,320
This is Head Waiter Isbary.
Good morning.

842
01:22:59,720 --> 01:23:02,880
I have not
waked you after all!

843
01:23:08,520 --> 01:23:11,080
Yes, yes,
but I am sincerely sorry

844
01:23:11,280 --> 01:23:12,600
to have startled you.

845
01:23:16,360 --> 01:23:19,920
No, truly
I have no excuse,

846
01:23:20,200 --> 01:23:22,640
particularly in view of
the insignificance of the matter

847
01:23:22,840 --> 01:23:24,160
about which I am speaking to you.

848
01:23:32,680 --> 01:23:35,040
She must have run to the
telephone in her nightdress.

849
01:23:35,240 --> 01:23:36,880
I really did wake her.

850
01:23:43,800 --> 01:23:47,400
There is here
an elevator boy by the name of -

851
01:23:48,560 --> 01:23:50,160
by the name of Karl Rossmann.

852
01:23:54,920 --> 01:23:57,960
Unfortunately he has
repaid your kindness badly.

853
01:23:58,120 --> 01:24:01,080
He has abandoned
his post without permission

854
01:24:01,280 --> 01:24:04,560
and I have therefore this moment
dismissed him.

855
01:24:05,280 --> 01:24:08,480
I hope you do not take
the matter tragically.

856
01:24:15,640 --> 01:24:19,160
No, there I really
cannot yield to you.

857
01:24:19,320 --> 01:24:22,960
It concerns my authority.
There is much at stake.

858
01:24:23,200 --> 01:24:25,960
Such a boy
will spoil the whole band for me.

859
01:24:31,960 --> 01:24:33,120
No, no.

860
01:24:33,320 --> 01:24:37,240
He will not be transferred
to other work, he is completely

861
01:24:37,440 --> 01:24:39,160
unusable.

862
01:24:44,760 --> 01:24:47,840
For the rest, other grievances
run against him as well.

863
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,520
The Head Porter, for example -
yes, Feodor -

864
01:24:50,760 --> 01:24:54,960
complains of the impoliteness
and insolence of this boy.

865
01:24:55,240 --> 01:24:56,880
What, that should not suffice?

866
01:24:57,080 --> 01:24:58,800
My dear madam,

867
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:02,440
you renounce your character
because of this boy.

868
01:25:06,440 --> 01:25:10,280
Every night free of service
he runs into the city.

869
01:25:13,680 --> 01:25:16,760
To speak frankly
I would not have believed

870
01:25:17,040 --> 01:25:20,440
you were such a poor
judge of character.

871
01:25:20,880 --> 01:25:25,200
I have this moment learned
something about your young angel

872
01:25:25,520 --> 01:25:29,520
that will fundamentally
change your opinion.

873
01:25:34,400 --> 01:25:35,920
Well, this fine boy

874
01:25:36,120 --> 01:25:38,280
whom you call
a model of decency

875
01:25:38,480 --> 01:25:40,640
does not let one night
free of service pass

876
01:25:40,880 --> 01:25:44,840
without running into the city
and not returning before morning.

877
01:25:46,840 --> 01:25:49,760
Yes, yes,
it is proven by witnesses,

878
01:25:50,040 --> 01:25:52,080
irrefutable witnesses.

879
01:25:53,240 --> 01:25:56,560
Can you now
tell me where he gets the money

880
01:25:56,760 --> 01:25:58,680
for these enjoyments?

881
01:25:59,440 --> 01:26:03,640
And how he can preserve
his attentiveness to his service?

882
01:26:10,480 --> 01:26:12,040
But, Mr. Head Waiter,

883
01:26:12,240 --> 01:26:14,480
every night free of service
I am in the dormitory.

884
01:26:14,680 --> 01:26:16,760
All the boys
can testify to that.

885
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:20,080
When I am not sleeping I study
commercial correspondence.

886
01:26:24,960 --> 01:26:27,960
The Head Porter
evidently is confusing me

887
01:26:28,160 --> 01:26:30,280
with someone else,
and now I understand also

888
01:26:30,480 --> 01:26:32,200
why he believes
I do not salute him.

889
01:26:32,680 --> 01:26:34,000
You will be silent at once!

890
01:26:36,160 --> 01:26:38,200
Then I can no longer
be Head Porter

891
01:26:38,400 --> 01:26:39,720
if I confuse people.

892
01:26:43,680 --> 01:26:45,000
Leave it, Feodor!

893
01:26:51,480 --> 01:26:53,840
He would like perhaps
before his departure

894
01:26:54,040 --> 01:26:59,520
to occasion some grand inquest
on his nocturnal occupations.

895
01:26:59,880 --> 01:27:02,360
Let us
rather not do that.

896
01:27:02,560 --> 01:27:04,680
The Head Cook,
this good woman,

897
01:27:04,880 --> 01:27:07,360
he has already duped her
and that should be enough.

898
01:27:19,400 --> 01:27:21,440
That's unheard of!
I'll come at once.

899
01:27:21,800 --> 01:27:26,120
Keep this fellow a little;
we will have more to say to him.

900
01:27:29,960 --> 01:27:33,600
Do I not
confuse him now?

901
01:27:33,800 --> 01:27:35,760
Mr. Head Porter,
please,

902
01:27:35,960 --> 01:27:38,040
let him free at once.
You are hurting him.

903
01:27:46,760 --> 01:27:49,600
What pleasure can it
give you to torture him?

904
01:27:49,800 --> 01:27:52,600
Orders,
little miss, orders.

905
01:27:53,440 --> 01:27:56,520
Please, Therese,
don't stay here; go upstairs.

906
01:27:56,760 --> 01:27:59,280
I will come take leave of you.

907
01:27:59,640 --> 01:28:01,800
But Rossmann,
what are you thinking of?

908
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:03,760
You will stay with us...

909
01:28:05,800 --> 01:28:10,000
Let him loose;
he is no murderer!

910
01:28:23,360 --> 01:28:28,320
Above all I want to tell you
that I still have complete trust

911
01:28:28,520 --> 01:28:34,400
in you. The Head Waiter also
is a just man.

912
01:28:39,480 --> 01:28:43,720
Forget therefore what
has been said to you until now.

913
01:28:44,320 --> 01:28:47,480
Above all, what the Head Porter
perhaps has said to you.

914
01:28:50,400 --> 01:28:53,480
He is indeed
an irritable man,

915
01:28:53,680 --> 01:28:55,920
which in view of his service
is no wonder,

916
01:28:56,120 --> 01:28:59,280
but he also has a wife
and children and knows that a boy

917
01:28:59,480 --> 01:29:03,920
with only himself to depend on
must not be tormented needlessly,

918
01:29:04,240 --> 01:29:08,320
but that the rest of the world
will furnish enough of that.

919
01:29:09,160 --> 01:29:12,320
I say this in order that
you answer without inhibition,

920
01:29:12,800 --> 01:29:18,480
which you probably
would have done in any case.

921
01:29:19,640 --> 01:29:24,520
The cause of your protégé
becomes continually worse.

922
01:29:26,560 --> 01:29:30,960
In a bed
in the boys' dormitory was found

923
01:29:31,280 --> 01:29:34,520
a man heavily drunk
and totally unknown.

924
01:29:35,360 --> 01:29:37,960
Naturally he was waked
and was to be removed.

925
01:29:38,320 --> 01:29:42,040
But this man
began to shout over and over

926
01:29:42,360 --> 01:29:45,880
that the dormitory
belonged to Karl Rossmann,

927
01:29:46,480 --> 01:29:48,080
whose guest he was,

928
01:29:49,920 --> 01:29:53,320
and who would punish
whoever dared to touch him.

929
01:29:54,040 --> 01:29:58,480
Besides, he said he also
had to wait for Karl Rossmann

930
01:29:58,960 --> 01:30:01,760
because this one
had promised him money and

931
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:04,080
had only gone to get it.

932
01:30:04,640 --> 01:30:07,240
Pay attention,
please, to this:

933
01:30:07,560 --> 01:30:11,760
had promised him money
and had gone to get it.

934
01:30:12,600 --> 01:30:14,960
You can also
pay attention, Rossmann:

935
01:30:15,920 --> 01:30:18,880
The man said further
that you two,

936
01:30:19,120 --> 01:30:20,640
after your return,

937
01:30:20,840 --> 01:30:25,040
would make a nocturnal visit
to some singer.

938
01:30:25,320 --> 01:30:27,880
And the boys
being what they are,

939
01:30:28,600 --> 01:30:30,680
at first they laughed at the man,

940
01:30:31,160 --> 01:30:33,320
then they
began a dispute with him,

941
01:30:33,520 --> 01:30:35,480
and he was simply knocked out.

942
01:30:46,640 --> 01:30:49,680
It is true that I brought
the man into the dormitory.

943
01:30:54,520 --> 01:30:57,920
He came here to pay me a visit,
but was so drunk

944
01:30:58,160 --> 01:31:00,200
that he could not
go away again alone.

945
01:31:00,400 --> 01:31:04,400
One must help
the brother in drunkenness.

946
01:31:04,760 --> 01:31:06,560
Guilty
I am, then.

947
01:31:06,880 --> 01:31:09,160
I am guilty
only in that

948
01:31:09,400 --> 01:31:10,760
I brought the man

949
01:31:10,960 --> 01:31:13,040
- his name is Robinson:
he's an Irishman -

950
01:31:13,240 --> 01:31:18,160
into the dormitory.
All that he said otherwise,

951
01:31:18,520 --> 01:31:21,080
he said out of drunkenness
and it is not correct.

952
01:31:23,840 --> 01:31:26,240
You promised him
no money, then?

953
01:31:27,120 --> 01:31:29,000
Yes, because he asked me for it.

954
01:31:29,200 --> 01:31:32,360
But I did not want
to go get it,

955
01:31:32,560 --> 01:31:37,680
but to give him the tips
I had earned tonight.

956
01:31:40,120 --> 01:31:41,720
You are going
further and further astray.

957
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:45,360
First you brought the man
- I don't even believe

958
01:31:45,560 --> 01:31:48,880
the name Robinson;
since there has been an Ireland

959
01:31:49,080 --> 01:31:50,600
no Irishman
has been called that -

960
01:31:50,840 --> 01:31:54,600
so first you only
brought him into the dormitory.

961
01:31:57,560 --> 01:32:00,080
Then,
when one asks you by surprise,

962
01:32:00,280 --> 01:32:02,200
you did promise him money.

963
01:32:02,800 --> 01:32:05,120
And first you didn't want
to go get the money,

964
01:32:05,320 --> 01:32:07,560
but give him
your tips from today.

965
01:32:07,760 --> 01:32:11,080
But then it is demonstrated
that you still have this money,

966
01:32:11,360 --> 01:32:12,480
so obviously

967
01:32:12,680 --> 01:32:15,160
you did want
to go get other money.

968
01:32:15,360 --> 01:32:18,160
In the end
that would be nothing peculiar,

969
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:25,080
but that you deny it,
that is something peculiar.

970
01:32:25,400 --> 01:32:27,600
Also that you want
to keep quiet

971
01:32:27,880 --> 01:32:31,600
that you made
the man drunk here in the hotel,

972
01:32:31,800 --> 01:32:33,840
of which there is
not the least doubt,

973
01:32:34,200 --> 01:32:37,960
for you yourself admitted
that he came alone but

974
01:32:38,160 --> 01:32:41,000
could not go away alone,
and he himself

975
01:32:41,440 --> 01:32:44,760
shouted in the dormitory
that he is your guest.

976
01:32:45,880 --> 01:32:49,520
In question then
remain only two things:

977
01:32:50,160 --> 01:32:54,320
how did you gain access to
the storerooms

978
01:32:55,440 --> 01:33:01,000
and how did you gather together
money that you could give away?

979
01:33:07,840 --> 01:33:11,760
Tell me, Therese,
have I in your opinion

980
01:33:12,120 --> 01:33:14,480
failed to do
something for him?

981
01:33:18,480 --> 01:33:21,280
Madam Head Cook,
I do not believe that I have done

982
01:33:21,480 --> 01:33:27,320
you disgrace in any way
and after an exact inquest,

983
01:33:27,520 --> 01:33:29,640
all others
would have to find it so also.

984
01:33:36,160 --> 01:33:38,360
No, Karl, no, no!

985
01:33:40,560 --> 01:33:44,240
Things that are just
also have a particular look,

986
01:33:44,960 --> 01:33:49,240
and your cause,
I must admit, does not.

987
01:34:01,560 --> 01:34:05,760
How could you, Karl,
hide all these things from me?

988
01:34:06,680 --> 01:34:10,560
If the common dormitory
was perhaps unbearable for you

989
01:34:10,760 --> 01:34:13,600
and you at first began
on these innocent grounds

990
01:34:13,800 --> 01:34:16,160
with your nocturnal caprices,

991
01:34:16,800 --> 01:34:19,240
why did you
not say a word to me?

992
01:34:19,920 --> 01:34:22,800
You know I wanted
to procure your own room for you.

993
01:34:23,400 --> 01:34:24,680
You must now

994
01:34:24,880 --> 01:34:28,280
leave the hotel,
and as quickly as possible,

995
01:34:28,480 --> 01:34:32,320
otherwise an inquest perhaps
would be unavoidable.

996
01:34:32,680 --> 01:34:35,160
Go directly
to the Pension Brenner.

997
01:34:35,320 --> 01:34:39,320
On my recommendation
they will take you in for nothing.

998
01:34:46,040 --> 01:34:47,840
Tomorrow
I will come to Brenner's and

999
01:34:48,040 --> 01:34:50,720
we will see what we can
further do for you.

1000
01:34:50,920 --> 01:34:53,120
I will not abandon you.

1001
01:34:58,040 --> 01:35:02,000
Aren't you glad at all that
everything turned out so well?

1002
01:35:04,280 --> 01:35:07,000
Rossmann, the man
is writhing in the entrance

1003
01:35:07,200 --> 01:35:10,920
and will not
let himself be removed.

1004
01:35:13,440 --> 01:35:16,360
He struggles
and claims that you would never

1005
01:35:16,560 --> 01:35:19,000
tolerate
his going to the hospital.

1006
01:35:19,440 --> 01:35:22,640
Someone is to take an automobile
and send him home.

1007
01:35:22,840 --> 01:35:25,640
You would pay for the automobile.
Will you?

1008
01:35:25,880 --> 01:35:28,280
The man has trust in you.

1009
01:35:28,880 --> 01:35:31,040
I am also to ask you
if you want to go with him.

1010
01:35:31,240 --> 01:35:34,400
He will not go with him.

1011
01:35:35,040 --> 01:35:37,280
So, Rossmann,
you are dismissed on the spot.

1012
01:35:37,480 --> 01:35:40,440
The grounds for your dismissal
I cannot

1013
01:35:40,640 --> 01:35:43,080
pronounce aloud,
otherwise I would have to

1014
01:35:43,280 --> 01:35:46,320
have you locked up.
Now go,

1015
01:35:46,520 --> 01:35:51,320
change, turn in your livery
and leave the premises at once.

1016
01:36:02,920 --> 01:36:05,480
Leave me, I want nothing
more to do with you.

1017
01:36:08,240 --> 01:36:09,240
I can scream.

1018
01:36:09,400 --> 01:36:11,200
And I can stop your mouth.

1019
01:36:15,040 --> 01:36:20,000
I am indeed convinced
that I will find nothing,

1020
01:36:20,200 --> 01:36:23,600
but you must be searched.

1021
01:36:27,400 --> 01:36:29,240
But now it is enough.

1022
01:36:42,280 --> 01:36:45,960
Rossmann, why do you
let me wait so long?

1023
01:36:51,680 --> 01:36:53,160
I wish

1024
01:36:53,360 --> 01:36:56,440
that you had seen
how I bled from the nose.

1025
01:36:56,640 --> 01:36:59,000
My vest
is completely ruined;

1026
01:36:59,160 --> 01:37:01,000
besides, I left it there.

1027
01:37:01,240 --> 01:37:03,720
My trousers are in shreds;
I am in underdrawers.

1028
01:37:03,920 --> 01:37:05,480
What will become of me?

1029
01:37:18,840 --> 01:37:20,560
Do you really live here?

1030
01:37:22,200 --> 01:37:23,440
Then I can go.

1031
01:37:23,600 --> 01:37:24,880
In shirtsleeves?

1032
01:37:25,200 --> 01:37:27,600
I will be sure to
earn another jacket.

1033
01:37:27,840 --> 01:37:30,000
You must
give him something more.

1034
01:37:30,200 --> 01:37:32,080
I had to wait for you
so long there.

1035
01:37:33,640 --> 01:37:36,080
I can only
look to you.

1036
01:37:36,240 --> 01:37:39,480
From this sick man
I can demand nothing.

1037
01:37:40,360 --> 01:37:46,040
Yes, if only
I had something more.

1038
01:37:59,640 --> 01:38:01,720
Robinson is a little sick,

1039
01:38:02,360 --> 01:38:05,440
but he will be able
to climb the stairs.

1040
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:09,000
The driver here
still wants a supplement

1041
01:38:09,200 --> 01:38:11,080
to the fare,
which I already paid.

1042
01:38:11,280 --> 01:38:12,960
And now I am going.

1043
01:38:15,040 --> 01:38:16,360
I say you stay!

1044
01:38:21,200 --> 01:38:22,200
What is your name?

1045
01:38:23,120 --> 01:38:25,840
Rossmann.
Show your identification papers.

1046
01:38:28,200 --> 01:38:30,040
So you have
no identification papers.

1047
01:38:30,240 --> 01:38:30,960
Not with me.

1048
01:38:31,160 --> 01:38:32,160
That is serious.

1049
01:38:34,080 --> 01:38:35,120
I was an elevator boy.

1050
01:38:35,320 --> 01:38:37,480
You were
an elevator boy,

1051
01:38:37,680 --> 01:38:40,040
so you are one no longer.
And from what do you live now?

1052
01:38:40,240 --> 01:38:42,000
Now I will
look for other work.

1053
01:38:42,200 --> 01:38:45,000
Yes, were you dismissed, then?

1054
01:38:45,200 --> 01:38:46,840
Yes, an hour ago.

1055
01:38:48,320 --> 01:38:50,920
And without a jacket
you were dismissed?

1056
01:38:52,760 --> 01:38:55,080
In what
hotel were you employed?

1057
01:38:55,240 --> 01:38:57,720
He was employed
at the Hotel Occidental.

1058
01:38:57,920 --> 01:39:00,760
No, it is not true.

1059
01:39:02,200 --> 01:39:03,600
You know the boy?

1060
01:39:04,320 --> 01:39:09,160
I have done him
much good in his time,

1061
01:39:10,080 --> 01:39:12,480
but he has
thanked me very badly.

1062
01:39:12,720 --> 01:39:15,080
He seems to be an obdurate boy.

1063
01:39:16,840 --> 01:39:19,880
But that is
still not his worst quality.

1064
01:39:20,600 --> 01:39:22,640
Yes, that is one fine shark.

1065
01:39:23,040 --> 01:39:26,840
We dragged him with us,
explained everything to him,

1066
01:39:31,200 --> 01:39:33,880
thought, in spite of all
the signs that spoke against it,

1067
01:39:34,080 --> 01:39:36,240
to still make of him
a usable human being.

1068
01:39:36,840 --> 01:39:40,080
Then he disappeared
once in the night,

1069
01:39:40,440 --> 01:39:45,200
under accompanying circumstances
I prefer not to utter.

1070
01:39:49,840 --> 01:39:52,840
In any case
I will take him along

1071
01:39:53,680 --> 01:39:56,040
and have him given back
to the Hotel Occidental.

1072
01:39:56,240 --> 01:39:58,640
May I venture to request
that you provisorily leave me

1073
01:39:58,840 --> 01:40:02,000
the boy. I have some
things to put in order with him.

1074
01:40:02,200 --> 01:40:06,680
I will take it upon myself
to conduct him back to the hotel.

1075
01:40:08,240 --> 01:40:09,760
I cannot do that.

1076
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:13,640
I must learn why
he was suddenly dismissed.

1077
01:40:13,840 --> 01:40:15,680
But he is not at all dismissed!

1078
01:40:15,880 --> 01:40:18,800
On the contrary,
he has a good post there.

1079
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:20,440
He is always
in with the Head Waiter,

1080
01:40:20,600 --> 01:40:23,600
with the Head Cook,
and is a trusted person.

1081
01:40:27,560 --> 01:40:29,560
How can he be dismissed?

1082
01:40:29,760 --> 01:40:32,960
I was gravely injured in the
hotel and he received the charge

1083
01:40:33,160 --> 01:40:35,280
to get me home
and since he was without a jacket

1084
01:40:35,480 --> 01:40:37,080
he just came with me
without a jacket.

1085
01:40:42,840 --> 01:40:46,240
But is that also true?
And if it is true,

1086
01:40:46,440 --> 01:40:49,160
why does the boy pretend
to be dismissed?

1087
01:40:49,680 --> 01:40:50,680
Stop him!

1088
01:42:01,760 --> 01:42:02,760
Is she asleep?

1089
01:42:02,840 --> 01:42:06,360
I believe not, but I
preferred to wait until you came.

1090
01:42:18,080 --> 01:42:20,800
She is sitting on the sofa,
but perhaps she is asleep.

1091
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:22,280
Is she ill?

1092
01:42:23,680 --> 01:42:25,240
He does not know her.

1093
01:42:27,160 --> 01:42:29,600
Yes, can we come in?

1094
01:42:39,560 --> 01:42:42,000
What heat, Delamarche!

1095
01:42:42,320 --> 01:42:45,440
Should I perhaps
have the curtain raised?

1096
01:42:46,440 --> 01:42:50,240
Anything but that.
Then it becomes still worse.

1097
01:42:50,800 --> 01:42:57,040
Wait, I will make it
a little comfortable for you.

1098
01:43:00,760 --> 01:43:05,680
Who is that? Why
does he stare at me so?

1099
01:43:06,880 --> 01:43:10,600
It is only the boy
I brought for your service.

1100
01:43:10,760 --> 01:43:13,840
But I want
to have no one.

1101
01:43:21,760 --> 01:43:25,360
But all the time you wish
for someone at your service.

1102
01:43:26,120 --> 01:43:33,240
Oh, Delamarche,
you do not understand me.

1103
01:43:36,520 --> 01:43:39,520
I really don't understand you.

1104
01:43:39,760 --> 01:43:42,400
But nothing has happened.

1105
01:43:42,600 --> 01:43:44,920
If you will,
he shall go away this instant.

1106
01:43:45,160 --> 01:43:48,520
If he is already here,
he shall stay.

1107
01:43:48,880 --> 01:43:52,360
I thank you for wanting
to leave me here yet a little.

1108
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:57,160
I am frightfully tired. I don't
at all rightly know where I am.

1109
01:43:57,520 --> 01:43:59,680
But when I have slept
a few hours,

1110
01:44:02,720 --> 01:44:05,040
you can send me away
without taking any regard.

1111
01:44:05,240 --> 01:44:10,080
You can stay here.
Room

1112
01:44:10,640 --> 01:44:14,920
we have
in overabundance, as you see.

1113
01:44:15,440 --> 01:44:17,840
So you must go.

1114
01:44:18,040 --> 01:44:20,840
No, he shall stay.

1115
01:44:22,440 --> 01:44:24,520
Delamarche, I cannot endure

1116
01:44:24,720 --> 01:44:27,800
the heat.
I am burning;

1117
01:44:28,720 --> 01:44:32,160
I must undress;
I must bathe.

1118
01:44:32,320 --> 01:44:34,680
Send the two
out of the room.

1119
01:44:36,200 --> 01:44:40,600
They are a burden to me;
they weigh upon my breast;

1120
01:44:41,880 --> 01:44:45,520
if I succumb
it is because of them.

1121
01:44:46,480 --> 01:44:48,840
You must both
go out on the balcony.

1122
01:45:33,560 --> 01:45:37,440
I am wholly pushed aside.
That so amuses Brunelda.

1123
01:45:37,640 --> 01:45:40,120
Once she wants to comb her hair,

1124
01:45:40,320 --> 01:45:41,880
once
she wants to open her corset,

1125
01:45:42,080 --> 01:45:43,400
once she wants to put it on,

1126
01:45:43,600 --> 01:45:45,720
and always
I am sent onto the balcony.

1127
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:55,880
Earlier I often
pulled the curtain a little

1128
01:45:56,080 --> 01:45:57,120
and looked,

1129
01:45:57,320 --> 01:45:59,760
but since one time
Delamarche

1130
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:05,920
hit me in the face
with the whip several times,

1131
01:46:06,120 --> 01:46:08,840
I don't dare look any more.
And so I lie

1132
01:46:09,040 --> 01:46:12,240
here on the balcony and have
no pleasure besides eating.

1133
01:46:13,760 --> 01:46:16,920
Why do you stay here then,
if they treat you so?

1134
01:46:17,120 --> 01:46:20,280
Pardon, Rossmann, that is not
a very judicious question.

1135
01:46:20,560 --> 01:46:25,080
You will stay here also, even
if you are treated still worse.

1136
01:46:25,760 --> 01:46:29,680
No, I will go,
and yet this evening if possible.

1137
01:46:31,680 --> 01:46:35,760
And how will you arrange
to go this evening

1138
01:46:36,400 --> 01:46:39,320
when you don't even have
the right to enter the room?

1139
01:46:45,120 --> 01:46:47,040
As long as there
has been no bell,

1140
01:46:47,240 --> 01:46:49,240
we do not have
the right to enter.

1141
01:46:49,440 --> 01:46:51,320
Earlier
I had the right to ask

1142
01:46:51,520 --> 01:46:53,400
if I could enter yet,
and I would be answered

1143
01:46:53,600 --> 01:46:56,400
yes or no
according to circumstances,

1144
01:46:56,600 --> 01:47:00,520
but then I apparently
made too much use of this,

1145
01:47:03,200 --> 01:47:07,560
and so it was decided
that when I can enter

1146
01:47:07,760 --> 01:47:09,600
the table bell is pressed.

1147
01:47:10,160 --> 01:47:14,880
So, there has been

1148
01:47:15,160 --> 01:47:16,680
no bell yet today,

1149
01:47:16,880 --> 01:47:18,440
and once it doesn't ring
for so long,

1150
01:47:18,640 --> 01:47:20,180
then it can still last
a very long time.

1151
01:47:20,240 --> 01:47:23,360
Yes, but what applies to you

1152
01:47:24,080 --> 01:47:27,360
still need not
apply to me.

1153
01:47:28,360 --> 01:47:31,200
Besides,
such a thing only applies

1154
01:47:31,560 --> 01:47:33,240
to the one
who lets it.

1155
01:47:33,440 --> 01:47:35,480
Is that a life?

1156
01:47:35,680 --> 01:47:39,600
Wouldn't it be better
in Butterford?

1157
01:47:39,800 --> 01:47:41,800
Or even in California
where you have friends?

1158
01:47:58,040 --> 01:48:00,960
When you
so vilely deserted us,

1159
01:48:01,160 --> 01:48:03,240
it went very badly for us.
We could find

1160
01:48:03,440 --> 01:48:06,000
no work
in the first days.

1161
01:48:06,200 --> 01:48:08,680
Besides, Delamarche
wanted no work.

1162
01:48:14,760 --> 01:48:16,040
Then he said

1163
01:48:16,240 --> 01:48:18,800
we should go
beg in the dwellings.

1164
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:22,400
So we went begging,

1165
01:48:22,600 --> 01:48:26,200
and in order that it
would look better,

1166
01:48:26,440 --> 01:48:28,240
I sang in front of
the doors of the dwellings.

1167
01:48:28,360 --> 01:48:30,320
And as Delamarche
always has good luck,

1168
01:48:30,520 --> 01:48:32,560
once while we were standing
in front of a dwelling,

1169
01:48:32,760 --> 01:48:34,800
a very rich dwelling,
on the ground floor,

1170
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:35,760
and at the door

1171
01:48:35,960 --> 01:48:38,360
were singing something
to the cook and the servant,

1172
01:48:38,560 --> 01:48:40,340
there comes the lady to whom
this dwelling belongs,

1173
01:48:40,400 --> 01:48:42,000
even Brunelda,
up the stairs.

1174
01:48:42,200 --> 01:48:44,600
She was perhaps laced
too tightly and could not come up

1175
01:48:44,800 --> 01:48:48,840
the few steps.
But how beautiful she looked!

1176
01:48:53,840 --> 01:48:57,240
Naturally the maid
and the servant ran

1177
01:48:57,440 --> 01:48:59,640
to meet her
and almost carried her up.

1178
01:49:04,360 --> 01:49:06,240
She stayed immobile a little

1179
01:49:06,480 --> 01:49:08,200
because she still
didn't have enough breath,

1180
01:49:08,320 --> 01:49:10,880
and I don't know
how it happened -

1181
01:49:11,080 --> 01:49:12,240
because of hunger

1182
01:49:12,440 --> 01:49:13,460
I was not
wholly in my right mind,

1183
01:49:13,520 --> 01:49:15,440
and nearby she was
even more beautiful -

1184
01:49:15,640 --> 01:49:17,880
in short,
I touched her a little

1185
01:49:18,080 --> 01:49:20,320
behind,
but very lightly, you know,

1186
01:49:20,520 --> 01:49:21,520
only touched, like that.

1187
01:49:22,280 --> 01:49:25,640
Naturally
one cannot tolerate that a beggar

1188
01:49:25,840 --> 01:49:27,560
touches a rich lady.

1189
01:49:34,040 --> 01:49:37,840
Who knows how badly that would
have turned out if Delamarche

1190
01:49:38,040 --> 01:49:39,640
had not at once
given me a slap,

1191
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:41,760
and such a slap

1192
01:49:41,920 --> 01:49:45,760
that I at once needed
both my hands for my cheeks.

1193
01:49:50,160 --> 01:49:53,800
Didn't you say
that Brunelda is a singer?

1194
01:49:58,600 --> 01:50:01,560
But we did not yet
know that then.

1195
01:50:01,760 --> 01:50:03,240
We only saw
that it was

1196
01:50:03,440 --> 01:50:06,200
a rich
and very distinguished lady.

1197
01:50:07,240 --> 01:50:10,160
She acted
as if nothing had happened.

1198
01:50:10,640 --> 01:50:13,080
Without cease
she contemplated Delamarche,

1199
01:50:13,840 --> 01:50:19,880
who in return
looked straight into her eyes.

1200
01:50:20,800 --> 01:50:24,560
Thereupon she said to him:
"Come in a little while,"

1201
01:50:24,760 --> 01:50:27,640
and with her parasol pointed
inside the dwelling.

1202
01:50:34,400 --> 01:50:37,520
They forgot me outside and
I sat down on the steps

1203
01:50:37,840 --> 01:50:39,720
to wait for Delamarche.

1204
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:42,240
But instead of Delamarche
the servant

1205
01:50:42,440 --> 01:50:45,600
came out and brought me
a whole tureen of soup.

1206
01:50:48,480 --> 01:50:49,480
The servant stayed

1207
01:50:49,560 --> 01:50:52,280
with me a little while
as I ate and recounted to me

1208
01:50:52,480 --> 01:50:54,480
things about Brunelda.

1209
01:50:54,680 --> 01:50:56,360
She was a divorced woman.

1210
01:50:56,560 --> 01:50:59,520
Her husband, a cocoa manufacturer,
indeed still loved her,

1211
01:50:59,720 --> 01:51:03,320
but she did not want
to hear of him in the least.

1212
01:51:07,720 --> 01:51:10,480
The servant did not dare,
despite the largest tip,

1213
01:51:10,640 --> 01:51:13,520
ask Brunelda
if she would receive him,

1214
01:51:13,800 --> 01:51:15,560
for he had already
asked several times

1215
01:51:15,760 --> 01:51:16,840
and always Brunelda had

1216
01:51:17,400 --> 01:51:20,320
thrown in his face
whatever she had at hand.

1217
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:23,360
What has the man
done to her?

1218
01:51:26,440 --> 01:51:31,720
Nothing in particular, I believe;
at least he himself doesn't know.

1219
01:51:36,040 --> 01:51:38,680
He waits for me daily
there on the street corner.

1220
01:51:38,920 --> 01:51:41,400
When I come, I have
to recount novelties to him.

1221
01:51:41,600 --> 01:51:42,720
If I cannot come,

1222
01:51:42,920 --> 01:51:45,800
he waits half an hour
and then goes away again.

1223
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:49,760
It was for me
a good supplementary revenue,

1224
01:51:50,640 --> 01:51:52,680
but since
Delamarche learned of it,

1225
01:51:53,000 --> 01:51:56,640
I must deliver everything to him,
and so I go more seldom.

1226
01:51:57,760 --> 01:52:00,080
But what does
the man want to have?

1227
01:52:01,760 --> 01:52:05,120
He hears
that she does not want him.

1228
01:52:07,520 --> 01:52:10,040
What does it matter to me?
I only know

1229
01:52:10,240 --> 01:52:12,080
he would give much money

1230
01:52:12,280 --> 01:52:16,200
to be able to lie here
on the balcony like us.

1231
01:52:44,400 --> 01:52:49,840
Tomorrow a judge
will be elected in our district,

1232
01:52:51,400 --> 01:52:54,680
and the one they are carrying
down there is a candidate.

1233
01:53:01,400 --> 01:53:04,840
Don't you want to
look through the glasses?

1234
01:53:05,040 --> 01:53:06,480
I see enough.

1235
01:53:06,680 --> 01:53:09,600
Try it anyway,
you will see better.

1236
01:53:09,880 --> 01:53:12,080
I have good eyes;
I see everything.

1237
01:53:13,400 --> 01:53:14,800
I don't see anything.

1238
01:53:27,960 --> 01:53:30,640
No, no, no!
Please, let me go.

1239
01:53:33,080 --> 01:53:37,000
Leave him, he will stay.

1240
01:53:37,880 --> 01:53:40,440
Be glad
you are not thrown out.

1241
01:53:42,040 --> 01:53:45,400
An escaped thief
is not thrown out,

1242
01:53:45,720 --> 01:53:48,920
he is delivered to the police.
And that can happen to him

1243
01:53:49,120 --> 01:53:51,640
as early as tomorrow morning,
if he does not keep quiet.

1244
01:53:51,840 --> 01:53:55,880
Now you have seen enough.
Go into the room,

1245
01:53:56,560 --> 01:53:59,520
make the beds, and prepare
everything for the night.

1246
01:55:34,600 --> 01:55:38,040
Your way of staring at me
disturbs me horribly.

1247
01:55:38,280 --> 01:55:39,360
Do you want
something of me?

1248
01:55:39,560 --> 01:55:40,600
You are studying?

1249
01:55:44,240 --> 01:55:46,120
First,
you have already disturbed me.

1250
01:55:46,320 --> 01:55:47,560
But second,

1251
01:55:47,760 --> 01:55:50,080
I always make a pause
at three o'clock.

1252
01:55:54,640 --> 01:55:57,880
Who are you?
How do you come

1253
01:55:58,080 --> 01:56:01,120
to these people? I hate them
all three.

1254
01:56:01,880 --> 01:56:04,640
That is quite simple.
Delamarche wants

1255
01:56:04,840 --> 01:56:06,960
me to become his servant.

1256
01:56:07,240 --> 01:56:08,480
But I don't want to.

1257
01:56:21,120 --> 01:56:23,400
Do you have another situation?

1258
01:56:23,600 --> 01:56:25,680
No, but that is nothing to me,

1259
01:56:25,880 --> 01:56:28,120
if only
I were away from here.

1260
01:56:29,040 --> 01:56:31,440
Why don't you want to
stay with these people?

1261
01:56:31,600 --> 01:56:33,600
Delamarche is a bad man.

1262
01:56:34,560 --> 01:56:36,680
If all servants
in choosing their masters

1263
01:56:36,880 --> 01:56:39,120
wanted to be as
difficult as you?

1264
01:56:40,040 --> 01:56:44,280
During the day I am a salesman
in Montly's department store.

1265
01:56:45,280 --> 01:56:48,120
This Montly
is doubtless a scoundrel

1266
01:56:48,320 --> 01:56:50,480
but that leaves me at rest.

1267
01:56:50,680 --> 01:56:53,200
I am only furious
at being so miserably paid.

1268
01:56:53,360 --> 01:56:56,240
By day you are a salesman
and you study in the night?

1269
01:57:02,720 --> 01:57:04,440
But when do you sleep?

1270
01:57:07,080 --> 01:57:13,080
Yes, sleep! I will sleep
when I have finished my studies.

1271
01:57:14,400 --> 01:57:16,680
Provisorily
I drink black coffee.

1272
01:57:21,760 --> 01:57:23,800
I don't like black coffee.

1273
01:57:31,280 --> 01:57:34,640
Without the black coffee
Montly would not keep me

1274
01:57:35,120 --> 01:57:39,080
an instant, for believe me,
I would soon lie

1275
01:57:39,400 --> 01:57:41,400
behind the counter
and sleep.

1276
01:57:44,040 --> 01:57:48,920
I always say Montly,
although he naturally has not

1277
01:57:49,120 --> 01:57:50,880
the slightest idea
that I am in the world.

1278
01:57:54,360 --> 01:57:55,600
I wanted to study also.

1279
01:57:59,840 --> 01:58:02,280
For years
I myself have

1280
01:58:02,480 --> 01:58:05,960
actually only been studying
out of consistency.

1281
01:58:06,640 --> 01:58:09,040
I have little satisfaction
from it

1282
01:58:09,200 --> 01:58:11,600
and still less
prospects for the future.

1283
01:58:13,400 --> 01:58:15,120
Could I not
perhaps also

1284
01:58:15,320 --> 01:58:18,040
obtain a place
in the department store?

1285
01:58:24,080 --> 01:58:26,760
Having obtained my post
at Montly's has been until now

1286
01:58:26,920 --> 01:58:29,760
the greatest success
of my life.

1287
01:58:33,640 --> 01:58:35,360
Ah, what are you thinking!

1288
01:58:35,560 --> 01:58:38,000
It is easier
to become a district judge here

1289
01:58:38,200 --> 01:58:40,400
than a door opener at Montly's.

1290
01:58:41,560 --> 01:58:45,800
You saw this evening
the demonstration below?

1291
01:58:46,320 --> 01:58:48,120
I understand
nothing of politics.

1292
01:58:48,520 --> 01:58:52,040
That is a fault.
But aside from that

1293
01:58:52,640 --> 01:58:55,080
you do have
eyes and ears.

1294
01:58:57,120 --> 01:59:00,240
Come to us one evening,

1295
01:59:00,400 --> 01:59:03,320
naturally only
if you would like.

1296
01:59:19,000 --> 01:59:22,120
You advise me then
to stay with Delamarche?

1297
01:59:22,360 --> 01:59:23,480
Absolutely.

1298
01:59:55,360 --> 01:59:57,720
On the racecourse
in Clayton,

1299
01:59:57,880 --> 02:00:01,360
today from six o'clock a.m.
to midnight, personnel

1300
02:00:01,520 --> 02:00:04,080
will be recruited
for the Theatre of Oklahoma!

1301
02:00:04,240 --> 02:00:06,800
The Great Theater of Oklahoma
calls you!

1302
02:00:10,080 --> 02:00:11,920
Who now misses the opportunity,

1303
02:00:12,120 --> 02:00:13,400
misses it forever.

1304
02:00:16,320 --> 02:00:17,840
Everyone is welcome!

1305
02:00:18,040 --> 02:00:20,480
Whoever wishes to become
an artist should report!

1306
02:00:20,680 --> 02:00:21,920
We are the theater

1307
02:00:22,120 --> 02:00:24,600
that can use everyone,
everyone in his place!

1308
02:00:24,800 --> 02:00:27,800
But hurry
to be received before midnight!

1309
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:30,800
At midnight all will be closed
and opened no more.

1310
02:00:31,000 --> 02:00:33,240
Accursed be
who does not believe us!

1311
02:00:33,440 --> 02:00:35,800
On to Clayton!

1312
02:01:00,400 --> 02:01:02,480
You were without a situation?

1313
02:01:04,280 --> 02:01:09,360
Where were you employed
at the last? At the last!

1314
02:01:09,880 --> 02:01:11,400
In an office.

1315
02:01:11,720 --> 02:01:14,280
Where you satisfied there?

1316
02:01:16,360 --> 02:01:20,480
To what post
do you feel yourself apt?

1317
02:01:21,240 --> 02:01:24,120
I read the placard in the city
and since it said there

1318
02:01:24,520 --> 02:01:27,840
that everyone could be used,
I reported.

1319
02:01:28,040 --> 02:01:33,200
What did you originally
want to study? In Europe, I mean.

1320
02:01:33,520 --> 02:01:35,360
I wanted to become an engineer.

1321
02:01:37,240 --> 02:01:39,240
An engineer
you cannot become

1322
02:01:39,640 --> 02:01:43,840
right away. But perhaps
provisorily it would be

1323
02:01:44,040 --> 02:01:48,040
suitable to you to perform
some minor technical work.

1324
02:02:03,760 --> 02:02:08,600
So we are finished, then.
In Oklahoma everything

1325
02:02:08,840 --> 02:02:13,480
will yet be reexamined.
Do our recruiting troupe

1326
02:02:14,480 --> 02:02:16,080
honour!

1327
02:06:43,200 --> 02:06:46,760
