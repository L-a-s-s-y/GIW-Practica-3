3
00:03:21,125 --> 00:03:22,374
Go over there.

4
00:03:29,625 --> 00:03:31,332
It's beautiful!
Come on!

5
00:03:52,041 --> 00:03:53,415
Giorgio!

6
00:03:54,958 --> 00:03:58,749
Help...Help!

7
00:04:06,791 --> 00:04:09,707
Help! Somebody's drowning!

8
00:04:26,458 --> 00:04:28,332
Where's Romolo?

9
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,040
He went to City Hall.

10
00:04:30,208 --> 00:04:32,582
To hell with City Hall!

11
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:36,707
It's a woman.

12
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,040
There she is!

13
00:04:39,208 --> 00:04:41,707
Tino's not here either?

14
00:04:41,875 --> 00:04:43,790
Is she trying to drown herself?

15
00:04:43,958 --> 00:04:46,249
There she is.
Go in after her.

16
00:04:46,416 --> 00:04:50,124
Jump! If she gets to the sewer
she won't come up again.

17
00:04:52,541 --> 00:04:54,624
A woman's drowning!

18
00:04:55,416 --> 00:04:58,624
You guys head her off.
I'll go in after her.

19
00:05:17,833 --> 00:05:19,290
Pascello!

20
00:05:19,458 --> 00:05:20,624
Run! Come over here!

21
00:05:20,791 --> 00:05:23,082
What are you doing? Not like that!

22
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:24,415
Turn her upside down.

23
00:05:24,583 --> 00:05:26,624
Stefano, hurry up!

24
00:05:27,833 --> 00:05:29,207
Where'd you fish her out?

25
00:05:29,375 --> 00:05:31,957
Careful.
Hold her under the stomach.

26
00:05:32,125 --> 00:05:33,040
She was drowning!

27
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:35,957
She probably slipped.
Mario saw her.

28
00:05:36,125 --> 00:05:37,832
She must have slipped
and fell in.

29
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,957
- Did she jump off the bridge?
- No.

30
00:05:40,125 --> 00:05:41,832
- Did she go under?
- 3 times.

31
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,207
- At least 7 times!
- 10 times!

32
00:05:44,375 --> 00:05:48,374
She must have swallowed a lot.
We'll need some help. Stefano!

33
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:52,165
- What happened?
- Hurry!

34
00:05:55,458 --> 00:05:57,749
- Faster with the arms!
- She lost a shoe.

35
00:06:00,291 --> 00:06:01,957
I think she's dead.

36
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:09,832
Get the water out,
before it's too late.

37
00:06:12,666 --> 00:06:14,832
Look how it's rushing out.
Move it, kids!

38
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,457
We saved her!

39
00:06:16,625 --> 00:06:18,124
Beat it!

40
00:06:18,583 --> 00:06:21,415
Let's get Pompeo.
He never seen anyone drown before.

41
00:06:21,583 --> 00:06:22,249
Look.

42
00:06:22,416 --> 00:06:24,749
I don't wanna look.
I'm afraid.

43
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:31,749
Looks dead to me.

44
00:06:32,083 --> 00:06:34,457
Corpses don't throw up water.

45
00:06:34,625 --> 00:06:35,874
She opened her eyes!

46
00:06:37,541 --> 00:06:39,707
She opened her eyes!
Put her down.

47
00:06:39,875 --> 00:06:41,707
We'll give her
artificial respiration.

48
00:06:41,875 --> 00:06:43,165
She's bleeding.

49
00:06:43,333 --> 00:06:45,290
It's just a scratch.

50
00:06:48,583 --> 00:06:49,874
What she needs is brandy.

51
00:06:50,041 --> 00:06:52,124
Brandy nothing!
What she needs is milk.

52
00:06:56,583 --> 00:07:00,457
Quiet! She's coming to. You, with
the motorbike, go get some milk.

53
00:07:00,625 --> 00:07:02,290
I'm outta gas.

54
00:07:02,958 --> 00:07:04,874
Take it easy now.

55
00:07:05,041 --> 00:07:08,957
You're all right.
You can thank the Holy Father.

56
00:07:09,416 --> 00:07:10,582
You're fine.

57
00:07:11,666 --> 00:07:13,957
- Where's Giorgio?
- Which Giorgio?

58
00:07:17,958 --> 00:07:19,582
Where are you going?

59
00:07:24,875 --> 00:07:26,415
Who's she looking for?

60
00:07:32,916 --> 00:07:34,707
- Wasn't she alone?
- Yes.

61
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:40,540
Who does he think he is?

62
00:07:40,916 --> 00:07:42,290
Take it easy. Come here.

63
00:07:42,458 --> 00:07:43,832
I'm going home!

64
00:07:44,791 --> 00:07:45,874
Where's my shoes?

65
00:07:46,041 --> 00:07:48,290
Here. There's only one.

66
00:07:50,583 --> 00:07:53,540
She's got 7 souls...like a cat!

67
00:07:54,166 --> 00:07:55,790
See? She can hardly stand up.

68
00:07:55,958 --> 00:07:57,915
Poor thing. She's in bad shape.

69
00:07:58,083 --> 00:08:00,249
You were almost dead.

70
00:08:00,416 --> 00:08:01,540
Leave me alone!

71
00:08:01,708 --> 00:08:02,749
Let go of me!

72
00:08:04,208 --> 00:08:06,082
Hey! We're the ones
who saved you!

73
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:08,415
Fine. You saved me...

74
00:08:09,291 --> 00:08:10,749
Now I wanna go home, O.K.?

75
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,957
O.K. Suit yourself.
Go home. Goodbye.

76
00:08:17,458 --> 00:08:18,624
Hi, Cabiria.

77
00:08:18,875 --> 00:08:19,999
You know her?

78
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:21,124
Sure. She's Cabiria.

79
00:08:21,833 --> 00:08:22,790
Where's she live?

80
00:08:22,958 --> 00:08:27,165
On Via Cecilia, near the gas
station. She lives the life...

81
00:08:53,083 --> 00:08:55,290
Giorgio! Open up! It's me!

82
00:08:57,666 --> 00:08:59,457
It's me! Cabiria!

83
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:21,999
Wanda!

84
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:26,707
Wanda! Have you seen Giorgio?

85
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:29,249
What happened to you?

86
00:09:29,625 --> 00:09:31,665
Mind your own business.
Did you see Giorgio?

87
00:09:31,833 --> 00:09:34,290
- Which Giorgio?
- My Giorgio.

88
00:09:36,833 --> 00:09:38,582
What happened to you?

89
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:44,790
What do you want from me?

90
00:09:45,833 --> 00:09:46,665
What do you want?

91
00:09:46,916 --> 00:09:50,165
I don't want nothing.
You mind your own ass!

92
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:10,165
Go inside and dry yourself off.

93
00:10:10,333 --> 00:10:11,874
I don't have the keys.

94
00:10:12,583 --> 00:10:13,749
Where'd you put them?

95
00:10:13,916 --> 00:10:15,290
In my purse.

96
00:10:18,125 --> 00:10:20,207
Where's your purse?

97
00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:22,040
Giorgio's got it.

98
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:27,915
We took a walk by the river and...

99
00:10:28,083 --> 00:10:29,790
...I fell in.

100
00:10:30,333 --> 00:10:32,707
He got scared and ran away.

101
00:10:35,541 --> 00:10:37,790
Cabiria! Open up!

102
00:10:40,041 --> 00:10:41,624
Come on, open up.

103
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:43,540
I gotta sleep!

104
00:10:48,875 --> 00:10:51,540
Tell me something, Cabiria.

105
00:10:51,791 --> 00:10:55,165
How much did you have
in your purse? Answer me.

106
00:11:15,333 --> 00:11:18,124
If you see Giorgio, I'm right here.

107
00:11:38,791 --> 00:11:41,249
What are you doing?

108
00:11:41,416 --> 00:11:43,332
You're right to stay home.

109
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,707
Go to bed
and get some sleep.

110
00:11:45,875 --> 00:11:48,249
I'll see you later
when I get back.

111
00:11:51,333 --> 00:11:53,082
Why didn't you take your aspirin?

112
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:54,832
Take it, it'll do you good.

113
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,332
You still here?

114
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,332
Aren't you tired of yakkin'?

115
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,415
Can't you see I had enough?

116
00:12:00,583 --> 00:12:05,249
Get lost! Who told you
we were friends?

117
00:12:05,416 --> 00:12:07,374
Get lost, will you?

118
00:12:09,208 --> 00:12:12,290
And don't come borrowing
my thermometer anymore!

119
00:12:12,416 --> 00:12:15,374
Who's asking you for anything?

120
00:12:15,541 --> 00:12:17,082
What a nut!

121
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:18,290
You're a sweetheart!

122
00:12:28,666 --> 00:12:31,499
Someone would throw you in the
river for 40,000 lire?

123
00:12:31,666 --> 00:12:34,332
Drown you for 40,000 lire?

124
00:12:34,666 --> 00:12:37,665
Nowadays they'll do it for 5,000.

125
00:12:37,833 --> 00:12:39,082
Someone who loves you?

126
00:12:39,791 --> 00:12:42,707
What love?
You met him a month ago!

127
00:12:42,875 --> 00:12:45,124
You don't know his name
or where he lives.

128
00:12:45,291 --> 00:12:48,040
Can't you understand?
He pushed you in!

129
00:12:48,208 --> 00:12:50,707
He pushed you in the river!

130
00:12:51,333 --> 00:12:53,582
And you were lucky, because me

131
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:56,624
I'd have held your head
under myself! You nut!

132
00:12:57,333 --> 00:12:58,915
Tell the cops!

133
00:12:59,083 --> 00:13:01,165
I'm no stool pigeon.

134
00:13:01,916 --> 00:13:03,374
Take my advice!

135
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:04,374
Report him!

136
00:13:07,166 --> 00:13:09,457
But why? Why'd he do it?

137
00:13:09,625 --> 00:13:11,124
I gave him everything.

138
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:13,499
I gave him everything he wanted.

139
00:13:13,666 --> 00:13:15,624
He didn't have to do it.

140
00:13:24,208 --> 00:13:25,957
I'm such a moron.

141
00:13:55,208 --> 00:13:56,874
What if I died?

142
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,999
That's it! The party's over!

143
00:14:25,166 --> 00:14:27,665
We're through! Finished!

144
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:30,999
Silk shirts!
I'll give you silk shirts!

145
00:14:31,166 --> 00:14:33,957
Find anotherjerk like me!

146
00:14:34,166 --> 00:14:36,707
Look what I bought him!

147
00:14:36,875 --> 00:14:38,332
Checked suit!

148
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,749
Camel-hair coat!

149
00:14:39,916 --> 00:14:42,582
Never again! Never!

150
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:46,290
And who's gonna feed you now?

151
00:14:46,458 --> 00:14:47,624
St. Peter?

152
00:14:47,791 --> 00:14:49,374
Eternal love!

153
00:14:49,541 --> 00:14:51,499
You dirty vitellone!

154
00:14:51,666 --> 00:14:54,457
Go back to selling balloons!

155
00:14:57,875 --> 00:14:59,874
I'll burn it all!

156
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:02,582
Chicken soup, veal chops...

157
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,457
You should drop dead!

158
00:15:24,125 --> 00:15:25,665
This is the last time!

159
00:15:25,833 --> 00:15:27,999
You'll never see me here again.

160
00:15:28,166 --> 00:15:29,082
This is my last evening.

161
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:31,582
I shouldn't even
be seen with you!

162
00:15:32,708 --> 00:15:35,790
Look how classy I am.

163
00:15:35,958 --> 00:15:38,832
You look like Moby Dick to me.

164
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,290
How dare you!

165
00:15:41,166 --> 00:15:42,749
Know where you belong?

166
00:15:42,916 --> 00:15:45,374
In the nuthouse!

167
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,499
Use your eyes!

168
00:15:47,666 --> 00:15:49,499
Take a good look at me!

169
00:15:49,666 --> 00:15:53,415
Look at me. A grande dame.

170
00:15:55,833 --> 00:15:58,624
She gets worse all the time.

171
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:01,499
They oughta put her away.

172
00:16:01,666 --> 00:16:03,415
That's how you'll end up!

173
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:05,124
And that's the heater...

174
00:16:05,291 --> 00:16:07,582
- This car's got everything.
- Even Coca- Cola.

175
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:10,165
- Gimme a ride?
- This ain't no tank!

176
00:16:10,333 --> 00:16:12,290
- Get out!
- I'm not getting out.

177
00:16:12,458 --> 00:16:13,707
Come on, move!

178
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:18,332
- Why should I?
- I'm taking Wanda for a ride.

179
00:16:18,458 --> 00:16:20,374
You don't know how to drive.

180
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,374
It's my car.
I do what I want.

181
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:23,249
Get out.

182
00:16:23,416 --> 00:16:25,290
I'll visit you in the hospital.

183
00:16:25,458 --> 00:16:26,874
This I gotta see.

184
00:16:27,041 --> 00:16:28,540
Why not the bigger model?

185
00:16:28,708 --> 00:16:30,999
Another one!
What do you know about cars?

186
00:16:31,166 --> 00:16:33,165
You're always in the bushes!

187
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:37,124
You're always on two wheels!

188
00:16:42,833 --> 00:16:45,249
Here comes the psycho again.

189
00:16:46,291 --> 00:16:47,665
- 'Bye, handsome.
- 'Bye, sweetie.

190
00:16:47,833 --> 00:16:50,665
Remember to come see
your princess.

191
00:16:55,708 --> 00:16:58,415
Cute! Real fancy!

192
00:16:58,583 --> 00:17:00,915
Me, I'd have picked a grey one.

193
00:17:01,083 --> 00:17:02,332
It's a fancier color.

194
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:03,999
But this one's cute.

195
00:17:04,125 --> 00:17:05,874
You're gonna kill the battery!

196
00:17:06,041 --> 00:17:08,874
Wanda, get out.
I don't want to argue tonight.

197
00:17:09,041 --> 00:17:11,207
Neither do I, you fanatic.

198
00:17:11,666 --> 00:17:14,165
Still, a Fiat is a Fiat.

199
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:16,457
With a car,
life's a lot different.

200
00:17:16,625 --> 00:17:18,582
You sit up there, high up,

201
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:21,040
and you signal right, left...

202
00:17:24,041 --> 00:17:27,832
People think you're well off...
a secretary, a daddy's girl...

203
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,290
The men all chase you.

204
00:17:30,458 --> 00:17:31,707
It feels great!

205
00:17:31,875 --> 00:17:33,832
- Listen to her!
- What?

206
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,832
I know how she got that car!

207
00:17:37,625 --> 00:17:38,915
That cokehead!

208
00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:40,207
Wait!

209
00:17:40,375 --> 00:17:41,207
Stay right here!

210
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:44,290
- Let me get out!
- Stay!

211
00:17:52,166 --> 00:17:53,707
Dance, Cabiria!

212
00:17:53,875 --> 00:17:55,207
You're in luck!

213
00:17:55,375 --> 00:17:57,499
I'm the best dancer in Rome.

214
00:17:57,791 --> 00:17:59,207
Come on!

215
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:07,832
Now she found another
deadbeat to say "I love you".

216
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,165
One who'll send her off begging.

217
00:18:11,333 --> 00:18:15,040
Get off the street, dear,
or I'll have you arrested.

218
00:18:19,375 --> 00:18:21,457
Here I am, gentlemen!

219
00:18:21,625 --> 00:18:23,124
Here I am!

220
00:18:23,458 --> 00:18:24,582
Just as well.

221
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:26,332
Who needs you?

222
00:18:27,041 --> 00:18:31,540
Where you going with the car?
To the old-age home?

223
00:18:31,666 --> 00:18:34,457
Maybe if you were 20 years
younger!

224
00:18:34,583 --> 00:18:36,290
Filthy flea bag!

225
00:18:36,416 --> 00:18:38,874
You're justjealous!

226
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:41,290
Hear that, Cabiria?

227
00:18:41,458 --> 00:18:44,165
She can't get away with that!

228
00:18:44,333 --> 00:18:47,124
Look how you'll end up,
you lousy whore!

229
00:18:47,791 --> 00:18:49,749
"Please...be kind...

230
00:18:49,916 --> 00:18:52,582
Have a heart!"

231
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:56,332
"Please, for my Giorgio's sake!"

232
00:18:58,583 --> 00:19:00,624
Do it! Poke her eyes out!

233
00:19:00,791 --> 00:19:02,374
Wanda, here we go again.

234
00:19:11,916 --> 00:19:13,082
Forza, Cabiria!

235
00:19:14,041 --> 00:19:15,999
Never mind her!

236
00:19:16,791 --> 00:19:19,290
Hit her low, in the belly!

237
00:19:20,333 --> 00:19:21,915
Don't stop them!

238
00:19:22,083 --> 00:19:23,665
It's too much fun!

239
00:19:23,791 --> 00:19:25,832
Stop it before the cops come!

240
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:30,290
I'll kill her!

241
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,999
Let go of me!

242
00:19:36,833 --> 00:19:38,457
Get her in the car.

243
00:19:40,166 --> 00:19:41,957
Get her away!

244
00:19:42,083 --> 00:19:44,999
- Leave me alone!
- Get inside!

245
00:19:45,166 --> 00:19:46,457
I'll punch you a new face!

246
00:19:50,375 --> 00:19:53,040
It's not over yet!

247
00:19:57,458 --> 00:19:59,082
She ruined my face!

248
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:00,915
Forget about her.

249
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:10,124
You're scared of me, right?

250
00:20:10,625 --> 00:20:12,707
You lousy loser!

251
00:20:17,041 --> 00:20:18,915
Have a smoke.

252
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:22,790
Where you wanna go?

253
00:20:23,208 --> 00:20:24,165
To Via Veneto.

254
00:20:24,333 --> 00:20:24,999
Via Veneto?

255
00:20:25,166 --> 00:20:27,374
Think you're the Empress Poppea?

256
00:20:28,833 --> 00:20:30,707
Cabiria, you and me oughta

257
00:20:30,875 --> 00:20:33,749
have a talk one of these days.

258
00:20:33,916 --> 00:20:35,624
You're not doing it right.

259
00:20:35,791 --> 00:20:37,582
Who's watching over you?

260
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,124
Look at Marisa and me.

261
00:20:40,291 --> 00:20:42,332
She's safe wherever she goes.

262
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,790
Nobody in Rome would harm her.

263
00:20:44,958 --> 00:20:47,582
You know why? Tell me.

264
00:20:48,083 --> 00:20:49,832
Let me out.

265
00:20:52,541 --> 00:20:55,207
What do you expect
to do here?

266
00:20:55,375 --> 00:20:58,457
Girls fight for spots
on Via Veneto and Villa Borghese.

267
00:20:58,625 --> 00:21:02,874
Cabiria, why not find yourself
a serious man like me?

268
00:21:03,791 --> 00:21:04,790
I don't need one.

269
00:21:04,958 --> 00:21:07,582
- I say you do.
- I say I don't!

270
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:12,040
Why should I slave
for filthy pigs like you?

271
00:21:12,208 --> 00:21:13,124
Let's drop it.

272
00:21:13,291 --> 00:21:15,915
Yeah, drop it.
Better let me out.

273
00:21:16,083 --> 00:21:17,707
Yeah, it's better.

274
00:21:25,416 --> 00:21:27,040
So long!

275
00:22:19,916 --> 00:22:24,624
Degenerate! Go take a walk
on the Passeggiata Archeologica!

276
00:23:22,291 --> 00:23:25,915
Can't I look?
Know how gorgeous you are?

277
00:23:26,666 --> 00:23:27,749
Get going.

278
00:23:29,791 --> 00:23:32,624
Yeah? I'm staying right here!
See?

279
00:23:43,416 --> 00:23:44,457
Sorry.

280
00:23:45,333 --> 00:23:46,374
Are you blind?

281
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,082
Jessie!

282
00:23:51,916 --> 00:23:54,665
Jessie! How can this happen?

283
00:23:54,833 --> 00:23:56,582
Alberto Lazzari!

284
00:23:59,375 --> 00:24:01,915
Jessie, I don't want to get upset.

285
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,332
Jessie, cut it out!

286
00:24:05,625 --> 00:24:06,874
Let go!

287
00:24:07,625 --> 00:24:10,832
Don't make me lose my temper.
Come back inside.

288
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,040
Give me the keys.

289
00:24:12,208 --> 00:24:16,457
- Go inside. Don't be stupid.
- Don't you touch me, you pig!

290
00:24:18,875 --> 00:24:22,707
Move over. Let me in.
Where are you going? Where?

291
00:24:22,958 --> 00:24:25,457
- Do I get the keys or not?
- No!

292
00:24:26,666 --> 00:24:30,457
- You're not getting out!
- You're hurting me. Let go!

293
00:24:34,416 --> 00:24:36,124
Listen, dear...

294
00:24:37,166 --> 00:24:38,290
Listen one last time.

295
00:24:38,458 --> 00:24:41,832
- There's no more to say.
- I'm tired. You're exhausting!

296
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,665
- Let go! You're ruining my fur.
- I bought it!

297
00:24:44,833 --> 00:24:45,874
You louse!

298
00:24:46,208 --> 00:24:47,874
- Wait a second...
- What for?

299
00:24:48,916 --> 00:24:49,999
You can go.

300
00:24:50,458 --> 00:24:52,040
Lousy second-rate ham!

301
00:24:56,458 --> 00:24:59,874
Listen, Jessie. If you don't
come back, it's over!

302
00:25:00,166 --> 00:25:01,624
Fine! It's over!

303
00:25:02,125 --> 00:25:05,290
Finished!
At last! So much the better.

304
00:25:05,583 --> 00:25:07,582
Thanks, thanks, Jessie.

305
00:25:09,083 --> 00:25:10,749
What do you want?
Go away!

306
00:25:36,458 --> 00:25:38,040
I'm talking to you!

307
00:25:41,625 --> 00:25:42,665
Get in.

308
00:25:43,333 --> 00:25:44,374
Who, me?

309
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:46,374
Yes, you. Hurry. Get in.

310
00:25:58,791 --> 00:25:59,874
Fast!

311
00:26:05,583 --> 00:26:06,707
Close the door.

312
00:26:39,333 --> 00:26:40,249
Get out.

313
00:26:40,541 --> 00:26:41,540
But why?

314
00:26:41,833 --> 00:26:43,249
Come on, get out.

315
00:26:48,541 --> 00:26:50,707
What's it gonna be, Mr. Mustache?

316
00:26:50,875 --> 00:26:53,874
What's going on here?
Get out, get in, get in, get out!

317
00:26:54,041 --> 00:26:55,290
Make up your mind!

318
00:26:56,916 --> 00:26:59,999
Come on. Let's have some fun.

319
00:27:26,458 --> 00:27:29,124
- He said to go in.
- So go in.

320
00:27:55,458 --> 00:27:57,874
How are you, Sir?
How about a table?

321
00:27:58,041 --> 00:28:00,124
Tonight's show is exceptional.

322
00:28:01,416 --> 00:28:03,124
Your umbrella, Signora?

323
00:28:11,541 --> 00:28:13,540
Right this way, Signora.

324
00:28:30,791 --> 00:28:31,915
Who's that?

325
00:28:35,333 --> 00:28:36,707
May I help you?

326
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,207
Sit over here. Come on.

327
00:28:41,791 --> 00:28:42,999
Please...

328
00:28:49,333 --> 00:28:50,540
Sit over there.

329
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,207
Alberto!
Monica...

330
00:29:37,916 --> 00:29:40,790
What are you up to, Alberto?
Are you shooting?

331
00:29:40,958 --> 00:29:42,749
- Yes.
- No need to introduce him!

332
00:29:42,916 --> 00:29:44,582
Pleased to meet you.

333
00:29:44,875 --> 00:29:47,624
Yesterday the Americans
gave me a screen test.

334
00:29:47,875 --> 00:29:49,499
It turned out fantastic!

335
00:29:49,666 --> 00:29:53,790
I have a 16 millimeter print at home
if you want to see it.

336
00:30:06,583 --> 00:30:11,165
Ladies and gentlemen, that was
part one of our show. Before you dance

337
00:30:11,333 --> 00:30:14,582
I'd like to salute and applaud
an illustrious guest who is

338
00:30:14,958 --> 00:30:16,082
honoring us with his presence.

339
00:30:16,875 --> 00:30:19,165
Must I applaud too, Alberto?

340
00:30:20,958 --> 00:30:23,332
O.K., boys! Mambo number 26!

341
00:30:29,250 --> 00:30:31,749
Do me a favor,
come to our table.

342
00:30:31,916 --> 00:30:34,540
A bunch of my friends
would love to meet you.

343
00:30:34,708 --> 00:30:36,707
- Come on, Alberto.
- I can't.

344
00:30:38,333 --> 00:30:39,415
I'm with the lady.

345
00:30:40,833 --> 00:30:41,957
Let's dance.

346
00:31:03,583 --> 00:31:07,707
Mambo...the world turns
around the mambo.

347
00:31:07,875 --> 00:31:09,290
What a mambo.

348
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:51,415
Oh, boy! What a mambo!

349
00:31:58,541 --> 00:32:02,207
If you wanna be with your friends,
don't mind me.

350
00:32:03,833 --> 00:32:04,832
What?

351
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,957
You can go with your friends.

352
00:32:07,125 --> 00:32:08,790
That's enough. Let's go.

353
00:32:09,666 --> 00:32:11,124
Good night, Commendatore.

354
00:32:31,958 --> 00:32:33,415
Get in. Hurry up!

355
00:32:35,875 --> 00:32:37,457
- Did you eat?
- No.

356
00:32:37,625 --> 00:32:39,332
Well, a little bit at 8 p.m.

357
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:42,040
- Let's get some supper.
- What?

358
00:32:42,208 --> 00:32:43,499
Let's have supper.

359
00:32:44,250 --> 00:32:46,957
Good. Where are we going?

360
00:32:47,125 --> 00:32:48,415
Home.

361
00:32:50,333 --> 00:32:52,665
Wait! Wait a second!
Hey, Fancy Pants!

362
00:32:53,333 --> 00:32:54,999
I'm talking to you!

363
00:32:55,708 --> 00:32:57,040
Look at me!

364
00:32:59,083 --> 00:33:03,207
Look who I'm with!
Up yours! Know who this is?

365
00:33:36,541 --> 00:33:39,207
- Did anyone call?
- Nobody, Commendatore.

366
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:43,040
- What do you mean nobody?
- Nobody called.

367
00:33:43,208 --> 00:33:47,040
- Were you awake or sleeping?
- Nobody called. I was here.

368
00:33:47,208 --> 00:33:48,207
All right.

369
00:33:48,375 --> 00:33:50,415
Supper for two in my room.

370
00:33:51,041 --> 00:33:55,290
If Miss Jessie calls, I'm asleep.
If she insists, I'm asleep.

371
00:33:55,458 --> 00:33:58,374
If she still insists,
I'm still asleep!

372
00:34:00,916 --> 00:34:03,374
We'll eat upstairs.
What's your name?

373
00:34:04,916 --> 00:34:05,790
What?

374
00:34:07,416 --> 00:34:09,582
Come on, move.

375
00:34:27,583 --> 00:34:29,582
What? Another dog?

376
00:34:42,583 --> 00:34:44,249
Look at these!

377
00:34:49,750 --> 00:34:51,415
You got fish, too?

378
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:55,624
Yes...
Now, where did I put it?

379
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,790
- Leave it for the maid.
- But it'll get wrinkled.

380
00:35:06,375 --> 00:35:08,207
Idiot! What made me do it?

381
00:35:09,166 --> 00:35:12,624
Did you ever see an idiot?
Well, you're looking at one.

382
00:35:12,791 --> 00:35:14,457
Just leave it!

383
00:35:36,791 --> 00:35:37,957
Come.

384
00:35:50,833 --> 00:35:52,290
Your name again?

385
00:35:59,291 --> 00:36:00,582
Where are you from?

386
00:36:00,750 --> 00:36:01,624
What?

387
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,707
- Where do you come from?
- From Rome. Piazza Risorgimento.

388
00:36:09,083 --> 00:36:11,749
Sit down. You're making me
nervous.

389
00:36:29,125 --> 00:36:30,040
You like it?

390
00:36:32,083 --> 00:36:35,624
Kind of...it's not really my thing.

391
00:36:36,541 --> 00:36:38,832
It's not my taste...but, yes.

392
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,915
Beethoven's Fifth.

393
00:36:44,083 --> 00:36:45,415
I love it.

394
00:36:47,916 --> 00:36:49,290
Come in.

395
00:37:01,125 --> 00:37:02,290
Leave it there.

396
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:04,832
I'll do it. Go.

397
00:37:05,083 --> 00:37:06,332
And close the door.

398
00:37:15,958 --> 00:37:18,332
Let's see what he brought us.

399
00:37:20,125 --> 00:37:21,540
Caviar...lobster...

400
00:37:22,958 --> 00:37:25,624
Help yourself. Eat.
I'm not in the mood.

401
00:37:26,750 --> 00:37:29,707
Help yourself.
I don't know if you like it.

402
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:33,249
1949.

403
00:37:34,791 --> 00:37:36,749
1949...

404
00:37:39,708 --> 00:37:42,124
Take that off.
It's hot in here.

405
00:37:51,666 --> 00:37:53,124
Guess I tore it.

406
00:37:55,916 --> 00:37:58,332
- Where do you live?
- Past the gas station.

407
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:00,790
- Where?
- On the road to Ostia.

408
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:03,957
- You come to Via Veneto?
- Via Veneto? Me?

409
00:38:04,750 --> 00:38:07,874
I work the Passeggiata
Archeologica. Much more convenient.

410
00:38:08,041 --> 00:38:08,790
Why?

411
00:38:08,958 --> 00:38:11,332
I'm on the Cilia.
Subway takes me right there.

412
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:13,624
There's another girl,
my friend Wanda.

413
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:17,582
She lives there, too.
But I don't bother with the others.

414
00:38:17,750 --> 00:38:20,707
The others sleep under the arches
in Caracalla.

415
00:38:20,875 --> 00:38:23,707
Mind you, I have my own house

416
00:38:23,875 --> 00:38:27,915
with water, electric, bottled gas...
I got every thing.

417
00:38:28,083 --> 00:38:29,874
Even a thermometer.

418
00:38:30,541 --> 00:38:35,249
See this one here?
She never, ever slept under an arch.

419
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:38,957
Well, maybe once...or twice.

420
00:38:41,833 --> 00:38:46,040
Of course, my house is...
nothing like this.

421
00:38:46,833 --> 00:38:48,124
But I like it.

422
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:57,207
Eat. Eat something.

423
00:39:03,833 --> 00:39:05,082
What's wrong?

424
00:39:05,666 --> 00:39:08,124
Damn it! I know who you are!

425
00:39:08,708 --> 00:39:11,499
I know!
Can I say it?

426
00:39:11,666 --> 00:39:13,040
Can I?

427
00:39:13,208 --> 00:39:17,332
Alberto Lazzari! I knew you
right away! I saw all your movies.

428
00:39:17,708 --> 00:39:20,707
- Very nice!
- Which is your favorite?

429
00:39:20,875 --> 00:39:22,582
Well... the last one

430
00:39:22,750 --> 00:39:27,249
in a costume with all that stuff,
then Vittorio Gassman came...

431
00:39:27,416 --> 00:39:29,707
pushed the door open and said:
"Fermi tutti!"

432
00:39:30,083 --> 00:39:31,957
Then it was his daughter.

433
00:39:32,375 --> 00:39:33,582
That wasn't me.

434
00:39:34,125 --> 00:39:35,540
What do you mean?

435
00:39:38,625 --> 00:39:40,165
You're as nice as your house.

436
00:39:43,708 --> 00:39:45,165
Bring the glasses here.

437
00:39:54,166 --> 00:39:56,582
- Champagne.
- Sit down.

438
00:40:27,875 --> 00:40:29,332
What's wrong now?

439
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:32,249
Who's gonna believe this
when I tell 'em?

440
00:40:32,458 --> 00:40:36,124
They already think I'm full of it.

441
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,290
I might not believe it myself
tomorrow.

442
00:40:39,458 --> 00:40:42,207
You have to do me a favor.
Give me a picture

443
00:40:42,375 --> 00:40:46,540
and write: "Cabiria was here
at my house. Alberto Lazzari"

444
00:40:46,708 --> 00:40:49,790
"Cabiria Ceccarelli
was at my house."

445
00:40:49,958 --> 00:40:50,999
Like that.

446
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:54,624
Now let's eat.

447
00:40:54,791 --> 00:40:56,290
And you eat, too.

448
00:40:56,833 --> 00:40:58,415
An olive.

449
00:41:00,916 --> 00:41:02,124
Should I open it?

450
00:41:03,458 --> 00:41:07,749
Chicken! Some chicken breast
to chase away the blues.

451
00:41:08,708 --> 00:41:10,832
Here's your plate.

452
00:41:11,166 --> 00:41:15,165
If you want to play more
of that music, I'd like it, too.

453
00:41:15,625 --> 00:41:18,749
And what's this?
I saw it in a movie once.

454
00:41:21,708 --> 00:41:23,332
- Commendatore.
- Yes, Davide.

455
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:25,874
- It's Signorina Jessie.
- Tell her I'm sleeping.

456
00:41:26,041 --> 00:41:27,165
- She's here.
- What?

457
00:41:27,333 --> 00:41:29,999
- She's downstairs.
- Just don't let her in.

458
00:41:30,166 --> 00:41:32,540
She's already in. She's coming up.

459
00:41:32,708 --> 00:41:33,999
Idiot!

460
00:41:45,541 --> 00:41:46,999
Alberto, open up.

461
00:41:47,416 --> 00:41:49,957
- Who is it?
- Don't be stupid! Open up!

462
00:41:50,375 --> 00:41:53,124
So? Open up.

463
00:41:54,250 --> 00:41:55,124
It's important.

464
00:41:55,916 --> 00:41:57,124
One moment.

465
00:42:02,041 --> 00:42:04,957
- The picture!
- Oh, yes. Hurry up!

466
00:42:05,625 --> 00:42:07,832
Alberto, will you open up?

467
00:42:08,250 --> 00:42:09,832
Go in the bathroom a minute.

468
00:42:10,125 --> 00:42:12,165
Yes. I'll get rid of her...Hurry!

469
00:42:12,333 --> 00:42:14,915
I'm not leaving.
I'll stay here all night!

470
00:42:15,083 --> 00:42:17,915
- Quiet, don't move.
- Open up.

471
00:42:19,041 --> 00:42:21,499
Alberto, please open the door.

472
00:42:25,541 --> 00:42:27,165
Open up, you bastard!

473
00:42:29,708 --> 00:42:30,665
What do you want?

474
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,999
What's on your mind?

475
00:42:45,958 --> 00:42:48,540
I'm tired.
I have to be up early tomorrow.

476
00:42:48,666 --> 00:42:50,707
I'm working. You know that.

477
00:42:51,208 --> 00:42:53,624
I'm thirsty. Give me a drink.

478
00:42:53,791 --> 00:42:56,165
- What?
- I'm thirsty.

479
00:43:01,333 --> 00:43:03,415
Now what?

480
00:43:05,125 --> 00:43:07,082
I can't go on this way!

481
00:43:07,250 --> 00:43:09,874
Well, neither can I!

482
00:43:10,750 --> 00:43:13,582
Yourjealousy
is morbid, unbearable.

483
00:43:13,750 --> 00:43:16,499
I'm tired of it.
I can't take it any more.

484
00:43:16,666 --> 00:43:20,249
Let's call it quits
while we're still friends.

485
00:43:21,458 --> 00:43:24,457
That's too easy.
I'm not going anywhere!

486
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:29,124
Jessie, don't do this.
Get some sleep.

487
00:43:30,458 --> 00:43:32,415
You're tired and
I'm falling apart.

488
00:43:32,583 --> 00:43:34,790
We'll call each other tomorrow.

489
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,999
- I know you've stopped loving me.
- Who told you?

490
00:43:58,166 --> 00:44:00,082
You've stopped loving me.

491
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:03,040
- Admit it.
- I'd never say such a thing.

492
00:44:03,208 --> 00:44:06,499
Admit it, and I'll never
bother you again.

493
00:44:06,666 --> 00:44:08,290
But I'd be lying.

494
00:44:08,708 --> 00:44:11,540
Even if we saw each other
occasionally...

495
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,082
Every two or three days,
I'd be happy.

496
00:44:15,250 --> 00:44:19,790
Why so seldom?
We could be together much more.

497
00:44:19,958 --> 00:44:22,665
- Every day?
- Yes, every day.

498
00:44:22,833 --> 00:44:27,665
But stop being so jealous. Is it my
fault that women always look at me?

499
00:44:27,833 --> 00:44:29,249
But you're ugly!

500
00:46:38,625 --> 00:46:40,915
How do I get outta here?

501
00:47:07,541 --> 00:47:11,332
Hey, Cabiria. Alberto Lazzari's
been lookin' for you!

502
00:47:11,583 --> 00:47:13,957
I'm not even talking to you!

503
00:47:14,125 --> 00:47:16,374
- Don't listen to her.
- Who's listening?

504
00:47:16,541 --> 00:47:18,207
Hey, Cabiria, there's Limpy.

505
00:47:18,375 --> 00:47:20,040
There's a winner.

506
00:47:20,750 --> 00:47:23,165
Hey, you old lecher!

507
00:47:23,833 --> 00:47:26,665
Homesick forjail?

508
00:47:27,166 --> 00:47:29,290
Come on, Cabiria,
let's have a good laugh.

509
00:47:34,625 --> 00:47:37,915
Why'd you bring him along?
A weed never dies!

510
00:47:38,083 --> 00:47:40,165
The Madonna might
have mercy on my uncle.

511
00:47:40,416 --> 00:47:41,207
What mercy?

512
00:47:41,375 --> 00:47:44,415
The pilgrims of the Madonna del
Divino Amore just went by.

513
00:47:44,583 --> 00:47:46,249
I don't believe that stuff.

514
00:47:46,375 --> 00:47:49,124
- Don't you believe in miracles?
- Not me.

515
00:47:49,291 --> 00:47:51,457
Should we go there on Sunday?

516
00:47:51,625 --> 00:47:53,915
We'll all have
something to ask.

517
00:47:54,666 --> 00:47:57,332
Cabiria, you goin' too?

518
00:47:57,500 --> 00:48:00,665
Me? I dunno.
I'll think about it. Besides,

519
00:48:00,833 --> 00:48:03,124
what would I ask for?
I've got everything.

520
00:48:03,291 --> 00:48:06,165
I'll even be done
with the mortgage soon.

521
00:48:06,333 --> 00:48:10,165
But I might go anyway.
I haven't said no.

522
00:48:11,375 --> 00:48:12,624
We'll see.

523
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:16,540
Think the Madonna would
waste a miracle on him?

524
00:48:16,916 --> 00:48:20,374
Funny, huh? She knows
how you made your dough.

525
00:48:20,541 --> 00:48:23,040
Selling coke
and pimping women.

526
00:48:23,208 --> 00:48:25,540
I'm going to see the Madonna

527
00:48:25,708 --> 00:48:28,082
and I know exactly
what I'll ask for.

528
00:48:28,666 --> 00:48:31,040
Don't make fun of stuff like that.

529
00:48:33,291 --> 00:48:34,999
You really want to go?

530
00:48:39,375 --> 00:48:40,999
What'll you ask for?

531
00:48:41,666 --> 00:48:44,124
I'm talking to you.
What'll you ask for?

532
00:49:53,833 --> 00:49:55,332
Hey, you! Shorty!

533
00:49:58,208 --> 00:49:59,749
Wanna lift?

534
00:50:22,583 --> 00:50:26,332
A shortcut...
He calls this a shortcut.

535
00:50:26,750 --> 00:50:28,790
I've been walking an hour.

536
00:50:29,375 --> 00:50:31,082
Who knows where I am?

537
00:51:16,583 --> 00:51:18,582
You live in the caves, too?

538
00:51:20,041 --> 00:51:21,249
I've never seen you before.

539
00:51:21,416 --> 00:51:22,749
I've got my own house.

540
00:51:39,208 --> 00:51:43,207
Gorgiano!... Gorgiano!
It's me. Come up.

541
00:51:49,166 --> 00:51:50,249
How are you doing?

542
00:51:50,416 --> 00:51:52,707
Not so bad, thank you, sir.

543
00:51:54,291 --> 00:51:56,457
And where's Pietro?
Sleeping?

544
00:51:56,958 --> 00:52:00,124
They took him to the hospital
two days ago.

545
00:52:00,291 --> 00:52:02,457
Said he was in bad shape.

546
00:52:03,416 --> 00:52:06,415
- What do you need?
- Whatever you want, sir.

547
00:52:06,583 --> 00:52:09,332
Here's a blanket. Is that alright?

548
00:52:09,541 --> 00:52:11,332
What hospital
did they take Pietro to?

549
00:52:11,500 --> 00:52:13,582
To the Fratebenefratelli.

550
00:52:13,750 --> 00:52:16,999
Alright, I'll visit him
if I have time.

551
00:52:29,625 --> 00:52:33,082
Hey, Dark Hair...
who is that guy?

552
00:52:39,083 --> 00:52:41,457
But who is he?
With some charity?

553
00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:45,124
Hey, I'm talkin' to you.

554
00:52:58,208 --> 00:52:59,499
Can I help you?

555
00:53:01,708 --> 00:53:03,582
Going back to Rome later?

556
00:53:06,916 --> 00:53:09,124
Can you give me a lift?

557
00:53:10,583 --> 00:53:11,749
Yes, later.

558
00:53:23,416 --> 00:53:24,374
Elsa!

559
00:53:28,916 --> 00:53:30,874
Ah, caro!

560
00:53:31,250 --> 00:53:35,374
I was expecting you Saturday,
but you came today!

561
00:53:35,541 --> 00:53:40,832
I was just thinking yesterday,
"He comes every 9 or 10 days...

562
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:44,415
"He came Wednesday,
so he'll show up Saturday!"

563
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:48,499
Bomba! But I know this one!

564
00:53:50,250 --> 00:53:52,082
But Bomba... You live here?

565
00:53:53,041 --> 00:53:56,540
I wish I had everything I used to...

566
00:53:56,708 --> 00:53:59,665
A place in Rome, a place in Ostia...

567
00:53:59,833 --> 00:54:02,915
Showered with gifts!
Money in the bank!

568
00:54:03,083 --> 00:54:04,415
Jewels! Gold!

569
00:54:04,583 --> 00:54:06,582
I had five kilos of gold!

570
00:54:06,750 --> 00:54:10,707
She's not lying, you know.
Now who'd believe it?

571
00:54:10,875 --> 00:54:12,749
But this one in her day...

572
00:54:12,916 --> 00:54:15,957
Here they don't even
make me comb my hair.

573
00:54:16,125 --> 00:54:19,249
But if I wear a low-cut blouse

574
00:54:19,416 --> 00:54:21,915
and the white earrings, then...ha!

575
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:24,790
Come, Elsa. Take this.

576
00:54:25,541 --> 00:54:28,249
Oh! Look at the sweets you
brought!

577
00:54:28,416 --> 00:54:30,999
And only for me!
None for the others!

578
00:54:31,166 --> 00:54:33,874
Give it to me to hide.

579
00:54:34,041 --> 00:54:36,165
The one with the chocolate!

580
00:54:36,333 --> 00:54:41,249
Pignoli! Look at the pignoli!
Like rainfall!

581
00:54:41,750 --> 00:54:45,249
Caro! Thank you, thank you!

582
00:54:50,041 --> 00:54:52,249
When will you be back?
When?

583
00:54:56,625 --> 00:55:00,040
God protect you from evil, my son.

584
00:55:10,125 --> 00:55:11,707
Of course...

585
00:55:12,541 --> 00:55:15,374
Lots of starving people in Rome,
eh?

586
00:55:21,458 --> 00:55:23,415
You drive around at night a lot.

587
00:55:25,375 --> 00:55:27,332
Not as much as needed.

588
00:55:35,291 --> 00:55:36,624
How 'bout during the day?

589
00:55:37,458 --> 00:55:41,040
No, in the daytime,
the poor wander about.

590
00:55:41,208 --> 00:55:42,999
How would I find them?

591
00:55:44,583 --> 00:55:46,374
Go figure...

592
00:55:47,708 --> 00:55:51,415
Me, I'm out at night, too,
and I've never met you.

593
00:55:53,375 --> 00:55:54,374
But how'd you get

594
00:55:55,916 --> 00:55:57,874
the idea of doing this job?

595
00:55:58,041 --> 00:56:02,040
I don't even know myself.
Like that. Little by little.

596
00:56:05,916 --> 00:56:09,374
We're here... There's your tram.

597
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:20,249
Do you live far from here?

598
00:56:20,416 --> 00:56:23,707
About 19 km, on the road to Ostia.

599
00:56:25,083 --> 00:56:26,874
What's your name?

600
00:56:27,041 --> 00:56:28,790
Maria Ceccarelli.

601
00:56:29,875 --> 00:56:31,207
Are you alone?

602
00:56:32,291 --> 00:56:34,874
My father and mother
died when I was little.

603
00:56:35,041 --> 00:56:36,999
I came to Rome later.

604
00:56:40,041 --> 00:56:42,999
Now go and get some sleep.

605
00:56:58,041 --> 00:56:59,457
So I...

606
00:57:00,416 --> 00:57:03,457
Arrivederci...
Go ahead, tell me.

607
00:57:04,041 --> 00:57:06,832
Thank you.
Thank you for everything.

608
00:57:32,791 --> 00:57:35,707
Don Vincenzo,
the group from Rieti is here.

609
00:57:38,541 --> 00:57:43,915
Get your prickly pears!
Fresh prickly pears!

610
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:53,415
Eat my Indian figs!

611
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,249
Gimme a hand, Maurizio.

612
00:58:12,458 --> 00:58:14,665
Wanda, get a load of this crowd!

613
00:58:14,916 --> 00:58:17,832
Divine Love

614
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:22,124
Grants grace at any time

615
00:58:23,708 --> 00:58:26,665
There's the candle guy.
Come on, Uncle.

616
00:58:27,458 --> 00:58:29,707
Viva Maria! Viva Maria!

617
00:58:34,708 --> 00:58:36,749
How much for the candles?

618
00:58:36,916 --> 00:58:40,415
Take your pick.
I got some for 50, 100, 150...

619
00:58:40,583 --> 00:58:42,165
The biggest you got.

620
00:58:42,333 --> 00:58:43,665
We'll take two each.

621
00:58:43,833 --> 00:58:46,624
Wanda, the candles! Over here!

622
00:58:47,083 --> 00:58:48,290
Are these all right?

623
00:58:48,416 --> 00:58:51,374
I just want one.
Maybe I'll pay you later.

624
00:58:51,541 --> 00:58:53,332
No, I'll pay for them all.

625
00:58:55,083 --> 00:58:58,207
- What'll I do with it now?
- Stupid!

626
00:58:59,541 --> 00:59:00,915
How much altogether?

627
00:59:01,333 --> 00:59:06,165
Lovely Lady

628
00:59:06,500 --> 00:59:10,790
Who with gladness
In their hearts

629
00:59:10,958 --> 00:59:14,249
Honor you today

630
00:59:14,416 --> 00:59:18,707
Make way! Sick man here!
Let us through!

631
00:59:21,333 --> 00:59:22,415
Oh, the poor lad.

632
00:59:22,583 --> 00:59:23,624
So young!

633
00:59:24,083 --> 00:59:26,665
We're over here! Wait for us!

634
00:59:26,833 --> 00:59:30,332
We're gonna get photos!

635
00:59:30,958 --> 00:59:34,207
- Come, Cabiria. They're calling us.
- I'm coming.

636
00:59:34,375 --> 00:59:35,374
Where's Wanda?

637
00:59:35,958 --> 00:59:37,957
Wanda, come on!

638
00:59:38,125 --> 00:59:39,332
Marisa!

639
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:48,249
Get lost! With that nose
you want a photo?

640
00:59:48,416 --> 00:59:49,957
How much the picture?

641
00:59:51,166 --> 00:59:52,624
Now what do we do?

642
00:59:52,791 --> 00:59:56,207
You need to confess. Down
there, where it says "confessione".

643
00:59:56,375 --> 00:59:58,374
I already confessed yesterday.

644
00:59:58,541 --> 01:00:00,207
Watch out! He's a cripple!

645
01:00:03,625 --> 01:00:08,332
- Long live the Madonna del Divino Amore!
- Long live the Madonna del Divino Amore!

646
01:00:08,500 --> 01:00:11,915
- Thank you, Holy Virgin!
- Thank you, Holy Virgin!

647
01:00:18,541 --> 01:00:25,374
Ave, Ave

648
01:00:26,208 --> 01:00:27,540
- Wanda...
- Yes?

649
01:00:28,166 --> 01:00:31,957
I'm gonna ask for mercy from
the Madonna, too. Like you.

650
01:00:32,083 --> 01:00:33,665
What am I asking for?

651
01:00:34,083 --> 01:00:35,665
You don't remember?

652
01:00:35,833 --> 01:00:38,165
I could ask for a villa
in Peripli.

653
01:00:38,750 --> 01:00:42,415
That's not what you said!

654
01:00:43,083 --> 01:00:44,207
Don't you remember?

655
01:00:44,375 --> 01:00:47,082
I'll ask for whatever I feel like.

656
01:00:49,041 --> 01:00:51,082
But you said you'd ask...

657
01:00:51,250 --> 01:00:53,165
I changed my mind.

658
01:01:00,958 --> 01:01:02,832
Why are you talking like that?

659
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,249
See? You made
my candle go out.

660
01:01:07,583 --> 01:01:10,999
30 masses at 1 ,000 each.
That's 30,000.

661
01:01:11,166 --> 01:01:12,249
I gave them thirty-five.

662
01:01:12,416 --> 01:01:14,957
Yeah, you did O.K.
You never know...

663
01:01:15,291 --> 01:01:18,957
- Thank you. Thank you very much.
- Careful not to get burnt.

664
01:01:22,833 --> 01:01:24,332
I forgot
the act of contrition.

665
01:01:24,500 --> 01:01:27,207
"My Lord, I repent
with all my heart..."

666
01:01:27,375 --> 01:01:29,915
- And after?
- It's written in the confessional.

667
01:01:30,083 --> 01:01:33,790
Wait here.
We can't go in together!

668
01:01:34,083 --> 01:01:35,624
That's enough for now!

669
01:01:35,916 --> 01:01:39,374
Use the other entrance!

670
01:01:39,541 --> 01:01:41,582
Watch your hands!

671
01:01:44,666 --> 01:01:47,165
Take it easy. Don't push!

672
01:01:47,333 --> 01:01:49,499
I'm sick. I can't help it.

673
01:01:49,958 --> 01:01:52,082
He's sick, too. Can't you see that?

674
01:01:55,250 --> 01:01:56,957
Careful, Uncle.

675
01:01:59,625 --> 01:02:01,874
- There's the altar, Uncle.
- I can't...

676
01:02:02,333 --> 01:02:05,249
I can't go on. I can't move.

677
01:02:05,416 --> 01:02:07,874
I'll hold you 'til
we're at the altar.

678
01:02:08,041 --> 01:02:09,457
I gotta rest.

679
01:02:09,625 --> 01:02:12,249
Rosie, come here.
I think he's gonna pass out.

680
01:02:12,416 --> 01:02:14,999
Try again, Uncle.
We're almost there.

681
01:02:17,625 --> 01:02:19,915
Everyone has a secret agony.

682
01:02:20,250 --> 01:02:22,832
Everyone has a wish
for You to fulfill.

683
01:02:23,041 --> 01:02:26,499
Open your heart to the suffering,
Oh, Holy Virgin!

684
01:02:26,833 --> 01:02:31,415
Mercy, Madonna!

685
01:02:31,541 --> 01:02:34,665
Call out with all your hearts,
"Viva Maria!"

686
01:02:34,833 --> 01:02:37,707
- Viva Maria!
- Viva Maria!

687
01:02:37,833 --> 01:02:41,082
- Mercy, Madonna!
- Mercy, Madonna!

688
01:03:22,625 --> 01:03:25,582
- Viva Maria!
- Viva Maria!

689
01:03:26,666 --> 01:03:29,207
- Mercy, Madonna!
- Mercy, Madonna!

690
01:03:30,125 --> 01:03:31,999
Mercy, Madonna!

691
01:03:32,541 --> 01:03:34,874
Viva Maria!

692
01:03:35,208 --> 01:03:37,249
Mercy, Madonna!

693
01:03:37,416 --> 01:03:41,082
- Heal me, Madonna!
- Make me well, Madonna!

694
01:03:41,250 --> 01:03:43,499
Heal me, Madonna!

695
01:03:43,666 --> 01:03:45,915
Make me well, Madonna!

696
01:03:46,083 --> 01:03:54,040
Mercy, Madonna!
I beg you with all my heart!

697
01:04:00,041 --> 01:04:01,582
Wanda, here!

698
01:04:01,958 --> 01:04:06,415
Who with gladness
In their hearts

699
01:04:06,583 --> 01:04:08,582
Stay close.
What happens next?

700
01:04:08,750 --> 01:04:09,790
I dunno!

701
01:04:09,958 --> 01:04:12,999
You oughta hear my heart beating.
I'm shaking.

702
01:04:13,166 --> 01:04:15,874
I feel so strange, Wanda.

703
01:04:17,708 --> 01:04:20,665
- Viva Maria!
- Viva Maria!

704
01:04:20,833 --> 01:04:23,957
- Mercy, Madonna!
- Mercy, Madonna!

705
01:04:24,208 --> 01:04:26,665
Now all kneel and pray.

706
01:04:26,916 --> 01:04:30,915
and beg our heavenly mother
for forgiveness.

707
01:04:33,250 --> 01:04:36,582
Amleto, will the Madonna
bestow Her grace on me?

708
01:04:37,833 --> 01:04:39,415
I think so.

709
01:04:41,333 --> 01:04:44,165
Now approach the altar
of the Virgin.

710
01:04:44,583 --> 01:04:47,082
Look into Her sweet eyes,

711
01:04:47,250 --> 01:04:51,207
and in Her glance each of you

712
01:04:51,333 --> 01:04:55,040
will feel the light of hope
turned on in your heart.

713
01:05:16,166 --> 01:05:18,415
Madonna, help me

714
01:05:18,791 --> 01:05:20,665
to change my life.

715
01:05:22,541 --> 01:05:24,457
Bestow your grace on me, too.

716
01:05:28,458 --> 01:05:30,415
Make me change my life.

717
01:05:31,125 --> 01:05:33,499
- Uncle, now!
- I'm afraid.

718
01:05:33,666 --> 01:05:36,874
Drop the crutches.
She'll have mercy on you.

719
01:05:37,333 --> 01:05:38,832
I'm afraid!

720
01:05:39,791 --> 01:05:41,332
I'm holding you!

721
01:05:41,541 --> 01:05:46,249
Madonna, I'm a sinner,
a worm of the earth.

722
01:05:46,500 --> 01:05:50,915
Have mercy on me, Madonna.
Don't leave me!

723
01:06:22,916 --> 01:06:24,707
Lost your tongue?
Have a drink.

724
01:06:24,875 --> 01:06:27,874
Careful, Wanda.
One glass and she's smashed.

725
01:06:28,041 --> 01:06:29,749
What are you doing?

726
01:06:29,875 --> 01:06:32,457
- I'm thinking.
- About what?

727
01:06:32,625 --> 01:06:34,249
- What?
- She's thinking.

728
01:06:34,416 --> 01:06:38,582
Too much thinking
will make your head explode.

729
01:06:40,583 --> 01:06:43,624
Look at those delinquents!
Stop with the damn ball!

730
01:06:43,791 --> 01:06:44,832
They're doing it on purpose!

731
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:46,540
I'll fix 'em!

732
01:06:49,458 --> 01:06:51,499
Get the ball.

733
01:06:51,666 --> 01:06:52,790
Blondie, the ball!

734
01:06:52,958 --> 01:06:55,790
Come on, we want to play!
Give us the ball!

735
01:06:56,083 --> 01:06:58,665
Next time I'll kick it
the other way!

736
01:07:04,458 --> 01:07:06,207
You wanna stay here by
yourselves?

737
01:07:06,375 --> 01:07:09,374
Uncle and I will leave. Just say so.

738
01:07:09,541 --> 01:07:12,707
- Why should we want to?
- What's wrong with you?

739
01:07:14,708 --> 01:07:17,332
- What if we wanted to?
- What's wrong?

740
01:07:17,458 --> 01:07:20,082
Hey! Come over here
and get your ball!

741
01:07:20,250 --> 01:07:23,290
Come over here
if you want it!

742
01:07:24,333 --> 01:07:27,207
Go get her.
She can't even walk.

743
01:07:27,375 --> 01:07:30,374
I'm not gonna tangle with her.
She'll manage.

744
01:07:30,541 --> 01:07:33,665
This music's boring!
Let's rock!

745
01:07:33,833 --> 01:07:34,915
Are you nut?

746
01:07:37,875 --> 01:07:40,207
We haven't changed.

747
01:07:41,416 --> 01:07:44,749
Nobody's changed!

748
01:07:45,583 --> 01:07:49,749
We're all the same as before,
just like the cripple.

749
01:07:49,875 --> 01:07:53,332
What do you want to change,
Cabiria?

750
01:07:56,083 --> 01:07:58,290
You think this is the end?

751
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:00,374
You know what I'm gonna do?

752
01:08:00,541 --> 01:08:05,624
I'm gonna sell the house.
Everything. I'm leaving.

753
01:08:06,125 --> 01:08:10,332
Goodbye, you guys.
I'm through with all this!

754
01:08:10,500 --> 01:08:11,582
Where'll you go?

755
01:08:11,750 --> 01:08:14,790
Where? Think I'm like you?

756
01:08:15,125 --> 01:08:18,332
I know where I can go. I know.

757
01:08:19,333 --> 01:08:22,582
Just look at those little nuns!

758
01:08:24,166 --> 01:08:28,124
Where you going with that banner?

759
01:08:28,291 --> 01:08:29,957
Looking for snails?

760
01:08:31,166 --> 01:08:34,457
- Why'd you make her drink?
- I made her drink?

761
01:08:36,750 --> 01:08:40,415
Did the Madonna give you mercy?

762
01:08:40,750 --> 01:08:42,415
Did she?

763
01:08:42,750 --> 01:08:45,624
Cabiria! You wanna get us
arrested?

764
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:48,957
Amleto, look at her!

765
01:08:49,125 --> 01:08:49,999
What?

766
01:08:50,166 --> 01:08:50,957
Bring her back!

767
01:08:51,125 --> 01:08:54,332
Leave me alone!
I wanna listen. Go on playing!

768
01:08:55,708 --> 01:08:59,415
Come have fun with us!

769
01:08:59,875 --> 01:09:04,374
Come dance with us!
Forget about your banner!

770
01:09:04,500 --> 01:09:08,332
Forget about it.

771
01:09:08,666 --> 01:09:12,165
- Why do you always butt in?
- Get lost!

772
01:09:13,583 --> 01:09:16,665
Cabiria!
You're in no condition for this!

773
01:09:17,083 --> 01:09:20,165
- Leave me alone.
- You're blind drunk!

774
01:09:20,333 --> 01:09:23,457
Who's drunk?
What do you know?

775
01:10:20,708 --> 01:10:22,124
Is the show any good?

776
01:10:22,875 --> 01:10:24,207
I asked you a question!

777
01:10:24,375 --> 01:10:26,332
Want me to say it stinks?

778
01:10:57,208 --> 01:11:01,082
As you can see, ladies and
gentlemen, my assistant's head

779
01:11:01,208 --> 01:11:05,249
has been completely
impaled by the daggers.

780
01:11:05,416 --> 01:11:09,457
There's no doubt
that his head must be

781
01:11:09,666 --> 01:11:11,332
soaked in blood.

782
01:11:11,625 --> 01:11:16,874
You'll be amazed to see, instead,
that his head has disappeared!

783
01:11:27,250 --> 01:11:29,665
In the second part
of our show, we'll feature

784
01:11:29,833 --> 01:11:32,957
experiments with magnetism,
hypnotism and auto-suggestion.

785
01:11:33,125 --> 01:11:37,165
Would anyone in the audience
care to volunteer? Prego, Signori!

786
01:11:37,291 --> 01:11:39,082
I will!

787
01:11:45,541 --> 01:11:47,957
Come right up.
Don't be afraid.

788
01:11:48,541 --> 01:11:50,915
There's absolutely no danger.

789
01:11:57,625 --> 01:12:01,582
We now need a representative
of the fair sex.

790
01:12:01,750 --> 01:12:04,207
- How about you, Signorina?
- Me?

791
01:12:04,333 --> 01:12:06,624
Yes, you! Come up. Be brave!

792
01:12:07,208 --> 01:12:08,540
I don't want to.

793
01:12:08,708 --> 01:12:11,999
Would you leave those young men
up there all alone?

794
01:12:12,166 --> 01:12:13,374
You go, then!

795
01:12:13,541 --> 01:12:15,749
Come on, chickie!
We need a laugh.

796
01:12:15,916 --> 01:12:17,332
Wanna laugh?

797
01:12:18,833 --> 01:12:20,374
Look at you in the mirror!

798
01:12:20,791 --> 01:12:23,415
Come on, Signorina,
don't make us beg.

799
01:12:23,583 --> 01:12:25,249
Should I come and get you?

800
01:12:25,416 --> 01:12:28,415
I'll come and get you. Beg you.

801
01:12:28,583 --> 01:12:31,707
Don't be afraid.
We're all good friends.

802
01:12:31,833 --> 01:12:32,707
All tricks...

803
01:12:32,875 --> 01:12:35,540
- Will you come?
- Sure! I'm coming.

804
01:12:36,750 --> 01:12:38,832
Think I'm scared?

805
01:12:40,250 --> 01:12:42,124
No reason to be.

806
01:12:42,708 --> 01:12:48,165
There's no reason to be afraid.
You've showed how brave you are.

807
01:12:49,500 --> 01:12:52,332
Come, you'll be fine.
Now, let's enjoy ourselves.

808
01:12:52,666 --> 01:12:56,915
Oh, I'm so forgetful!
It's really unforgivable!

809
01:12:57,083 --> 01:13:01,249
I completely forgot that
Signorina Elvira is still inside.

810
01:13:06,583 --> 01:13:08,915
Oh, this heat!
You're hot too, aren't you?

811
01:13:09,083 --> 01:13:12,915
How about a nice boat ride?
Does anybody here get seasick?

812
01:13:13,125 --> 01:13:15,832
I was on the Isle of Elba
as a kid.

813
01:13:16,041 --> 01:13:17,624
You barely got to Ostia.

814
01:13:17,791 --> 01:13:21,999
Nobody here gets seasick?
That's very good.

815
01:13:22,166 --> 01:13:24,040
Ah, here's our boat.

816
01:13:24,208 --> 01:13:27,832
We named her "Intrepid" because
she always defies the waves.

817
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,707
Come on, boys.
Don't make me beg you.

818
01:13:30,875 --> 01:13:32,457
Signorina, you stay here.

819
01:13:32,625 --> 01:13:37,290
The boat is waiting. The sea is
calm, and the weather is fine.

820
01:13:37,958 --> 01:13:39,374
I'm getting out of here!

821
01:13:39,541 --> 01:13:41,082
Where are you going?

822
01:13:42,500 --> 01:13:45,082
Damn, he's good!
He zapped him!

823
01:13:54,125 --> 01:13:55,415
Look into my eyes!

824
01:14:02,583 --> 01:14:03,707
Take the oars.

825
01:14:05,458 --> 01:14:06,582
Row!

826
01:14:11,333 --> 01:14:16,540
The sea is calm, transparent.
Feel the breeze.

827
01:14:16,875 --> 01:14:20,665
Enjoy filling your lungs with air
saturated with salt and iodine.

828
01:14:21,291 --> 01:14:22,165
Dolphins!

829
01:14:24,625 --> 01:14:25,832
Boy, look at 'em jump!

830
01:14:26,250 --> 01:14:27,874
One of you doesn't feel so good.

831
01:14:29,041 --> 01:14:31,207
Things are looking bad, boys.

832
01:14:31,458 --> 01:14:34,624
It's the open sea now.
The waves are swelling.

833
01:14:34,791 --> 01:14:36,415
Hear the wind whistling.

834
01:14:37,458 --> 01:14:38,915
It's a hurricane!

835
01:14:44,500 --> 01:14:46,165
Help! Hold the rudder!

836
01:14:48,458 --> 01:14:51,499
It's every man for himself!

837
01:14:59,166 --> 01:15:01,499
Mamma mia bella!
I'm drowning!

838
01:15:16,916 --> 01:15:20,040
- Scared, weren't you?
- You'd have been, too!

839
01:15:20,208 --> 01:15:22,832
You were plenty scared!

840
01:15:24,666 --> 01:15:26,040
Where are you going?

841
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:28,499
- You mean me?
- Yes.

842
01:15:28,666 --> 01:15:29,957
It's not over?

843
01:15:30,083 --> 01:15:33,915
It's not over.
You'd leave me here all alone?

844
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:36,457
What's he want now?

845
01:15:37,083 --> 01:15:38,415
Signora or Signorina?

846
01:15:42,916 --> 01:15:44,165
Did you have fun?

847
01:15:44,458 --> 01:15:45,874
Not really.

848
01:15:46,041 --> 01:15:49,790
I'd like to talk with you
a moment. Come here.

849
01:15:50,541 --> 01:15:52,957
- Are you from Rome?
- I live in Rome.

850
01:15:55,375 --> 01:15:59,749
In what part of town?
Colonna? Parioli? Prati?

851
01:16:00,625 --> 01:16:01,457
In Prati.

852
01:16:03,583 --> 01:16:07,957
Come on, be honest with me.
Where do you live?

853
01:16:08,750 --> 01:16:10,124
In Borgata San Francesco.

854
01:16:18,875 --> 01:16:20,207
What's so funny?

855
01:16:20,625 --> 01:16:23,207
Don't pay any attention.
They're justjoking.

856
01:16:23,625 --> 01:16:28,082
So, you're not married,
but you'd like to be.

857
01:16:28,708 --> 01:16:30,665
Why should I get married?

858
01:16:30,791 --> 01:16:33,124
Who'd marry her!

859
01:16:34,041 --> 01:16:35,832
All girls want to get married.

860
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:41,582
I know a nice young man
who'd be happy to marry you.

861
01:16:41,958 --> 01:16:43,165
Me?

862
01:16:43,333 --> 01:16:45,874
He's rich, handsome
and drives a Ferrari.

863
01:16:46,041 --> 01:16:49,207
Let's see if we can arrange it.

864
01:16:49,333 --> 01:16:50,832
What type of work
do you do?

865
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:52,540
She's a countess!

866
01:16:55,916 --> 01:16:59,165
Listen, I'm fine the way I am.
I got everything.

867
01:16:59,791 --> 01:17:01,290
And now I'm leaving.

868
01:17:04,833 --> 01:17:07,290
I don't need anything!
O.K.?

869
01:17:07,625 --> 01:17:09,749
Even better.

870
01:17:09,916 --> 01:17:14,207
So you're rich?
With a bank account, houses...

871
01:17:14,791 --> 01:17:16,832
I own the house I live in. O.K.?

872
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:18,957
And now I'll get going.

873
01:17:20,666 --> 01:17:22,124
One moment!

874
01:17:22,458 --> 01:17:24,332
Don't make me look foolish.

875
01:17:24,500 --> 01:17:28,374
At least let me introduce you
to the young man, Oscar.

876
01:17:28,958 --> 01:17:31,082
Who the heck is Oscar?

877
01:17:36,458 --> 01:17:37,707
Please step forward.

878
01:17:41,875 --> 01:17:43,207
How elegant you look.

879
01:17:44,375 --> 01:17:48,082
Come here. I'd like to introduce
you to the Signorina.

880
01:17:49,166 --> 01:17:51,332
She wanted to meet you, too.

881
01:17:54,333 --> 01:17:55,457
A pleasure.

882
01:17:55,625 --> 01:17:58,040
The pleasure is all his,
believe me.

883
01:18:03,833 --> 01:18:07,582
Now that you've met,
I'll leave you two alone.

884
01:18:08,041 --> 01:18:13,040
This is a beautiful garden,
filled with flowers.

885
01:18:13,541 --> 01:18:18,582
You can talk, confide in
each other. No one is listening.

886
01:18:19,125 --> 01:18:21,582
Look, Signorina,
Oscar is offering his arm.

887
01:18:21,750 --> 01:18:26,207
Come, Signorina, take his arm.
There's no harm in that.

888
01:18:26,375 --> 01:18:29,790
But...we just met.

889
01:18:30,500 --> 01:18:33,749
You're strolling among the flowers.

890
01:18:34,041 --> 01:18:37,957
The birds are singing
but Oscar doesn't dare to speak.

891
01:18:38,125 --> 01:18:40,415
He's shy, moved.

892
01:18:40,583 --> 01:18:42,624
Now he says, "Signorina,

893
01:18:42,791 --> 01:18:46,915
"I've been hoping to meet you
for such a long time.

894
01:18:47,625 --> 01:18:49,290
"May I ask you a question?

895
01:18:51,041 --> 01:18:53,540
"You're not spoken for, are you?

896
01:18:54,541 --> 01:18:57,249
"There was never
a man in your life?

897
01:18:59,208 --> 01:19:00,915
"Ah, I thought so.

898
01:19:01,916 --> 01:19:06,832
"I often see you standing by your
window, and at Sunday Mass.

899
01:19:07,125 --> 01:19:11,332
"Your eyes are always lowered.
You're always with your mother.

900
01:19:12,791 --> 01:19:16,665
"That's good. Picking flowers
indicates a gentle soul.

901
01:19:17,750 --> 01:19:21,499
"Signorina, may I hope
to see you again?

902
01:19:24,916 --> 01:19:28,374
"Ah, thank you.
What did you say your name was?

903
01:19:31,125 --> 01:19:35,082
"Thank you. I'll save this flower
like a precious object.

904
01:19:35,250 --> 01:19:36,999
"Would you dance with me?"

905
01:19:37,166 --> 01:19:40,415
Play, Maestro.
Oscar and Maria wish to dance.

906
01:19:41,416 --> 01:19:44,249
The orchestra will play
a beautiful waltz.

907
01:19:50,791 --> 01:19:53,374
"I'm wealthy
but I'm alone and unhappy.

908
01:19:53,541 --> 01:19:57,332
"What good are fancy cars,
long journeys and luxury hotels?

909
01:19:57,500 --> 01:19:59,207
"Smoke! Illusion!

910
01:19:59,416 --> 01:20:04,165
"What I really want is a home,
children, and a wife like you."

911
01:20:05,375 --> 01:20:09,540
When I was eighteen, that's when
you should have known me.

912
01:20:10,125 --> 01:20:13,790
I had long black hair...
This long.

913
01:20:14,166 --> 01:20:17,082
"For me, you'll always be eighteen."

914
01:20:20,125 --> 01:20:21,540
Then it's true?

915
01:20:21,666 --> 01:20:22,915
You love me?

916
01:20:24,041 --> 01:20:27,749
Is it really true?
You're not trying to fool me?

917
01:20:28,291 --> 01:20:30,124
Do you really love me?

918
01:20:43,125 --> 01:20:45,499
There, there. It's all right.

919
01:20:59,958 --> 01:21:01,165
What happened?

920
01:21:02,083 --> 01:21:04,249
What did you make me do?

921
01:21:15,375 --> 01:21:16,957
I have to close up.

922
01:21:17,125 --> 01:21:18,624
I'm going!

923
01:21:20,583 --> 01:21:23,832
Listen, are those creeps
still out there?

924
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,374
Everybody's gone.
There's nobody left.

925
01:21:28,708 --> 01:21:30,790
Get going.
I gotta close up.

926
01:21:31,208 --> 01:21:33,290
I'll show them a thing or two!

927
01:21:36,625 --> 01:21:38,124
Pardon me, Signorina.

928
01:21:38,958 --> 01:21:40,582
I'm Donofrio, accountant.

929
01:21:42,541 --> 01:21:44,415
Forgive my boldness.

930
01:21:45,500 --> 01:21:48,707
I don't normally
stop young ladies in the street.

931
01:21:48,875 --> 01:21:50,707
I was among the audience.

932
01:21:50,875 --> 01:21:52,999
Oh! You were there, watching!

933
01:21:53,166 --> 01:21:55,790
Great show!
I bet you liked it!

934
01:21:56,083 --> 01:21:59,082
If I ever see that slime-ball again...

935
01:21:59,500 --> 01:22:03,415
Signorina!
Please don't misunderstand me.

936
01:22:03,583 --> 01:22:05,290
I agree with you.

937
01:22:06,125 --> 01:22:08,374
In fact, I sympathize with you.

938
01:22:08,916 --> 01:22:12,832
I came to tell you
how moved I was.

939
01:22:14,750 --> 01:22:18,999
We can all pretend to be
cynical and scheming.

940
01:22:20,250 --> 01:22:25,707
But when we're faced with...
purity and innocence

941
01:22:26,333 --> 01:22:28,707
the cynical mask drops off

942
01:22:29,666 --> 01:22:32,499
and all that is best in us
awakens.

943
01:22:36,875 --> 01:22:39,540
I wanted to thank you.
You did me good.

944
01:22:42,500 --> 01:22:44,999
It's gotten chilly, hasn't it?

945
01:22:46,625 --> 01:22:49,874
May I? Excuse me.
It's the night-time humidity.

946
01:22:52,541 --> 01:22:54,249
May I buy you something?

947
01:22:54,458 --> 01:22:57,207
But... I really don't know you.

948
01:23:01,666 --> 01:23:04,582
Those damn creeps
are still there!

949
01:23:06,500 --> 01:23:09,790
Excuse my persistence,
but these experiments with magnetism

950
01:23:09,958 --> 01:23:12,124
are extremely dangerous.

951
01:23:12,541 --> 01:23:16,082
They can cause imbalances
and other disturbances.

952
01:23:17,875 --> 01:23:20,874
That's why I felt so strange!

953
01:23:21,041 --> 01:23:24,290
Cold, hot, sweaty.
Like I had a fever.

954
01:23:25,500 --> 01:23:26,749
How about that!

955
01:23:26,916 --> 01:23:29,874
I would suggest a Fernet.
It'll do you good.

956
01:23:31,291 --> 01:23:32,790
Come and sit down.

957
01:23:33,708 --> 01:23:35,082
Just a moment.

958
01:23:36,625 --> 01:23:37,915
Please sit down.

959
01:23:40,458 --> 01:23:42,040
Two Fernet, please.

960
01:23:49,500 --> 01:23:52,665
I swear, I've rarely suffered
as I did tonight.

961
01:23:53,791 --> 01:23:58,790
When that charlatan spoke words
of love to you in Oscar's name

962
01:23:59,875 --> 01:24:03,915
and you answered
with such modesty and trepidation,

963
01:24:04,291 --> 01:24:08,207
it made me sick.
Something hurt me in here.

964
01:24:08,916 --> 01:24:11,082
I was ill. Really ill.

965
01:24:11,708 --> 01:24:13,332
Hurry up. I'm closing.

966
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,415
Don't be upset.

967
01:24:18,625 --> 01:24:22,749
Some things cannot be touched
by human vulgarity.

968
01:24:25,666 --> 01:24:28,832
Even amidst a crowd
that laughs idiotically,

969
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:32,707
there's always someone
who understands, who knows,

970
01:24:32,958 --> 01:24:34,332
who appreciates.

971
01:24:42,458 --> 01:24:43,915
But what did I do?

972
01:24:45,583 --> 01:24:49,582
You acted out a very tender
and delicate love scene.

973
01:24:50,541 --> 01:24:52,540
I'm still deeply touched.

974
01:24:52,875 --> 01:24:54,499
I can't even express it.

975
01:24:56,583 --> 01:25:00,415
Yes...what struck me most

976
01:25:01,333 --> 01:25:05,249
is that deep inside,
you're as pure as you were at 18.

977
01:25:06,083 --> 01:25:08,415
When you went to Mass
with your mother

978
01:25:09,375 --> 01:25:12,624
and had long black hair,
falling down to here.

979
01:25:14,500 --> 01:25:16,457
I really said that?

980
01:25:18,041 --> 01:25:19,040
Closing time.

981
01:25:20,125 --> 01:25:22,749
- How much?
- 150 lire.

982
01:25:26,375 --> 01:25:29,415
Thank you....
Hey, you, go sleep at home!

983
01:25:29,583 --> 01:25:31,332
Listen, Signorina...

984
01:25:31,791 --> 01:25:34,915
What happened tonight
is extremely important to me.

985
01:25:36,541 --> 01:25:38,207
Just imagine...

986
01:25:38,750 --> 01:25:42,665
I'm not from around here,
I just came here by chance.

987
01:25:43,250 --> 01:25:48,124
I enjoy strolling in the city
in sections that I don't know.

988
01:25:48,500 --> 01:25:51,957
I went into that music hall,
without knowing why.

989
01:25:52,166 --> 01:25:56,832
There's no explanation for what
happened. As if guided by fate.

990
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:58,832
Yes, that's the word: fate!

991
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:00,665
But who are you?

992
01:26:01,041 --> 01:26:02,999
You sound like you're from Parioli.

993
01:26:03,166 --> 01:26:04,374
What do you mean?

994
01:26:04,583 --> 01:26:07,499
You talk like they them.
A refined type.

995
01:26:08,583 --> 01:26:13,082
I told you my name is Donofrio.
I'm a government employee.

996
01:26:13,500 --> 01:26:15,207
What do you want from me?

997
01:26:17,416 --> 01:26:21,582
You might understand me better
after I tell you my first name.

998
01:26:22,958 --> 01:26:23,957
Oscar.

999
01:26:24,541 --> 01:26:25,540
I'm Oscar.

1000
01:26:25,708 --> 01:26:27,832
- Your name's Oscar?
- Yes.

1001
01:26:28,958 --> 01:26:32,790
So what? Your being Oscar
could be a coincidence, no?

1002
01:26:34,250 --> 01:26:38,915
Sure. But isn't it strange that the
hypnotist chose the name Oscar?

1003
01:26:40,041 --> 01:26:43,499
Signorina,
I really must see you again.

1004
01:26:44,250 --> 01:26:45,124
You're taking the bus?

1005
01:26:45,791 --> 01:26:49,374
Yeah. I'm dead tired.
I gotta get to bed.

1006
01:26:49,625 --> 01:26:52,832
Do we say goodbye now,
never to meet again?

1007
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:55,374
Impossible.
I've got to see you again.

1008
01:26:56,333 --> 01:27:00,832
The city is vast and we still have
so much to say to each other.

1009
01:27:01,583 --> 01:27:04,665
When and where
can we meet again? Please!

1010
01:27:05,083 --> 01:27:09,040
I don't know...I'm busy..I work.

1011
01:27:09,625 --> 01:27:12,999
I'm a salesgirl... Anyway,
what'll we say to each other?

1012
01:27:13,166 --> 01:27:15,332
- What?
- What would we say?

1013
01:27:15,708 --> 01:27:18,082
There's the bus.
So long. Arrivederci.

1014
01:27:18,666 --> 01:27:21,540
Please don't say no.
I work, too.

1015
01:27:21,833 --> 01:27:23,999
Maybe we can meet after work.

1016
01:27:24,166 --> 01:27:28,165
Like tomorrow evening.
Signorina, wait! Tomorrow?

1017
01:27:28,291 --> 01:27:30,957
- The evening, no.
- Sunday afternoon?

1018
01:27:31,125 --> 01:27:33,540
Sunday, the Stazione Termini,
at seven.

1019
01:27:33,708 --> 01:27:35,999
I don't know. I feel so strange...

1020
01:27:39,583 --> 01:27:40,624
What're you doing?

1021
01:27:40,791 --> 01:27:42,249
Hurry. Let's go!

1022
01:28:30,500 --> 01:28:31,624
Here I am!

1023
01:28:33,875 --> 01:28:37,124
I was over there.
Sorry I kept you waiting.

1024
01:28:38,208 --> 01:28:39,707
Thank you for coming here.

1025
01:28:41,333 --> 01:28:45,374
You might have thought me
annoying, out of line.

1026
01:28:45,541 --> 01:28:47,040
It was all so strange...

1027
01:28:48,041 --> 01:28:49,915
As if I were dreaming.

1028
01:28:51,166 --> 01:28:53,207
I took the liberty,
if you'll accept.

1029
01:28:53,375 --> 01:28:56,624
Thanks. You didn't have to.

1030
01:28:56,791 --> 01:28:59,832
My pleasure.
Let's go that way.

1031
01:29:01,583 --> 01:29:06,457
He says he likes to talk to me.
And he talks. Boy! Does he talk!

1032
01:29:06,625 --> 01:29:09,665
The type who reads a lot.
Well-educated.

1033
01:29:10,083 --> 01:29:13,082
Last night we saw
a first-run movie.

1034
01:29:13,250 --> 01:29:14,957
Hey! That's your third!

1035
01:29:15,125 --> 01:29:16,790
I know they're good.

1036
01:29:17,041 --> 01:29:20,749
We went at the Metropolitan.
A costume movie.

1037
01:29:20,875 --> 01:29:23,040
Gladiators, Christian martyrs.

1038
01:29:24,291 --> 01:29:28,290
He explained to me
that it wasn't a true story.

1039
01:29:28,458 --> 01:29:30,874
It's just for the movies,
understand?

1040
01:29:31,041 --> 01:29:33,332
And then, he told me that...

1041
01:29:33,583 --> 01:29:36,915
he gets a kick out
of talking to me because...

1042
01:29:37,083 --> 01:29:39,082
because I understand him.

1043
01:29:39,333 --> 01:29:41,249
He's even good-looking.

1044
01:29:41,416 --> 01:29:45,082
Black eyes, brown skin.
A northern type.

1045
01:29:45,250 --> 01:29:48,874
Then we had pizza at a trattoria.
He always pays.

1046
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:50,665
Even for the flowers.

1047
01:29:51,083 --> 01:29:53,624
- Nothing? He wants nothing?
- 'Course not.

1048
01:29:53,791 --> 01:29:55,915
Do me a favor, Cabi!

1049
01:29:56,083 --> 01:29:58,874
I'll be meeting him again
tomorrow.

1050
01:29:59,041 --> 01:30:00,540
What's he after?

1051
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:03,457
How do I know?

1052
01:30:03,625 --> 01:30:06,749
And who cares?
As long as he pays!

1053
01:30:06,916 --> 01:30:08,290
Oh, sure!

1054
01:30:09,375 --> 01:30:12,374
The cops!

1055
01:30:14,666 --> 01:30:16,915
What you all need is jail!

1056
01:30:17,083 --> 01:30:19,040
Arrest them all!

1057
01:30:19,208 --> 01:30:22,207
I'm not running away.
If you want me, I'm here!

1058
01:30:57,875 --> 01:31:00,707
How are you?
How elegant you look today!

1059
01:31:00,875 --> 01:31:02,540
How are you feeling?

1060
01:31:03,125 --> 01:31:06,915
- Fine, and you?
- Thank you. Here...for you.

1061
01:31:08,041 --> 01:31:10,915
- Thank you. You shouldn't have.
- Don't mention it.

1062
01:31:11,083 --> 01:31:12,790
- It's too much.
- Take it.

1063
01:31:13,875 --> 01:31:15,332
Where shall we go?

1064
01:31:15,708 --> 01:31:17,374
Wherever you want.

1065
01:31:17,708 --> 01:31:18,915
Sunny day.

1066
01:31:19,875 --> 01:31:21,582
Let's go to the Aventino.

1067
01:31:28,250 --> 01:31:30,165
Your family's not from Rome?

1068
01:31:30,375 --> 01:31:32,249
No. I have no family left.

1069
01:31:32,416 --> 01:31:35,082
My mother and father
died when I was a child.

1070
01:31:35,541 --> 01:31:38,124
Loneliness is a heavy burden,
but I'd rather be alone

1071
01:31:38,333 --> 01:31:40,707
than make compromises.

1072
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:45,374
We lived in Puglia,
in a small village.

1073
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:48,957
The name is unimportant.
You wouldn't know it.

1074
01:31:49,375 --> 01:31:53,082
I grew up in an old house.
I remember the oil lamps.

1075
01:31:53,666 --> 01:31:57,249
My father owned a small plot
of land. His name was Giovanni.

1076
01:31:59,333 --> 01:32:01,582
My mother's name was Elsa,
the poor soul.

1077
01:32:01,750 --> 01:32:04,040
I like the name Elsa.
It's pretty.

1078
01:32:05,666 --> 01:32:09,040
I had no brothers or sisters.
When my father died

1079
01:32:09,208 --> 01:32:11,499
some ruthless relatives
robbed my mother

1080
01:32:11,666 --> 01:32:14,499
of what little property she had,
leaving us very poor.

1081
01:32:14,708 --> 01:32:16,207
I went looking for work.

1082
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:40,874
What are you doing, my child?

1083
01:33:42,291 --> 01:33:43,415
Good day, Father.

1084
01:33:43,583 --> 01:33:45,165
Some alms for Sant'Antonio?

1085
01:33:45,333 --> 01:33:46,999
Sorry, I've no money on me.

1086
01:33:47,166 --> 01:33:49,540
Never mind. Some other time.

1087
01:33:49,708 --> 01:33:52,457
What's important is
to always be in God's grace.

1088
01:33:52,625 --> 01:33:55,499
You are in God's grace,
aren't you, my child?

1089
01:33:57,125 --> 01:33:58,999
You're not in God's grace?

1090
01:34:02,875 --> 01:34:04,040
Why not?

1091
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:10,957
Everyone should be
in God's grace.

1092
01:34:11,125 --> 01:34:13,457
Whoever lives in God's grace
is happy.

1093
01:34:14,250 --> 01:34:17,790
I'm in God's grace
and I'm happy.

1094
01:34:18,916 --> 01:34:22,165
I even went to the Madonna
to ask for Her grace.

1095
01:34:22,583 --> 01:34:27,290
Maybe you didn't know how to
ask, or maybe you didn't need it.

1096
01:34:27,875 --> 01:34:29,457
Are you married?

1097
01:34:30,208 --> 01:34:33,832
That's bad. Girls should get
married and make children.

1098
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:36,249
Matrimony is a sacred thing.

1099
01:34:36,583 --> 01:34:40,665
In the grace of God, my child.
Ask Sant'Antonio for help.

1100
01:34:40,833 --> 01:34:44,249
If you need me,
I'm Brother Giovanni.

1101
01:34:46,333 --> 01:34:50,790
I'm at the San Francesco
Monastery, but I'm hard to find.

1102
01:34:51,333 --> 01:34:52,957
I'm always running around.

1103
01:35:13,625 --> 01:35:15,040
Hey, Blondie!

1104
01:35:22,083 --> 01:35:23,624
So long!

1105
01:35:26,291 --> 01:35:27,415
Tomorrow?

1106
01:35:27,583 --> 01:35:28,832
Tomorrow I'm busy.

1107
01:35:29,708 --> 01:35:31,707
Then the day after tomorrow.
Same time.

1108
01:35:31,875 --> 01:35:34,082
I'm busy then, too.

1109
01:35:39,208 --> 01:35:41,040
I was gonna tell you...

1110
01:35:41,208 --> 01:35:43,165
I dunno if I'll keep seeing you.

1111
01:35:43,333 --> 01:35:44,624
But, why?

1112
01:35:48,583 --> 01:35:51,540
It's not that I'm
uncomfortable with you.

1113
01:35:54,166 --> 01:35:55,790
But what's the point?

1114
01:35:56,833 --> 01:35:58,665
What am I doing with you?

1115
01:35:58,833 --> 01:36:00,540
We're both wasting our time.

1116
01:36:01,250 --> 01:36:02,415
And doing what?

1117
01:36:03,583 --> 01:36:06,124
Anyway, what do you
want from me?

1118
01:36:07,458 --> 01:36:11,332
If you want...I'll marry you.

1119
01:36:18,958 --> 01:36:20,874
I wanted to ask you before.

1120
01:36:23,125 --> 01:36:26,332
But I didn't have the courage.
I've wanted to...

1121
01:36:27,916 --> 01:36:30,540
to ask you since
the first time I saw you.

1122
01:36:32,500 --> 01:36:33,665
What are you saying?

1123
01:36:35,208 --> 01:36:36,749
Marry me?

1124
01:36:37,708 --> 01:36:42,040
What are you saying?
Marry someone you saw 10 times?

1125
01:36:42,833 --> 01:36:45,874
That's not how it's done!
Really!

1126
01:36:46,041 --> 01:36:48,707
Thank God I'm an honest woman!

1127
01:36:48,875 --> 01:36:51,582
That's not how it's done.
Excuse-me.

1128
01:36:52,541 --> 01:36:54,415
What do you know about me?

1129
01:36:54,875 --> 01:36:56,290
Who I am?

1130
01:36:58,541 --> 01:37:00,749
You ask me like that?

1131
01:37:01,458 --> 01:37:03,707
I'm no fool!

1132
01:37:04,208 --> 01:37:06,165
And you chose me!

1133
01:37:16,333 --> 01:37:19,915
I've asked you no question.
I don't want to know anything.

1134
01:37:23,875 --> 01:37:25,790
Prejudices don't touch me.

1135
01:37:28,500 --> 01:37:31,415
Because... what matters

1136
01:37:32,416 --> 01:37:34,540
is that I know your inner self.

1137
01:37:35,708 --> 01:37:38,707
We are...we are
two lonely creatures.

1138
01:37:46,166 --> 01:37:49,915
We have to stick together.
I need you.

1139
01:37:52,416 --> 01:37:54,040
Don't tell me that.

1140
01:37:55,583 --> 01:37:57,165
Don't, if it isn't true.

1141
01:37:57,333 --> 01:37:58,457
But it is!

1142
01:38:12,666 --> 01:38:16,582
What did you do?
What is it, you nut?

1143
01:38:16,875 --> 01:38:19,124
I'm getting married!

1144
01:38:19,291 --> 01:38:23,665
He asked me to marry him! We're
buying a store in Grotta Ferrata!

1145
01:38:23,833 --> 01:38:25,790
He's almost signed the contract.

1146
01:38:25,958 --> 01:38:30,124
Without me knowing, he arranged
it all: a store, a house!

1147
01:38:30,291 --> 01:38:34,499
I'm selling everything!
I'll sell the house...the house...

1148
01:38:36,208 --> 01:38:38,499
We're getting married
in two weeks!

1149
01:38:39,208 --> 01:38:41,915
Wanda, I'm leaving!

1150
01:38:42,500 --> 01:38:44,249
Does he know that you...

1151
01:38:44,375 --> 01:38:46,457
Of course he knows!
I told him everything.

1152
01:38:46,625 --> 01:38:49,040
I didn't hide anything
from him.

1153
01:38:49,250 --> 01:38:51,249
But he's a saint. An angel!

1154
01:38:51,458 --> 01:38:54,457
He didn't want to know
anything. He didn't care.

1155
01:38:54,625 --> 01:38:57,707
He loves me! He loves me!

1156
01:38:58,041 --> 01:38:59,832
Wanda! He loves me!

1157
01:39:16,708 --> 01:39:17,999
Who's there?

1158
01:39:22,375 --> 01:39:24,749
- Hello.
- May I see Brother Giovanni?

1159
01:39:24,916 --> 01:39:27,957
He's not back yet.
Why do you want to see him?

1160
01:39:28,125 --> 01:39:31,624
- To confess to him.
- Go to church for confession.

1161
01:39:33,250 --> 01:39:35,999
I want Father Giovanni
to hear my confession.

1162
01:39:36,166 --> 01:39:39,874
He can't hear your confession.
He's not an ordained priest.

1163
01:39:40,375 --> 01:39:43,790
I know, but...
I'll wait for Father Giovanni.

1164
01:39:44,166 --> 01:39:46,082
Fine. Then wait.

1165
01:39:58,375 --> 01:40:01,915
Why'd you pack this?
I'm not taking that!

1166
01:40:02,083 --> 01:40:04,040
Should I take the owl?

1167
01:40:04,208 --> 01:40:07,540
Nah, it brings bad luck.
But I'll take the seashell.

1168
01:40:07,708 --> 01:40:10,540
See if it fits.
If it fits, I'll take it.

1169
01:40:11,125 --> 01:40:13,207
I sold that.
Put it over there.

1170
01:40:13,541 --> 01:40:18,082
What a waste!
Leaving all this good stuff.

1171
01:40:18,250 --> 01:40:21,249
- Here are the dishes.
- Sold. Leave 'em!

1172
01:40:21,416 --> 01:40:22,457
Them, too?

1173
01:40:22,625 --> 01:40:24,999
Why not?
I got paid for them.

1174
01:40:25,208 --> 01:40:27,915
It would cost more
to move everything.

1175
01:40:28,416 --> 01:40:32,707
He sold everything back home.
So I'm selling everything, too.

1176
01:40:32,875 --> 01:40:33,582
All new!

1177
01:40:33,750 --> 01:40:38,249
Me, I'd have taken all the stuff.
Are you forgetting anything?

1178
01:40:38,416 --> 01:40:39,874
What could I forget?

1179
01:40:40,125 --> 01:40:43,332
- Did you take the money?
- Of course! I'm no idiot!

1180
01:40:44,583 --> 01:40:45,957
See? You forgot your fur.

1181
01:40:46,125 --> 01:40:48,290
Fur? What fur?

1182
01:40:48,541 --> 01:40:50,790
- No! I don't want that.
- Give it to my aunt?

1183
01:40:50,958 --> 01:40:53,957
Sure, but hurry!
They're waiting to move in!

1184
01:40:54,125 --> 01:40:56,457
Damn it! Those low-lives.

1185
01:40:56,625 --> 01:40:59,040
Close the suitcase. Tight.

1186
01:41:01,458 --> 01:41:02,749
Oh, la mamma!

1187
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:12,874
Take one more look...
and then I'm getting married.

1188
01:41:13,041 --> 01:41:15,540
- What?
- I'm getting married, too.

1189
01:41:15,708 --> 01:41:17,749
What did I say? Nothing.

1190
01:41:29,333 --> 01:41:30,790
How do I look?

1191
01:41:32,041 --> 01:41:32,957
Real good.

1192
01:41:33,833 --> 01:41:35,415
It cost me 1 ,200 lire.

1193
01:41:35,625 --> 01:41:37,040
You got robbed.

1194
01:41:37,458 --> 01:41:39,040
You paid too much.

1195
01:41:42,166 --> 01:41:43,790
Ah, my pocketbook.

1196
01:41:43,958 --> 01:41:46,457
Goodbye, D'Artagnan.
Let's get going.

1197
01:41:47,500 --> 01:41:49,749
Time to leave.
Let's get going.

1198
01:42:03,791 --> 01:42:07,249
See them? I can't stand
those starving bastards.

1199
01:42:10,583 --> 01:42:11,874
Let's go.

1200
01:42:18,375 --> 01:42:22,040
Here are the house keys.
I'm leaving. Arrivederci.

1201
01:42:24,125 --> 01:42:27,749
If you need anything, just tell
my friend, Signorina Wanda.

1202
01:42:27,916 --> 01:42:30,249
She'll write to me.
Arriverderci.

1203
01:42:31,166 --> 01:42:33,165
Have a good trip. Good luck!

1204
01:42:33,333 --> 01:42:35,290
Thank you. Likewise.

1205
01:42:50,791 --> 01:42:53,665
Never mind. I don't wanna
say goodbye to anybody.

1206
01:42:54,333 --> 01:42:56,124
It's better that way.

1207
01:42:56,291 --> 01:42:59,332
I'm so happy now,
and then all these people...

1208
01:42:59,500 --> 01:43:01,415
They'll ask questions...

1209
01:43:02,666 --> 01:43:03,832
I'm leaving.
I'm getting married!

1210
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:08,124
- Send us some wedding candy!
- I will!

1211
01:43:10,291 --> 01:43:13,957
Say goodbye to Nando and
his uncle, and to everyone.

1212
01:43:23,250 --> 01:43:24,374
Nice, eh?

1213
01:43:25,458 --> 01:43:26,874
They're pretty.

1214
01:43:31,833 --> 01:43:33,665
You're getting married

1215
01:43:33,833 --> 01:43:37,165
and I never met
this fiancé of yours.

1216
01:43:37,333 --> 01:43:39,874
I couldn't bring him
where everybody knows me.

1217
01:43:41,250 --> 01:43:42,707
Here's the bus.

1218
01:43:45,458 --> 01:43:46,540
It's here.

1219
01:43:54,583 --> 01:43:57,874
Ciao, Wanda....
Why are you crying?

1220
01:43:59,250 --> 01:44:00,624
Who's crying?

1221
01:44:00,833 --> 01:44:02,124
Aren't you crying?

1222
01:44:04,708 --> 01:44:08,665
I'll write the minute I get there
with my address.

1223
01:44:09,916 --> 01:44:12,165
And you'll get married, too.

1224
01:44:12,916 --> 01:44:13,790
Let's go.

1225
01:44:14,083 --> 01:44:18,374
Hurry, the suitcase.
I'll send my address right away.

1226
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:36,040
Stay out of trouble.
You'll get a miracle, like me.

1227
01:44:36,208 --> 01:44:38,749
- Yeah, sure.
- It'll happen.

1228
01:45:22,083 --> 01:45:24,749
- What are you doing?
- I want to pay.

1229
01:45:24,916 --> 01:45:27,707
- But there's no reason...
- Please! You've always paid.

1230
01:45:27,875 --> 01:45:30,374
Anyway, what's mine is yours now.

1231
01:45:30,541 --> 01:45:33,124
It's all the same, isn't it?

1232
01:45:36,583 --> 01:45:37,832
Waiter!

1233
01:45:43,958 --> 01:45:45,332
It's getting late.

1234
01:45:49,041 --> 01:45:51,624
You'll see how beautiful
the sunsets are up here.

1235
01:45:59,041 --> 01:46:00,999
You want to get me drunk?

1236
01:46:01,541 --> 01:46:03,332
It's such a light wine.

1237
01:46:12,708 --> 01:46:14,165
The money.

1238
01:46:16,500 --> 01:46:17,915
Put it away.

1239
01:46:19,833 --> 01:46:21,290
It's my dowry.

1240
01:46:24,375 --> 01:46:27,874
350,000 for the house.
That's all those crooks would pay.

1241
01:46:28,041 --> 01:46:31,165
They knew I was in a hurry,
so they took advantage.

1242
01:46:31,333 --> 01:46:34,457
Then I got all my money
from the bank.

1243
01:46:34,625 --> 01:46:35,957
400,000.

1244
01:46:36,875 --> 01:46:39,332
See? I made them give me
all new bills.

1245
01:47:00,333 --> 01:47:03,207
Because you never asked
if I had money...

1246
01:47:03,583 --> 01:47:06,832
You, you're an angel,
a saint!

1247
01:47:07,541 --> 01:47:12,124
If you knew what I went through
to end up with this money.

1248
01:47:12,500 --> 01:47:15,540
I told you, I don't want to know.
Please!

1249
01:47:16,416 --> 01:47:18,290
Let's get away from here.

1250
01:47:19,875 --> 01:47:22,457
The beatings I took.

1251
01:47:22,625 --> 01:47:26,165
You see, some guys are
just after a girl's money.

1252
01:47:26,333 --> 01:47:28,332
You wouldn't believe it.

1253
01:47:28,791 --> 01:47:32,249
Everything for love.
But not that way.

1254
01:47:32,416 --> 01:47:35,540
But what about my old age?

1255
01:47:35,666 --> 01:47:37,499
Who worries about my old age?

1256
01:47:37,625 --> 01:47:39,165
I'm sorry...

1257
01:47:41,833 --> 01:47:44,332
Waiter, keep the change.

1258
01:47:44,500 --> 01:47:45,665
Let's go.

1259
01:47:46,458 --> 01:47:49,915
I didn't want to go on
like that forever.

1260
01:47:50,083 --> 01:47:53,124
I'd have quit if I could,
even tomorrow.

1261
01:47:53,291 --> 01:47:54,582
I'd have gone away.

1262
01:47:55,375 --> 01:47:58,665
To live that way forever?
I already owned the house.

1263
01:47:58,833 --> 01:48:00,624
Know what me
and Wanda planned?

1264
01:48:00,791 --> 01:48:02,790
Rent a newsstand.

1265
01:48:03,041 --> 01:48:08,165
Understand? You didn't exist...
Where are we going?

1266
01:48:08,416 --> 01:48:09,707
It's so nice here.

1267
01:48:09,875 --> 01:48:12,124
Let's take a little walk. O.K.?

1268
01:48:13,750 --> 01:48:16,082
I don't even remember
how I started.

1269
01:48:16,250 --> 01:48:19,374
I was a child,
that's all I remember.

1270
01:48:20,125 --> 01:48:21,499
And the suitcases?

1271
01:48:21,791 --> 01:48:23,499
We'll take them later.

1272
01:48:24,375 --> 01:48:27,165
You should have seen me at fifteen

1273
01:48:27,333 --> 01:48:31,040
with my black hair,
long, down to here.

1274
01:48:31,208 --> 01:48:33,957
Who understood anything?
My motherjust wanted the money.

1275
01:48:34,125 --> 01:48:35,915
Where are we going?

1276
01:48:36,083 --> 01:48:38,290
I don't know.
We're just strolling.

1277
01:48:39,375 --> 01:48:41,249
What's the name of that song?

1278
01:48:55,416 --> 01:48:56,790
Won't you kiss me?

1279
01:49:20,875 --> 01:49:21,874
Come...

1280
01:49:23,208 --> 01:49:24,165
I know a shortcut.

1281
01:49:54,208 --> 01:49:56,374
Oscar! Where are you?

1282
01:49:56,833 --> 01:49:59,832
What a bad boy you are!

1283
01:50:02,791 --> 01:50:05,165
Look at these flowers.
Like 'em?

1284
01:50:05,333 --> 01:50:07,040
They stink, but still...

1285
01:50:08,041 --> 01:50:10,207
I never saw flowers
like these before.

1286
01:50:10,375 --> 01:50:11,540
Let's go.

1287
01:50:11,958 --> 01:50:13,124
I'm coming.

1288
01:50:16,750 --> 01:50:19,499
Smell them.
What kind of flowers are they?

1289
01:50:20,125 --> 01:50:22,082
What's wrong? Are you sad?

1290
01:50:22,708 --> 01:50:23,832
Me? No. Why?

1291
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:26,457
You stopped singing.
Wait a minute.

1292
01:50:31,250 --> 01:50:34,124
Why don't we carve
our initials on the trees?

1293
01:50:35,666 --> 01:50:37,790
Let's go and watch the sunset.

1294
01:50:37,958 --> 01:50:42,082
The sunset, eh?
Where do you wanna go?

1295
01:50:57,875 --> 01:50:59,540
What a strange light.

1296
01:51:15,083 --> 01:51:16,457
Beautiful, isn't it?

1297
01:51:19,875 --> 01:51:22,624
Guess there's some justice
in the world.

1298
01:51:24,583 --> 01:51:28,540
You suffer,
you go through hell...

1299
01:51:29,875 --> 01:51:33,499
but then happiness
comes along for everyone.

1300
01:51:36,208 --> 01:51:38,040
You've been my angel.

1301
01:51:38,708 --> 01:51:41,290
Your hand is freezing.
Are you cold?

1302
01:51:44,833 --> 01:51:46,499
Having regrets?

1303
01:51:49,708 --> 01:51:50,915
Beautiful, eh?

1304
01:51:52,333 --> 01:51:54,165
Look how deep it is!

1305
01:51:54,625 --> 01:51:57,124
I'd love a boat ride
right now.

1306
01:51:58,375 --> 01:52:01,040
Are there any boats
down there now?

1307
01:52:01,208 --> 01:52:03,374
- Can you swim?
- Not me!

1308
01:52:03,916 --> 01:52:06,915
I almost drowned once.
But they saved me.

1309
01:52:07,083 --> 01:52:09,207
Just imagine!
I was pushed in!

1310
01:52:13,458 --> 01:52:14,790
What's wrong?

1311
01:52:29,250 --> 01:52:30,832
What's the matter?

1312
01:52:33,791 --> 01:52:36,249
You don't want to kill me,
do you?

1313
01:52:38,333 --> 01:52:39,874
Answer me!

1314
01:52:40,833 --> 01:52:42,582
You want to kill me?

1315
01:52:44,708 --> 01:52:46,415
You want to kill me!

1316
01:52:47,333 --> 01:52:50,874
Don'tjust stand there.
Say something!

1317
01:52:51,541 --> 01:52:56,249
Speak! Don't be like that!
Speak!

1318
01:52:57,625 --> 01:52:59,040
Tell me.

1319
01:53:04,708 --> 01:53:06,124
For the money?

1320
01:53:09,500 --> 01:53:11,457
For the money...

1321
01:53:37,833 --> 01:53:40,790
Kill me!
Throw me off the cliff!

1322
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:44,374
I don't wanna live anymore!

1323
01:53:47,875 --> 01:53:52,124
Kill me!
I don't wanna live anymore!

1324
01:53:52,291 --> 01:53:54,665
Kill me!

1325
01:53:54,833 --> 01:53:56,457
Throw me off!

1326
01:54:03,500 --> 01:54:04,540
Shut up!

1327
01:54:07,208 --> 01:54:10,624
I don't want to hurt you.
Can't you see that?

1328
01:54:11,458 --> 01:54:13,582
I don't wanna live anymore!

1329
01:54:17,333 --> 01:54:19,040
Kill me!

1330
01:55:44,125 --> 01:55:48,040
Maurizio, hurry up!
We're leaving.

1331
01:55:59,166 --> 01:56:02,457
We're gonna lose our way
going home!
