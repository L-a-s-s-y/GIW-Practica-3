1
00:02:31,125 --> 00:02:32,875
Who's there?

2
00:02:36,083 --> 00:02:38,000
Who's there?

3
00:02:45,625 --> 00:02:47,583
Crazy...

4
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:51,750
Crazy...

5
00:03:16,083 --> 00:03:18,750
Viktor Mixajlov

6
00:03:20,625 --> 00:03:23,208
Vera Majorova

7
00:03:24,542 --> 00:03:27,083
Vadim Lobanov

8
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:31,292
Irina Rakshina

9
00:03:33,167 --> 00:03:35,542
Aleksandr Rasinskij

10
00:03:37,375 --> 00:03:39,667
in

11
00:03:42,333 --> 00:03:47,458
A Visitor to the Museum

12
00:03:53,375 --> 00:03:54,917
Written and Directed by

13
00:03:55,333 --> 00:03:58,667
Konstantin Lopushanskij

14
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:37,750
What do you want
 from me?

15
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:24,333
Where's the railroad line
 around here?

16
00:08:26,708 --> 00:08:28,792
I'm looking for
 the dump train.

17
00:08:28,792 --> 00:08:32,417
The garbage train -
 where does it stop?

18
00:08:33,042 --> 00:08:34,667
Come inside.

19
00:08:41,958 --> 00:08:45,500
Come in quickly, you're
 letting the dust in.

20
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,875
This way...

21
00:08:56,208 --> 00:08:58,083
Can I have some
 water, please?

22
00:08:58,083 --> 00:09:01,583
Sure, sure.

23
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,625
It's the dust.

24
00:09:06,083 --> 00:09:08,042
The cups are dirty...

25
00:09:09,208 --> 00:09:11,792
The dust here is terrible.

26
00:09:11,792 --> 00:09:14,708
It's better if you cover
 your mouth.

27
00:09:14,708 --> 00:09:17,292
The dust is bad for you.

28
00:09:20,625 --> 00:09:23,208
Drink.
 -Thank you.

29
00:09:26,417 --> 00:09:31,042
The garbage train will be
 another hour at least.

30
00:09:31,042 --> 00:09:34,125
You can rest here.

31
00:09:34,125 --> 00:09:36,917
Would you like something
 to eat?

32
00:09:36,917 --> 00:09:39,042
We run a tavern here,
 very reasonable prices.

33
00:09:39,042 --> 00:09:41,042
Thank you, I'm not hungry.

34
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:44,958
Maybe a cup of coffee
 and a sandwich?

35
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:50,083
Come this way.

36
00:11:10,708 --> 00:11:14,333
What's that in the windows?
 Why is it burning?

37
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,208
To keep them out
 of the house.

38
00:11:19,208 --> 00:11:23,708
There's a reservation nearby.
 The degenerates.

39
00:11:24,292 --> 00:11:26,208
They climb through
 the windows.

40
00:11:26,208 --> 00:11:28,833
Especially at night.

41
00:11:28,833 --> 00:11:30,958
What a fright.

42
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:35,083
They're scared
 of fire, though.

43
00:11:35,083 --> 00:11:37,875
They're generally scared
 of fire, remember that.

44
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:40,208
You're here for the
 first time, no?

45
00:11:41,458 --> 00:11:43,208
First time.

46
00:11:44,125 --> 00:11:46,042
Going to the factory?

47
00:11:46,333 --> 00:11:49,625
No, the weather station.

48
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,375
Do they pay well?
 - Where?

49
00:11:53,375 --> 00:11:56,167
The station. Aren't you
 going to work there?

50
00:11:58,333 --> 00:12:02,083
No, I'm just a tourist.

51
00:12:03,667 --> 00:12:07,500
I'd like to visit the Museum.
 The one that's flooded.

52
00:12:09,958 --> 00:12:13,542
Ah, the museum. The whole
 world's gone mad.

53
00:12:13,542 --> 00:12:15,833
Many people going?

54
00:12:15,833 --> 00:12:19,833
Just the opposite.
 That's not the point.

55
00:12:20,542 --> 00:12:22,875
What is it then?

56
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:26,333
Many of them don't make it.

57
00:12:26,542 --> 00:12:30,750
They don't understand
 the sea. It’s no joke.

58
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:34,042
They told me the low tide
 lasts 7 days.

59
00:12:34,042 --> 00:12:36,833
Three days there,
 three back.

60
00:12:40,625 --> 00:12:43,042
What is the sea floor like
 when the water goes?

61
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:46,625
It's a desert.

62
00:12:46,875 --> 00:12:52,625
You can lose your way,
 and the tide comes quickly.

63
00:12:53,208 --> 00:12:57,958
A big wave comes
 and it's all over.

64
00:12:59,417 --> 00:13:02,250
What if you take
a life vest?

65
00:13:05,625 --> 00:13:13,000
A life vest? Good luck.
It's your business.

66
00:13:15,125 --> 00:13:20,125
I understand, you'd like
some pictures of the museum.

67
00:13:21,458 --> 00:13:25,625
I mean your own, not
something out of a book.

68
00:13:26,583 --> 00:13:29,667
I don't need photos.

69
00:13:30,542 --> 00:13:33,583
I want to touch it
with my own hands.

70
00:13:38,833 --> 00:13:42,750
Go on and eat. I'll be
back with coffee.

71
00:13:57,667 --> 00:13:59,667
A tourist?

72
00:14:02,583 --> 00:14:06,792
I'm asking you.
- Yes, a tourist.

73
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:11,792
Maybe he'll take
a room upstairs?

74
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,125
Tell him.

75
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:19,458
Why don't you
say something?

76
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:22,833
He's made arrangements
at the weather station.

77
00:14:22,833 --> 00:14:25,167
So what?

78
00:14:25,167 --> 00:14:28,958
It's cheaper here, and
he gets free board.

79
00:14:31,208 --> 00:14:32,917
Tell him.

80
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:37,042
I already told him.
- And?

81
00:14:51,417 --> 00:14:54,083
Father, put some clothes on!

82
00:15:00,917 --> 00:15:04,000
Pay no attention, he's mad.

83
00:15:05,042 --> 00:15:08,208
Why don't you
mind your business!

84
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:12,417
You never let me talk
to a real human being.

85
00:15:35,292 --> 00:15:38,208
Can you tell fortune
from the book?

86
00:15:45,208 --> 00:15:48,417
Tell my fortune.

87
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:51,250
Open at any place.

88
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,167
Point your finger.

89
00:15:55,167 --> 00:15:57,792
Close your eyes first.

90
00:16:09,583 --> 00:16:17,792
“…neither will they be persuaded,
though one rose from the dead.”

91
00:16:26,458 --> 00:16:30,667
What does it mean
rose from the dead?

92
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:38,042
What could it mean?

93
00:16:38,042 --> 00:16:40,125
I don't know.

94
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:42,000
What?

95
00:16:43,125 --> 00:16:45,167
I don't know.

96
00:16:55,625 --> 00:16:58,250
Do it again.

97
00:17:12,292 --> 00:17:18,750
“What is man, that thou art
mindful of him?”

98
00:17:19,792 --> 00:17:27,042
“and the son of man,
that thou visitest him?”

99
00:20:46,667 --> 00:20:50,750
Plenty of room, as you
can see. But it is cold.

100
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:53,708
Maybe on the other
side of the house?

101
00:20:55,333 --> 00:20:59,458
There's a nice room there,
especially reserved for you.

102
00:21:03,833 --> 00:21:08,792
No, I like it here
very much. Really.

103
00:21:17,625 --> 00:21:21,292
Please take this.
- Why, it can wait.

104
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:24,042
All meals are served
in the dining room.

105
00:21:24,042 --> 00:21:25,792
I can bring them up
to the room.

106
00:21:25,792 --> 00:21:27,792
Don't trouble yourself.

107
00:21:29,125 --> 00:21:31,792
I will call you down
to dinner then.

108
00:22:53,167 --> 00:22:56,625
Fashions changing again.

109
00:22:57,292 --> 00:23:00,083
Is it alright without sound?

110
00:23:00,083 --> 00:23:02,917
I don't like when it's noisy.

111
00:23:08,792 --> 00:23:10,833
Here you go.

112
00:23:53,625 --> 00:23:58,667
Are you done?
What do you say?

113
00:24:03,417 --> 00:24:06,083
Bon appetit.

114
00:24:06,417 --> 00:24:08,583
You can go.

115
00:24:13,917 --> 00:24:15,792
Thank you.

116
00:24:23,417 --> 00:24:25,917
Forgive me, I forgot
to ask you.

117
00:24:25,917 --> 00:24:29,333
If you mind, they can
eat downstairs.

118
00:24:29,333 --> 00:24:34,250
No, no... Who are they?

119
00:24:37,292 --> 00:24:39,958
They're like servants.

120
00:24:39,958 --> 00:24:43,333
Distant relatives...
-Right.

121
00:24:44,542 --> 00:24:48,000
Brother and sister. Both
came from the reservation.

122
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,500
We keep them as servants,
there's too much work here for us.

123
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:55,792
We're educating them
as best we can.

124
00:24:55,792 --> 00:25:00,250
You should have seen them
a year ago.

125
00:25:00,667 --> 00:25:03,625
I don't know what they teach
them at the reservation.

126
00:25:03,625 --> 00:25:06,833
Nothing, that's the trouble.

127
00:25:07,375 --> 00:25:09,375
I'll have you know
that 40% of children

128
00:25:09,375 --> 00:25:13,083
are born degenerate
every year.

129
00:25:13,375 --> 00:25:16,833
You can imagine
what we're facing.

130
00:25:16,833 --> 00:25:21,750
I beg you not to mention
the museum in front of them.

131
00:25:25,333 --> 00:25:28,500
Sure... why?

132
00:25:30,083 --> 00:25:35,167
The degenerates have
a religious holiday at low tide.

133
00:25:35,542 --> 00:25:40,625
Priests, etc., religious
psychosis, hysteria.

134
00:25:41,167 --> 00:25:43,167
There may be
a disturbance.

135
00:25:43,167 --> 00:25:47,083
At the reservation,
of course, not here.

136
00:25:48,833 --> 00:25:53,500
You mean the Feast
of Branches?

137
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:57,250
Yes, branches.

138
00:25:58,917 --> 00:26:00,667
Strange...

139
00:26:00,667 --> 00:26:02,792
What is?

140
00:26:02,792 --> 00:26:05,583
Yes, what is strange?

141
00:26:05,583 --> 00:26:09,458
Aren't they afraid of fire?

142
00:26:09,458 --> 00:26:14,875
But they light the
branches on fire...

143
00:26:14,875 --> 00:26:19,500
Nothing strange here.
They worship what they fear.

144
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:23,750
Don't we have anything better
to talk about than degenerates?

145
00:26:25,625 --> 00:26:29,667
Tell us what news
there is in the city.

146
00:26:29,667 --> 00:26:33,375
Do you live in the city
or the suburbs?

147
00:26:37,792 --> 00:26:41,583
I'm in the city,
basically downtown.

148
00:26:41,917 --> 00:26:45,208
Then tell us about it.

149
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:53,875
I don't know what to say.
Nothing new, I guess...

150
00:27:03,125 --> 00:27:06,583
You'll have to take
some water with you.

151
00:27:07,917 --> 00:27:11,708
Food and water are
most important.

152
00:27:14,167 --> 00:27:16,542
Do you have a map?

153
00:27:16,542 --> 00:27:18,750
Yes, of course.

154
00:27:20,625 --> 00:27:25,125
The terrain is difficult.
The sea floor is slimy.

155
00:27:26,458 --> 00:27:29,292
Uneven too.

156
00:27:32,708 --> 00:27:38,250
This is the place. You'll
start from here.

157
00:28:04,792 --> 00:28:08,792
The degenerates don't go
to the Museum?

158
00:28:09,083 --> 00:28:12,333
Of course not.
They're too weak.

159
00:28:12,333 --> 00:28:17,333
You have to be in
very good shape.

160
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:24,125
Seven days of travel
is no joke.

161
00:28:24,542 --> 00:28:27,458
Not every healthy man
can take it.

162
00:28:29,583 --> 00:28:32,708
Have you ever tried it?

163
00:28:34,542 --> 00:28:37,000
What do I need it for?

164
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,250
There is a stench here,
can you smell it?

165
00:28:43,625 --> 00:28:46,667
Chemicals?
– Yes, chemical waste.

166
00:28:46,875 --> 00:28:49,917
The sea is basically dead.

167
00:28:55,958 --> 00:28:59,542
Have there been other
visitors recently?

168
00:28:59,625 --> 00:29:02,333
We had many here.

169
00:29:02,667 --> 00:29:05,375
Not everyone stays with us.

170
00:29:05,375 --> 00:29:08,708
There was a girl with
some guys last year.

171
00:29:09,292 --> 00:29:12,917
They only walked half way
and came back.

172
00:29:12,917 --> 00:29:16,042
They were afraid of getting
caught in the tide.

173
00:29:16,042 --> 00:29:19,500
A married couple came
two years ago.

174
00:29:20,167 --> 00:29:21,917
They drowned.

175
00:29:22,583 --> 00:29:26,125
I guess they didn't
count the days right.

176
00:29:27,083 --> 00:29:30,208
Or maybe they lost their way.

177
00:29:32,125 --> 00:29:37,167
To tell the truth, many
people die here.

178
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:40,708
Better think it over carefully.

179
00:29:44,125 --> 00:29:46,542
What is it?

180
00:29:55,667 --> 00:29:59,083
Don't worry, it's nothing.

181
00:31:12,958 --> 00:31:14,917
The Mound is the main thing.

182
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:18,708
The heart of the Museum.

183
00:31:22,292 --> 00:31:24,917
No mound in here, though.

184
00:31:26,875 --> 00:31:29,042
What about the encyclopedia?

185
00:31:29,042 --> 00:31:31,042
Only pictures there.

186
00:31:31,042 --> 00:31:34,250
Hold on... Let me think...

187
00:31:35,250 --> 00:31:39,542
What makes you think
 the Mound is the main thing?

188
00:31:40,458 --> 00:31:46,292
The Museum is a city
first and foremost.

189
00:31:49,583 --> 00:31:51,333
A city.

190
00:31:53,958 --> 00:31:55,917
Who knows...

191
00:31:57,417 --> 00:32:01,583
The priests in their
so-called sacred texts...

192
00:32:03,458 --> 00:32:07,125
What? What about
the priests?

193
00:32:10,958 --> 00:32:16,000
... speak of the Mound,
the Museum.

194
00:32:18,542 --> 00:32:24,333
And a path shall open from this
age to the beginning of time.

195
00:32:24,333 --> 00:32:26,750
An ancient city
will be revealed

196
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:30,000
with its great mysteries.

197
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,917
A mound will stand
outside the city

198
00:32:32,917 --> 00:32:38,625
upon which rises...
and so forth.

199
00:32:41,375 --> 00:32:45,667
That's what it says, so
the Mound is the main thing.

200
00:32:46,458 --> 00:32:52,125
Enough. How can you take
seriously all that nonsense?

201
00:32:54,875 --> 00:32:57,292
The priests' texts are not
as naive as it seems.

202
00:32:57,292 --> 00:33:01,708
I didn't say naive.
I'm saying crazy.

203
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:06,417
The priests are just another
kind of degenerates.

204
00:33:07,792 --> 00:33:10,375
Don't kid yourself about that.

205
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,708
I can allow them their own
degenerate culture, religion...

206
00:33:14,917 --> 00:33:17,833
Why not?

207
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:23,042
Madness is not an argument.

208
00:33:23,708 --> 00:33:27,875
Our own culture has
a trace of it too.

209
00:33:30,542 --> 00:33:35,458
"Let him become a fool
that he may be wise..."

210
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:40,250
"For the wisdom of this world
is foolishness with God."

211
00:33:42,667 --> 00:33:46,125
I believe Paul said that,
the Apostle.

212
00:33:46,125 --> 00:33:49,125
He had something else in mind.

213
00:33:52,667 --> 00:33:57,458
Why's that? Essentially
the same thing.

214
00:34:41,417 --> 00:34:43,417
Come in.

215
00:34:43,917 --> 00:34:46,208
I forgot to mention it,

216
00:34:46,208 --> 00:34:49,000
you’ll have to register
with the Inspection.

217
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,083
It's silly, but rules are rules.

218
00:34:52,083 --> 00:34:53,833
Does it have to be today?

219
00:34:53,833 --> 00:34:57,417
Today. It's mandatory.

220
00:34:57,625 --> 00:35:01,458
What if I don't register?
I'll just be a few days.

221
00:35:01,458 --> 00:35:06,292
Sorry, not allowed. We
can get in trouble.

222
00:35:06,292 --> 00:35:11,333
Anyone going to the Museum
must register.

223
00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:16,500
Certainly... Where is
this Inspection?

224
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:19,083
At the Reservation,
on factory grounds.

225
00:35:19,083 --> 00:35:21,042
The maid will take you there.

226
00:35:21,042 --> 00:35:24,167
She's going there for a
vaccine shot anyway.

227
00:35:24,667 --> 00:35:29,167
Ah, there's the dinner bell.
We'll wait for you.

228
00:36:04,208 --> 00:36:07,458
Who are the people
in the basement?

229
00:36:11,375 --> 00:36:13,500
They're our guests.

230
00:36:14,292 --> 00:36:17,667
Is that so? Guests?

231
00:36:19,292 --> 00:36:24,750
From the Reservation?
Is that what you mean?

232
00:36:26,583 --> 00:36:30,292
It's the Feast of
the Branches.

233
00:36:30,292 --> 00:36:35,208
The Master permitted it.
I never ask for anything.

234
00:36:35,208 --> 00:36:37,833
Just once a year.

235
00:36:38,125 --> 00:36:44,875
I did permit it, for a very
short time. Just for the Feast.

236
00:36:44,875 --> 00:36:49,083
Very humane of you,
and pedagogical, too.

237
00:36:49,083 --> 00:36:53,000
Maybe I should leave my house,
so I don't get in the way?

238
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:56,708
Please, it's nothing
so terrible.

239
00:37:01,583 --> 00:37:09,083
Listen here, I don't want
your monkey guests

240
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:13,500
coming out into
the hallway.

241
00:37:13,792 --> 00:37:17,708
They are not to wander anywhere
outside the basement.

242
00:37:17,708 --> 00:37:21,417
I don't want to hear
any cries or noises.

243
00:37:21,417 --> 00:37:23,792
Got it?

244
00:37:24,292 --> 00:37:26,750
I understand.

245
00:37:27,917 --> 00:37:29,708
I promise.

246
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:34,000
Bon appetit.

247
00:37:50,583 --> 00:37:54,542
Thank you very much

248
00:37:54,542 --> 00:37:58,333
for your pleasant company.

249
00:38:03,292 --> 00:38:05,708
Get out!

250
00:39:02,875 --> 00:39:05,417
There was a city here?

251
00:39:05,958 --> 00:39:09,083
Where?
- Here.

252
00:39:10,458 --> 00:39:13,708
Maybe. I don't remember.

253
00:39:15,792 --> 00:39:23,958
Tell me, can I see
the priests?

254
00:39:26,667 --> 00:39:29,458
Just to take a look.

255
00:39:30,833 --> 00:39:33,167
Can you show me
where they are?

256
00:39:33,167 --> 00:39:35,958
Who?
- The priests.

257
00:39:37,042 --> 00:39:39,208
What is it, a temple?

258
00:39:39,208 --> 00:39:43,417
What is it called?
- Nothing.

259
00:39:45,958 --> 00:39:51,583
It's by the village,
behind the Reservation.

260
00:39:52,167 --> 00:39:56,250
Will they let me in?
- No.

261
00:39:57,083 --> 00:40:00,625
What do I need to do
to get in?

262
00:40:00,625 --> 00:40:03,458
You have to pray.

263
00:40:03,458 --> 00:40:05,292
Knock on the wall?

264
00:40:05,292 --> 00:40:08,250
Knock and repeat the words.

265
00:40:08,250 --> 00:40:11,292
What words?

266
00:40:11,708 --> 00:40:16,833
Let me out of here.
You say it many times.

267
00:40:17,292 --> 00:40:20,625
Is that it?
- That's it.

268
00:40:20,625 --> 00:40:24,667
We only have one prayer.

269
00:40:27,625 --> 00:40:32,542
Let me out of where?
The Reservation?

270
00:40:33,542 --> 00:40:41,500
Out of here...
in general.

271
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,208
What is that?

272
00:42:54,292 --> 00:42:57,583
So, you're going
to the Museum?

273
00:42:59,292 --> 00:43:02,000
You have to fill out
this form.

274
00:43:07,875 --> 00:43:10,875
Write at the bottom:

275
00:43:11,833 --> 00:43:16,292
I have been warned
of possible dangers.

276
00:43:16,708 --> 00:43:21,208
I agree not to hold
the Inspection responsible.

277
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:23,458
What's it for, anyway?

278
00:43:24,542 --> 00:43:26,833
Just in case.

279
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,542
Not afraid of drowning?

280
00:43:32,542 --> 00:43:35,083
I'm counting on my luck.

281
00:43:36,125 --> 00:43:39,042
Some people are lucky,
it's true.

282
00:43:39,042 --> 00:43:44,958
But why risk your life,
just to see some ruins?

283
00:43:48,375 --> 00:43:52,083
It probably stinks
to high heaven.

284
00:43:52,333 --> 00:43:56,958
All the chemical waste,
it goes to the bottom.

285
00:44:02,208 --> 00:44:06,250
It's your business, I just
have to warn you.

286
00:44:12,917 --> 00:44:18,000
Check it out. Latest fashion.
- Where's you get it?

287
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:22,083
We got a whole load of them
from the dump train.

288
00:44:22,083 --> 00:44:26,042
Like new.
- I'll be right back.

289
00:46:50,708 --> 00:46:53,875
Who's there?

290
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,167
What?

291
00:52:22,833 --> 00:52:25,292
What do you want?

292
00:52:27,750 --> 00:52:31,083
What are you doing here?

293
00:52:37,208 --> 00:52:40,542
The Mistress is shouting.

294
00:52:41,083 --> 00:52:45,583
The Mistress. You hear?

295
00:52:56,792 --> 00:53:00,958
If you're scared,
 you can stay here.

296
00:53:03,083 --> 00:53:05,875
No, you...

297
00:53:07,375 --> 00:53:09,375
What about me?

298
00:53:09,375 --> 00:53:15,208
You come down to us,
I'm not allowed here.

299
00:53:33,792 --> 00:53:39,625
...they will progress. They've
already learned so much!

300
00:53:40,167 --> 00:53:45,792
It's vile, perverse,
can't you see that!

301
00:53:46,167 --> 00:53:52,792
How dare you!
They're our children!

302
00:54:03,042 --> 00:54:12,083
Let us out of here!
Let me out of here!

303
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:34,875
It is a curious
psychological phenomenon.

304
00:55:35,083 --> 00:55:39,333
Everyone says:
an ecological catastrophe.

305
00:55:39,625 --> 00:55:44,208
So what happens next?
Nothing.

306
00:55:44,542 --> 00:55:48,083
You can't shut down factories,
or stop experiments.

307
00:55:48,083 --> 00:55:50,208
A vicious circle.

308
00:55:50,458 --> 00:55:53,500
Personally, I think we couldn't
freeze the glaciers, either.

309
00:55:53,750 --> 00:55:57,542
Water levels will keep rising.
That's a fact.

310
00:55:58,083 --> 00:56:01,292
You're thinking another flood?

311
00:56:02,792 --> 00:56:07,792
Would that surprise you?
A flood, naturally.

312
00:56:08,042 --> 00:56:12,833
A real-life flood.
In about 50 years.

313
00:56:13,625 --> 00:56:19,292
None of us will be alive
for it, of course.

314
00:56:19,292 --> 00:56:23,292
That's why nobody
cares about it.

315
00:56:23,500 --> 00:56:25,375
Would you like some
tea with milk?

316
00:56:25,375 --> 00:56:27,750
Yes, please.

317
00:56:28,167 --> 00:56:31,125
Tea with milk purifies the blood.

318
00:56:31,125 --> 00:56:34,750
I read it in some magazine.

319
00:56:39,917 --> 00:56:42,875
Pardon us, please.

320
00:57:08,083 --> 00:57:13,083
I'm sorry. I don't understand.
It's somebody else. It's not me.

321
00:57:14,917 --> 00:57:20,417
Somebody's torturing me.
It's not me. I don't know who...

322
00:57:57,667 --> 00:58:02,000
Let us go over
yesterday's lesson.

323
00:58:02,458 --> 00:58:06,750
What has man created
in his time on earth?

324
00:58:08,958 --> 00:58:12,958
Man has created
a trash heap.

325
00:58:12,958 --> 00:58:17,125
Not a trash heap,
but material goods.

326
00:58:17,667 --> 00:58:22,833
Cities, goods.
Now you say it.

327
00:58:26,625 --> 00:58:30,083
Man has created goods.

328
00:58:30,083 --> 00:58:32,750
Pardon me. May I look
at the maps?

329
00:58:32,750 --> 00:58:34,917
Of course.

330
00:58:36,542 --> 00:58:40,000
Right. Let's move on.

331
00:58:43,083 --> 00:58:48,042
What was the mistake?
Can you tell me?

332
00:58:49,542 --> 00:58:53,458
Man has forgotten himself.

333
00:58:53,458 --> 00:58:56,250
Back to square one, I see.

334
00:58:56,250 --> 00:58:58,167
Come on, concentrate.

335
00:58:58,167 --> 00:59:00,542
What is this here?

336
00:59:00,542 --> 00:59:03,333
It's a curse.

337
00:59:04,958 --> 00:59:08,583
Fine, let's speak in metaphors.

338
00:59:08,583 --> 00:59:10,917
I agree that it's a curse.

339
00:59:10,917 --> 00:59:14,750
But how is it expressed,
through what processes?

340
00:59:15,875 --> 00:59:23,583
In that God has hidden
himself and Hell reigns...

341
00:59:23,583 --> 00:59:25,750
Where?

342
00:59:25,750 --> 00:59:30,875
Wherever there is man,
there is Hell.

343
00:59:31,667 --> 00:59:38,792
It is written, if you are born
here you are damned.

344
00:59:39,417 --> 00:59:42,667
Fine, what else does it say?

345
00:59:42,667 --> 00:59:48,750
It says, lusting after pleasure
shall devour you...

346
00:59:48,750 --> 00:59:54,417
Enough! I don't want to hear
about your scriptures!

347
00:59:54,917 --> 00:59:57,083
Think about it!

348
00:59:57,083 --> 00:59:59,792
What sort of prayer is it,
knocking on walls?

349
00:59:59,792 --> 01:00:03,917
What holy powers?
What sacred pages?

350
01:00:03,917 --> 01:00:06,875
They're not sacred,
they're made of paper.

351
01:00:06,875 --> 01:00:10,917
It's all madness,
ignorance and superstition.

352
01:00:10,917 --> 01:00:13,333
Sure, such sentiments
are inevitable

353
01:00:13,333 --> 01:00:16,875
in an age of ecological
catastrophies.

354
01:00:16,875 --> 01:00:19,583
But rational man
must confront them.

355
01:00:21,083 --> 01:00:23,667
I don't want to hear
about any god!

356
01:00:23,667 --> 01:00:27,292
He doesn't exist,
never existed!

357
01:02:07,417 --> 01:02:12,458
Hello. I would like to see
the monastery.

358
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:19,750
Can you take me
to the priests?

359
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,833
Man, look upon yourself
and despair.

360
01:04:11,833 --> 01:04:15,417
For Nature has never
beheld anything so vile.

361
01:04:15,417 --> 01:04:19,417
Your name is deceit,
your actions are hypocrisy.

362
01:04:19,417 --> 01:04:22,667
Everything you touch
shall be defiled,

363
01:04:22,667 --> 01:04:28,792
living and dead, trees and stones,
the air, animals and fish.

364
01:04:28,792 --> 01:04:31,667
Everything shall be poisoned
and distorted.

365
01:04:31,667 --> 01:04:35,250
For your lust shall in the end
devour you.

366
01:04:35,250 --> 01:04:38,458
You have turned the earth into
the refuse heap of your defilements,

367
01:04:38,458 --> 01:04:42,000
and buried it under mounds
of the remains of your pleasures.

368
01:04:42,208 --> 01:04:44,750
Suffocating under the weight
of your insatiability

369
01:04:44,750 --> 01:04:48,125
you continue to clamor
for more.

370
01:04:49,083 --> 01:04:53,125
Let the prophecy we have
received be realized,

371
01:04:53,375 --> 01:04:54,833
for it was said:

372
01:04:54,833 --> 01:04:59,042
the depths of the sea shall reveal
the mysteries of the past.

373
01:04:59,292 --> 01:05:02,417
And the path from our days
to the beginning of times.

374
01:05:02,667 --> 01:05:05,917
And the ancient city with its
grand mysteries shall be revealed.

375
01:05:06,125 --> 01:05:10,458
And the Mound near the city,
with its the eternal sanctuary.

376
01:05:10,750 --> 01:05:13,458
And he that ascends to
the Mound shall be heard.

377
01:05:13,708 --> 01:05:17,292
And his name is
the Presaged One.

378
01:05:18,708 --> 01:05:23,417
And there was another Prophecy,
may it be realized.

379
01:05:24,125 --> 01:05:27,667
And an Intercessor
shall be sent to you,

380
01:05:28,292 --> 01:05:31,542
an advocate for your salvation.

381
01:05:31,958 --> 01:05:36,000
And he shall intercede for you
before the Seat of Justice.

382
01:05:36,542 --> 01:05:40,375
His petition shall be
your prayers and suffering.

383
01:05:41,333 --> 01:05:45,458
But he shall not know his mystery
or understand his path.

384
01:05:45,833 --> 01:05:49,667
He shall be deaf and blind
like all abiding in the final days.

385
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:53,208
But he shall sense
the wings of his angel,

386
01:05:53,750 --> 01:05:56,833
for the name of his Angel
is Sorrow.

387
01:05:57,292 --> 01:06:00,292
And let the Prophecy
be realized, for it is said:

388
01:06:00,583 --> 01:06:04,125
An intercessor shall come
in the final days

389
01:06:04,125 --> 01:06:07,000
and a great sorrow shall be
his from his birth.

390
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,833
And he shall have nothing
but the great sorrow,

391
01:06:09,833 --> 01:06:12,875
neither the gift of prophecy
nor of healing,

392
01:06:12,875 --> 01:06:16,542
neither providence,
nor the gift of tongues.

393
01:06:16,750 --> 01:06:21,583
But he shall be heard on account
of the prayers of the desperate.

394
01:06:21,583 --> 01:06:24,458
For the one interceding for you
is the final Intercessor,

395
01:06:24,708 --> 01:06:28,250
there shall be no other.
Amen.

396
01:06:32,958 --> 01:06:38,917
Lord! Let us out of here!

397
01:09:51,792 --> 01:09:55,167
I've gotten my coat dirty.

398
01:09:55,167 --> 01:09:59,583
Leave it, the maid will
clean it in the morning.

399
01:10:01,625 --> 01:10:03,708
Thank you.

400
01:10:05,583 --> 01:10:09,167
Are you mad?

401
01:10:09,417 --> 01:10:12,250
Why did you go there?

402
01:10:12,250 --> 01:10:16,708
Don't you understand
how it will end?

403
01:10:18,125 --> 01:10:24,417
How? How do things
end, anyway?

404
01:10:27,083 --> 01:10:29,292
Go on...

405
01:11:06,458 --> 01:11:09,167
No, it's really some kind
of temporary insanity.

406
01:11:09,583 --> 01:11:11,917
I only have four weeks
of vacation,

407
01:11:11,917 --> 01:11:15,750
and I spend a whole week
 at a dump site!

408
01:11:16,500 --> 01:11:19,667
Don't get me wrong,
it's lovely here.

409
01:11:19,917 --> 01:11:23,667
I mean everything else
around here.

410
01:11:24,208 --> 01:11:27,000
No, it's really incredible.

411
01:11:27,250 --> 01:11:32,208
You're absolutely right.
We'll miss you of course.

412
01:11:32,583 --> 01:11:35,208
But I understand you
completely.

413
01:11:35,208 --> 01:11:38,625
Frankly, I was surprised at first.

414
01:11:38,625 --> 01:11:41,625
A normal, healthy man
in his prime,

415
01:11:41,625 --> 01:11:43,875
no abnormalities, as they say,

416
01:11:43,875 --> 01:11:46,250
and yet such wild fantasies.

417
01:11:46,250 --> 01:11:49,083
All that about Museums,

418
01:11:49,292 --> 01:11:52,333
risking your life
on a field trip...

419
01:11:52,333 --> 01:11:56,708
A field trip! Exactly!
It's ridiculous.

420
01:11:56,958 --> 01:12:01,083
Spending my vacation
wandering around a dump!

421
01:12:01,583 --> 01:12:05,333
I can just see my city friends
laughing at me!

422
01:12:05,333 --> 01:12:07,333
Oh, what a birthday gift!

423
01:12:07,333 --> 01:12:10,208
Is it your birthday?
- Yes!

424
01:16:17,625 --> 01:16:19,625
Why are you up?

425
01:16:25,542 --> 01:16:27,708
What happened?

426
01:17:17,292 --> 01:17:20,000
You're leaving?

427
01:17:22,750 --> 01:17:28,042
Stop! You can't!
I beg you!

428
01:17:28,500 --> 01:17:31,875
Please! Please!

429
01:17:32,375 --> 01:17:36,375
We don't have anyone
except for you!

430
01:17:36,375 --> 01:17:39,083
I told them you're going
to the Museum!

431
01:17:39,083 --> 01:17:40,625
Everyone's counting on you!

432
01:17:40,625 --> 01:17:42,167
Who did you tell?

433
01:17:42,167 --> 01:17:45,125
The priests!
- Who told you to?

434
01:17:46,375 --> 01:17:49,417
I'm guilty!
Punish me!

435
01:17:49,417 --> 01:17:50,958
Just don't leave!

436
01:17:50,958 --> 01:17:53,542
I'm begging you!

437
01:17:53,792 --> 01:17:57,500
I don't have anybody
else besides you!

438
01:17:57,500 --> 01:18:01,000
What does it have
to do with me!

439
01:18:03,042 --> 01:18:06,167
I'm going! I have to go!
You understand?

440
01:18:06,167 --> 01:18:08,708
I have work to do
in the city!

441
01:18:21,542 --> 01:18:25,000
Stop!
Stop!

442
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:09,792
What's with you
and the dump train?

443
01:19:10,292 --> 01:19:13,125
You'll get to the end
of the dump, then what?

444
01:19:13,125 --> 01:19:16,417
All the boats
have gone home.

445
01:19:18,417 --> 01:19:20,417
What do you mean?

446
01:19:21,583 --> 01:19:25,292
The low tide.
Don't you know that?

447
01:19:26,708 --> 01:19:28,917
At least seven days.

448
01:19:29,375 --> 01:19:32,167
You'll be stuck at the edge
of the dump for a week.

449
01:19:32,417 --> 01:19:34,958
There's nowhere
to stay there.

450
01:19:35,250 --> 01:19:38,750
Meanwhile you can stay
here, cheaply.

451
01:19:39,917 --> 01:19:43,250
Want to check out a room?

452
01:19:49,333 --> 01:19:51,708
Later.

453
01:19:52,125 --> 01:19:54,833
My god, what difference
does it make?

454
01:19:54,833 --> 01:19:58,083
As you like.

455
01:20:48,167 --> 01:20:54,917
I keep reading, but I don't
understand a thing.

456
01:21:01,958 --> 01:21:04,542
All my life I'm reading.

457
01:21:04,542 --> 01:21:07,458
Are you gonna keep
bothering people?

458
01:21:18,417 --> 01:21:22,292
Why don't you tell
my fortune.

459
01:21:23,875 --> 01:21:27,250
Just close your eyes.

460
01:21:51,917 --> 01:21:58,750
"O Lord, I know that the way
of man is not in himself"

461
01:21:58,958 --> 01:22:05,458
"it is not in man that walketh
to direct his steps."

462
01:22:12,917 --> 01:22:16,792
What does it mean?

463
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:28,042
Completely incomprehensible.

464
01:22:34,292 --> 01:22:38,917
Can you explain it to me?

465
01:26:21,958 --> 01:26:26,583
What is it?
Are you ill?

466
01:26:28,083 --> 01:26:30,125
What?

467
01:26:30,417 --> 01:26:32,792
What do you need?

468
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:35,875
Is it your heart?

469
01:26:36,917 --> 01:26:40,333
I can't hear.
What is it?

470
01:26:40,917 --> 01:26:46,250
The sorrow!
The sorrow!

471
01:26:49,542 --> 01:26:56,333
If all has been foretold,
then it's a prison!

472
01:27:00,333 --> 01:27:04,500
Like marionettes...

473
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:22,208
Running around
like a hysteric...

474
01:27:26,042 --> 01:27:28,083
I'm telling you,
he's one of them.

475
01:27:31,500 --> 01:27:34,292
We have to call
the Inspection.

476
01:27:34,708 --> 01:27:37,292
He's a degenerate.
A runaway.

477
01:27:38,125 --> 01:27:40,542
Didn't you hear?

478
01:27:41,500 --> 01:27:46,000
They run away and live
like normal people!

479
01:27:47,333 --> 01:27:49,833
Will you listen to yourself!

480
01:27:49,833 --> 01:27:54,083
We have to report it
to the Inspection!

481
01:27:54,083 --> 01:27:57,375
Fine, fine! I'll report it!

482
01:27:59,375 --> 01:28:03,708
Now get out of here!
Nobody asked you.

483
01:30:33,875 --> 01:30:35,708
Do you hear me?

484
01:30:35,708 --> 01:30:39,792
They can kill you!
They will kill you!

485
01:30:41,875 --> 01:30:43,958
Not now, for christ's sake!

486
01:30:44,500 --> 01:30:47,792
I warned you, they can
tear you to pieces!

487
01:30:49,250 --> 01:30:51,667
Drink!

488
01:31:00,167 --> 01:31:05,083
Shame!
Shame!

489
01:31:06,708 --> 01:31:10,167
Forgive me!
Forgive me!

490
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:20,792
Wait!

491
01:45:19,625 --> 01:45:23,542
"Out of the depths have I
cried unto thee, O Lord."

492
01:45:24,667 --> 01:45:29,625
"From the desolation of the earth
I beseech thee, O Savior."

493
01:45:31,167 --> 01:45:34,042
"Give ear, O Lord,
unto my prayer,"

494
01:45:34,250 --> 01:45:38,042
"and attend to the voice
of my supplications."

495
01:45:41,708 --> 01:45:44,250
"Do not requite me
for my iniquities"

496
01:45:44,458 --> 01:45:46,500
"and forgive the sin
of my ignorance,"

497
01:45:46,500 --> 01:45:51,333
"Holy God, Holy Power,
have mercy upon me."

498
01:45:53,458 --> 01:45:55,292
"Cast me not away
from thy presence;"

499
01:45:55,292 --> 01:45:58,583
"and take not thy holy
spirit from me."

500
01:46:02,833 --> 01:46:05,625
Forgive my pride, O Lord,

501
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:08,542
as I enter into
your holy desert,

502
01:46:08,792 --> 01:46:11,958
and approach the seat
of your Justice,

503
01:46:12,292 --> 01:46:16,667
with the words of your
psalmist upon my heart.

504
01:46:17,542 --> 01:46:19,625
As it is written,

505
01:46:20,667 --> 01:46:24,542
"Lord, who shall abide
in thy tabernacle?"

506
01:46:24,833 --> 01:46:28,583
"who shall dwell
in thy holy hill?"

507
01:46:30,583 --> 01:46:32,875
"And they that know
thy name"

508
01:46:32,875 --> 01:46:35,208
"will put their trust in thee"
as it is written,

509
01:46:35,458 --> 01:46:39,000
"Thou shalt hide them in the
secret of thy presence."

510
01:46:39,500 --> 01:46:43,167
Lord, instill understanding
in my heart,

511
01:46:43,750 --> 01:46:47,917
and give absolution to one
wandering all of his days,

512
01:46:48,208 --> 01:46:52,667
so that my sinful spirit
shall know thy truths.

513
01:46:53,333 --> 01:46:56,833
For one dwelling in this world
 is blind

514
01:46:57,042 --> 01:47:01,250
and shrouded in
interminable darkness.

515
01:47:02,042 --> 01:47:05,208
Do not abandon me,
O Lord.

516
01:47:08,500 --> 01:47:11,833
I stand before thee,
O Lord,

517
01:47:12,125 --> 01:47:17,458
and my spirit is like dust
in thy hand.

518
01:47:18,250 --> 01:47:22,125
Lord, king of heaven,

519
01:47:23,417 --> 01:47:25,917
myriads of stars
upon thy palm,

520
01:47:25,917 --> 01:47:29,042
hear the cry of
a grain of sand.

521
01:47:29,250 --> 01:47:31,250
For the grains of sand
are numberless,

522
01:47:31,583 --> 01:47:34,583
and the deserts of time
are limitless.

523
01:47:34,833 --> 01:47:39,042
How shall I reach thee?

524
01:47:39,333 --> 01:47:41,833
Who shall dare
lift up his eyes

525
01:47:42,208 --> 01:47:45,042
and gaze upon the radiance
of thy name?

526
01:47:45,292 --> 01:47:48,000
Who shall fathom your
limitless mystery?

527
01:47:48,292 --> 01:47:51,375
Lord, Lord, my God,

528
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:53,958
hear the cries of my heart,

529
01:47:54,292 --> 01:47:57,583
like the prodigal son I
prostrate myself before thee.

530
01:47:57,875 --> 01:48:00,417
Bestow wisdom upon me,
for the ways of man

531
01:48:00,667 --> 01:48:04,417
are dreadful in the dark
ignorance of thy words.

532
01:48:04,417 --> 01:48:08,292
But what mortal shall
know thy secret,

533
01:48:08,667 --> 01:48:10,833
and raise the veil
of thy mystery,

534
01:48:11,250 --> 01:48:14,333
the day and the hour
foretold by thee.

535
01:48:16,792 --> 01:48:20,875
Thou hast said, I shall rain
fire upon the earth.

536
01:48:21,125 --> 01:48:23,917
What does it mean?

537
01:48:24,125 --> 01:48:28,417
You foretold the end of
the world, but did not say why.

538
01:48:28,667 --> 01:48:31,083
Do we have a choice then?

539
01:48:31,333 --> 01:48:34,458
It is written, "the way of
man is not in himself"

540
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:40,042
"it is not in man that walketh
to direct his steps."

541
01:48:43,708 --> 01:48:49,208
Holy God, Holy Power,
have mercy upon us.

542
01:48:51,167 --> 01:48:53,750
My faith is in thee alone.

543
01:48:54,042 --> 01:49:00,042
As it is written, "For the needy
shall not always be forgotten:"

544
01:49:00,250 --> 01:49:04,250
"the expectation of the poor
shall not perish for ever."

545
01:49:04,542 --> 01:49:10,333
Our Father, have mercy
upon me, a sinner.

546
01:50:46,875 --> 01:50:50,125
I'm going, O Lord .

547
01:50:50,125 --> 01:50:56,833
I remember... I must
have some sleep...

548
01:51:22,917 --> 01:51:26,792
Lord, do not abandon me.

549
01:53:26,250 --> 01:53:29,125
Lord!

550
01:53:30,458 --> 01:53:34,333
Where shall I go?

551
01:53:35,250 --> 01:53:40,958
Help me!

552
01:53:52,333 --> 01:53:55,542
Lord, let me live!

553
01:55:35,042 --> 01:55:38,458
Lord, how much time...

554
01:55:57,833 --> 01:56:03,208
How much time
do I have, O Lord?

555
01:59:13,625 --> 01:59:19,208
Lord, it is I, man!

556
01:59:21,667 --> 01:59:26,125
Hear my cries, O Lord,
I beseech thee!

557
01:59:28,125 --> 01:59:30,833
Let them out of here!

558
01:59:30,833 --> 01:59:35,375
Answer their prayer,
and reward their faith,

559
01:59:35,375 --> 01:59:40,833
for they suffer for
the sins of others.

560
01:59:41,542 --> 01:59:45,375
Why shall your
chosen ones suffer,

561
01:59:45,750 --> 01:59:49,792
why shall they be damned?

562
01:59:51,333 --> 01:59:54,708
Let them die. Let them
out of here.

563
01:59:55,000 --> 01:59:57,542
Let them out of the world.

564
01:59:57,542 --> 01:59:59,708
Everything in this world
is damned!

565
01:59:59,708 --> 02:00:02,625
Everything shall perish!

566
02:00:02,625 --> 02:00:05,792
Everything in this world
is a lie!

567
02:00:05,792 --> 02:00:08,208
And the Devil is
the father of lies!

568
02:00:08,417 --> 02:00:11,250
You had said, the whole world
is mired in lies,

569
02:00:11,250 --> 02:00:15,542
and there is not a single
righteous man!

570
02:00:15,542 --> 02:00:21,083
You said so! Let
them out, Lord!

571
02:02:57,000 --> 02:03:01,375
Who's there?

572
02:13:06,250 --> 02:13:12,500
THE END
