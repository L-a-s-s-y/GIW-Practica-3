1
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:18,894
<i>Once upon the time, when the yen</i>

2
00:00:19,102 --> 00:00:21,647
<i>was the most powerful force
in the world,</i>

3
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:24,107
<i>the city overflowed with immigrants</i>

4
00:00:24,274 --> 00:00:26,485
<i>like a gold rush boomtown.</i>

5
00:00:26,652 --> 00:00:28,612
<i>They came in search of yen.</i>

6
00:00:28,779 --> 00:00:30,155
<i>Snatching up yen.</i>

7
00:00:30,364 --> 00:00:33,909
<i>And the immigrants called the city
Yentown.</i>

8
00:00:34,576 --> 00:00:36,954
<i>But the Japanese hated that name.</i>

9
00:00:37,287 --> 00:00:41,291
<i>So, they referred to those Yen Thieves
as Yentowns.</i>

10
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:45,212
<i>It's a bit puzzling, but Yentown
meant both, the city</i>

11
00:00:45,837 --> 00:00:47,839
<i>and the outcast.</i>

12
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:51,343
<i>If they worked hard,
earned a pocketful of yen,</i>

13
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:55,305
<i>and they returned home,
they'd be rich men.</i>

14
00:00:55,681 --> 00:00:58,058
<i>It sounds like a fairy tale.</i>

15
00:00:58,225 --> 00:01:01,728
<i>But it was a paradise of yen.
"Yentown".</i>

16
00:01:01,853 --> 00:01:06,066
<i>And this is the story of
Yentowns in Yentown.</i>

17
00:03:08,355 --> 00:03:10,941
HOMELESS YEN-THIEVES

18
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:55,026
Name of the deceased?

19
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:57,404
I don't know.

20
00:03:57,654 --> 00:03:59,656
What do you mean?

21
00:03:59,865 --> 00:04:01,867
- She's a colleague of yours.
- No, she's not.

22
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:03,034
Don't lie to us.

23
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:05,746
It's true. I never seen her before.

24
00:04:06,163 --> 00:04:08,039
Whatever. Just get it out of here.

25
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:09,791
Don't leave it lying around.

26
00:04:11,877 --> 00:04:14,796
What do you think you're doing?
This isn't a fucking funeral home.

27
00:04:15,005 --> 00:04:16,715
What's going on?

28
00:04:19,885 --> 00:04:21,386
What's this?

29
00:04:25,015 --> 00:04:27,267
You can't do that!

30
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:29,853
They stick cigarettes in rice
in your fucking country?

31
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:32,022
C'mon, get rid of all this!

32
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:34,858
What a bunch of freaks.

33
00:04:40,781 --> 00:04:44,409
Hey!
What the hell are you doing?

34
00:04:44,868 --> 00:04:47,746
You're burning down the place!

35
00:04:57,631 --> 00:04:58,924
For fuck's sake!

36
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,058
She wasn't your mother, was she?

37
00:05:13,188 --> 00:05:14,189
No.

38
00:05:16,942 --> 00:05:17,942
Damn Yentowns!

39
00:05:18,068 --> 00:05:19,945
We've never seen her before.

40
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:37,587
Please forgive me.

41
00:05:37,796 --> 00:05:40,674
A proper funeral
would've cost a fortune.

42
00:05:40,966 --> 00:05:44,970
It's OK, I bet your Mom's
made it to heaven.

43
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:03,697
Yuriko really stashed it away!

44
00:06:06,116 --> 00:06:08,243
- Give it to me!
- What for?

45
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:12,122
- I'll settle with you later.
- What do you mean?

46
00:06:12,247 --> 00:06:15,625
I told you, didn't I?
We'll split it later.

47
00:06:15,876 --> 00:06:19,588
Well, it's no use to her now is it?

48
00:06:20,338 --> 00:06:22,215
But I found it!

49
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,970
Take care.

50
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,889
Keep going.

51
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:31,600
Don't you forget us.

52
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:37,105
Good luck!

53
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:48,742
How come I haven't seen you
in so long? Drop by.

54
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:56,166
<i>Hurry up, WU'-!</i>

55
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:02,672
<i>She was dealing heroin.</i>

56
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:06,551
<i>Bloody amateur. Didn't know what
she was getting involved in.</i>

57
00:07:06,885 --> 00:07:08,428
Selling stuff to anyone.

58
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:11,765
It's no wonder the
Shanghai liumang did her in.

59
00:07:12,933 --> 00:07:14,267
Serves her right.

60
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:16,937
I'd look after her,
but I have a hard time.

61
00:07:17,062 --> 00:07:18,313
Please help me out!

62
00:07:18,563 --> 00:07:21,441
Would you please?
I beg you, please!

63
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:27,322
You're not the only one
having a hard time.

64
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:32,035
If she's too much of a nuisance,
you can do with her whatever you like.

65
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:35,162
Okay.

66
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:42,544
What's your name?

67
00:07:49,052 --> 00:07:50,553
Your name?

68
00:07:54,224 --> 00:07:55,475
I asked you a question!

69
00:07:57,102 --> 00:07:58,478
I don't have one.

70
00:07:58,603 --> 00:07:59,980
Bull shit!

71
00:08:00,355 --> 00:08:01,606
Everybody has a name.

72
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:09,447
You really don't have one?

73
00:08:12,951 --> 00:08:14,828
A pack of cigarettes
costs 250 yen.

74
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:17,497
A pack a day,
that's 7,500 yen a month.

75
00:08:17,706 --> 00:08:20,125
My old man's a farmer.

76
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:24,004
He makes 400 yuan a month.

77
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:28,758
If a yuan is worth 12 yen
then that's 4800 yen.

78
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:32,470
He couldn't even afford cigarettes.

79
00:08:32,804 --> 00:08:34,681
I never manage to save much.

80
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:36,766
I never manage to save anything.

81
00:08:37,434 --> 00:08:38,810
It's so hard.

82
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:41,563
At this rate I'll never get home.

83
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:43,440
How many do you do in a night?

84
00:08:43,565 --> 00:08:45,191
It's been really slow lately.

85
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:46,943
Economy's bad, what can we do.

86
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:50,280
I'm getting cobwebs in my pussy.

87
00:08:51,072 --> 00:08:54,451
I came up with this great game.

88
00:08:54,826 --> 00:08:57,954
I bet with my customers,
that they can't last.

89
00:08:58,163 --> 00:09:01,416
If they come in under 10 minutes,
I win.

90
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:04,461
If they last longer than 10 minutes,
they win. Sounds easy, huh?

91
00:09:04,586 --> 00:09:07,964
Of course they all think they can last.
If I win, I double the price.

92
00:09:08,298 --> 00:09:12,594
If they come real quick, I triple it!
They win - they get a free ride.

93
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:16,431
- What do you think?
- Great if they're quick-shooters.

94
00:09:16,598 --> 00:09:21,728
I learned a trick from this
quack doctor.

95
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:25,732
There's a spot between their ass
and their balls.

96
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:28,359
Oh god, it works fucking great.

97
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:31,362
I brought you something.

98
00:09:31,488 --> 00:09:33,073
You shouldn't have.

99
00:09:33,323 --> 00:09:35,241
It was given to me anyway.

100
00:09:35,492 --> 00:09:37,952
Hang on, it's downstairs.

101
00:09:40,497 --> 00:09:42,248
I wonder what it is?

102
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:47,462
What's your name?

103
00:09:48,213 --> 00:09:49,756
Mine's Glico.

104
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:52,217
Glico's a weird name, huh?

105
00:09:52,634 --> 00:09:54,844
Do you know what Glico is?

106
00:09:55,512 --> 00:09:57,597
It's a kind of candy.

107
00:09:58,014 --> 00:10:01,518
Japanese businessmen grow up
sucking on Glico.

108
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:08,274
Wonder what she's bringing me?

109
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:14,906
Are you Shizuko's sister?

110
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:18,243
I don't speak Chinese.

111
00:10:19,661 --> 00:10:21,162
No Chinese?

112
00:10:21,538 --> 00:10:24,124
Aren't you Shizuko's sister?

113
00:10:27,794 --> 00:10:30,130
Then who are you?

114
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:42,142
You're so cute.
What's your name?

115
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:45,186
Doesn't have one, she says.

116
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:47,147
Call her anything you want.

117
00:10:51,943 --> 00:10:53,903
- Is that all?
- Yes.

118
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,948
Everyone has to get by
on their own.

119
00:10:57,198 --> 00:11:00,702
Work hard so you get out of
here soon.

120
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:02,078
Shall we go?

121
00:11:04,706 --> 00:11:06,040
Have you done this before?

122
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:08,084
Obviously not.

123
00:11:21,723 --> 00:11:25,101
Something like this,
would look great on you.

124
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:27,187
Look in the mirror.

125
00:11:27,437 --> 00:11:29,814
You know, I...

126
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:34,736
used to be a school teacher.
I was pretty good at teaching.

127
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:38,072
You can call me "teacher."
Go ahead, say it.

128
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:39,240
Hey!

129
00:11:39,741 --> 00:11:41,743
What do you want?
Forgot something?

130
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:43,828
This isn't enough.

131
00:11:44,621 --> 00:11:45,622
What?

132
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:48,750
Give me a little more.

133
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:51,127
But that's all I've got.

134
00:11:51,461 --> 00:11:53,379
Then forget it.

135
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:55,757
Alright, another 10,000.

136
00:11:56,132 --> 00:12:00,887
Hey, how about 30,000?
Wait! I'll give you 30,000!

137
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:04,390
- He wanted to pay.
- Huh?

138
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:06,517
- That man.
- What?

139
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:08,770
I didn't hear him.

140
00:12:10,021 --> 00:12:12,523
That place is a shit hole.

141
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:16,778
- Never sell yourself too cheap.
- I'm sorry.

142
00:12:20,865 --> 00:12:22,116
- G/ico!
- Huh?

143
00:12:22,533 --> 00:12:23,910
Who's that new face?

144
00:12:24,035 --> 00:12:25,370
She's my sister

145
00:12:25,536 --> 00:12:27,622
I didn't know you have a sister.

146
00:12:27,789 --> 00:12:29,916
Yeah, from today.

147
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:44,764
<i>Thinking of him with tears
swelling in her eyes.</i>

148
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:50,019
<i>Soaking her red sarong
and white blouse.</i>

149
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:51,312
This?

150
00:12:52,522 --> 00:12:54,941
- A butterfly.
- You like them?

151
00:12:55,942 --> 00:12:57,068
Not really.

152
00:12:58,069 --> 00:12:59,821
This one's called Ageha.

153
00:13:00,697 --> 00:13:04,575
I came to Japan
with my two older brothers.

154
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:09,330
Ranki and Ryankai.

155
00:13:09,956 --> 00:13:13,543
We planned to save some cash
and go home.

156
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:17,422
But it wasn't so easy
to find any work.

157
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:22,844
For a while we scavenged,
living like rats.

158
00:13:24,971 --> 00:13:27,598
We used to rob people
in the streets.

159
00:13:28,725 --> 00:13:33,104
Ranki would snatch their purses
and throw them to Ryankai.

160
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:36,733
Then Ryankai would dash off.

161
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:42,071
He'd run like hell and dump it
in a trash can somewhere.

162
00:13:42,363 --> 00:13:44,866
My job was to pick it up.

163
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:48,369
We made a little money.

164
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,122
But then one day...

165
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:55,501
Ryankai was making his escape,

166
00:13:57,503 --> 00:13:59,756
when he was hit by a car
and died.

167
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:05,136
He died instantly.
His head was split right open.

168
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:08,348
Then all hell broke loose.

169
00:14:08,765 --> 00:14:14,854
Ranki and I tried to get to him, but
there was a huge crowd of people.

170
00:14:17,607 --> 00:14:21,903
Then an ambulance came and a guy
in a white coat was yelling something.

171
00:14:22,153 --> 00:14:26,157
I guess he was shouting
"Does anybody know this man?"

172
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:34,624
We didn't know any Japanese back then,
so we couldn't understand him.

173
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:39,921
Ranki and I didn't know
what to do.

174
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:44,926
Then the ambulance was gone,
and that was it for Ryankai.

175
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:49,180
I still don't know what
happened to him.

176
00:14:50,932 --> 00:14:53,810
They probably took him to the hospital,

177
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:58,314
just another 'Yentown'
without a name and nationality.

178
00:14:58,773 --> 00:15:01,067
One more unidentified body.

179
00:15:02,193 --> 00:15:05,696
It'll be the same for me when I die.

180
00:15:06,072 --> 00:15:08,950
It's the same for all Yentowns.

181
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:14,288
That's why I got this tattoo.
If I die, they'll know who I am.

182
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:17,834
It's something like an ID card.

183
00:15:18,418 --> 00:15:19,961
Want one, too?

184
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:26,467
What happened
to your other brother?

185
00:15:26,676 --> 00:15:29,303
I wonder where he is.

186
00:15:29,554 --> 00:15:32,223
He sure is scratching
along somewhere.

187
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:35,977
You're still a kid,
so you get a caterpillar.

188
00:15:38,104 --> 00:15:39,355
There we are.

189
00:15:42,859 --> 00:15:44,068
DAgehan?

190
00:15:44,986 --> 00:15:47,196
Yep, it's your name.

191
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:48,865
AGEHA

192
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:52,493
Ageha.

193
00:15:57,582 --> 00:15:58,708
Ageha.

194
00:16:00,585 --> 00:16:02,753
My name is...

195
00:16:04,255 --> 00:16:05,339
Ageha.

196
00:16:18,019 --> 00:16:20,104
It's too tight.

197
00:16:20,605 --> 00:16:22,273
This is a 20, right?

198
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:24,275
30 meters...

199
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:25,776
Forty...

200
00:16:26,027 --> 00:16:27,153
More than 40...

201
00:16:28,905 --> 00:16:30,156
How do I fix it?

202
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:32,158
Let me see.

203
00:16:34,035 --> 00:16:35,786
Wait! It's coming! Look!

204
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:39,665
30 meters.

205
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:42,417
Forty.

206
00:16:44,629 --> 00:16:46,297
Shit!

207
00:16:58,142 --> 00:17:00,937
Did you see that?
Did you see me get his tire?

208
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:03,064
That was fucking great!

209
00:17:03,814 --> 00:17:06,984
Wait! Wait a minute! Bastard!

210
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:14,534
Oh shit!

211
00:17:17,787 --> 00:17:20,164
CAR REPAIR SHOP

212
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:37,181
Hello... my car broke down.

213
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:40,017
My car is <i>punc.</i>

214
00:17:40,685 --> 00:17:41,894
<i>Car punc.</i>

215
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:45,398
Please, help me.

216
00:17:46,941 --> 00:17:48,067
FeFHOng!

217
00:17:50,278 --> 00:17:51,529
What's up?

218
00:17:52,572 --> 00:17:57,326
Ah! This tube is shot!
You gonna need a new one.

219
00:17:58,452 --> 00:18:00,204
Please.

220
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:03,332
No time. Fast? Fast?

221
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:05,668
Okay, okay. Five minutes.

222
00:18:05,835 --> 00:18:08,713
Get yourself a drink.
Hey, Nihat!

223
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:11,424
Over there.

224
00:18:22,602 --> 00:18:23,811
There you are.

225
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:25,605
Thank you very much.

226
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:56,344
Where did you pick this one up?

227
00:18:58,638 --> 00:18:59,847
You're adorable.

228
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:01,641
What's your name?

229
00:19:03,768 --> 00:19:05,728
She doesn't speak Chinese.

230
00:19:05,895 --> 00:19:08,856
Name... you got a name?

231
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:11,108
Ageha.

232
00:19:11,901 --> 00:19:13,277
Age... Ageha?

233
00:19:13,653 --> 00:19:14,904
I named her.

234
00:19:16,489 --> 00:19:18,532
Is that your street name?

235
00:19:18,908 --> 00:19:20,493
I buy her.

236
00:19:20,785 --> 00:19:21,786
How much?

237
00:19:22,036 --> 00:19:24,288
Oh, she's not for sale.

238
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:28,542
She needs a job... part-time.

239
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:31,754
Why? We don't need her.
Just sell her.

240
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:36,175
Please, please, please.
You can give her a job.

241
00:19:37,677 --> 00:19:38,803
Right, Ran?

242
00:19:43,808 --> 00:19:45,434
Ran said it's okay.

243
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:47,185
Did I?

244
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,562
<i>I'm sorry!</i>

245
00:19:50,564 --> 00:19:51,816
Gasoline empty.

246
00:19:52,316 --> 00:19:53,651
He's back.

247
00:19:53,818 --> 00:19:55,903
Do you have... gasoline?

248
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:58,823
Hey! Today's not your day,
is it?

249
00:20:05,955 --> 00:20:07,665
What do you want me to do?

250
00:20:07,957 --> 00:20:10,918
Trash hunting.
Look for the good stuff.

251
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:12,293
See what you can find.

252
00:20:12,837 --> 00:20:15,047
So, you run a recycling shop?

253
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:17,216
Not really.

254
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:19,468
See, this is how it goes:

255
00:20:19,677 --> 00:20:21,679
We'll do anything
if it leads to the yen.

256
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:24,098
Anything... for money?

257
00:20:25,099 --> 00:20:26,100
Like what?

258
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:29,603
That's what you have to
figure out. Think about it.

259
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:35,359
Like... killing?

260
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:42,742
Hey, pick that up.

261
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:45,119
But it's broken.

262
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:49,248
Fix it! Umbrellas always sell
when it rains.

263
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:54,879
You never know when you might stumble
across a chance to get rich.

264
00:20:55,129 --> 00:20:58,007
God gives everyone that same chance.

265
00:20:58,758 --> 00:21:01,719
It depends on if the person decides
to grab it or not.

266
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:07,892
"Heaven never created a man above another,
nor a man below another."

267
00:21:08,726 --> 00:21:09,726
What's that?

268
00:21:09,769 --> 00:21:12,229
Fukuzawa, the Yentown God
said that.

269
00:23:01,505 --> 00:23:05,467
<i>The wind from the coconut trees
stirs the silver waves.</i>

270
00:23:06,343 --> 00:23:09,597
<i>The setting sun sneaks
behind the clouds.</i>

271
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:14,143
<i>On the golden beach.</i>

272
00:23:15,019 --> 00:23:19,773
<i>Alone sits a beautiful girl.</i>

273
00:23:21,025 --> 00:23:25,154
<i>Her eyes sparkling like the stars.</i>

274
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:29,033
<i>Her brows curved like the moon.</i>

275
00:23:29,366 --> 00:23:33,537
<i>Dressed in a red sarong.</i>

276
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:39,418
<i>As red as the betel nut
in her mouth.</i>

277
00:23:40,169 --> 00:23:44,298
<i>She is sighing lightly.</i>

278
00:23:45,049 --> 00:23:49,178
<i>About that heartless lover.</i>

279
00:23:49,803 --> 00:23:53,807
<i>Thinking of him with tears
swelling in her eyes.</i>

280
00:23:54,683 --> 00:23:59,146
<i>Soaking her red sarong
and white blouse.</i>

281
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:01,440
<i>Ah, girl of the South China Sea</i> -

282
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:02,900
It's time to go.

283
00:24:03,817 --> 00:24:04,818
Come on, Ageha!

284
00:24:05,069 --> 00:24:07,029
- Sing us another song.
- Next time.

285
00:24:09,698 --> 00:24:12,409
Hey, gimme.

286
00:24:30,844 --> 00:24:34,598
<i>Oh Glico, sunshine of our hearts.</i>

287
00:24:34,932 --> 00:24:38,435
<i>Who's your lover
in the early morning dark?</i>

288
00:24:38,602 --> 00:24:41,605
<i>You're the belladonna of Yentown</i>

289
00:24:41,814 --> 00:24:46,360
Italian folk songs and
Chinese wine don't mix.

290
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:48,862
Huh?

291
00:24:50,614 --> 00:24:53,200
Forget it.

292
00:24:53,867 --> 00:24:56,203
BLUE SKY

293
00:24:56,996 --> 00:24:59,748
WELCOME!

294
00:25:03,377 --> 00:25:05,754
Ow! Wait!

295
00:25:08,757 --> 00:25:09,757
What's wrong?

296
00:25:12,636 --> 00:25:15,014
Nothing. It always hurts.

297
00:25:20,477 --> 00:25:22,354
Hurry up!

298
00:25:24,606 --> 00:25:26,400
It's coming! Hurry up!

299
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:29,278
Fei-Hong's knee always tells
us the weather. Right, Fei-Hong?

300
00:25:29,528 --> 00:25:30,529
Ouch!

301
00:25:30,738 --> 00:25:33,115
Come on! Get out of here.

302
00:25:34,742 --> 00:25:37,286
- "Hey, Ran!
- Hurry up!"

303
00:25:38,537 --> 00:25:39,913
Asshole!

304
00:25:41,665 --> 00:25:43,250
Good luck!

305
00:25:46,295 --> 00:25:48,297
<i>When did your knee go bad?</i>

306
00:25:48,505 --> 00:25:51,300
<i>This? I don't know.</i>

307
00:25:52,301 --> 00:25:54,762
<i>Can't remember.</i>

308
00:26:00,934 --> 00:26:01,935
It's fate's fault.

309
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:03,687
Fate?

310
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:07,816
TVs, washing machines,
even those...

311
00:26:08,067 --> 00:26:11,779
they get old and break,
then they die on you.

312
00:26:14,573 --> 00:26:17,576
But we can fix them,
so they can move again.

313
00:26:18,327 --> 00:26:19,828
People...

314
00:26:20,954 --> 00:26:22,164
People just die.

315
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:24,416
And go to heaven.

316
00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:26,418
I don't know.

317
00:26:27,711 --> 00:26:28,921
Mama...

318
00:26:30,214 --> 00:26:31,465
when she died,

319
00:26:31,965 --> 00:26:34,218
she didn't go anywhere.

320
00:26:36,845 --> 00:26:38,097
She was broken.

321
00:26:39,848 --> 00:26:42,059
There <i>is</i> a heaven!

322
00:26:42,351 --> 00:26:45,104
But nobody ever gets there.

323
00:26:45,312 --> 00:26:48,232
You die and your spirit rises to the sky,

324
00:26:49,483 --> 00:26:53,821
but as soon it touches a cloud
it turns into rain.

325
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:59,118
So nobody's ever seen heaven.

326
00:27:03,497 --> 00:27:07,751
Don't look so serious.
I just made that up.

327
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:16,760
So, if people end up in heaven,

328
00:27:18,387 --> 00:27:21,223
then I guess, we're in heaven.

329
00:27:35,154 --> 00:27:37,781
Cut the noise!

330
00:27:37,906 --> 00:27:39,783
I can't hear my damn TV!

331
00:27:41,535 --> 00:27:42,535
Cut the noise!

332
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:43,787
Chill out, man!

333
00:27:43,912 --> 00:27:46,123
Cut the noise!
I can't hear my TV!

334
00:27:46,415 --> 00:27:48,041
You're gonna make me!

335
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:14,067
Hey, I can't hear my damn TV!
You think I'm playin'?

336
00:28:14,193 --> 00:28:16,195
I'm gonna hurt somebody out here.

337
00:28:17,821 --> 00:28:18,906
Aseha?

338
00:28:19,948 --> 00:28:22,075
What's goin' on?

339
00:28:22,701 --> 00:28:24,953
I never get this damn thing.

340
00:28:25,078 --> 00:28:28,582
I can't work out
who's talking to who or what.

341
00:28:29,041 --> 00:28:30,459
Hey, can you see the -

342
00:28:31,335 --> 00:28:35,339
Hey, there you go.
The champ of the world.

343
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:39,218
Let me show you something.
Gimme a jab. A right hand...

344
00:28:39,343 --> 00:28:43,931
A jab, right hand...

345
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:48,977
- That's my ex-wife, Kate.
- I know.

346
00:28:49,353 --> 00:28:52,981
Oh I love that woman.
Almost more than I love boxin'.

347
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:58,362
Before a fight, she used to give me a kiss
in all the places I don't wanna get hit,

348
00:28:58,612 --> 00:29:04,368
Like... my arm, my body, my jaw,
my nose, eyes... temple.

349
00:29:08,622 --> 00:29:11,458
- You want some milk?
- No, thanks.

350
00:29:12,501 --> 00:29:17,714
You know, them kisses used to work, too.
Shit, I never lost a fight. No.

351
00:29:18,382 --> 00:29:23,637
Until that one day I forgot to ask Katie
to give me the damn kiss, you see.

352
00:29:23,971 --> 00:29:28,517
Which I never forget. It was the...
fourth round, right?

353
00:29:29,017 --> 00:29:32,521
And I... and I had him against
the rope, see?

354
00:29:32,729 --> 00:29:36,650
It was left, right... I didn't see
that damn punch comin', see?

355
00:29:37,025 --> 00:29:41,780
So all I remember is... it bein' dark
and me gettin' on off the floor, see?

356
00:29:43,365 --> 00:29:47,744
Oh, if I'd have won that fight, I'd have
had me a championship, man... you know?

357
00:29:47,911 --> 00:29:51,623
That's all right, though,
because I'm still bad.

358
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:54,293
You know who Mike Tyson is, right?

359
00:29:55,669 --> 00:29:57,170
Cause he ain't nothin'!

360
00:29:57,296 --> 00:30:00,549
Arrow. Want to see some magic?

361
00:30:01,675 --> 00:30:03,760
The one you always do, huh?

362
00:30:04,928 --> 00:30:08,765
Let me... let me cut
the light on for you.

363
00:30:11,435 --> 00:30:13,520
- I'm only gonna do it once.
- All right.

364
00:30:13,687 --> 00:30:17,691
Oh Arrow gonna go get it now.
I'm gonna get it.

365
00:30:21,778 --> 00:30:25,407
- Sorry. I will try again.
- Go ahead.

366
00:30:25,699 --> 00:30:28,035
'Cause I got my eyes on it now.

367
00:30:28,327 --> 00:30:30,203
Oh Arrow's gonna get it.

368
00:30:30,412 --> 00:30:31,412
See.

369
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:35,834
Maybe my fingers are stiff.

370
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:38,670
Yeah, let me see
what you got there.

371
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:42,341
- Let me try again.
- Go ahead. Go.

372
00:30:42,591 --> 00:30:44,676
'Cause I think I got it now.

373
00:30:45,344 --> 00:30:47,304
It's the way you move your hand.

374
00:30:47,471 --> 00:30:51,433
Oh Arrow got it. It's the way
you move your hand.

375
00:30:55,812 --> 00:30:59,107
Son of a bitch! How'd you do that?

376
00:31:00,609 --> 00:31:03,612
You gotta... you gotta
show me that trick.

377
00:31:03,737 --> 00:31:07,741
- Damn. I can't figure it out.
- It's not a trick.

378
00:31:26,134 --> 00:31:27,636
Got a towel?

379
00:31:27,761 --> 00:31:30,222
<i>Isn't there one there?</i>

380
00:31:30,472 --> 00:31:32,224
Oh yeah...

381
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:09,052
What are you doing in here?

382
00:32:12,305 --> 00:32:15,392
The music's too loud.

383
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:19,813
You're starting alone?

384
00:32:21,064 --> 00:32:22,524
What are you doing?

385
00:32:22,691 --> 00:32:25,819
- It's OK, I'll pay.
- This one's different.

386
00:32:26,027 --> 00:32:27,529
I said I'll pay.

387
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:33,702
- I'm gonna call the cops!
- The cops... Oh yeah?

388
00:32:34,327 --> 00:32:37,080
Calling the cops, huh?

389
00:32:44,838 --> 00:32:47,799
Now try and call them! Yes, Sir!

390
00:32:48,842 --> 00:32:50,719
Think you can?

391
00:32:57,726 --> 00:33:00,312
You don't fucking get it,
do you?

392
00:33:00,729 --> 00:33:04,357
A whore house is for
a good time, right?

393
00:33:05,609 --> 00:33:08,361
Goddamn it, sit down.

394
00:33:16,953 --> 00:33:19,331
Both of you, listen to me!

395
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:26,087
Go get Arrow!

396
00:33:26,588 --> 00:33:28,632
Hold up. Wait a minute.
Just talk to me.

397
00:33:28,757 --> 00:33:30,634
What's wrong?
What's wrong? What?

398
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:33,094
Talk to me! What?

399
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:38,099
What the fuck is goin' on?

400
00:33:42,604 --> 00:33:43,604
Shit!

401
00:33:57,285 --> 00:34:00,664
He's fine. He's OK.

402
00:34:01,164 --> 00:34:03,041
- Glico!
- What?

403
00:34:03,416 --> 00:34:06,002
He's still alive.
We have to get help.

404
00:34:06,127 --> 00:34:08,421
Ambulance... ambulance...

405
00:34:08,547 --> 00:34:10,340
What?

406
00:34:26,189 --> 00:34:28,733
He's totally squashed.

407
00:34:43,999 --> 00:34:45,375
Hey, give us a hand!

408
00:34:45,709 --> 00:34:48,587
Let go. Help them! Help them!

409
00:34:54,217 --> 00:34:56,344
- You scared?
- No.

410
00:35:24,623 --> 00:35:25,874
Hurry up!

411
00:35:35,050 --> 00:35:36,426
What are you doing?

412
00:35:38,428 --> 00:35:39,804
Who knows?

413
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:42,807
- He got me.
- What?

414
00:35:44,643 --> 00:35:45,643
What's this?

415
00:35:47,896 --> 00:35:50,065
It's coming out of his stomach.

416
00:35:52,942 --> 00:35:54,653
A parasite?

417
00:35:54,944 --> 00:35:58,657
- What did you say?
- A parasite or something.

418
00:35:58,823 --> 00:35:59,824
Parasite?

419
00:36:00,075 --> 00:36:01,826
Parasite!

420
00:36:03,203 --> 00:36:04,203
Quiet!

421
00:36:12,921 --> 00:36:15,965
- What are you doing?
- There's something in here.

422
00:36:16,466 --> 00:36:18,968
Between the intestines.

423
00:36:20,679 --> 00:36:21,930
It slipped.

424
00:36:24,849 --> 00:36:26,226
Behind the liver.

425
00:36:26,476 --> 00:36:29,312
Ran, you're gonna burn in hell!

426
00:36:33,483 --> 00:36:34,484
Got it.

427
00:36:45,328 --> 00:36:46,955
What is this?

428
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,377
A cassette tape.

429
00:37:06,141 --> 00:37:08,393
Hey, Glico. Sing something.

430
00:37:08,601 --> 00:37:09,853
What?

431
00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:11,895
Sing what?

432
00:37:20,989 --> 00:37:22,615
Sing something!

433
00:37:24,409 --> 00:37:25,910
Something happy!

434
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:34,544
Why would something like that
be in his stomach?

435
00:37:46,681 --> 00:37:48,266
That doesn't sound happy.

436
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:33,686
Singing at a time like this.

437
00:39:02,465 --> 00:39:05,134
- Sud0's disappeared?
- Yes.

438
00:39:05,385 --> 00:39:07,637
We've been out of contact
for a week.

439
00:39:07,846 --> 00:39:10,014
And our little item?

440
00:39:11,015 --> 00:39:12,267
The tape!

441
00:39:12,475 --> 00:39:14,727
It vanished with Sudo.

442
00:39:14,894 --> 00:39:16,729
What did you say?

443
00:39:16,896 --> 00:39:19,232
We are undertaking
a thorough search.

444
00:39:20,275 --> 00:39:22,652
I can't sit around listening to this.

445
00:39:23,987 --> 00:39:27,156
Why the hell are you still here?

446
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:31,286
Goodness! Going home already?

447
00:39:31,536 --> 00:39:34,163
Boss, look. This is on the house.

448
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:36,499
At least have a taste
before you go.

449
00:39:40,044 --> 00:39:41,379
What's this?

450
00:39:41,546 --> 00:39:43,006
Boss!

451
00:39:50,763 --> 00:39:53,182
- Oops, pardon me.
- Son-of-a-bitch!

452
00:39:53,308 --> 00:39:55,310
It's all on the house.

453
00:39:58,438 --> 00:40:01,065
Put your gun away,
so we can talk.

454
00:40:01,441 --> 00:40:03,443
Can't you hear me, Tako!

455
00:40:03,568 --> 00:40:07,655
Mao Foo, he's scary.
Shall I pop him?

456
00:40:08,281 --> 00:40:10,199
<i>No hurry, Wan.</i>

457
00:40:14,454 --> 00:40:16,581
Rio Ranki!

458
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:20,960
Hello, Boss.

459
00:40:21,711 --> 00:40:23,796
So where does the rat
hide himself?

460
00:40:23,963 --> 00:40:27,592
I thought, Rio Ranki
was a gentleman.

461
00:40:28,468 --> 00:40:30,094
You should talk, swindling bastard.

462
00:40:30,303 --> 00:40:32,430
- Wha.. What?
- The tape!

463
00:40:33,056 --> 00:40:35,224
The tape. "My Way"-

464
00:40:35,475 --> 00:40:36,601
What are you talking about?

465
00:40:37,310 --> 00:40:39,479
You gotta be kidding.

466
00:40:39,854 --> 00:40:41,981
You don't know "My Way"?

467
00:40:42,357 --> 00:40:44,692
It's worth a fortune to a collector.

468
00:40:44,859 --> 00:40:48,112
- Wha... what?
- So, I want it back!

469
00:40:50,865 --> 00:40:54,243
Let's see your stomach,
you fucking kangaroo!

470
00:40:54,953 --> 00:40:57,956
Oh, Mao Foo, I forgot my gun.

471
00:40:58,498 --> 00:41:01,000
So, now it's two against four.

472
00:41:02,210 --> 00:41:04,337
We're in big trouble, Mao Foo.

473
00:41:04,587 --> 00:41:08,591
Four minus two equals
two survivors, right?

474
00:41:09,008 --> 00:41:12,220
- Listen Ranki...
- So, two will be left standing.

475
00:41:12,512 --> 00:41:17,141
Who wants to live? You, Boss?

476
00:41:17,767 --> 00:41:20,019
- You're fucking insane!
- How do we decide?

477
00:41:21,896 --> 00:41:23,648
Rock-paper-scissors?

478
00:41:26,275 --> 00:41:32,156
Say, I'm sorry. But there's no
sense in having it out here.

479
00:41:32,365 --> 00:41:35,618
Ranki, how about we make a deal?

480
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:38,621
We don't deal with small fries like you.

481
00:41:47,171 --> 00:41:50,049
Why didn't you blow me away?

482
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:53,761
You think these are microphones?

483
00:41:54,429 --> 00:41:58,182
Or maybe... a hair dryer?

484
00:42:25,209 --> 00:42:27,336
Sudo has the tape.

485
00:42:30,798 --> 00:42:32,967
Sudo disappeared.

486
00:42:36,929 --> 00:42:38,848
Where is Sudo?

487
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:41,976
Where?!

488
00:42:43,478 --> 00:42:45,354
We are looking for him.

489
00:42:46,064 --> 00:42:47,482
What?

490
00:42:47,732 --> 00:42:51,611
He ain't here!
He's been missing for a week.

491
00:42:51,944 --> 00:42:56,949
He ran off with the tape.
When we find him, he's a dead man.

492
00:42:57,116 --> 00:42:59,869
Lying sack of shit.
You can do better.

493
00:42:59,994 --> 00:43:03,623
It's the truth!
We were just talking about it.

494
00:43:03,748 --> 00:43:08,878
- Boss, lying's no good.
- It's the truth!

495
00:43:09,629 --> 00:43:14,008
Let's try again.
Who took the tape?

496
00:43:14,509 --> 00:43:15,635
Sudo!

497
00:43:17,095 --> 00:43:19,013
Who gave the order?

498
00:43:23,476 --> 00:43:25,895
Wan, bring me the bucket.

499
00:43:26,354 --> 00:43:29,357
We're gonna have a blood flood.

500
00:43:34,028 --> 00:43:35,530
I did.

501
00:43:37,865 --> 00:43:39,158
You did?

502
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:42,370
Much better.

503
00:43:44,789 --> 00:43:47,291
<i>Now, where's Suds'?</i>

504
00:43:47,917 --> 00:43:48,918
I don't know.

505
00:43:54,173 --> 00:43:58,052
Liars go to hell.
The Flaming Pit of Damnation.

506
00:43:58,386 --> 00:44:00,805
Please don't! It's the -

507
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:06,519
Here comes the bucket.

508
00:44:07,562 --> 00:44:10,815
- Chop it off.
- It's the truth!

509
00:44:11,065 --> 00:44:13,442
Good boy, Boss.

510
00:44:13,776 --> 00:44:17,905
Honesty brings salvation.

511
00:44:22,577 --> 00:44:24,787
- Chop it off.
- But it's true!

512
00:44:30,585 --> 00:44:33,546
He used to pick up Yentown
hookers around here.

513
00:44:33,713 --> 00:44:35,590
A perfect place to hide.

514
00:44:35,798 --> 00:44:38,718
Come with me. I'm cheap.

515
00:44:38,843 --> 00:44:40,845
<i>It's very rare,</i>

516
00:44:41,053 --> 00:44:43,973
that a 'Yent0wn' comes here.

517
00:44:44,473 --> 00:44:47,852
He's not my type.
Don't know him.

518
00:44:49,353 --> 00:44:51,689
Never seen him before.

519
00:45:21,093 --> 00:45:22,845
Here, buy yourself a hit.

520
00:45:24,639 --> 00:45:27,266
He was all squashed!

521
00:45:36,651 --> 00:45:38,486
How long will this go on?

522
00:45:38,986 --> 00:45:39,986
What?

523
00:45:49,538 --> 00:45:52,166
Hey Ran, did you find something?

524
00:45:52,875 --> 00:45:53,875
Nothing there!

525
00:45:56,003 --> 00:46:01,676
<i>In the Sunday Park
Light in the afternoon</i>

526
00:46:02,009 --> 00:46:06,180
<i>I listen to the sound of my dream.</i>

527
00:46:06,764 --> 00:46:08,641
<i>Coming through.</i>

528
00:46:08,808 --> 00:46:11,769
<i>All the mountains of.</i>

529
00:46:11,936 --> 00:46:14,563
<i>Blueberries and greens.</i>

530
00:46:14,689 --> 00:46:20,319
<i>Fairy tale lullaby.</i>

531
00:46:21,570 --> 00:46:23,823
<i>I was down last night.</i>

532
00:46:24,323 --> 00:46:27,034
<i>Too much to handle here.</i>

533
00:46:27,451 --> 00:46:32,206
<i>I didn't know how to carry on.</i>

534
00:46:32,331 --> 00:46:34,208
<i>Still lucky.</i>

535
00:46:34,333 --> 00:46:40,089
<i>All the mess in my
head is fading now.</i>

536
00:46:40,589 --> 00:46:45,594
<i>Among the crowds on the streets.</i>

537
00:46:47,972 --> 00:46:52,977
<i>I wish you'd come to my place.</i>

538
00:46:53,853 --> 00:46:59,317
<i>You would be smiling so close to me.</i>

539
00:47:00,735 --> 00:47:08,492
<i>I wish the day dream never ends.</i>

540
00:47:24,091 --> 00:47:26,886
Hey! What the hell
do you think you're doing?

541
00:47:27,136 --> 00:47:29,513
10,000 yen please.

542
00:47:32,892 --> 00:47:37,855
<i>When I feel a single beat
of my lonely heart.</i>

543
00:47:38,981 --> 00:47:45,237
<i>I can sing, I can cry,
without knowing why.</i>

544
00:47:45,488 --> 00:47:50,034
<i>Yes I tried and tried
to the way to you.</i>

545
00:47:50,159 --> 00:47:56,540
<i>Somehow life always leads
through a maze.</i>

546
00:47:58,125 --> 00:48:03,547
<i>Everyday, every night
you live in my mind.</i>

547
00:48:04,298 --> 00:48:09,261
<i>Everyday, every night
still pleasure and pain.</i>

548
00:48:09,428 --> 00:48:15,393
<i>And those melodies
of memories will never stop.</i>

549
00:48:15,559 --> 00:48:21,941
<i>You are with me
until the end of time.</i>

550
00:48:22,441 --> 00:48:28,781
<i>Just a day dream
in the Sunday Park.</i>

551
00:48:31,283 --> 00:48:34,328
Our man is now 500 meters
away and closing.

552
00:48:34,703 --> 00:48:37,456
And here's his picture. Hey!

553
00:48:38,666 --> 00:48:42,670
He's in the third car, wearing glasses,
reading the Japan Times.

554
00:48:43,295 --> 00:48:46,090
- I'll take his heart.
- No, I'll take his heart.

555
00:48:46,298 --> 00:48:47,925
And you'll take his head.

556
00:48:49,802 --> 00:48:51,220
- 10 seconds.
- Ready.

557
00:49:12,616 --> 00:49:14,952
I wonder what they're after.

558
00:49:15,453 --> 00:49:17,121
A murder?

559
00:49:17,329 --> 00:49:19,498
Your looking at Sudo Kanji.

560
00:49:19,623 --> 00:49:24,503
He is, or should I say was, a main man
in the Katsushika Syndicate.

561
00:49:24,628 --> 00:49:26,714
About a week ago
Sudo disappeared,

562
00:49:26,964 --> 00:49:29,133
and the "family" put on
a frantic search for him.

563
00:49:29,717 --> 00:49:33,512
But now, the strange thing is
the gang itself has perished.

564
00:49:33,637 --> 00:49:36,849
- Gone. Is history.
- What do you mean?

565
00:49:37,141 --> 00:49:39,894
The boss and all the other
key people are missing.

566
00:49:40,102 --> 00:49:45,274
Organized crime just can't work
without someone to organize it, right?

567
00:49:47,401 --> 00:49:49,361
Now, here are your buddies!

568
00:49:50,112 --> 00:49:53,532
Wan Shaun Shen and Mao Foo.
They're Shanghai Iiumang.

569
00:49:53,782 --> 00:49:55,868
You know, Chinese Mafia.

570
00:49:56,035 --> 00:50:00,289
Mao Foo is one cold blooded
motherfucker, or as they say,

571
00:50:00,414 --> 00:50:01,874
"a pokerface-killer".

572
00:50:02,291 --> 00:50:05,920
For some reason, they too have
been sniffing around after Sudo.

573
00:50:06,170 --> 00:50:07,379
Why, Ran?

574
00:50:08,005 --> 00:50:09,423
I thought I'd ask you
to find out.

575
00:50:09,673 --> 00:50:14,053
And their leader, Rio Ranki.
He's at the top.

576
00:50:14,178 --> 00:50:18,641
I'm talking Liumang King, sitting pretty
on his beautiful Yentown throne.

577
00:50:18,807 --> 00:50:22,895
He looks pretty young to be -
He's only 28.

578
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:26,023
He was a punk, selling "hot" cars,
and worked his way up.

579
00:50:26,190 --> 00:50:28,692
Before long people were
calling him "The Forger".

580
00:50:28,943 --> 00:50:33,280
Rumor has it, he is already, or is planning
on counterfeiting Fukuzawa notes.

581
00:50:33,405 --> 00:50:37,076
I'm sure he's gonna be called
"The Counterfeiting King".

582
00:50:37,201 --> 00:50:41,455
So Ran, why are you so
interested?

583
00:50:42,706 --> 00:50:43,706
I'm not.

584
00:50:53,676 --> 00:50:55,052
What are you doing?

585
00:50:55,219 --> 00:50:57,846
I don't know. We're doing
Ram's homework.

586
00:50:58,597 --> 00:50:59,848
It's boring.

587
00:51:02,351 --> 00:51:04,853
- Finished yet?
- A little more.

588
00:51:04,979 --> 00:51:06,855
Let me see.

589
00:51:10,818 --> 00:51:12,111
What's that?

590
00:51:12,486 --> 00:51:16,740
It's a 10,000 yen note.
Except its magnetic data.

591
00:51:17,366 --> 00:51:19,868
Every money go through
a lot of different machines.

592
00:51:20,119 --> 00:51:23,330
Cash dispensers, vending machines,
change makers...

593
00:51:23,497 --> 00:51:25,124
They can tell
if the paper's real or not,

594
00:51:25,332 --> 00:51:28,127
by reading the patterns
printed on them with magnetic ink.

595
00:51:28,335 --> 00:51:29,753
Like this pattern here?

596
00:51:30,129 --> 00:51:31,338
Right.

597
00:51:34,133 --> 00:51:37,845
Japanese bills...
are all the same height.

598
00:51:38,137 --> 00:51:41,140
All you have to do to make
a 1,000 yen note the same size

599
00:51:41,265 --> 00:51:44,518
as a 10,000 yen note...
is break that.

600
00:51:57,990 --> 00:51:59,241
You see?

601
00:51:59,658 --> 00:52:00,659
Yes.

602
00:52:03,287 --> 00:52:07,374
So, what happens if you code
this with the magnetic data?

603
00:52:16,675 --> 00:52:19,303
It looks like a 1,000,
but it works like 10,000.

604
00:52:19,678 --> 00:52:22,306
No way, they spot that in a second.

605
00:52:22,556 --> 00:52:26,935
Humans might. But to a machine,
this Soseki looks just like a Fukuzawa.

606
00:52:28,937 --> 00:52:30,147
Okay, ready.

607
00:52:37,196 --> 00:52:40,199
- It doesn't work.
- Wait a sec.

608
00:52:42,201 --> 00:52:43,285
Weird.

609
00:52:43,827 --> 00:52:46,080
Is the show over?

610
00:52:56,340 --> 00:52:59,593
There must be something wrong
with the machine.

611
00:53:01,053 --> 00:53:03,180
One thousand becomes ten.

612
00:53:03,347 --> 00:53:05,349
So, we just made 9,000 yen.

613
00:53:05,474 --> 00:53:11,063
So, by putting in ten of these,
we get 90,000 back, right?

614
00:53:13,482 --> 00:53:17,361
We make a hundred of these
and we have 900,000 yen?

615
00:53:17,486 --> 00:53:20,197
And with a 1,000 bills,
we have 9 million yen?

616
00:53:20,364 --> 00:53:22,866
10,000, that's 90 million!

617
00:53:23,325 --> 00:53:26,995
- That's more Soseki than Chinese.
- 100,000...

618
00:53:27,496 --> 00:53:29,623
That's 900 million!

619
00:53:29,748 --> 00:53:31,208
Theoretically speaking.

620
00:53:32,501 --> 00:53:35,003
It's easy to make 100,000, though!

621
00:53:35,504 --> 00:53:38,382
First you get rich,
then you just get caught.

622
00:53:39,633 --> 00:53:41,635
And then get deported.

623
00:53:44,596 --> 00:53:46,640
It's just a party-trick.

624
00:53:47,391 --> 00:53:49,601
You don't even know how to party.

625
00:54:04,158 --> 00:54:05,868
The money!

626
00:54:09,371 --> 00:54:10,914
Pick it up! Pick it up!

627
00:54:22,885 --> 00:54:26,680
<i>We struck gold.
But it was paper gold.</i>

628
00:54:26,805 --> 00:54:29,016
<i>Even though the sun shone
through the bills,</i>

629
00:54:29,183 --> 00:54:32,936
<i>all I ever saw was the same face
staring back at me.</i>

630
00:54:38,692 --> 00:54:40,652
You're gonna leave your kids?

631
00:54:40,819 --> 00:54:43,322
- Who?
- Your kids! They're yours?

632
00:54:44,782 --> 00:54:45,782
No.

633
00:54:47,034 --> 00:54:48,076
See you!

634
00:54:49,578 --> 00:54:50,913
Hey, Ran!

635
00:54:52,456 --> 00:54:53,582
Ran!

636
00:54:54,208 --> 00:54:55,584
BYE-bye!

637
00:54:59,087 --> 00:55:02,800
<i>We laid our dream
on a wagon of paper gold,</i>

638
00:55:02,966 --> 00:55:05,969
<i>and said good-bye to Blue Sky.</i>

639
00:55:07,054 --> 00:55:09,348
These are the counterfeit notes.

640
00:55:09,473 --> 00:55:13,352
We've found nearly 10,000 in
a matter of days across the city.

641
00:55:15,062 --> 00:55:16,730
Looks amateurish.

642
00:55:17,189 --> 00:55:19,983
Actually it isn't.
Take a look at this.

643
00:55:22,861 --> 00:55:25,113
This is the stolen magnetic data.

644
00:55:25,864 --> 00:55:26,949
Rio Ranki, huh?

645
00:55:27,616 --> 00:55:30,994
Kind of crude for his M.O.,
isn't it?

646
00:55:45,008 --> 00:55:46,968
THOUSANDS OF COUNTERFEIT BILLS
APPEAR ACROSS CITY.

647
00:55:59,773 --> 00:56:01,275
- Take it easy now.
- Bye!

648
00:56:03,110 --> 00:56:05,529
<i>Arrow and Nihat, they went home.</i>

649
00:56:08,657 --> 00:56:12,536
<i>Fei-hong, Glico and me,
we went downtown.</i>

650
00:56:17,749 --> 00:56:21,295
<i>That was the beginning
of our next journey.</i>

651
00:56:22,045 --> 00:56:23,547
That car is something else.

652
00:56:25,048 --> 00:56:27,050
What a piece of junk!

653
00:56:41,189 --> 00:56:42,900
This whole place is ours?

654
00:56:43,150 --> 00:56:45,569
I don't have many properties
like this.

655
00:56:45,694 --> 00:56:47,195
You were lucky.

656
00:56:47,321 --> 00:56:48,780
You'll need a front man.

657
00:56:48,947 --> 00:56:52,826
Yentowns aren't allowed to
make contracts.

658
00:56:52,951 --> 00:56:54,703
The owner's gotta be Japanese?

659
00:56:54,828 --> 00:56:57,331
Don't worry, we'll find someone.

660
00:56:57,956 --> 00:57:00,584
Now, about the staff...

661
00:57:00,709 --> 00:57:04,046
pick the ones you like.
They can start anytime.

662
00:57:04,212 --> 00:57:06,214
It's not going to be
that kind of place.

663
00:57:10,469 --> 00:57:13,430
Glico, stand here for a second.

664
00:57:14,848 --> 00:57:17,434
Over here, right here.

665
00:57:19,353 --> 00:57:20,604
What for?

666
00:57:21,063 --> 00:57:23,690
You want me to be a stripper?

667
00:57:24,232 --> 00:57:25,943
How's this?

668
00:57:26,568 --> 00:57:28,070
Sing something.

669
00:57:28,695 --> 00:57:33,992
<i>Spending every day of my life with you.</i>

670
00:57:35,994 --> 00:57:38,497
Soon you can sing all you want.

671
00:57:39,748 --> 00:57:44,002
This is going to be a live music club.
Your live music club.

672
00:57:45,087 --> 00:57:49,508
We'll have a band, a lot of
customers, and you'll sing.

673
00:57:49,716 --> 00:57:51,343
They'll come to hear you.

674
00:57:51,468 --> 00:57:55,514
It will be the talk of the town.
It'll be standing room only!

675
00:57:55,639 --> 00:57:58,892
Then we'll release a single.
It'll be a big hit.

676
00:57:59,017 --> 00:58:02,396
A star is born! You'll be
the hottest singer in Japan.

677
00:58:02,604 --> 00:58:04,272
What do you think?

678
00:58:05,023 --> 00:58:06,149
You're nuts!

679
00:58:07,901 --> 00:58:11,738
Frankly, it's rare for a live
venue to turn a profit these days.

680
00:58:12,030 --> 00:58:13,782
Make it a girlie bar.

681
00:58:14,032 --> 00:58:16,660
Why don't you get up here
and sing.

682
00:58:17,035 --> 00:58:20,414
- They don't want me.
- Neither do they want me!

683
00:58:20,998 --> 00:58:22,624
What's so funny?

684
00:58:22,791 --> 00:58:25,502
This will definitely become
a live music club.

685
00:58:25,627 --> 00:58:27,295
Not a goddamn girlie bar.

686
00:58:27,504 --> 00:58:31,258
If you want singing,
make it a Karaoke bar.

687
00:58:31,425 --> 00:58:34,803
- Mr. Fei-Hong may have a point.
- Keep out of this!

688
00:58:35,929 --> 00:58:38,932
A legit club could be
a useful front.

689
00:58:39,516 --> 00:58:42,936
Front, back, whatever.
It'll be a straight live music club!

690
00:58:44,813 --> 00:58:48,191
That kind of life
is behind us now.

691
00:59:12,549 --> 00:59:14,176
VeW 900d! Very good!

692
00:59:14,926 --> 00:59:16,678
Great! You're hired!

693
00:59:19,931 --> 00:59:22,059
He's only the first one.

694
00:59:22,225 --> 00:59:23,977
He's only the first one.

695
00:59:28,857 --> 00:59:29,857
Name?

696
00:59:30,192 --> 00:59:30,942
Betty.

697
00:59:31,109 --> 00:59:32,109
Real name?

698
00:59:32,486 --> 00:59:34,071
Ikeda Yoshiko.

699
00:59:34,196 --> 00:59:35,238
Expeflenced?

700
00:59:35,489 --> 00:59:36,573
It's my first time.

701
00:59:36,698 --> 00:59:39,993
Why "Betty" if you're just starting out?

702
00:59:42,746 --> 00:59:43,997
Are you experienced?

703
00:59:44,498 --> 00:59:45,248
Not very.

704
00:59:45,499 --> 00:59:46,499
How old?

705
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:48,126
Not very.

706
00:59:48,376 --> 00:59:50,504
How old are you? Your age?

707
00:59:51,213 --> 00:59:52,213
Twenty-three.

708
00:59:52,380 --> 00:59:53,380
Liar!

709
01:00:08,605 --> 01:00:09,898
Your name?

710
01:00:10,732 --> 01:00:12,275
Well, I'm Asakawa.

711
01:00:13,110 --> 01:00:14,110
Your instrument?

712
01:00:14,277 --> 01:00:17,364
I'm supposed to be the owner.

713
01:00:17,781 --> 01:00:21,034
- What'd he say?
- He said, he's the owner.

714
01:00:22,119 --> 01:00:23,161
Owner?

715
01:00:25,914 --> 01:00:28,625
Very impressive! Isn't he?

716
01:00:32,045 --> 01:00:35,006
Here's the paperwork.

717
01:00:35,173 --> 01:00:38,260
All under Asakawa's name.
But it's just a formality.

718
01:00:38,426 --> 01:00:41,263
If the whole thing goes under,

719
01:00:41,429 --> 01:00:44,307
his life is insured up to
ten million yen.

720
01:00:44,558 --> 01:00:48,436
- Oh, he's an insurance agent?
- No, if the venture folds -

721
01:00:48,645 --> 01:00:50,689
We're not even open yet.

722
01:00:50,814 --> 01:00:56,444
Just in case the club folds and he dies,
you'll collect on the insurance.

723
01:00:57,070 --> 01:01:01,283
- How did you get this guy?
- Too many bad debts.

724
01:01:01,449 --> 01:01:03,827
He had to sell himself, right?

725
01:01:04,578 --> 01:01:07,164
- You bought him?
- Yeah.

726
01:01:07,330 --> 01:01:10,667
We'll take care of any killing
so don't you worry about it.

727
01:01:10,917 --> 01:01:14,087
Our deal is off if they find out.

728
01:01:14,296 --> 01:01:16,464
We're talking about you.

729
01:01:21,094 --> 01:01:23,847
It looks like we've got
all the band together.

730
01:01:23,972 --> 01:01:25,473
All right.

731
01:01:30,437 --> 01:01:34,983
Hey! You're not really gonna
hire that guy, are you?

732
01:01:35,442 --> 01:01:36,985
Why?

733
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:40,739
That's the only riff
he can play!

734
01:01:46,870 --> 01:01:49,372
You guys are Yentowns, right?

735
01:01:49,581 --> 01:01:53,251
Yentown has its own groove, right?

736
01:01:53,585 --> 01:01:56,755
How can Jap musicians play
the groove of Yentown?

737
01:01:57,214 --> 01:02:01,509
- But you're not a Yentown.
- No, I'm not a Yentown.

738
01:02:01,885 --> 01:02:06,223
Both my parents were American,
but I was born and raised in Japan.

739
01:02:06,389 --> 01:02:09,601
Thanks to the shitty Japanese
education system,

740
01:02:09,768 --> 01:02:12,604
I can't speak a word of English.

741
01:02:12,854 --> 01:02:16,274
- He said, he can't speak English.
- Don't you believe it!

742
01:02:16,775 --> 01:02:18,902
You think it's funny?
Well, I guess it is.

743
01:02:19,027 --> 01:02:21,154
So what am I,
Japanese or American?

744
01:02:21,279 --> 01:02:24,115
The way I look, I'm always
treated like a foreigner.

745
01:02:24,282 --> 01:02:28,870
But fact is, I was born
and raised here.

746
01:02:29,663 --> 01:02:31,539
And nowhere else is home.

747
01:02:31,790 --> 01:02:34,793
From the cradle to the grave
I'll sleep on tatami.

748
01:02:35,126 --> 01:02:38,046
It's OK for you guys.
You've got a country to go back to.

749
01:02:39,130 --> 01:02:41,883
Yentowns have their own
home countries.

750
01:02:42,133 --> 01:02:45,011
How about you, sweetheart?
Where were you born? China?

751
01:02:45,178 --> 01:02:46,304
Japan.

752
01:02:46,429 --> 01:02:47,764
You think you're a Yentown?

753
01:02:48,056 --> 01:02:50,934
- Yes.
- No, you're not.

754
01:02:51,142 --> 01:02:54,145
Did your parents come here
to make money?

755
01:02:55,063 --> 01:02:59,025
You're second generation,
but the Japs don't care.

756
01:02:59,317 --> 01:03:01,945
For them, you're just
another Yentown.

757
01:03:02,195 --> 01:03:03,196
Strange, isn't it?

758
01:03:03,697 --> 01:03:04,406
So...

759
01:03:04,656 --> 01:03:07,200
for us 2nd generation kids,

760
01:03:07,409 --> 01:03:11,079
there should be a special name.

761
01:03:11,329 --> 01:03:15,458
And I came up with one.
Wanna hear it?

762
01:03:20,588 --> 01:03:22,799
"Third Culture Kids."

763
01:03:24,843 --> 01:03:25,844
Good, isn't it?

764
01:03:25,969 --> 01:03:30,056
And our music is called,
"Third Culture Music".

765
01:03:30,849 --> 01:03:32,934
Okay, ya ya, sounds great.

766
01:03:33,184 --> 01:03:36,062
So go ahead, let's hear you play.

767
01:03:36,980 --> 01:03:39,858
- Your instrument?
- I don't play an instrument.

768
01:03:40,608 --> 01:03:42,610
Said he can't play an instrument.

769
01:03:43,987 --> 01:03:48,867
Wait a second. What the hell did you
come here to do, Mr. Third Culture?

770
01:03:49,117 --> 01:03:50,368
Why are you here?

771
01:03:50,994 --> 01:03:56,333
Why I'm here? Well... you could
call me a su... I'm a supervisor.

772
01:03:56,750 --> 01:03:58,376
Super...

773
01:03:58,835 --> 01:04:03,214
It's OK, just leave it to me.
I'll get you the best!

774
01:04:18,396 --> 01:04:22,776
Sounds like the real thing!

775
01:04:23,735 --> 01:04:26,112
Wanna sing? Come on!

776
01:04:27,530 --> 01:04:29,657
Wait, hold it.

777
01:04:30,283 --> 01:04:34,120
Time out! Let's ask our
madonna to sing!

778
01:04:34,287 --> 01:04:35,287
No!

779
01:04:39,542 --> 01:04:42,170
No way! I can't.

780
01:04:43,380 --> 01:04:46,674
Come on up, what would
you like to sing?

781
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:47,884
I can't sing.

782
01:04:48,259 --> 01:04:50,553
Hey, Glico. Sing "My Way"!

783
01:04:54,057 --> 01:04:55,392
He's kidding?

784
01:04:55,558 --> 01:04:59,312
"My Way" is a bit outdated.
It's music for grandpas.

785
01:04:59,521 --> 01:05:01,815
That music has no soul!

786
01:05:03,817 --> 01:05:07,654
Oh my God, he's really
gonna do it!

787
01:05:09,656 --> 01:05:16,287
<i>And now the end is near.</i>

788
01:05:17,414 --> 01:05:24,462
<i>And so I face the final curtain.</i>

789
01:05:26,214 --> 01:05:32,220
<i>My friends I'll say it clear.</i>

790
01:05:33,596 --> 01:05:41,596
<i>I'll state my case, of which I'm certain.</i>

791
01:05:42,313 --> 01:05:49,737
<i>I've lived a life that's full.</i>

792
01:05:50,238 --> 01:05:58,238
<i>I traveled each and every highway.</i>

793
01:05:59,122 --> 01:06:04,961
<i>And more, much more than this.</i>

794
01:06:06,129 --> 01:06:14,129
<i>I did it my way.</i>

795
01:06:16,264 --> 01:06:22,353
<i>Regrets, I've had a few.</i>

796
01:06:23,480 --> 01:06:31,480
<i>And then again, too few to mention.</i>

797
01:06:32,530 --> 01:06:39,287
<i>I did what I had to do.</i>

798
01:06:39,787 --> 01:06:47,504
<i>Though I saw it through
without exemption.</i>

799
01:06:48,922 --> 01:06:55,678
<i>I planned each chartered course.</i>

800
01:06:57,263 --> 01:07:04,437
<i>Each careful step along the byway.</i>

801
01:07:05,063 --> 01:07:11,277
<i>And more, much more than this.</i>

802
01:07:12,028 --> 01:07:19,410
<i>I did it my way.</i>

803
01:07:51,109 --> 01:07:56,614
<i>I faced it all and I stood tall</i>

804
01:07:56,948 --> 01:08:04,372
<i>I did it my way.</i>

805
01:08:04,622 --> 01:08:08,251
<i>For what is a man.</i>

806
01:08:08,626 --> 01:08:12,213
<i>What has he got?</i>

807
01:08:12,755 --> 01:08:19,137
<i>If not himself, then he was not.</i>

808
01:08:20,179 --> 01:08:27,312
<i>To say the things he truly feels.</i>

809
01:08:28,354 --> 01:08:34,986
<i>And not the words of one who kneels.</i>

810
01:08:35,486 --> 01:08:42,076
<i>The record shows I took the blows.</i>

811
01:08:44,078 --> 01:08:52,078
<i>And did it my way.</i>

812
01:09:03,222 --> 01:09:04,974
<i>Mama's alright.</i>

813
01:09:05,224 --> 01:09:07,268
<i>She's got the taste you need.</i>

814
01:09:07,393 --> 01:09:09,270
<i>Mama's alright.</i>

815
01:09:09,479 --> 01:09:11,397
<i>She's got that smile.</i>

816
01:09:11,522 --> 01:09:13,483
<i>But if you're in doubt.</i>

817
01:09:13,733 --> 01:09:15,777
<i>Pick up the telephone.</i>

818
01:09:16,152 --> 01:09:19,864
<i>Another reason for you to cry.</i>

819
01:09:20,156 --> 01:09:24,285
<i>Another reason
that mama lied to you.</i>

820
01:09:24,494 --> 01:09:27,288
Who said you could put those
up here?

821
01:09:27,538 --> 01:09:30,917
This is our turf. You wanna put
those up, you gotta pay.

822
01:09:31,167 --> 01:09:32,293
No.

823
01:09:32,418 --> 01:09:35,421
So you want a piece of me, huh?

824
01:09:37,382 --> 01:09:40,176
Going easy on women
has gone outta style.

825
01:09:43,554 --> 01:09:45,431
Told you I'm not jokin'!

826
01:09:46,891 --> 01:09:49,143
Get up. Come on.

827
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:52,689
Come on. Come on.

828
01:09:58,528 --> 01:10:00,196
Are you OK?

829
01:10:00,405 --> 01:10:02,448
Come on. Come on.

830
01:10:03,533 --> 01:10:05,410
<i>Mama's alright.</i>

831
01:10:05,702 --> 01:10:07,662
<i>She's got the taste you need.</i>

832
01:10:07,829 --> 01:10:09,664
<i>Mama's alright.</i>

833
01:10:09,914 --> 01:10:11,666
<i>She's got that smile.</i>

834
01:10:11,958 --> 01:10:13,960
<i>But if you're in doubt.</i>

835
01:10:14,210 --> 01:10:16,462
<i>Pick up the telephone.</i>

836
01:10:16,671 --> 01:10:20,341
<i>Another reason for you to cry.</i>

837
01:10:20,591 --> 01:10:25,471
<i>Another reason
that mama lied to you.</i>

838
01:10:33,479 --> 01:10:36,858
<i>I never felt the real her.</i>

839
01:10:37,483 --> 01:10:41,571
<i>I never touched the real her.</i>

840
01:10:42,113 --> 01:10:48,995
<i>She may not be alive
But she's alright.</i>

841
01:10:50,455 --> 01:10:53,583
<i>But Mama knows
her wrong from right.</i>

842
01:10:53,750 --> 01:10:56,127
<i>And she will say “so what”.</i>

843
01:10:56,836 --> 01:10:59,756
<i>And Mama knows to be herself.</i>

844
01:10:59,964 --> 01:11:04,385
<i>So she can be with me... and now.</i>

845
01:11:04,844 --> 01:11:06,763
<i>Mama's alright.</i>

846
01:11:06,971 --> 01:11:09,015
<i>She's got the taste you need.</i>

847
01:11:09,223 --> 01:11:10,975
<i>Mama's alright.</i>

848
01:11:11,142 --> 01:11:13,019
<i>She's got that smile.</i>

849
01:11:13,144 --> 01:11:14,896
<i>But if you're in doubt.</i>

850
01:11:15,521 --> 01:11:17,899
<i>Pick up the telephone.</i>

851
01:11:18,024 --> 01:11:21,527
<i>Another reason for you to cry.</i>

852
01:11:22,278 --> 01:11:26,491
<i>Another reason
that mama lied to you.</i>

853
01:11:39,045 --> 01:11:42,048
<i>But Mama knows
her wrong from right.</i>

854
01:11:42,256 --> 01:11:44,425
<i>And she will say “so what”.</i>

855
01:11:45,176 --> 01:11:48,387
<i>And Mama knows to be herself.</i>

856
01:11:48,554 --> 01:11:55,061
<i>So she can be with me... and now.</i>

857
01:11:55,686 --> 01:11:57,396
<i>Mama's alright.</i>

858
01:11:57,688 --> 01:11:59,816
<i>She's got the taste you need.</i>

859
01:12:00,191 --> 01:12:01,901
<i>Mama's alright.</i>

860
01:12:02,068 --> 01:12:03,945
<i>She's got that smile.</i>

861
01:12:04,153 --> 01:12:05,696
<i>Mama's alright.</i>

862
01:12:06,197 --> 01:12:08,199
<i>She's got the taste you need.</i>

863
01:12:08,407 --> 01:12:10,201
<i>Mama's alright.</i>

864
01:12:10,326 --> 01:12:11,953
<i>She's got that smile.</i>

865
01:12:45,820 --> 01:12:48,364
- Mash Music?
- Yeah, I am.

866
01:12:54,078 --> 01:12:56,581
Make sure you tell everyone
about the club.

867
01:12:56,873 --> 01:12:59,500
Our show's at 7, every night.

868
01:13:01,878 --> 01:13:03,713
You know "Mash Music", right?

869
01:13:04,505 --> 01:13:08,593
How about "A|| or Nothing"?
You know "Free Flower"?

870
01:13:08,759 --> 01:13:09,844
It's a big hit.

871
01:13:10,386 --> 01:13:12,263
- What?
- Oh well...

872
01:13:14,891 --> 01:13:17,226
Mash offered Glico a deal.

873
01:13:17,476 --> 01:13:18,519
Wow!

874
01:13:27,778 --> 01:13:31,157
Ever thought about your
dreams coming true?

875
01:13:32,033 --> 01:13:33,534
I feel like mine have.

876
01:13:34,493 --> 01:13:36,787
Before I dreamed them.

877
01:13:44,295 --> 01:13:48,424
Hey, Ran! Check it out! This is
"A|| or Nothing" by "Free Flower".

878
01:13:48,633 --> 01:13:50,051
Ran! Ran?

879
01:13:50,176 --> 01:13:51,302
Hey!

880
01:13:53,304 --> 01:13:54,430
Take it.

881
01:14:04,398 --> 01:14:06,943
Hey! Hey, Ran! What's this?

882
01:14:08,319 --> 01:14:09,570
<i>Dori-seki.</i>

883
01:14:12,698 --> 01:14:14,784
Dream security.

884
01:14:18,579 --> 01:14:20,456
Mr. Kusunoki of Mash Records.

885
01:14:21,415 --> 01:14:22,208
Good afternoon.

886
01:14:22,416 --> 01:14:25,086
Ms. Hoshino of Popland Music.

887
01:14:26,712 --> 01:14:29,715
We heard your demo,
it's not bad.

888
01:14:32,802 --> 01:14:34,553
Where are you from?

889
01:14:35,096 --> 01:14:36,973
I'm from Shanghai, China.

890
01:14:37,098 --> 01:14:39,475
Difficult to sell
foreigners in Japan.

891
01:14:40,559 --> 01:14:42,603
You know Agnes Chan?

892
01:14:43,229 --> 01:14:45,481
We used to have a band together.

893
01:14:46,816 --> 01:14:48,734
How about Teresa Teng?

894
01:14:49,360 --> 01:14:51,737
God rest her soul.

895
01:14:52,238 --> 01:14:54,740
That's about it
for foreign singers.

896
01:14:56,325 --> 01:14:57,952
Would you become Japanese?

897
01:14:59,578 --> 01:15:01,122
Would be an easier sell.

898
01:15:01,580 --> 01:15:03,582
That's a bit tricky.

899
01:15:03,833 --> 01:15:07,628
The policy of the 'Yentown Band'
is kind of...

900
01:15:07,878 --> 01:15:10,589
different from Japanese er...

901
01:15:10,756 --> 01:15:11,882
The soul... is...

902
01:15:12,133 --> 01:15:13,509
Doesn't sound hip.

903
01:15:13,634 --> 01:15:16,971
Hip? There's no 'hip'
in rock'n' roll.

904
01:15:17,596 --> 01:15:19,348
Do you have a visa?

905
01:15:20,224 --> 01:15:21,350
You don't?

906
01:15:21,517 --> 01:15:25,146
You can tell the truth.
We're not the police.

907
01:15:26,522 --> 01:15:28,858
- Sorry, no.
- What do you think?

908
01:15:29,025 --> 01:15:31,402
We can make it work.

909
01:15:31,986 --> 01:15:35,614
Glico. What're they saying?

910
01:15:36,657 --> 01:15:39,660
Quit being Chinese,
become a Jap.

911
01:15:40,286 --> 01:15:43,122
- What?
- Otherwise I'll never sell.

912
01:15:46,792 --> 01:15:49,420
No, no, no problem.

913
01:15:49,545 --> 01:15:53,799
If it will make Glico a star,
we'll become as Japanese as you want.

914
01:15:54,383 --> 01:15:56,427
So, who are you?

915
01:15:57,303 --> 01:15:59,930
Are you two involved? Or what?

916
01:16:00,765 --> 01:16:02,516
Involved?

917
01:16:02,767 --> 01:16:04,769
No. I'm her...

918
01:16:05,311 --> 01:16:07,396
personal assistant and
manager. That's all.

919
01:16:10,441 --> 01:16:13,319
How will I take a piss,
when I'm a star?

920
01:16:13,569 --> 01:16:17,698
- What do you mean?
- Will it be different?

921
01:16:18,657 --> 01:16:20,826
You'll do it the same as now.

922
01:16:25,956 --> 01:16:27,917
How about sex?

923
01:16:32,171 --> 01:16:35,091
Will it be OK to have sex?

924
01:16:42,098 --> 01:16:44,850
I think I'm gonna come.

925
01:16:45,810 --> 01:16:47,353
- Really?
- Almost.

926
01:16:54,485 --> 01:16:56,112
I'm sorry.

927
01:16:58,114 --> 01:17:00,074
Fly. Fly. Fly-

928
01:17:02,576 --> 01:17:03,577
(Fl)'-

929
01:17:11,252 --> 01:17:12,878
<i>She don't care.</i>

930
01:17:13,379 --> 01:17:16,465
<i>Taking what you give her.</i>

931
01:17:17,258 --> 01:17:18,884
<i>She don't care.</i>

932
01:17:19,343 --> 01:17:22,763
<i>About the way you dress.</i>

933
01:17:23,139 --> 01:17:24,849
<i>She don't care.</i>

934
01:17:25,266 --> 01:17:28,644
<i>To talk to you 'bout nothing.</i>

935
01:17:29,019 --> 01:17:30,604
<i>She don't care.</i>

936
01:17:31,147 --> 01:17:35,985
<i>To thank you for your time.</i>

937
01:17:36,485 --> 01:17:40,906
<i>Sit by the telephone today,
in case you call.</i>

938
01:17:41,782 --> 01:17:42,783
FeFHOng!

939
01:17:45,035 --> 01:17:47,371
- What?
- A visitor!

940
01:17:48,289 --> 01:17:53,252
<i>Watching the telephone again,
it gets me down</i>

941
01:17:53,419 --> 01:17:56,172
<i>I don't want this affair.</i>

942
01:17:57,006 --> 01:17:58,299
- Shit!
- Fei-Hong!

943
01:18:00,509 --> 01:18:01,510
Wait!

944
01:18:03,137 --> 01:18:05,014
Stop! I said stop!

945
01:18:05,639 --> 01:18:07,516
Stop or I'll shoot!

946
01:18:07,933 --> 01:18:09,685
Okay, okay!

947
01:18:12,188 --> 01:18:16,150
Tell me just one thing.
Who the fuck sold me out?

948
01:18:16,650 --> 01:18:19,028
I can't not speak English.

949
01:18:19,195 --> 01:18:21,155
<i>She don't care.</i>

950
01:18:21,322 --> 01:18:24,783
<i>Taking what you give her.</i>

951
01:18:25,075 --> 01:18:26,075
<i>She don't care.</i>

952
01:18:28,704 --> 01:18:30,789
I feel a little guilty.

953
01:18:30,956 --> 01:18:32,708
<i>She don't care.</i>

954
01:18:34,585 --> 01:18:36,670
Since he was kinda cute.

955
01:18:36,837 --> 01:18:38,464
<i>She don't care.</i>

956
01:18:38,923 --> 01:18:42,968
<i>Thank you for your time.</i>

957
01:19:02,446 --> 01:19:06,825
- What's this?
- The guard messed them all up.

958
01:19:07,243 --> 01:19:08,827
Yummy!

959
01:19:12,998 --> 01:19:15,751
- <i>How's</i> Glico?
<i>- She's well.</i>

960
01:19:16,585 --> 01:19:18,629
The Mash Music people are
coming every day.

961
01:19:18,754 --> 01:19:21,632
Her single's gonna come out
on the 20th.

962
01:19:22,258 --> 01:19:23,258
That's good.

963
01:19:23,384 --> 01:19:26,387
Glico says hi and
sorry she can't come.

964
01:19:26,595 --> 01:19:29,640
Mash Music is so strict.

965
01:19:30,599 --> 01:19:31,725
It's all right.

966
01:19:31,976 --> 01:19:35,104
It's a very important time
for her right now.

967
01:19:35,271 --> 01:19:37,481
Tell her not to worry.

968
01:19:48,867 --> 01:19:51,120
Made these yourself?

969
01:19:51,662 --> 01:19:54,915
You're gonna make a good wife.

970
01:19:58,669 --> 01:19:59,878
Yesterday,

971
01:20:00,045 --> 01:20:04,174
with Dave, we all went to...

972
01:20:07,136 --> 01:20:08,387
Record shop.

973
01:20:09,138 --> 01:20:10,931
A record shop.

974
01:20:11,181 --> 01:20:14,435
We went to a record shop.

975
01:20:14,560 --> 01:20:16,145
<i>And then...</i>

976
01:20:17,813 --> 01:20:21,692
We want to buy "one <i>single</i> each."

977
01:20:23,152 --> 01:20:24,445
<i>“Bu? There's none.</i>

978
01:20:24,570 --> 01:20:26,196
We went to another.

979
01:20:27,948 --> 01:20:29,450
But no singles...

980
01:20:29,658 --> 01:20:30,951
there either.

981
01:20:31,201 --> 01:20:33,704
Well, you can't expect too much.

982
01:20:33,954 --> 01:20:35,205
A new band, a new record...

983
01:20:35,539 --> 01:20:38,667
That's what Dave said, too.
But he was wrong.

984
01:20:38,834 --> 01:20:41,920
A man came into the shop
and said...

985
01:20:44,423 --> 01:20:46,717
<i>Shanghai Baby, please.</i>

986
01:20:47,593 --> 01:20:48,844
<i>"What", please?</i>

987
01:20:49,470 --> 01:20:54,683
Shanghai <i>Baby.</i>
The name of... Glico's... single.

988
01:20:57,102 --> 01:20:59,605
The man in the shop said...

989
01:21:00,814 --> 01:21:03,734
How do I say, "sold out"?

990
01:21:05,986 --> 01:21:08,072
"Mai-wan-la."

991
01:21:09,740 --> 01:21:11,367
Mai-wan-la?

992
01:21:12,701 --> 01:21:14,244
Sold out? Amazing!

993
01:21:14,495 --> 01:21:15,746
The customer...

994
01:21:17,498 --> 01:21:18,749
The customer said...

995
01:21:18,957 --> 01:21:23,253
He tried 7 shops,
but they were mai-wan-la.

996
01:21:23,754 --> 01:21:25,130
Sold out...

997
01:21:30,219 --> 01:21:35,391
These are very good
sandwiches. Delicious.

998
01:21:35,974 --> 01:21:39,269
<i>"| will" make them for you again.</i>

999
01:22:00,916 --> 01:22:03,127
I'll be deported.

1000
01:22:03,794 --> 01:22:04,920
What?

1001
01:22:07,131 --> 01:22:09,633
They'll send me back to China.

1002
01:22:09,758 --> 01:22:13,262
Deported. Straight back
to Shanghai.

1003
01:22:15,180 --> 01:22:16,180
Why?

1004
01:22:16,640 --> 01:22:18,809
Who knows?

1005
01:22:22,646 --> 01:22:25,190
Well, you know...

1006
01:22:27,067 --> 01:22:30,195
Give everybody my best.

1007
01:22:30,446 --> 01:22:34,074
And if you ever come to
Shanghai, look me up!

1008
01:22:35,451 --> 01:22:36,785
And...

1009
01:22:41,290 --> 01:22:43,208
Take care of yourself.

1010
01:22:49,423 --> 01:22:51,049
I Will.

1011
01:22:52,593 --> 01:22:55,345
What's music for you, Glico?

1012
01:22:57,431 --> 01:22:58,432
Everything.

1013
01:22:59,725 --> 01:23:02,227
And lastly, your favorite phrase?

1014
01:23:02,603 --> 01:23:04,229
Time is money.

1015
01:23:17,868 --> 01:23:20,496
Hey! Check it out!

1016
01:23:20,746 --> 01:23:22,706
You gotta see this!

1017
01:23:22,873 --> 01:23:25,083
- What?
- What's up?

1018
01:23:29,505 --> 01:23:30,839
What is it?

1019
01:23:32,841 --> 01:23:33,841
This Way!

1020
01:23:36,136 --> 01:23:38,514
- Okay.
- What is it?

1021
01:23:44,019 --> 01:23:46,146
Chai found something cool!

1022
01:23:46,396 --> 01:23:47,481
What?

1023
01:23:47,648 --> 01:23:49,650
Let's check it out.

1024
01:24:03,372 --> 01:24:04,540
Is it real?

1025
01:24:25,435 --> 01:24:27,813
- Here, just a little.
- No way!

1026
01:24:28,188 --> 01:24:30,399
Since you're the one who found it.

1027
01:24:30,566 --> 01:24:32,025
Stop it! All of you!

1028
01:24:32,442 --> 01:24:33,694
He doesn't want to do it.

1029
01:24:35,070 --> 01:24:36,405
Do it yourself!

1030
01:24:37,072 --> 01:24:38,323
Me? I'm not...

1031
01:24:38,699 --> 01:24:39,699
Scared?

1032
01:24:39,825 --> 01:24:42,327
- I'm not scared.
- Do it then, wimp.

1033
01:24:44,663 --> 01:24:46,290
Be a man.

1034
01:24:46,957 --> 01:24:48,709
You better not...

1035
01:24:59,177 --> 01:25:00,929
Feel anything?

1036
01:25:01,096 --> 01:25:02,222
Nothing at all.

1037
01:25:13,734 --> 01:25:15,068
Stop, please!

1038
01:25:15,736 --> 01:25:17,195
Help!

1039
01:25:17,988 --> 01:25:19,865
Help us, please!

1040
01:25:21,742 --> 01:25:23,452
Fucking kids, get out of the way!

1041
01:25:25,996 --> 01:25:27,706
<i>What's all this? Stop a minute.</i>

1042
01:25:29,082 --> 01:25:30,208
Help us!

1043
01:25:30,876 --> 01:25:32,127
What's goin' on here?

1044
01:25:33,629 --> 01:25:35,756
Rio Ranki! It's him!

1045
01:25:38,967 --> 01:25:40,594
Over there.

1046
01:25:44,723 --> 01:25:46,475
In here, Mr. Ranki.

1047
01:25:50,896 --> 01:25:53,732
We melted this...
and with a needle...

1048
01:26:09,414 --> 01:26:10,666
What's going on, Boss?

1049
01:26:11,416 --> 01:26:12,876
To the hospital!

1050
01:26:38,694 --> 01:26:40,278
<i>Your sister?</i>

1051
01:26:40,654 --> 01:26:41,947
<i>Kind of.</i>

1052
01:26:43,699 --> 01:26:45,701
<i>She shot up. "Yentown White".</i>

1053
01:26:46,702 --> 01:26:49,079
<i>This little girl?</i>

1054
01:26:49,705 --> 01:26:52,958
<i>What is this world coming to?</i>

1055
01:26:58,088 --> 01:26:59,089
Glico.

1056
01:27:01,174 --> 01:27:02,300
Glico?

1057
01:27:03,844 --> 01:27:05,971
You're a fan of the Yentown Band, huh?

1058
01:27:06,847 --> 01:27:09,224
- What?
- Yentown Band.

1059
01:27:09,349 --> 01:27:12,185
- You know the singer, Glico.
- What?

1060
01:27:12,352 --> 01:27:13,729
You're into rock, Doc?

1061
01:27:14,730 --> 01:27:16,857
"Rock Doc", I like that sound.

1062
01:27:17,065 --> 01:27:20,193
Obviously, you never heard
of the band, huh?

1063
01:27:20,944 --> 01:27:22,362
They're all the rage.

1064
01:27:23,363 --> 01:27:25,115
I did that tattoo.

1065
01:27:25,323 --> 01:27:27,701
And it's a masterpiece.

1066
01:27:38,211 --> 01:27:39,755
I came here

1067
01:27:39,880 --> 01:27:42,257
with my brother and sister.

1068
01:27:43,008 --> 01:27:45,761
You know, make some quick cash
and cut out.

1069
01:27:45,969 --> 01:27:49,514
Yeah, tell me about it.
It didn't work out, right?

1070
01:27:49,890 --> 01:27:52,851
My brother died in a car crash.

1071
01:27:53,018 --> 01:27:55,395
And, I lost track of my sister.

1072
01:27:56,855 --> 01:27:59,024
Now... it's been years.

1073
01:28:01,109 --> 01:28:02,527
When we first got here,

1074
01:28:03,278 --> 01:28:06,239
we had to think up
Japanese names.

1075
01:28:07,282 --> 01:28:09,785
Called ourselves the "Yaohans".

1076
01:28:12,913 --> 01:28:15,248
I was "Toyota Yaohan".

1077
01:28:15,415 --> 01:28:19,294
Ryankai, my little brother,
he was "Hitachi".

1078
01:28:23,673 --> 01:28:26,259
Only Japanese words we knew.

1079
01:28:31,056 --> 01:28:36,436
My little sister Xiaodie,
I named Glico.

1080
01:28:40,565 --> 01:28:42,901
I named Glico.

1081
01:28:44,653 --> 01:28:47,697
Xiaodie was such
a little ball of energy.

1082
01:28:51,201 --> 01:28:54,287
You know that Japanese candy?

1083
01:28:55,831 --> 01:29:01,336
Japanese businessmen
grow up sucking Glico.

1084
01:29:10,345 --> 01:29:11,721
<i>That's Opium Street.</i>

1085
01:29:11,930 --> 01:29:13,348
Opium Street?

1086
01:29:13,598 --> 01:29:15,433
- Ever been there?
- You kidding?

1087
01:29:16,935 --> 01:29:19,855
The place is crawling with
mafia and traffickers.

1088
01:29:19,980 --> 01:29:23,358
Even the cops won't go there.

1089
01:29:24,192 --> 01:29:27,070
That guy Rio Ranki
is so cool, though.

1090
01:29:31,366 --> 01:29:33,368
Amphetamines was it?

1091
01:29:33,493 --> 01:29:35,495
I don't know.

1092
01:29:39,583 --> 01:29:44,629
No larceny, no assault, no drug
offenses. Looks clean to me.

1093
01:29:47,382 --> 01:29:49,467
- Destination?
- Shanghai.

1094
01:29:49,843 --> 01:29:53,263
That's about 80,000 one-way now.
Got any money?

1095
01:29:54,014 --> 01:29:54,639
No.

1096
01:29:54,973 --> 01:29:57,142
- Get some.
- Where from?

1097
01:29:57,601 --> 01:29:59,603
From your family.

1098
01:30:02,355 --> 01:30:03,356
Go on then!

1099
01:30:04,524 --> 01:30:05,734
I may go?

1100
01:30:05,901 --> 01:30:08,528
Clear out!
Lots of people are waiting.

1101
01:30:08,653 --> 01:30:11,907
Get out! Go!
Get the fuck out of here!

1102
01:30:13,241 --> 01:30:14,534
Hurry up!

1103
01:30:14,868 --> 01:30:17,621
Next. Number 629!

1104
01:30:19,039 --> 01:30:21,374
Un-fucking-believable!

1105
01:31:00,956 --> 01:31:02,207
Ageha!

1106
01:31:03,208 --> 01:31:05,669
He's back! Mr. Fei-Hong.

1107
01:31:12,050 --> 01:31:14,094
61, 62, 63,

1108
01:31:14,302 --> 01:31:16,805
64, 65, 66...

1109
01:31:17,097 --> 01:31:20,058
This is it. No more.

1110
01:31:20,600 --> 01:31:22,978
Forget about Glico
from today on.

1111
01:31:23,436 --> 01:31:25,981
Glico? Who's that?

1112
01:31:26,314 --> 01:31:28,108
I can't seem to remember.

1113
01:31:28,316 --> 01:31:31,736
But if I do, I'll be sure
to let you know.

1114
01:31:36,491 --> 01:31:38,827
One million, right on the money.

1115
01:31:39,369 --> 01:31:41,496
You want a receipt?

1116
01:31:42,372 --> 01:31:44,874
I know you're the one ratting
me out to the cops.

1117
01:31:45,333 --> 01:31:47,877
I can see right through you.

1118
01:31:48,378 --> 01:31:53,091
I'll do my best. So, Fei-Hong,
you do your best, too.

1119
01:31:53,258 --> 01:31:53,758
Huh?

1120
01:31:53,883 --> 01:31:56,469
That's what Glico said.

1121
01:31:57,387 --> 01:31:59,889
She won't listen to any of us.

1122
01:32:01,016 --> 01:32:06,521
You know, she's still chasing
after the bone you've thrown.

1123
01:32:08,606 --> 01:32:13,862
Is that what you call...
the power of love?

1124
01:32:15,739 --> 01:32:17,907
Lucky bastard!

1125
01:32:21,911 --> 01:32:23,663
Afternoon!

1126
01:32:25,540 --> 01:32:28,543
Grumpy bitch.
You got PMS or something?

1127
01:32:28,668 --> 01:32:30,670
Hey there!

1128
01:32:34,049 --> 01:32:35,425
What's going on?

1129
01:32:35,633 --> 01:32:38,053
Desperate for cash?
You piece of shit.

1130
01:32:38,261 --> 01:32:40,513
- What do you want?
- Blackmailing the manager?

1131
01:32:40,638 --> 01:32:43,058
- What are you so steamed about?
- Calm down!

1132
01:32:43,266 --> 01:32:46,311
- Stay out of it!
- Quit the fucking English, asshole!

1133
01:32:46,561 --> 01:32:48,897
Somebody translate this.

1134
01:32:49,522 --> 01:32:50,774
We quit.

1135
01:32:50,940 --> 01:32:53,068
- What is this?
- Fuck you.

1136
01:32:53,193 --> 01:32:54,402
I've had enough!

1137
01:32:54,569 --> 01:32:57,072
Ageha get over here and translate.

1138
01:32:57,280 --> 01:32:59,949
Ageha, translate!

1139
01:33:01,409 --> 01:33:03,536
- What...
- What's this shit?

1140
01:33:03,703 --> 01:33:05,830
Give it back you punk.

1141
01:33:08,666 --> 01:33:11,419
- What is it?
- It looks like a million!

1142
01:33:11,586 --> 01:33:14,214
How much did you get for Glico?

1143
01:33:14,672 --> 01:33:16,341
Let me go!

1144
01:33:16,549 --> 01:33:20,220
Put me down! I'm the boss, right?

1145
01:33:20,595 --> 01:33:21,721
I'll fire you all!

1146
01:33:21,930 --> 01:33:23,223
Out! Out! Out!

1147
01:33:23,431 --> 01:33:25,850
We don't understand Chinese,
you bastard!

1148
01:33:25,975 --> 01:33:27,477
Ageha, tell them!

1149
01:33:29,354 --> 01:33:31,106
They want to know,

1150
01:33:31,314 --> 01:33:35,693
how much you got for Glico,
and why you're so greedy.

1151
01:33:40,490 --> 01:33:43,493
Glico was a valuable business tool.

1152
01:33:43,618 --> 01:33:47,247
What's wrong
with making some money?

1153
01:33:50,125 --> 01:33:51,334
Go on...

1154
01:33:52,627 --> 01:33:53,711
Tell them!

1155
01:33:56,005 --> 01:33:58,258
He said, "Glic0 was an
important tool of the trade."

1156
01:33:58,466 --> 01:34:00,593
And, "What's wrong with
making some money?"

1157
01:34:01,344 --> 01:34:03,471
So, he really said that?

1158
01:34:07,642 --> 01:34:09,477
Yentown scum.

1159
01:34:11,271 --> 01:34:13,231
- Please wait a minute.
- It's over.

1160
01:34:13,523 --> 01:34:14,524
Wait a second.

1161
01:34:31,166 --> 01:34:34,794
Good thing they got out
before it was too late.

1162
01:34:35,295 --> 01:34:38,298
You've been let off
the hook this time.

1163
01:34:49,267 --> 01:34:51,895
Look out! Be careful you idiot!

1164
01:34:54,772 --> 01:34:56,316
Damn shit!

1165
01:34:56,774 --> 01:34:57,817
Hoan!

1166
01:35:00,820 --> 01:35:01,905
Hoan!

1167
01:35:02,780 --> 01:35:03,780
Hey, Boss!

1168
01:35:07,327 --> 01:35:10,163
- Where are we going?
- Opium Street.

1169
01:35:13,708 --> 01:35:15,210
I'm not going.

1170
01:35:15,585 --> 01:35:17,212
Are you afraid?

1171
01:35:17,462 --> 01:35:19,047
No, but...

1172
01:35:20,465 --> 01:35:22,717
What are you going there for?

1173
01:35:27,597 --> 01:35:30,183
Something good.

1174
01:36:31,411 --> 01:36:33,913
These people all
entered the country illegally.

1175
01:36:34,038 --> 01:36:37,000
They live here 'cause
they have no other home.

1176
01:37:13,453 --> 01:37:16,205
Excuse me. We're sorry.

1177
01:37:39,854 --> 01:37:40,938
He's dead.

1178
01:38:01,501 --> 01:38:03,252
That's opium.

1179
01:39:00,184 --> 01:39:01,310
Is this it?

1180
01:39:04,689 --> 01:39:06,691
It says "medical center".

1181
01:39:09,694 --> 01:39:12,071
URINARY ORGANS,
ACUPUNCTURE & TATTOOS

1182
01:39:15,199 --> 01:39:16,534
Hey!

1183
01:39:16,826 --> 01:39:17,827
Hi.

1184
01:39:18,035 --> 01:39:20,204
How've you been feeling? Okay?

1185
01:39:20,955 --> 01:39:23,082
No more shooting up, huh?

1186
01:39:23,541 --> 01:39:27,211
So, what's up this time?
You catch a cold or something?

1187
01:39:27,462 --> 01:39:29,839
Doctor, you do tattoos, right?

1188
01:39:29,964 --> 01:39:31,591
Yes, I do.

1189
01:39:31,716 --> 01:39:33,968
- How much?
- Huh?

1190
01:39:34,427 --> 01:39:36,053
How much would it cost?

1191
01:39:37,972 --> 01:39:39,307
You want a tattoo?

1192
01:39:39,974 --> 01:39:42,435
Boss, you're getting a tattoo?

1193
01:39:42,977 --> 01:39:44,979
Wow! That's great!

1194
01:39:45,188 --> 01:39:46,606
That's fucking great!

1195
01:39:49,108 --> 01:39:51,444
So, what kind do you want?

1196
01:39:51,861 --> 01:39:53,863
Butterfly. On my chest.

1197
01:39:54,739 --> 01:39:56,699
Ah, like Glico's.

1198
01:39:57,492 --> 01:40:02,121
But... this is all I've got.

1199
01:40:02,622 --> 01:40:05,875
No, no... it's not the money.

1200
01:40:06,334 --> 01:40:10,338
You gotta think of a tattoo
as a living thing you raise in your body.

1201
01:40:10,630 --> 01:40:13,841
See, a tattoo can change
your character...

1202
01:40:14,258 --> 01:40:16,135
can change your destiny!

1203
01:40:16,260 --> 01:40:18,137
So you just can't lay one
on anybody.

1204
01:40:27,522 --> 01:40:30,024
Here's the right wing...

1205
01:40:30,650 --> 01:40:32,860
Here's for the left wing.

1206
01:40:34,028 --> 01:40:35,404
The body, I keep.

1207
01:40:35,530 --> 01:40:37,281
I can't fly anyway.

1208
01:40:38,658 --> 01:40:41,285
Take your shirt off
and lie down.

1209
01:40:57,927 --> 01:41:00,179
Do most doctors tattoo?

1210
01:41:00,388 --> 01:41:04,767
Nah, you need many skills,
you know.

1211
01:41:04,934 --> 01:41:07,395
First, you gotta be an artist.

1212
01:41:07,562 --> 01:41:11,941
Then, you gotta have vision.
Like a fortune-teller.

1213
01:41:12,650 --> 01:41:14,193
- A fortune-teller?
- Yes.

1214
01:41:14,569 --> 01:41:17,029
You wanna come here
a little more?

1215
01:41:24,829 --> 01:41:27,039
Wow! You got beautiful skin!

1216
01:41:27,206 --> 01:41:30,084
It's begging for an exquisite design.

1217
01:41:30,918 --> 01:41:32,086
Will it hurt?

1218
01:41:33,421 --> 01:41:34,589
Uh-huh.

1219
01:41:46,100 --> 01:41:48,853
That's a girl. Hang in there.

1220
01:41:52,106 --> 01:41:55,359
Tell me about the first time
you saw a butterfly.

1221
01:41:59,488 --> 01:42:01,324
Just try to remember.

1222
01:42:33,272 --> 01:42:34,607
A small room...

1223
01:42:38,903 --> 01:42:39,904
with a window.

1224
01:42:46,535 --> 01:42:48,120
And where was that?

1225
01:42:51,123 --> 01:42:53,000
I don't remember.

1226
01:42:53,167 --> 01:42:55,294
I think, you do.

1227
01:43:05,930 --> 01:43:08,516
I heard a voice.

1228
01:43:08,808 --> 01:43:10,017
Yeah?

1229
01:43:11,686 --> 01:43:13,688
Somebody calling.

1230
01:43:14,772 --> 01:43:15,772
"Mama!"

1231
01:43:16,565 --> 01:43:17,692
"Mama!"

1232
01:43:20,695 --> 01:43:22,446
Like a kid?

1233
01:43:23,698 --> 01:43:24,907
Maybe.

1234
01:43:29,286 --> 01:43:30,663
What else?

1235
01:43:36,460 --> 01:43:37,837
What's in the room?

1236
01:43:40,464 --> 01:43:41,799
Nothing.

1237
01:43:41,966 --> 01:43:45,219
Come on. There's gotta be
something in the room.

1238
01:43:48,097 --> 01:43:49,974
I don't remember.

1239
01:43:51,100 --> 01:43:53,853
Yes, you do.

1240
01:44:01,235 --> 01:44:03,112
A bathroom...

1241
01:44:06,115 --> 01:44:08,367
Kiyoshi, eat!

1242
01:44:09,368 --> 01:44:10,745
Eat!

1243
01:44:16,751 --> 01:44:18,127
She's playing...

1244
01:44:20,629 --> 01:44:22,256
By herself.

1245
01:44:30,723 --> 01:44:33,642
She's calling Mama
from the bathroom.

1246
01:44:34,769 --> 01:44:36,979
Why is she there?

1247
01:44:43,527 --> 01:44:47,114
She's always in the bathroom,
when Mama works.

1248
01:44:47,907 --> 01:44:49,909
If she calls out...

1249
01:44:50,534 --> 01:44:52,787
Mama scolds her.

1250
01:44:54,121 --> 01:44:56,123
So why call her?

1251
01:45:01,170 --> 01:45:05,424
She's trying to tell her
there's a butterfly.

1252
01:45:10,012 --> 01:45:11,764
She wants to catch it.

1253
01:45:20,272 --> 01:45:21,440
But...

1254
01:45:21,941 --> 01:45:24,318
If Mama doesn't hurry,

1255
01:45:24,527 --> 01:45:26,570
it will fly away.

1256
01:45:41,043 --> 01:45:42,043
Mama!

1257
01:45:42,837 --> 01:45:43,837
Mama!

1258
01:45:48,092 --> 01:45:49,093
Mama!

1259
01:45:50,344 --> 01:45:51,345
Mama!

1260
01:46:33,888 --> 01:46:36,223
Was that my memory?

1261
01:46:39,518 --> 01:46:42,646
I wonder, if that was really me.

1262
01:46:43,898 --> 01:46:45,733
If which was...

1263
01:46:46,483 --> 01:46:49,528
The little girl watching the butterfly?

1264
01:46:55,159 --> 01:46:58,162
Or the butterfly
that got squashed?

1265
01:47:05,544 --> 01:47:07,546
How's that, huh?

1266
01:47:11,008 --> 01:47:12,801
Another masterpiece.

1267
01:47:13,636 --> 01:47:15,554
This butterfly...

1268
01:47:15,679 --> 01:47:18,933
It's called Ageha in Japanese.

1269
01:47:19,767 --> 01:47:23,020
Oh, yeah? What's it called
in English?

1270
01:47:23,687 --> 01:47:25,064
I don't know.

1271
01:47:27,066 --> 01:47:30,194
It's called a swallowtail.

1272
01:47:30,569 --> 01:47:33,405
'Cause it's shaped
like a swallow's tail.

1273
01:47:34,782 --> 01:47:36,408
Swallowtail?

1274
01:47:36,575 --> 01:47:40,579
It's gonna protect you,
no matter how hard things get.

1275
01:47:41,330 --> 01:47:43,040
Hey, believe me!

1276
01:47:43,207 --> 01:47:46,710
'Cause I gave it
that... magical touch.

1277
01:48:01,725 --> 01:48:03,227
- Ms. Suzukino.
- Yes?

1278
01:48:03,477 --> 01:48:06,230
- You've got a visitor.
- Where?

1279
01:48:06,355 --> 01:48:08,107
In the conference room.

1280
01:48:23,872 --> 01:48:25,624
I'm Suzukino.

1281
01:48:27,626 --> 01:48:28,627
May I ask your name?

1282
01:48:30,004 --> 01:48:31,630
Nice to meet you.

1283
01:48:35,884 --> 01:48:38,387
You write this column, don't you?

1284
01:48:38,887 --> 01:48:40,014
That's right.

1285
01:48:42,474 --> 01:48:45,602
I read it every week.

1286
01:48:46,270 --> 01:48:47,980
How may I help you?

1287
01:48:48,147 --> 01:48:51,025
<i>Do you know a guy name
Sudo Kan“?</i>

1288
01:48:51,275 --> 01:48:52,401
<i>Sudo Kan“?</i>

1289
01:48:53,777 --> 01:48:55,779
Look, this guy.

1290
01:48:57,489 --> 01:48:59,408
You wrote this too, right?

1291
01:49:00,034 --> 01:49:02,536
Oh, the deputy of the
Katsushika syndicate.

1292
01:49:02,661 --> 01:49:05,998
I saw how he got killed.

1293
01:49:06,623 --> 01:49:07,623
What?

1294
01:49:08,417 --> 01:49:10,294
He fell from a window.

1295
01:49:16,175 --> 01:49:18,052
Glic0's window.

1296
01:49:18,552 --> 01:49:20,054
You know Glico?

1297
01:49:20,304 --> 01:49:24,558
I doubt it. I only know the Glico
from that Yentown Band.

1298
01:49:24,808 --> 01:49:27,811
Oh, so you do know her.

1299
01:49:55,714 --> 01:49:59,468
I suppose a customer
took this picture.

1300
01:49:59,968 --> 01:50:02,679
She used to be a prostitute?

1301
01:50:06,350 --> 01:50:08,727
This would be quite a scandal.

1302
01:50:11,480 --> 01:50:15,359
How much would you pay for this?

1303
01:50:22,116 --> 01:50:24,243
Can I have some more?

1304
01:50:31,708 --> 01:50:33,377
Thank you.

1305
01:50:34,753 --> 01:50:36,255
I was lucky to get this gig.

1306
01:50:38,590 --> 01:50:40,634
I'm a big fan.

1307
01:50:43,971 --> 01:50:45,764
Ageha!

1308
01:50:50,769 --> 01:50:52,729
Give me the tape.

1309
01:50:53,021 --> 01:50:54,731
The tape?

1310
01:50:56,108 --> 01:50:58,110
Why do you need it?

1311
01:50:58,277 --> 01:51:00,279
Make fake money.

1312
01:51:00,654 --> 01:51:02,281
What for?

1313
01:51:04,032 --> 01:51:05,659
Buy it back.

1314
01:51:06,410 --> 01:51:08,162
Buy what back?

1315
01:51:09,037 --> 01:51:10,164
Everything.

1316
01:51:19,006 --> 01:51:20,674
What's the story here?

1317
01:51:26,680 --> 01:51:28,807
This is Randy Heavens from Yoga.

1318
01:51:29,183 --> 01:51:30,893
Koichi from Suzugamori.

1319
01:51:31,185 --> 01:51:32,686
Chu Ba Jeh from Namamugi.

1320
01:51:32,811 --> 01:51:34,813
Shao Kampao from Gasu Bridge.

1321
01:51:35,189 --> 01:51:36,398
Chu-Bin from Tennozu.

1322
01:51:39,651 --> 01:51:44,281
They're a weird bunch,
but they can pull it off.

1323
01:51:44,823 --> 01:51:46,325
- Hoan.
- What?

1324
01:51:47,659 --> 01:51:49,828
Is that your woman?

1325
01:51:50,078 --> 01:51:51,955
Who do you think you're talking to?

1326
01:51:52,456 --> 01:51:54,333
What do you want, sweetheart?

1327
01:51:54,458 --> 01:51:56,710
Let's be clear, this is strictly business.

1328
01:51:56,919 --> 01:51:58,295
Business?

1329
01:51:58,587 --> 01:52:01,173
How's a million each sound?

1330
01:52:01,340 --> 01:52:02,716
Boss, that's too much!

1331
01:52:03,091 --> 01:52:04,092
What's the job?

1332
01:52:05,427 --> 01:52:06,803
I'll explain.

1333
01:52:22,486 --> 01:52:23,862
Wow!

1334
01:52:24,196 --> 01:52:25,948
I can't believe this.

1335
01:52:29,368 --> 01:52:30,869
- Here.
- Next.

1336
01:52:36,375 --> 01:52:37,459
Here.

1337
01:52:38,126 --> 01:52:39,211
Next.

1338
01:52:43,131 --> 01:52:44,883
Is that all?

1339
01:52:45,342 --> 01:52:46,510
Stop complaining.

1340
01:52:47,636 --> 01:52:48,636
Next.

1341
01:52:50,514 --> 01:52:51,723
Hurry up!

1342
01:52:51,890 --> 01:52:54,726
They'd never know
if we pinched some.

1343
01:52:54,893 --> 01:52:57,145
If they found out,
you'd be in deep shit!

1344
01:52:57,396 --> 01:52:58,522
Come on.

1345
01:53:02,150 --> 01:53:03,360
Hurry up!

1346
01:53:16,123 --> 01:53:17,124
Next.

1347
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:19,418
Is that everything?

1348
01:53:22,671 --> 01:53:23,922
Let's have it.

1349
01:53:27,426 --> 01:53:29,553
- Good job.
- Thank you very much.

1350
01:53:30,178 --> 01:53:31,555
Next.

1351
01:53:38,186 --> 01:53:40,522
You did well to get so many.

1352
01:53:40,689 --> 01:53:42,941
It wasn't easy, was it Chu-Bin?

1353
01:53:43,066 --> 01:53:44,568
No big deal.

1354
01:53:50,073 --> 01:53:51,700
It's ripped.

1355
01:53:53,952 --> 01:53:56,038
What are you doing?

1356
01:53:56,204 --> 01:53:57,414
It's just one...

1357
01:53:57,581 --> 01:53:59,833
What do you think you're doing?

1358
01:54:06,340 --> 01:54:08,592
Got a problem with that?

1359
01:54:21,855 --> 01:54:22,856
What the hell?

1360
01:54:27,611 --> 01:54:30,489
- Good morning.
- Nice to see you.

1361
01:54:30,614 --> 01:54:34,868
- Hi, Ms. Glico! How are you?
- It's great to have you here.

1362
01:54:35,118 --> 01:54:37,371
Why don't you have a seat?

1363
01:54:37,621 --> 01:54:39,873
Yentown Band sure is popular.

1364
01:54:40,707 --> 01:54:42,250
Excuse me.

1365
01:54:42,501 --> 01:54:45,128
I'd like to ask a few questions
while you get ready.

1366
01:54:45,253 --> 01:54:47,130
Mind if I record it?

1367
01:54:47,631 --> 01:54:50,759
Am I the only one who's nervous?

1368
01:54:51,635 --> 01:54:54,513
- The new album's out on the... 21st?
- Yes.

1369
01:54:54,638 --> 01:54:56,515
OK, let's talk about that first.

1370
01:54:56,765 --> 01:55:00,227
<i>Would you move the blue Porsche?</i>

1371
01:55:00,394 --> 01:55:03,021
- Sure. Just a second.
- I'm terribly sorry.

1372
01:55:09,986 --> 01:55:12,030
What's that there?

1373
01:55:13,156 --> 01:55:15,033
- What's that?
- This?

1374
01:55:15,659 --> 01:55:18,370
- How pretty. It's a tattoo, right?
- Yes.

1375
01:55:18,495 --> 01:55:20,997
Isn't that nice!
It suits you're image.

1376
01:55:21,164 --> 01:55:23,792
But it's just like this one.

1377
01:55:25,293 --> 01:55:27,003
- This is you, isn't it?
- Dunno.

1378
01:55:27,254 --> 01:55:30,132
You don't know?
But it's exactly the same.

1379
01:55:37,806 --> 01:55:40,684
What is this? I don't know
what you're talking about.

1380
01:55:40,892 --> 01:55:42,894
OK. Let me put it this way.

1381
01:55:44,438 --> 01:55:46,690
What did you do with Sudo's body?

1382
01:55:47,023 --> 01:55:49,776
You know, the guy who fell
out of your window.

1383
01:55:50,193 --> 01:55:53,029
Remember? Back when you
were a hooker.

1384
01:55:53,280 --> 01:55:55,407
Look! Stop bullshitting!

1385
01:55:57,075 --> 01:55:58,201
What are you doing?

1386
01:55:58,452 --> 01:56:00,704
What've you got in your mouth?

1387
01:56:00,912 --> 01:56:02,330
Spit that out!

1388
01:56:02,456 --> 01:56:06,168
Hey, look at her! Spit it out!

1389
01:56:06,418 --> 01:56:08,962
You can't swallow it!

1390
01:56:10,714 --> 01:56:13,717
Alright, I don't care. Go ahead.

1391
01:56:15,427 --> 01:56:20,474
But this proves
that you were involved.

1392
01:56:20,932 --> 01:56:23,477
You're giving yourself away.

1393
01:56:24,811 --> 01:56:25,979
Aren't you?

1394
01:56:27,105 --> 01:56:28,105
Get it?

1395
01:56:28,231 --> 01:56:31,693
Now, give me back
that soggy picture.

1396
01:56:34,946 --> 01:56:37,199
Don't be so childish!

1397
01:56:38,366 --> 01:56:39,743
You're back?

1398
01:56:39,868 --> 01:56:41,745
I'll wait for you out back. Come alone.

1399
01:56:43,830 --> 01:56:45,123
Excuse me.

1400
01:56:45,332 --> 01:56:47,501
OK, I have to go.

1401
01:56:47,876 --> 01:56:50,879
Sorry about earlier.
I overdid it a bit.

1402
01:56:51,004 --> 01:56:53,715
If I hadn't done it, we wouldn't
be able to talk like this.

1403
01:56:55,759 --> 01:56:59,471
It's not like I'd publish
anything and everything.

1404
01:57:01,598 --> 01:57:05,477
It's more like you've
piqued my curiosity.

1405
01:57:06,770 --> 01:57:10,899
Know what I mean? It's my job,
like singing is for you.

1406
01:57:12,359 --> 01:57:14,903
I don't sing because I like it.

1407
01:57:15,153 --> 01:57:17,280
You don't like singing?

1408
01:57:17,781 --> 01:57:19,115
I hate it.

1409
01:57:19,616 --> 01:57:22,911
The singer who hates to sing.
That's a good one.

1410
01:57:23,411 --> 01:57:24,871
Why is that?

1411
01:57:25,372 --> 01:57:29,042
I don't wanna be the object
of your curiosity, thanks.

1412
01:57:29,543 --> 01:57:32,003
Guess I hit a nerve.

1413
01:57:54,651 --> 01:57:55,651
Open up!

1414
01:57:55,902 --> 01:57:57,195
- Open up!
- Okay.

1415
01:57:58,446 --> 01:57:59,573
Can I help you?

1416
01:58:01,074 --> 01:58:03,326
Want a bullet in the face?

1417
01:58:07,956 --> 01:58:11,334
Hey, you! Where's Sudo's tape?

1418
01:58:11,710 --> 01:58:13,461
Tell me where it is!

1419
01:58:14,588 --> 01:58:15,714
Get out!

1420
01:58:16,298 --> 01:58:16,840
Get out!

1421
01:58:16,965 --> 01:58:18,174
Just a second.

1422
01:58:18,717 --> 01:58:20,093
Don't shoot, please...

1423
01:58:20,218 --> 01:58:21,469
<i>Don't shoe“ Understand?</i>

1424
01:58:23,221 --> 01:58:26,975
I'm stuck. Let me get the...

1425
01:58:27,225 --> 01:58:28,935
get the cigarette.

1426
01:58:29,102 --> 01:58:30,102
Duck!

1427
01:58:46,369 --> 01:58:47,454
Morons!

1428
01:58:48,496 --> 01:58:50,874
You know "Telekura"?

1429
01:58:50,999 --> 01:58:52,125
<i>Yeah.</i>

1430
01:58:52,876 --> 01:58:54,753
The name is "Lovely Friends".

1431
01:58:55,253 --> 01:58:56,755
Teen's recommendation.

1432
01:58:57,380 --> 01:58:59,007
How about you?

1433
01:59:00,383 --> 01:59:01,384
<i>I don't know.</i>

1434
01:59:04,846 --> 01:59:06,222
Good luck.

1435
01:59:08,892 --> 01:59:10,143
Telephone!

1436
01:59:10,393 --> 01:59:12,145
Can I get for you?

1437
01:59:29,371 --> 01:59:30,413
Hello.

1438
01:59:30,789 --> 01:59:34,793
<i>Fei-Hong? Fei-Hong? Is that you?</i>

1439
01:59:35,126 --> 01:59:36,127
<i>It's Glico.</i>

1440
01:59:36,753 --> 01:59:38,546
Hey Glico. What's up?

1441
01:59:38,755 --> 01:59:40,131
<i>How are you?</i>

1442
01:59:40,298 --> 01:59:42,801
Fine. And you?

1443
01:59:43,134 --> 01:59:46,554
<i>Good. How's everyone?</i>

1444
01:59:46,763 --> 01:59:48,056
Oh, very good.

1445
01:59:48,556 --> 01:59:49,683
Fei-Hong...

1446
01:59:50,058 --> 01:59:51,935
Were you on TV the other day?

1447
01:59:52,310 --> 01:59:54,270
Fei-Hong, listen...

1448
01:59:54,396 --> 01:59:55,814
Maybe it was someone else.

1449
01:59:56,022 --> 01:59:58,274
What did you do with that tape?

1450
01:59:59,317 --> 01:59:59,943
Tape?

1451
02:00:00,151 --> 02:00:01,319
<i>O' “My Way“ I.</i>

1452
02:00:03,196 --> 02:00:05,824
There are some weird guys
after me.

1453
02:00:05,949 --> 02:00:07,409
They're looking for the tape.

1454
02:00:09,577 --> 02:00:12,080
<i>They have guns.
What should I do?</i>

1455
02:00:12,205 --> 02:00:15,583
<i>It's probably llumang.
They'll kill us.</i>

1456
02:00:16,584 --> 02:00:18,044
Where are you?

1457
02:00:18,461 --> 02:00:20,171
Where are we?

1458
02:00:22,173 --> 02:00:23,550
No idea.

1459
02:00:24,092 --> 02:00:25,093
We don't know.

1460
02:00:25,468 --> 02:00:26,553
Who's with you?

1461
02:00:26,845 --> 02:00:27,846
Fei-Hong...

1462
02:00:28,179 --> 02:00:30,098
If I get killed -

1463
02:00:30,223 --> 02:00:31,223
What do you mean?

1464
02:00:32,600 --> 02:00:34,728
Forgive me.

1465
02:00:34,978 --> 02:00:35,978
What for?

1466
02:00:36,104 --> 02:00:39,107
Becoming a singer and
leaving you all behind.

1467
02:00:39,607 --> 02:00:40,859
Cut the crap!

1468
02:00:40,984 --> 02:00:42,110
Forgive me.

1469
02:00:42,235 --> 02:00:44,112
Stupid, everyone's
happy for you!

1470
02:00:44,237 --> 02:00:45,321
If I get killed -

1471
02:00:45,447 --> 02:00:46,740
OK, tell me where -

1472
02:00:46,865 --> 02:00:47,615
If they kill me -

1473
02:00:47,824 --> 02:00:50,827
Who? You've never been
the timid type before.

1474
02:00:50,994 --> 02:00:53,121
I may never see you again!

1475
02:00:59,377 --> 02:01:01,755
Don't worry, I'll help you.

1476
02:01:02,255 --> 02:01:03,256
Where are you?

1477
02:01:03,715 --> 02:01:05,842
What's around there?

1478
02:01:06,509 --> 02:01:07,509
FeFHOng!

1479
02:01:12,390 --> 02:01:13,391
Hello?

1480
02:01:15,393 --> 02:01:16,644
Meet me at Blue Sky.

1481
02:01:17,479 --> 02:01:19,731
Fei-Hong? Fei-Hong?

1482
02:01:22,650 --> 02:01:24,652
What's going on?

1483
02:01:29,908 --> 02:01:33,161
I would appreciate it
if you'd explain to me...

1484
02:01:33,620 --> 02:01:36,247
just exactly what's going on?

1485
02:01:38,500 --> 02:01:39,542
Hey!

1486
02:01:41,169 --> 02:01:42,170
<i>They're here.</i>

1487
02:01:59,145 --> 02:02:02,023
<i>I bet Mao Fee's having fun
with Glico right now!</i>

1488
02:02:03,149 --> 02:02:05,819
All we got
was the faggot patrol.

1489
02:02:05,944 --> 02:02:09,322
Hey, I thought that was
right up your alley!

1490
02:02:10,782 --> 02:02:11,782
Shut up!

1491
02:02:12,200 --> 02:02:15,328
Was Glico really a whore?

1492
02:02:16,329 --> 02:02:19,082
Did you all get to stick it to her?

1493
02:02:19,415 --> 02:02:20,792
That's right. Jealous?

1494
02:02:30,844 --> 02:02:31,970
I can't see!

1495
02:02:32,178 --> 02:02:33,847
The blood won't stop!

1496
02:02:45,984 --> 02:02:47,443
You'll pay for this!

1497
02:02:59,622 --> 02:03:01,124
- Open up!
- Hey!

1498
02:03:13,219 --> 02:03:15,388
Hey taxi! Taxi!

1499
02:03:22,270 --> 02:03:23,396
Wait!

1500
02:03:26,357 --> 02:03:28,484
- Oh, shit!
- What's up?

1501
02:03:28,651 --> 02:03:31,738
My money! Mr. Fei-Hong!
Do you have the money?

1502
02:03:31,905 --> 02:03:34,157
Huh? Let me see...

1503
02:03:37,493 --> 02:03:39,871
It's not enough. More money?

1504
02:03:42,040 --> 02:03:43,541
What's With this bill?

1505
02:03:44,250 --> 02:03:45,543
What's this?

1506
02:03:46,294 --> 02:03:47,503
Will 10 be enough?

1507
02:03:48,046 --> 02:03:49,631
Keep an eye on him!

1508
02:03:50,673 --> 02:03:53,051
Money! I'll be back with 10,000.

1509
02:03:53,676 --> 02:03:54,676
What're you...

1510
02:03:55,303 --> 02:03:58,890
The God of Yen has not
forsaken us!

1511
02:03:59,933 --> 02:04:01,309
Mr. Fei-Hong!

1512
02:04:02,685 --> 02:04:04,187
Go in! Go in!

1513
02:04:09,067 --> 02:04:12,695
Huh? What kind of idiot
carjacks a taxi,

1514
02:04:13,446 --> 02:04:16,074
and then pays the fare?

1515
02:04:17,909 --> 02:04:19,327
Give it back!

1516
02:04:19,452 --> 02:04:20,912
Give it back!

1517
02:04:24,082 --> 02:04:26,042
What are you doing?

1518
02:04:30,713 --> 02:04:35,343
<i>This bank note is invalid.</i>

1519
02:04:57,699 --> 02:04:59,617
Where is Ran?

1520
02:05:00,326 --> 02:05:02,453
Ran! Ran! Ran!

1521
02:05:04,580 --> 02:05:07,750
Hey, long time no see.

1522
02:05:07,959 --> 02:05:09,627
Ran, she's my friend.

1523
02:05:10,586 --> 02:05:13,881
Hi, nice... I'm glad to see you.

1524
02:05:14,757 --> 02:05:16,384
Isn't he a nice man?

1525
02:05:16,592 --> 02:05:17,592
What's the matter?

1526
02:05:17,760 --> 02:05:20,263
Ran, do you have
that cassette tape?

1527
02:05:20,471 --> 02:05:21,471
What about it?

1528
02:05:21,639 --> 02:05:22,974
I just wanna borrow it.

1529
02:05:23,266 --> 02:05:24,266
Why?

1530
02:05:24,642 --> 02:05:26,894
- Come on...
- Let me have it!

1531
02:05:27,353 --> 02:05:29,647
What do you need it for?

1532
02:05:30,023 --> 02:05:32,275
Come on! Please, Ran!

1533
02:05:33,401 --> 02:05:34,527
Who's that?

1534
02:05:38,990 --> 02:05:40,158
More friends?

1535
02:05:55,298 --> 02:05:56,632
Isn't this overkill?

1536
02:05:57,300 --> 02:06:00,261
Shut up! Mr. Ranki's orders.

1537
02:06:00,887 --> 02:06:05,767
Just for one little tape?
That's stupid. Ridiculous!

1538
02:06:05,933 --> 02:06:09,437
It can't be helped.
Mr. Ranki's orders.

1539
02:06:13,024 --> 02:06:14,567
This is no fun at all!

1540
02:06:16,194 --> 02:06:19,072
Please Ran, the tape! Hurry!

1541
02:06:19,405 --> 02:06:20,573
It's not here.

1542
02:06:20,782 --> 02:06:21,782
What?

1543
02:06:22,450 --> 02:06:23,534
Ageha took it.

1544
02:06:26,662 --> 02:06:27,662
Aim!

1545
02:06:40,051 --> 02:06:41,051
Fire!

1546
02:06:54,107 --> 02:06:55,733
I'll find some other tape.

1547
02:06:55,942 --> 02:06:57,944
- Right?
- Other tape?

1548
02:06:59,070 --> 02:07:00,321
That won't work!

1549
02:07:00,863 --> 02:07:02,323
Buy me some time!

1550
02:07:03,741 --> 02:07:04,992
We're looking for it!

1551
02:07:05,868 --> 02:07:06,953
Glico!

1552
02:07:11,249 --> 02:07:13,376
Hey, look what I found.

1553
02:07:13,626 --> 02:07:14,626
Wait, wait, wait...

1554
02:07:15,378 --> 02:07:16,378
What are you doing?

1555
02:07:24,470 --> 02:07:25,888
Please, stop that!

1556
02:07:26,639 --> 02:07:28,766
- Stop it. I beg you.
- Ran!

1557
02:07:29,267 --> 02:07:30,267
OK.

1558
02:07:36,732 --> 02:07:38,526
This guy got a death wish?

1559
02:07:38,734 --> 02:07:40,403
Interesting. Very interesting.

1560
02:07:40,778 --> 02:07:43,030
Hold your fire!
Worry about the tape later.

1561
02:07:43,239 --> 02:07:46,659
<i>Mao Fee's on the Warpath now.
He's a dead man.</i>

1562
02:07:47,034 --> 02:07:48,034
Hey!

1563
02:07:49,036 --> 02:07:51,873
How about one-on-one?

1564
02:07:52,915 --> 02:07:56,294
If you get me,
we'll let you all live.

1565
02:07:56,669 --> 02:07:57,795
What's he saying?

1566
02:07:58,296 --> 02:07:59,797
One-on-one.

1567
02:08:01,007 --> 02:08:03,926
Mao Foo don't make
promises like that.

1568
02:08:10,183 --> 02:08:11,684
He's coming!

1569
02:08:12,143 --> 02:08:15,188
Glico. When I give the signal,
get down.

1570
02:08:15,938 --> 02:08:17,565
Okay. What kind of signal?

1571
02:08:21,944 --> 02:08:24,197
- Gimme any signal!
- Get down.

1572
02:08:48,846 --> 02:08:51,349
Today's not your day, is it?

1573
02:09:09,742 --> 02:09:11,744
What is this, a war?

1574
02:09:17,458 --> 02:09:19,377
Sorry, we're closed.

1575
02:09:23,381 --> 02:09:28,386
Oh, Ageha. What brings you here?

1576
02:09:35,643 --> 02:09:36,769
What's all this?

1577
02:09:37,144 --> 02:09:39,605
I want to buy it back.

1578
02:09:40,273 --> 02:09:42,024
The Yentown Club.

1579
02:09:45,778 --> 02:09:47,780
Will you sell it to me?

1580
02:09:53,869 --> 02:09:59,166
You may be a kid,
but you have a lot of cash.

1581
02:10:00,918 --> 02:10:05,673
- Where did you get all that money?
- It's a secret.

1582
02:10:09,176 --> 02:10:10,928
Did you rob a bank?

1583
02:10:41,959 --> 02:10:46,672
Oh, I forgot.
It's already been sold.

1584
02:10:47,673 --> 02:10:49,717
What! To who?

1585
02:10:50,468 --> 02:10:51,469
It's too late.

1586
02:10:52,345 --> 02:10:55,431
- I'll buy it off them.
- You can't do that.

1587
02:10:55,598 --> 02:10:58,309
Why not? Yes I can!

1588
02:10:58,601 --> 02:11:02,355
- But I've got all this money!
- No means no!

1589
02:11:04,357 --> 02:11:06,442
Go home.
Take the money with you.

1590
02:11:13,115 --> 02:11:16,494
<i>The left print is from
the forgery.</i>

1591
02:11:17,828 --> 02:11:19,872
They match, don't they?

1592
02:11:20,831 --> 02:11:21,831
It's the same guy.

1593
02:11:22,625 --> 02:11:24,960
Run a check on
Rio Ranki's group.

1594
02:11:26,003 --> 02:11:30,883
We may have something this time.
Liumang King, I'm gonna get you.

1595
02:11:32,009 --> 02:11:33,469
<i>Who hired you?</i>

1596
02:11:35,012 --> 02:11:37,264
<i>I don't know what
you're talking about.</i>

1597
02:11:39,767 --> 02:11:41,268
<i>Don't play dumb with me.</i>

1598
02:11:41,477 --> 02:11:45,523
<i>Lately, the same fake bills
pop up all over the town.</i>

1599
02:11:49,402 --> 02:11:52,405
You did all that
by yourself, huh?

1600
02:11:56,283 --> 02:11:58,285
What's he talkin' about?

1601
02:12:04,542 --> 02:12:06,794
Then where did you get this?

1602
02:12:10,131 --> 02:12:11,424
I found it.

1603
02:12:11,674 --> 02:12:12,925
He found it.

1604
02:12:18,889 --> 02:12:20,891
Lying hurts, doesn't it?

1605
02:12:21,058 --> 02:12:23,936
Even a Yentown
can understand that!

1606
02:12:24,186 --> 02:12:27,398
Or, do you need a little
taste of death?

1607
02:12:27,565 --> 02:12:29,567
Hey, Yentown!

1608
02:12:32,194 --> 02:12:35,906
Who's your boss? Tell us
and we'll let you go.

1609
02:12:40,202 --> 02:12:41,912
Is it Rio Ranki?

1610
02:12:45,583 --> 02:12:47,543
I don't know.

1611
02:12:47,793 --> 02:12:49,086
He doesn't know.

1612
02:12:52,840 --> 02:12:54,717
Want money, Yentown?

1613
02:12:55,092 --> 02:12:57,094
Will you talk for money?

1614
02:12:57,219 --> 02:12:59,305
Yentowns do anything for money.

1615
02:12:59,597 --> 02:13:00,973
Talk!

1616
02:13:01,223 --> 02:13:02,349
Yentown!

1617
02:13:36,634 --> 02:13:40,346
Your whole fucking country
is nothing but a Yentown!

1618
02:13:44,600 --> 02:13:46,268
That's what he said.

1619
02:13:53,150 --> 02:13:54,652
Get up!

1620
02:14:07,248 --> 02:14:08,541
Bastard!

1621
02:14:26,892 --> 02:14:29,270
Fuckin' cop.

1622
02:14:30,938 --> 02:14:34,692
I'll kill that bastard one day.

1623
02:14:41,323 --> 02:14:43,200
God, it hurts.

1624
02:15:04,597 --> 02:15:06,932
Un-fucking-believable!

1625
02:16:05,407 --> 02:16:08,118
The guy was singing a song
all night long.

1626
02:16:08,285 --> 02:16:09,536
A song?

1627
02:16:09,912 --> 02:16:12,164
Yeah. "My Way".

1628
02:16:18,170 --> 02:16:21,006
You're right. He's dead.

1629
02:16:37,189 --> 02:16:39,775
<i>Name of the deceased?</i>

1630
02:16:42,236 --> 02:16:43,362
FeFHong.

1631
02:16:44,738 --> 02:16:45,738
<i>What?</i>

1632
02:16:46,865 --> 02:16:48,492
Hio Fei-Hong.

1633
02:16:49,493 --> 02:16:50,744
<i>A</i> Chinese?

1634
02:16:55,499 --> 02:16:57,751
<i>From Fujian or Shanghai?</i>

1635
02:17:04,007 --> 02:17:05,342
Yentown.

1636
02:18:06,904 --> 02:18:08,155
Glico.

1637
02:18:09,656 --> 02:18:12,451
The caterpillar turned into
a butterfly.

1638
02:19:44,793 --> 02:19:48,422
Hey! What are you throwing away?

1639
02:19:51,675 --> 02:19:52,885
How much was there?

1640
02:19:53,635 --> 02:19:54,635
Lots.

1641
02:19:54,928 --> 02:19:56,638
How much was it?

1642
02:19:57,931 --> 02:19:58,932
I forgot.

1643
02:20:02,436 --> 02:20:03,562
Shit!

1644
02:20:37,471 --> 02:20:39,556
<i>Once upon a time, when the Yen</i>

1645
02:20:39,723 --> 02:20:42,809
<i>was the most powerful force
in the world,</i>

1646
02:20:42,976 --> 02:20:45,312
<i>the city overflowed with immigrants</i>

1647
02:20:45,437 --> 02:20:47,481
<i>like a gold rush boomtown.</i>

1648
02:20:47,689 --> 02:20:49,566
<i>They came in search of Yen.</i>

1649
02:20:49,942 --> 02:20:51,485
<i>Snatching up Yen.</i>

1650
02:20:51,693 --> 02:20:55,197
<i>And the immigrants
called the city Yentown.</i>

1651
02:20:55,739 --> 02:20:58,325
<i>But the Japanese hated that name.</i>

1652
02:20:58,492 --> 02:21:02,120
<i>So they referred to those
yen thieves as Yentowns.</i>

1653
02:21:02,746 --> 02:21:06,750
<i>It's a bit puzzling, but "Yentown"
meant both the city,</i>

1654
02:21:07,000 --> 02:21:09,336
<i>and the outcasts.</i>

1655
02:21:09,503 --> 02:21:12,631
<i>If they worked hard,
earned a pocketful of yen,</i>

1656
02:21:12,881 --> 02:21:14,841
<i>and they returned home,</i>

1657
02:21:15,008 --> 02:21:16,510
<i>they'd be rich men.</i>

1658
02:21:16,885 --> 02:21:19,221
<i>It sounds like a fairy tale,</i>

1659
02:21:19,388 --> 02:21:22,975
<i>but it was a paradise of yen.
"Yentown".</i>

1660
02:21:23,100 --> 02:21:27,145
<i>And this is the story of
Yentowns in Yentown.</i>

1661
02:21:27,521 --> 02:21:30,399
Come on, lad. You're always
late. Get in there.

1662
02:21:34,236 --> 02:21:36,405
The target just passed the
<i>2</i> kilometer mark.

1663
02:21:36,613 --> 02:21:38,657
Should be there in one minute.

1664
02:21:39,282 --> 02:21:41,034
- You know about tonight's main dish?
- Nah.

1665
02:21:42,035 --> 02:21:45,038
He's your buddy. Liumang King.

1666
02:21:49,918 --> 02:21:51,795
<i>We're checking now, but...</i>

1667
02:21:52,004 --> 02:21:54,798
<i>We heard the Fuchen “umang
were on the move.</i>

1668
02:21:55,424 --> 02:21:57,426
The Fuchen are behind it?

1669
02:21:57,634 --> 02:21:59,636
<i>It's hard to believe.</i>

1670
02:22:00,053 --> 02:22:05,183
<i>In any case, Mao Foo and the
whole gang have vanished.</i>

1671
02:22:06,018 --> 02:22:08,812
<i>The police have got wind
of the tape, too.</i>

1672
02:22:09,021 --> 02:22:11,148
<i>We should move quick.</i>

1673
02:22:11,523 --> 02:22:16,069
If we get the tape, we can
cash in and return to Shanghai.

1674
02:22:18,071 --> 02:22:23,827
Or, maybe I'll buy this whole
town and fix the place up.

1675
02:22:27,831 --> 02:22:29,458
Yentown.

1676
02:22:31,168 --> 02:22:33,211
God, how I hate it.

1677
02:22:42,095 --> 02:22:43,555
<i>' Stop!</i> "<i>Huh?</i>"

1678
02:22:48,727 --> 02:22:49,728
Hey!

1679
02:22:51,938 --> 02:22:53,106
You're looking well!

1680
02:22:58,445 --> 02:22:59,613
Not too bad.

1681
02:23:00,739 --> 02:23:02,824
Stay out of trouble, okay?

1682
02:23:04,201 --> 02:23:06,953
- Shopping?
- Yeah, for my store.

1683
02:23:07,370 --> 02:23:10,749
- Your store?
- It's over there, across the highway.

1684
02:23:11,374 --> 02:23:12,584
What do you sell?

1685
02:23:17,255 --> 02:23:20,133
- <i>Boss, we should be going!</i>
- Right.

1686
02:23:20,342 --> 02:23:23,637
- You're a busy man.
- I lost something I need.

1687
02:23:26,139 --> 02:23:27,224
Gotta go.

1688
02:23:28,850 --> 02:23:29,851
Wait!

1689
02:23:37,526 --> 02:23:39,027
For helping me.

1690
02:23:42,114 --> 02:23:43,406
What's on it?

1691
02:23:44,032 --> 02:23:45,408
"My Way»!

1692
02:23:46,409 --> 02:23:48,620
Don't you know "My Way"?

1693
02:23:50,914 --> 02:23:52,165
Hey!

1694
02:23:56,378 --> 02:23:57,420
What's your name?

1695
02:23:58,672 --> 02:23:59,672
Ageha.

1696
02:24:00,298 --> 02:24:01,424
Aseha?

1697
02:24:02,050 --> 02:24:03,677
Glico gave me my name.

1698
02:24:07,180 --> 02:24:10,308
<i>You know,</i> Glico <i>the hooker.</i>
