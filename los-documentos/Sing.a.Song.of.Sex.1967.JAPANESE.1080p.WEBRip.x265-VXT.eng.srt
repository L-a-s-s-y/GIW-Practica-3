Want one?
- I have my own.

21
00:03:32,819 --> 00:03:34,651
It's No. 469.

22
00:03:39,574 --> 00:03:42,544
Couldn't keep my eyes off her
during the exam.

23
00:03:42,662 --> 00:03:44,790
If I fail, it's her fault.

24
00:03:45,799 --> 00:03:47,768
You've found yourself
a good excuse.

25
00:03:47,801 --> 00:03:49,793
You had your eye on her too.

26
00:03:54,404 --> 00:03:55,531
Ladies and gentlemen,

27
00:03:55,775 --> 00:03:59,610
please support our campaign

28
00:04:01,781 --> 00:04:04,717
We must bring peace to Vietnam.

29
00:04:05,685 --> 00:04:10,623
Please join us
in opposing the Vietnam War.

30
00:04:24,643 --> 00:04:25,736
Thank you very much.

00:04:26,371 --> 00:04:27,566

00:04:56,669 --> 00:04:58,604
You two sign too.

35
00:04:59,706 --> 00:05:01,800
You can't possibly
be for the war.

Hey, cut the crap!

39
00:05:15,789 --> 00:05:19,624
Hey, Nakamura and Ueda,
how'd it go?

40
00:05:19,793 --> 00:05:22,729
A couple more years of study
won't kill you.

41
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:26,598
You must be relieved
the exams are over.

42
00:05:27,901 --> 00:05:29,802
Look at me.

43
00:05:29,836 --> 00:05:32,738
I keep taking the exams
just for that feeling.

44
00:05:34,355 --> 00:05:36,449
Where are you going now?

45
00:05:39,594 --> 00:05:41,688
Wanna go to the Lawrence
in Shinjuku?

46
00:05:42,749 --> 00:05:44,684
Come to the Lawrence.

47
00:05:51,375 --> 00:05:52,468
Pig!

48
00:05:53,593 --> 00:05:55,562
What's the Lawrence?

49
00:06:01,701 --> 00:06:03,670
Hey, Hiroi!

50
00:06:06,673 --> 00:06:08,665
Cut it out!

51
00:06:12,812 --> 00:06:16,681
The Lawrence?
He wants to fool around with a widow?

52
00:06:16,716 --> 00:06:20,881
I saw a nice girl at my school too.
Her number was –

53
00:06:21,318 --> 00:06:24,345
We have No. 469.
Forget yours.

54
00:06:24,691 --> 00:06:27,889
Does he mean the Lawrence
of <i>Lady Chatterley's Lover?</i>

55
00:06:28,511 --> 00:06:29,824
Don't bother figuring it out.

56
00:06:30,406 --> 00:06:31,601
He's always saying stupid stuff.

57
00:06:31,831 --> 00:06:36,599
I'm sure No. 469 isn't married.
She's a virgin.

58
00:06:36,636 --> 00:06:38,696
I'm not so sure about that.

59
00:06:38,805 --> 00:06:41,741
She is, I tell you.
Really good-looking too.

60
00:06:41,774 --> 00:06:44,744
No. 469.
Was she that good?

61
00:06:44,777 --> 00:06:47,645
Of course.
No one else like her.

62
00:06:47,747 --> 00:06:51,741
I should've taken
the exam for your university.

63
00:06:56,756 --> 00:06:58,748
Did he mean the movie
<i>Lawrence of Arabia?</i>

64
00:06:58,791 --> 00:07:02,660
Use your head.
It's got nothing to do with heroism.

65
00:07:02,695 --> 00:07:04,721
The bastard said it
in a really lascivious way.

66
00:07:04,764 --> 00:07:06,756
What's "lascivious" mean?

67
00:07:06,799 --> 00:07:08,631
It has to do with sex.

68
00:07:08,668 --> 00:07:09,863
Lustful.

69
00:07:10,361 --> 00:07:11,454
Like us.

70
00:07:11,704 --> 00:07:13,798
- What's the name?
<i>- Lawrence of Arabia?</i>

71
00:07:14,452 --> 00:07:16,444
No, <i>her</i> name.

72
00:07:16,676 --> 00:07:18,702
- Fujiwara.
<i>- First</i> name.

73
00:07:19,779 --> 00:07:23,716
Fujiwara, No. 469 from Tokyo.

74
00:08:16,669 --> 00:08:18,661
- Who are they?
- I don't know.

75
00:08:18,705 --> 00:08:20,697
What's in that box?

76
00:08:20,773 --> 00:08:22,674
Probably nothing.

77
00:08:22,809 --> 00:08:25,779
"One day I looked up

78
00:08:25,812 --> 00:08:28,782
and saw a black flag
waving high in the sky.

79
00:08:29,612 --> 00:08:32,548
It waved so high

80
00:08:32,685 --> 00:08:35,587
I couldn't hear its sound.

81
00:08:36,492 --> 00:08:39,462
I tried to bring it down,

82
00:08:39,596 --> 00:08:41,656
but without a rope
there was nothing I could do.

83
00:08:42,629 --> 00:08:45,531
The flag just kept on waving

84
00:08:46,366 --> 00:08:49,359
as if flying off
into the depths of the sky...

85
00:08:49,669 --> 00:08:52,639
as if flying off
into the depths of the sky."

86
00:09:33,629 --> 00:09:36,724
ABOLISH NATIONAL
FOUNDATION DAY

87
00:09:47,744 --> 00:09:50,646
Aren't you going to say anything?

88
00:09:50,747 --> 00:09:53,740
Abolish National Foundation Day!

89
00:09:55,785 --> 00:09:59,654
- Long live the Lawrence in Shinjuku!
- Long live No. 469!

90
00:10:01,474 --> 00:10:03,500
Hey, look.

91
00:10:06,696 --> 00:10:08,790
- What?
- He's with a woman.

92
00:10:08,865 --> 00:10:10,857
- Who is?
- Our teacher.

93
00:11:28,811 --> 00:11:31,906
- Ueda, go after her.
- Why me?

94
00:11:32,473 --> 00:11:34,567
- Just do it.
- You go.

95
00:11:34,817 --> 00:11:36,683
You go.

96
00:11:36,786 --> 00:11:39,688
- What about you?
- I think I'm catching a cold.

97
00:11:39,822 --> 00:11:40,915
Go on.

98
00:12:36,913 --> 00:12:38,779
Excuse me.

99
00:12:40,883 --> 00:12:42,749
What is it?

100
00:12:42,818 --> 00:12:44,912
You've been following me,
haven't you?

101
00:12:46,439 --> 00:12:48,670
- We're his students.
- "His"?

102
00:12:49,759 --> 00:12:51,728
I see. And?

103
00:12:53,829 --> 00:12:55,661
Nothing.

104
00:12:55,831 --> 00:12:57,732
Forgive me.

105
00:13:06,776 --> 00:13:07,937
What's wrong, Nakamura?

106
00:13:08,277 --> 00:13:10,875
Did you see that mocking look
on her face?

107
00:13:11,647 --> 00:13:13,843
- Yeah, full of contempt.
- Is that all?

108
00:13:13,883 --> 00:13:18,753
- Why'd she make that face?
- Maybe they'd fought.

109
00:13:18,788 --> 00:13:20,780
- Is she his girlfriend?
- Probably his plaything.

110
00:13:20,856 --> 00:13:22,882
Dyed hair
doesn't make her a prostitute.

111
00:13:23,659 --> 00:13:24,888
She <i>is</i> a prostitute.

112
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,855
Does he hold her
with that same solemn look?

113
00:13:28,664 --> 00:13:29,962
"Hold me tighter, baby."

114
00:13:31,801 --> 00:13:33,770
Think she undresses by herself?

115
00:13:33,803 --> 00:13:35,669
There are all types.

116
00:13:35,705 --> 00:13:37,799
What would I do if a girl said,
"Help me undress"?

117
00:13:37,873 --> 00:13:40,775
No girl's ever gonna
say that to you.

118
00:13:41,744 --> 00:13:44,805
That woman undresses on her own.
She just seems the type.

119
00:13:44,847 --> 00:13:46,782
She isn't my type,
I'll tell you that.

120
00:13:46,816 --> 00:13:49,752
Otake doesn't base
his choices on your type.

121
00:13:49,819 --> 00:13:51,754
He sure seems to know
what he's doing.

122
00:13:51,821 --> 00:13:54,620
You look up to him?

123
00:13:55,925 --> 00:13:58,759
No. 469. Right, Nakamura?

124
00:14:00,663 --> 00:14:02,723
Damn it, let's go find her.

125
00:14:03,632 --> 00:14:05,828
- Should we call her?
- You know her address?

126
00:14:05,935 --> 00:14:07,836
No, but the university does.

127
00:14:11,874 --> 00:14:13,672
Hello.

128
00:14:13,743 --> 00:14:16,679
I took my exams today.

129
00:14:16,746 --> 00:14:19,841
Can you give me
the name of another examinee?

130
00:14:20,587 --> 00:14:22,783
No. 469, a female.

131
00:14:23,657 --> 00:14:24,784
Not allowed?

132
00:14:27,890 --> 00:14:30,655
They can't do it.

133
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:33,694
Miss Sanae of Maebashi?

134
00:14:33,763 --> 00:14:36,756
- Miss Tomoko of Maebashi?
- Miss Satoko Ikegami?

135
00:14:37,509 --> 00:14:39,478
Miss Sanae Satomi?

136
00:14:39,647 --> 00:14:41,582
This is shameful.
Let's go.

137
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:46,606
Miss Sanae?

138
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:49,702
Miss Tomoko?

139
00:14:50,746 --> 00:14:53,614
Miss Sanae, No. 469?

140
00:14:54,511 --> 00:14:56,605
Miss Sanae, No. 469?

141
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:59,616
Miss Tomoko, No. 469?

142
00:15:00,565 --> 00:15:03,467
Hey, what high school
is your date from?

143
00:15:03,562 --> 00:15:06,532
Tell these idiots
your appointment isn't a date.

144
00:15:06,633 --> 00:15:08,727
- No imagination.
- Don't worry about that.

145
00:15:08,864 --> 00:15:11,766
- We're going to see the teacher.
- Otake?

146
00:15:11,834 --> 00:15:13,826
Better stay away from him.

147
00:15:13,936 --> 00:15:15,871
Sure, he's good-looking
and lives in Tokyo.

148
00:15:16,274 --> 00:15:18,470
How about coming to the Lawrence?

149
00:15:18,941 --> 00:15:20,876
Don't be so crazy about Otake.

150
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:25,428
- We could go to graduate school too.
- Sure you're smart enough?

151
00:15:25,626 --> 00:15:27,686
Otake's sleeping with someone.

152
00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:31,685
We saw him walking
with an ugly woman.

153
00:15:31,887 --> 00:15:33,788
We don't need you following us.

154
00:15:45,801 --> 00:15:50,739
<i>Today we fly to Kasumigaura</i>

155
00:15:51,707 --> 00:15:54,836
<i>A great cloud of hope wells up</i>

156
00:15:55,845 --> 00:16:00,647
If you boys want
to go home now, feel free.

157
00:16:02,527 --> 00:16:04,428
Maruyama, have some.

158
00:16:04,601 --> 00:16:05,591
I'm fine.

159
00:16:05,721 --> 00:16:08,657
Stop it.

160
00:16:08,824 --> 00:16:10,622
Sir...

161
00:16:12,553 --> 00:16:16,490
I want to live in Tokyo.
Should I rent an apartment?

162
00:16:16,932 --> 00:16:19,834
- Yeah, you should.
- One with no lock.

163
00:16:19,935 --> 00:16:23,633
That's not for me to say.
It's up to you.

164
00:16:23,739 --> 00:16:26,641
And I want to read Henry Miller.

165
00:16:26,742 --> 00:16:29,769
- His descriptions are so –
- Nakamura, stop it.

166
00:16:29,845 --> 00:16:33,782
Mr. Otake, of <i>Sexus,</i>
<i>Nexus,</i> and <i>Plexus –</i>

167
00:16:33,849 --> 00:16:36,648
You wouldn't understand
any of it.

168
00:16:36,785 --> 00:16:38,651
What time is it?

169
00:16:38,687 --> 00:16:39,848
Mr. Otake...

170
00:16:40,956 --> 00:16:42,822
may I have some too?

171
00:16:43,692 --> 00:16:44,819
Of course.

172
00:16:46,481 --> 00:16:49,576
Sir, do you always go drinking
at restaurants like this?

173
00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:54,831
You go to bars too, right?

174
00:16:55,508 --> 00:16:57,704
Come on.
Finish eating already.

175
00:16:58,841 --> 00:17:02,642
There are trains at 7:36, 7:58,

176
00:17:02,678 --> 00:17:05,614
8:26, 8:38 –

177
00:17:05,648 --> 00:17:07,674
Let's all take the 7:36.

178
00:17:07,816 --> 00:17:09,648
What's the rush?

179
00:17:09,818 --> 00:17:11,810
We all just finished exams.

180
00:17:11,854 --> 00:17:14,688
You may have
to retake them next year.

181
00:17:14,823 --> 00:17:16,815
I've been watching all of you,

182
00:17:17,374 --> 00:17:19,754
and boys and girls
really are different.

183
00:17:19,828 --> 00:17:22,855
What do you think
of the examination system?

184
00:17:23,346 --> 00:17:25,863
Sir, don't men and women
sometimes go to protests together?

185
00:17:26,175 --> 00:17:28,269
Yours had nice legs.

186
00:17:28,771 --> 00:17:31,639
They didn't do anything
special when they parted.

187
00:17:35,844 --> 00:17:36,868
Sir...

188
00:17:46,722 --> 00:17:48,657
I peeled this shrimp for you.

189
00:17:53,829 --> 00:17:55,798
Sir, I'll have some too.

190
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:59,692
Thanks for the meal.

191
00:18:11,369 --> 00:18:14,430
<i>Let's begin
with the first case, ho, ho!</i>

192
00:18:14,624 --> 00:18:18,527
<i>Doing it with an only daughter, ho!</i>

193
00:18:18,754 --> 00:18:22,748
<i>Ask her parents'
permission first, ho, ho!</i>

194
00:18:23,726 --> 00:18:26,719
<i>Let's go on
to the second case, ho, ho!</i>

195
00:18:27,663 --> 00:18:28,858
Quiet, everyone!

196
00:18:29,632 --> 00:18:30,861
<i>Doing it with two sisters, ho!</i>

197
00:18:31,234 --> 00:18:35,330
<i>Take the older one first, ho, ho!</i>

198
00:18:35,838 --> 00:18:38,831
<i>Let's go on
to the third case, ho!</i>

199
00:18:39,775 --> 00:18:43,610
<i>Doing it with an ugly girl, ho!</i>

200
00:18:43,712 --> 00:18:47,615
<i>Cover her face
with a wrapping cloth, ho, ho!</i>

201
00:18:48,717 --> 00:18:51,778
<i>Let's go on
to the fourth case, ho!</i>

202
00:18:52,721 --> 00:18:56,715
<i>When doing it upstairs, ho!</i>

203
00:18:56,792 --> 00:19:01,594
<i>Be quiet
so you won't be heard, ho, ho!</i>

204
00:19:07,636 --> 00:19:08,797
Let's go.

205
00:19:33,729 --> 00:19:35,721
Sir, don't you hold
your liquor well?

206
00:20:02,791 --> 00:20:05,852
A <i>Soran</i> tune from Hokkaido...

207
00:20:06,662 --> 00:20:08,961
a <i>Tsugaru-jongara</i> tune from Aomori...

208
00:20:09,798 --> 00:20:12,859
a <i>Mugi-tsuki</i> tune from Iwate...

209
00:20:13,519 --> 00:20:15,511
an <i>Ohara</i> tune from Toyama...

210
00:20:15,632 --> 00:20:17,726
an <i>Itchaka</i> tune from Chiba...

211
00:20:17,906 --> 00:20:21,900
not to mention the amazing things
I heard in Enoshima.

212
00:20:22,304 --> 00:20:26,400
Bridal songs from Yamanashi,
nursery songs from Mie,

213
00:20:26,886 --> 00:20:29,685
ramming songs from Kumamoto,

214
00:20:29,765 --> 00:20:32,633
millet-husking songs from Miyazaki...

215
00:20:32,921 --> 00:20:36,688
and <i>asadoya yunta</i> work songs
from Okinawa.

216
00:20:37,893 --> 00:20:39,885
Bawdy songs,

217
00:20:40,829 --> 00:20:42,627
raunchy songs,

218
00:20:42,664 --> 00:20:44,724
erotic songs,

219
00:20:45,667 --> 00:20:47,636
songs about sex –

220
00:20:47,770 --> 00:20:51,639
these are the suppressed
voices of the people.

221
00:20:51,673 --> 00:20:55,633
An oppressed people's labor,

222
00:20:55,677 --> 00:20:56,838
their lives...

223
00:20:57,780 --> 00:20:59,646
and their loves.

224
00:20:59,748 --> 00:21:01,944
Once people became
conscious of these things,

225
00:21:02,663 --> 00:21:05,599
they naturally turned to song
to express themselves.

226
00:21:05,754 --> 00:21:11,785
That's why bawdy songs represent
the history of the people.

227
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:15,797
Still, no need to force
the youngsters to listen.

228
00:21:18,801 --> 00:21:21,896
I feel sorry for them.

229
00:21:22,601 --> 00:21:27,630
They don't know
how to feel anything fully.

230
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:31,802
No politics, no panties,
no oppression –

231
00:21:31,914 --> 00:21:33,974
They can't even sense
that they're oppressed.

232
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:38,724
So there's no other choice
but to sing for them like this.

233
00:21:41,657 --> 00:21:46,721
<i>Rising into the clouds</i>

234
00:21:46,762 --> 00:21:49,664
<i>The high peak of Takachiho</i>

235
00:21:49,731 --> 00:21:52,758
So a doomed people sings
the songs of a doomed nation?

236
00:21:54,636 --> 00:21:58,732
What's it matter?
Japan's full of doomed people.

237
00:22:02,778 --> 00:22:06,874
"I remember three years ago,
when the village suffered a drought,

238
00:22:07,749 --> 00:22:12,653
the family council deliberated
whether to sell the daughter or the house.

239
00:22:12,688 --> 00:22:16,682
They decided to sell their daughter

240
00:22:16,758 --> 00:22:19,660
and got 3,000 <i>ryo</i> for her.

241
00:22:20,796 --> 00:22:23,891
They put lipstick on her,
powdered her face,

242
00:22:24,527 --> 00:22:26,655
put her in a palanquin
bedecked with flowers,

243
00:22:27,603 --> 00:22:29,697
and took her
to a well-known place

244
00:22:29,905 --> 00:22:33,672
in the red-light district."

245
00:22:34,877 --> 00:22:41,807
<i>Knowing neither
my place nor my name</i>

246
00:22:42,751 --> 00:22:48,748
<i>Unable to avoid
the most dreadful of customers</i>

247
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:55,402
<i>Sleeping alone
night after night</i>

248
00:22:55,831 --> 00:23:01,737
<i>All this for my useless parents</i>

249
00:23:08,495 --> 00:23:09,485
Let's go.

250
00:23:09,684 --> 00:23:12,586
What? Leaving so soon?

251
00:23:13,618 --> 00:23:16,611
It's just getting interesting!

252
00:23:18,854 --> 00:23:21,653
Please sing
for the Lawrence in Shinjuku.

253
00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:23,850
What's the Lawrence?

254
00:23:24,793 --> 00:23:26,659
I don't know.

255
00:23:26,695 --> 00:23:28,789
Lawrence of Arabia was a hero.

256
00:23:28,864 --> 00:23:30,799
He attacked Turkey.

257
00:23:30,866 --> 00:23:34,860
I attack the "Turkish baths"
in Shinjuku,

258
00:23:34,903 --> 00:23:38,863
so I'm Lawrence of Shinjuku.

259
00:23:40,465 --> 00:23:43,560
Will you men be
Lawrence of Arabia

260
00:23:43,912 --> 00:23:47,849
or Lawrence of Shinjuku?

261
00:23:50,652 --> 00:23:55,818
<i>The English are so clever</i>

262
00:23:56,407 --> 00:24:00,606
<i>They use rubber and paper</i>

263
00:24:01,763 --> 00:24:04,665
<i>Russians use their fingers</i>

264
00:24:04,733 --> 00:24:07,828
"Not a single one of our actions

265
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:11,370
can be divorced from rage.

266
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:16,642
Taking a break to catch your breath
and sleeping at night

267
00:24:16,678 --> 00:24:18,840
are both a waste of time.

268
00:24:19,781 --> 00:24:22,649
They will make you late for battle.

269
00:24:23,442 --> 00:24:27,641
Even so, love is the only
true act of resistance.

270
00:24:28,857 --> 00:24:31,656
They all trample upon love.

271
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:36,858
If you realize
that your parents or wives

272
00:24:37,589 --> 00:24:39,860
have taken the enemy's side...

273
00:24:40,802 --> 00:24:43,704
you must abandon them!

274
00:24:44,806 --> 00:24:47,742
You can no longer...

275
00:24:48,341 --> 00:24:50,469
fear hatred!

276
00:24:50,812 --> 00:24:53,839
You can no longer
be ashamed to be a fanatic!

277
00:24:54,207 --> 00:24:56,335
I have a grudge with them.

278
00:24:57,288 --> 00:25:00,452
They nearly did me in,
didn't they?

279
00:25:02,658 --> 00:25:06,823
Only when you embrace hatred
do you really feel this human existence.

280
00:25:08,456 --> 00:25:11,688
Hatred turns poverty
into a nurturing cradle.

281
00:25:12,834 --> 00:25:16,635
I know this quite well,

282
00:25:16,772 --> 00:25:20,732
so I savor my rage,
and my hatred grows by the day."

283
00:25:51,707 --> 00:25:54,802
Can you girls still catch
the last train?

284
00:25:54,843 --> 00:25:56,812
We're staying here tonight.

285
00:25:56,845 --> 00:25:58,746
You do that!

286
00:25:59,429 --> 00:26:02,607
I'll put you up in a hotel.

287
00:26:05,754 --> 00:26:08,724
Shall we catch
an exhibit tomorrow?

288
00:26:09,725 --> 00:26:11,660
Fantastic!

289
00:26:12,861 --> 00:26:15,660
After all, there's no school.

290
00:26:16,352 --> 00:26:19,447
A long holiday in February
for the first time since the war!

291
00:26:19,646 --> 00:26:21,512
Let's have fun!

292
00:26:32,848 --> 00:26:35,682
Are you really wearing those?
You idiot!

293
00:26:37,372 --> 00:26:41,623
Ueda's a simpleton.
He's so superstitious.

294
00:26:41,690 --> 00:26:42,817
This is no superstition.

295
00:26:43,353 --> 00:26:46,515
I passed math and English
because of these.

296
00:26:46,628 --> 00:26:49,598
Didn't you say you failed
because of No. 469?

297
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:54,702
Ueda, go to the girls' room
like that and get some food.

298
00:26:54,736 --> 00:26:56,602
Do they have any?

299
00:26:56,638 --> 00:26:58,800
They must.
They're gorging right now.

300
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:00,741
In panties and slips?

301
00:27:00,809 --> 00:27:04,610
Damn! There are three girls
right next door.

302
00:27:05,847 --> 00:27:07,816
Three virgins?

303
00:27:08,917 --> 00:27:11,716
- Go on.
- "You pervert!"

304
00:27:12,621 --> 00:27:13,714
Go ahead.

305
00:27:13,755 --> 00:27:14,848
Cut it out, asshole!

306
00:27:15,367 --> 00:27:17,616
I'll strip you naked, bastard!

307
00:27:19,628 --> 00:27:20,755
A virgin's here!

308
00:27:20,829 --> 00:27:22,661
Don't put anything on.

309
00:27:22,731 --> 00:27:23,858
Come in.

310
00:27:26,668 --> 00:27:27,863
It's Kaneda.

311
00:27:28,255 --> 00:27:32,283
Mr. Otake paid the bill,
so don't worry about that.

312
00:27:32,576 --> 00:27:36,513
Please be sure to check out
by 10:00 a.m.

313
00:27:36,658 --> 00:27:38,684
Ueda!

314
00:27:42,784 --> 00:27:44,810
- Kaneda?
<i>- What?</i>

315
00:27:45,341 --> 00:27:46,714
You got any food?

316
00:27:46,788 --> 00:27:48,814
<i>Yeah, rice crackers and doughnuts.</i>

317
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:50,786
Go like that.

318
00:27:50,826 --> 00:27:52,692
Idiot.

319
00:27:52,794 --> 00:27:54,820
Then I guess I'll go.

320
00:27:56,387 --> 00:27:58,583
I might even get in their room.

321
00:28:15,851 --> 00:28:17,717
Hey!

322
00:28:17,752 --> 00:28:18,913
<i>What?</i>

323
00:28:21,723 --> 00:28:22,850
Thank you.

324
00:28:30,671 --> 00:28:32,606
Take this key.

325
00:28:34,376 --> 00:28:35,503
I'll try.

326
00:28:39,774 --> 00:28:41,675
Will that key work?

327
00:28:41,710 --> 00:28:44,578
- Why would it?
- It might.

328
00:28:44,813 --> 00:28:47,578
<i>Excuse me.
Please open up.</i>

329
00:28:47,782 --> 00:28:50,684
<i>I need to talk to you.</i>

330
00:28:50,785 --> 00:28:54,586
<i>We shouldn't let Mr. Otake
pay for everything.</i>

331
00:28:54,689 --> 00:28:56,681
<i>Let's talk about the bill.</i>

332
00:28:56,825 --> 00:28:58,760
What a jerk!

333
00:28:58,793 --> 00:29:00,694
That's pathetic!

334
00:29:06,801 --> 00:29:10,602
<i>It's 12:00 midnight.
Hurry home to bed, children.</i>

335
00:29:10,639 --> 00:29:12,665
<i>Your mommies are worried.</i>

336
00:29:12,707 --> 00:29:14,642
Sanae?

337
00:29:14,743 --> 00:29:16,735
Let's feel each other up.

338
00:29:16,811 --> 00:29:18,712
Tomoko too.

339
00:29:21,716 --> 00:29:23,708
- What?
- It's my turn.

340
00:29:24,553 --> 00:29:26,419
What a drag.

341
00:29:26,721 --> 00:29:29,657
Watch.
I'll show you how it's done.

342
00:29:29,824 --> 00:29:31,725
<i>Now it's Nakamura.</i>

343
00:29:32,627 --> 00:29:34,755
That's right – Toyoaki Nakamura.

344
00:29:34,829 --> 00:29:36,730
<i>Just ignore them.</i>

345
00:29:36,765 --> 00:29:39,826
<i>Let's go to sleep.
Let them get all worked up.</i>

346
00:29:42,685 --> 00:29:44,677
Hey, I feel lascivious!

347
00:29:44,773 --> 00:29:45,934
<i>What?</i>

348
00:29:47,562 --> 00:29:50,657
- I feel lascivious.
<i>- I don't know what that means.</i>

349
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,849
I'll write it down.

350
00:30:02,958 --> 00:30:04,790
<i>What's wrong?</i>

351
00:30:04,859 --> 00:30:06,760
I forgot my pen.

352
00:30:31,391 --> 00:30:33,598
Excuse me.
I came to get my fountain pen.

353
00:30:37,926 --> 00:30:39,792
Mr. Otake!

354
00:31:08,890 --> 00:31:15,694
<i>Let's begin
with the first case, ho</i>

355
00:31:18,867 --> 00:31:24,773
<i>Doing it with an only daughter, ho</i>

356
00:31:27,688 --> 00:31:31,591
<i>Ask her parents' permission first</i>

357
00:32:54,658 --> 00:32:56,559
You still here?

358
00:33:02,871 --> 00:33:05,841
- Good night.
- Yes, good night.

359
00:33:22,891 --> 00:33:24,757
Bastard!

360
00:33:24,859 --> 00:33:28,762
Going by yourself!
We'll strip you for that!

361
00:33:28,796 --> 00:33:32,858
<i>Let's begin
with the first case, ho, ho!</i>

362
00:33:33,701 --> 00:33:37,797
<i>Doing it with an only daughter, ho!</i>

363
00:33:39,487 --> 00:33:43,549
<i>Ask her parents'
permission first, ho, ho!</i>

364
00:33:43,711 --> 00:33:47,705
<i>Now let's go on
to the second case, ho, ho!</i>

365
00:33:47,849 --> 00:33:50,683
You'd be ashamed
if No. 469 found out!

366
00:33:50,718 --> 00:33:53,745
<i>Doing it with two sisters, ho!</i>

367
00:33:54,622 --> 00:33:57,922
<i>Take the older one first, ho, ho!</i>

368
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:02,661
<i>Let's go on
to the third case, ho!</i>

369
00:34:02,730 --> 00:34:06,792
<i>Doing it with an ugly girl, ho!</i>

370
00:34:08,670 --> 00:34:11,799
<i>Take the older one first, ho, ho!</i>

371
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:15,776
What's wrong with him?
He doesn't even care.

372
00:34:16,945 --> 00:34:19,881
What?
Giving up so soon?

373
00:34:20,648 --> 00:34:22,776
Stripping you is no fun.

374
00:34:23,785 --> 00:34:25,777
Where'd you really go?

375
00:34:27,822 --> 00:34:29,757
To Otake's.

376
00:34:29,791 --> 00:34:32,818
- Why?
- I left my pen there.

377
00:34:32,894 --> 00:34:34,829
You went back for it?

378
00:34:36,764 --> 00:34:38,699
What was he doing?

379
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:42,600
He was fast asleep.

380
00:34:42,837 --> 00:34:44,772
The gas heater was burning.

381
00:35:20,855 --> 00:35:22,687
Get up.

382
00:35:22,824 --> 00:35:24,816
- Sleep with me.
- Idiot!

383
00:35:24,893 --> 00:35:27,795
- Hey, come a little closer.
- What for?

384
00:35:27,829 --> 00:35:29,821
- Closer.
- What is it?

385
00:35:30,732 --> 00:35:31,791
I saw it!

386
00:35:31,833 --> 00:35:33,893
- Pervert!
- You girls are no fun.

387
00:35:33,935 --> 00:35:35,995
"7000 Years of the Orient"
opens at 10:00.

388
00:35:36,738 --> 00:35:39,936
Otake packed us together like this
so we'd have sex.

389
00:35:40,709 --> 00:35:43,645
- That's why he sang that song.
- Ultra-pervert!

390
00:35:43,678 --> 00:35:47,672
The first human civilization
was established 7,000 years ago

391
00:35:47,749 --> 00:35:49,741
in the Tigris-Euphrates delta.

392
00:35:49,784 --> 00:35:51,946
- Yeah, by men and women.
- That's enough.

393
00:35:52,487 --> 00:35:55,548
If you're not coming,
at least go thank Mr. Otake.

394
00:35:55,677 --> 00:35:57,578
What for?

395
00:35:57,759 --> 00:35:59,887
We'll thank him
if you bring him here.

396
00:36:00,531 --> 00:36:01,658
Let's go.

397
00:36:01,863 --> 00:36:05,664
<i>Let's begin
with the first case, ho, ho!</i>

398
00:36:05,867 --> 00:36:06,891
I like that song...

399
00:36:07,409 --> 00:36:08,536
Of course.
It's the best.

400
00:36:08,870 --> 00:36:10,896
...when Mr. Otake sings it!

401
00:36:13,908 --> 00:36:15,774
To be...

402
00:36:16,878 --> 00:36:18,710
or not to be?

403
00:36:22,784 --> 00:36:24,685
Checkout time.

404
00:36:42,409 --> 00:36:43,570
You too.

405
00:36:44,839 --> 00:36:46,774
To be or not to be...

406
00:36:46,841 --> 00:36:48,673
What's that?

407
00:36:54,749 --> 00:36:56,775
Tails.

408
00:36:59,888 --> 00:37:01,754
What's wrong?

409
00:37:02,326 --> 00:37:04,318
Please go away!

410
00:37:07,896 --> 00:37:09,797
Stop crying!

411
00:37:10,273 --> 00:37:14,471
Mr. Otake drank too much last night.

412
00:37:16,306 --> 00:37:18,589
And he sang really loud.

413
00:37:18,873 --> 00:37:20,671
Yeah, he did.

414
00:37:20,775 --> 00:37:22,676
That's why...

415
00:37:22,877 --> 00:37:24,709
...he died?

416
00:37:27,682 --> 00:37:28,877
What happened because he sang?

417
00:37:29,697 --> 00:37:33,793
He was tired and fell asleep
with the gas heater on.

418
00:37:35,690 --> 00:37:36,817
The heater?

419
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:40,729
He was really drunk.

420
00:37:41,459 --> 00:37:44,486
He kicked the heater hose
loose in his sleep,

421
00:37:44,685 --> 00:37:47,484
and the room filled with gas.

422
00:37:47,714 --> 00:37:50,616
He didn't know
the gas was killing him.

423
00:37:50,872 --> 00:37:53,120
The police are there now.

424
00:37:55,295 --> 00:37:57,321
This isn't a joke, is it?

425
00:37:57,672 --> 00:38:00,699
Did the gas kill him?
I think he killed himself.

426
00:38:01,636 --> 00:38:03,730
He only has himself to blame.

427
00:38:03,885 --> 00:38:07,845
Aren't you even sad
that he's dead?

428
00:38:07,889 --> 00:38:09,858
Of course we are.

429
00:38:10,662 --> 00:38:12,563
He was kind to us.

430
00:38:12,694 --> 00:38:14,754
But some people at school
will be happy.

431
00:38:14,796 --> 00:38:16,765
- You idiots!
- Cut it out!

432
00:38:16,798 --> 00:38:19,700
Nothing we can do about it
if he's dead.

433
00:38:21,803 --> 00:38:25,672
But he did so much for you boys!

434
00:38:25,773 --> 00:38:27,674
So what?

435
00:38:27,709 --> 00:38:29,769
"That's what teachers
and parents are for."

436
00:38:29,811 --> 00:38:32,872
- A man has died!
- Yeah, very stupidly.

437
00:38:32,914 --> 00:38:37,818
An emperor or president could die
like that and people would laugh.

438
00:38:37,886 --> 00:38:39,878
You're a madman!
An ingrate!

439
00:38:39,921 --> 00:38:41,753
You aren't human!

440
00:38:41,823 --> 00:38:45,726
Go complain to the guy
who died a fool's death.

441
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:49,663
How can you talk
about your teacher that way?

442
00:38:49,731 --> 00:38:50,926
Now I get it.

443
00:38:52,096 --> 00:38:54,830
You girls were in love with him,

444
00:38:54,869 --> 00:38:58,670
and you can't stand
that he died such a stupid death.

445
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:00,775
Let's go pay our respects.

446
00:39:00,842 --> 00:39:02,674
Yeah, probably best.

447
00:39:02,744 --> 00:39:04,736
Seems like the thing to do.

448
00:39:08,850 --> 00:39:10,842
Which of you is Hiroi?

449
00:39:11,428 --> 00:39:12,616
That's me.

450
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:15,549
- Ueda?
- That's me.

451
00:39:15,857 --> 00:39:18,793
You're Maruyama?

452
00:39:19,032 --> 00:39:20,507
And you're Nakamura?

453
00:39:21,963 --> 00:39:24,899
You boys accompanied
Mr. Otake here last night.

454
00:39:25,636 --> 00:39:27,662
- That's right.
- What time did you leave him?

455
00:39:27,869 --> 00:39:29,861
Around 10:30, wasn't it?

456
00:39:30,682 --> 00:39:32,898
He asked us to stay a while,

457
00:39:33,182 --> 00:39:36,175
but he was really drunk,
so we left.

458
00:39:36,699 --> 00:39:38,691
Who turned on the heater?

459
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:40,712
Mr. Otake.

460
00:39:40,815 --> 00:39:44,877
The cause of death
was carbon monoxide poisoning.

461
00:39:44,986 --> 00:39:47,785
Anything else
you might have noticed?

462
00:39:47,822 --> 00:39:49,688
Not really.

463
00:39:50,892 --> 00:39:53,691
I did come back
for something I'd left behind.

464
00:39:53,728 --> 00:39:54,923
Left behind?

465
00:39:55,469 --> 00:39:58,462
- A fountain pen.
- A fountain pen, huh?

466
00:39:58,735 --> 00:40:00,567
Come this way.

467
00:40:10,845 --> 00:40:12,814
I wonder if he killed him.

468
00:40:12,847 --> 00:40:14,713
Who knows.

469
00:40:14,816 --> 00:40:17,012
- What do you think?
- I don't know.

470
00:40:19,821 --> 00:40:21,847
I didn't have any motive.

471
00:40:22,698 --> 00:40:24,826
You look like you suspect me.
- Maybe.

472
00:40:25,592 --> 00:40:27,788
You have to admit,
you had an opportunity.

473
00:40:28,481 --> 00:40:31,542
Maybe so,
but I'm not that stupid.

474
00:40:31,788 --> 00:40:34,656
People can kill for no reason.

475
00:40:35,870 --> 00:40:37,031
This is ridiculous.

476
00:40:37,904 --> 00:40:39,930
Why are you so suspicious of me?

477
00:40:40,345 --> 00:40:42,314
I'm not particularly.

478
00:40:42,656 --> 00:40:44,784
I'm just –
- Passing the time?

479
00:40:54,822 --> 00:40:56,916
We had so much fun with him.

480
00:40:57,992 --> 00:41:00,791
He even sang for us.

481
00:41:00,828 --> 00:41:03,696
I peeled shrimp for him.

482
00:41:07,735 --> 00:41:11,729
"We'll go to an exhibit."
Those were his last words.

483
00:41:12,384 --> 00:41:14,546
I last saw him
at the demonstration.

484
00:41:23,830 --> 00:41:26,823
<i>Let's begin
with the first case, ho, ho!</i>

485
00:41:27,955 --> 00:41:31,824
<i>Doing it with an only daughter, ho!</i>

486
00:41:32,509 --> 00:41:35,741
<i>Ask her parents' permission first</i>

487
00:41:38,514 --> 00:41:40,506
That's the last song he sang.

488
00:41:42,648 --> 00:41:46,585
You're the one
who followed me yesterday.

489
00:41:49,911 --> 00:41:53,814
We were trying to figure out
your relationship to him.

490
00:41:59,374 --> 00:42:01,366
Did he really sing that song?

491
00:42:22,944 --> 00:42:24,936
It couldn't have been that song.

492
00:42:25,913 --> 00:42:29,816
His last song must have been
something better.

493
00:42:31,953 --> 00:42:33,945
Isn't that right?

494
00:42:52,673 --> 00:42:53,800
Three teas.

495
00:43:00,915 --> 00:43:02,816
You must be thirsty.

496
00:43:08,923 --> 00:43:11,688
Stop crying.
People are watching.

497
00:43:13,545 --> 00:43:15,537
She bought a handkerchief.

498
00:43:16,694 --> 00:43:17,821
Let's go.

499
00:43:18,933 --> 00:43:20,799
What are you doing?

500
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:25,632
The four of us killed Mr. Otake.

501
00:43:27,942 --> 00:43:30,741
- You did?
- Yeah, all together.

502
00:43:31,184 --> 00:43:32,567
After you went to sleep.

503
00:43:33,305 --> 00:43:34,398
We were mad.

504
00:43:34,733 --> 00:43:37,635
Because you wouldn't let us in.

505
00:43:37,852 --> 00:43:39,718
He talked so big.

506
00:43:39,754 --> 00:43:41,017
You know that heater?

507
00:43:41,689 --> 00:43:43,749
We kicked it over!

508
00:43:47,573 --> 00:43:48,957
Let's take that train.

509
00:43:49,431 --> 00:43:50,714
That's the Shinetsu line.

510
00:43:50,798 --> 00:43:53,859
Doesn't matter.
We'll talk about this later.

511
00:44:00,875 --> 00:44:02,707
Get on.

512
00:44:10,303 --> 00:44:11,601
You were lying, weren't you?

513
00:44:13,375 --> 00:44:14,502
Weren't you?

514
00:44:14,989 --> 00:44:16,821
It's the truth.

515
00:44:34,709 --> 00:44:35,904
They're watching us.

516
00:44:35,943 --> 00:44:38,708
Shall we wave a handkerchief?

517
00:44:48,856 --> 00:44:52,884
Did they really believe it?
Won't they spread it around?

518
00:44:53,435 --> 00:44:54,630
You went too far.

519
00:44:54,792 --> 00:44:59,787
Don't blame me.
Nakamura sounded really serious.

520
00:45:00,234 --> 00:45:02,328
- Were you really serious?
- Yeah.

521
00:45:02,792 --> 00:45:04,727
What did you tell the detective?

522
00:45:04,872 --> 00:45:08,673
So you killed him
when you went back alone?

523
00:45:08,776 --> 00:45:09,869
You kicked the heater?

524
00:45:09,911 --> 00:45:11,777
I'm not like you guys.

525
00:45:11,812 --> 00:45:15,806
If we'd thought of this last night,
at least one of those girls –

526
00:45:15,883 --> 00:45:19,684
We could've had all three.
They were all crying.

527
00:45:20,591 --> 00:45:23,584
Even ugly girls are sexy
when they cry.

528
00:45:23,704 --> 00:45:25,639
But there were only three of them.

529
00:45:25,749 --> 00:45:27,877
We'd have worked it out.

530
00:45:29,599 --> 00:45:32,865
Sanae would be a pushover.
She's a crybaby.

531
00:45:33,387 --> 00:45:35,413
She covers her face
when she cries.

532
00:45:35,559 --> 00:45:38,893
- Then we grab her from behind.
- Of course.

533
00:45:39,385 --> 00:45:42,549
<i>Let's begin
with the first case, ho, ho!</i>

534
00:45:43,678 --> 00:45:47,740
<i>Doing Sanae Satomi, ho!</i>

535
00:45:47,848 --> 00:45:52,650
<i>We do it while wiping away
her tears, ho, ho!</i>

536
00:46:02,763 --> 00:46:05,892
I like girls who resist, like Tomoko.
More of a challenge.

537
00:46:06,358 --> 00:46:08,863
We gotta be careful with Tomoko.

538
00:46:08,903 --> 00:46:12,704
If she resists,
we'll rip her clothes off.

539
00:46:12,773 --> 00:46:14,708
What'll she say afterward?

540
00:46:14,775 --> 00:46:16,676
"Mother!"

541
00:46:18,466 --> 00:46:21,781
<i>Let's go on
to the second case, ho, ho!</i>

542
00:46:21,916 --> 00:46:26,786
<i>Doing it with Tomoko Ikegami, ho!</i>

543
00:46:26,821 --> 00:46:31,725
<i>Put some antiseptic
on one hand, ho, ho!</i>

544
00:46:46,841 --> 00:46:49,936
<i>Let's go on
to the third case, ho, ho!</i>

545
00:46:50,745 --> 00:46:52,839
<i>Doing it with Sachiko Kaneda</i>

546
00:46:52,947 --> 00:46:55,746
Forget it.
Kaneda won't get us hot.

547
00:46:55,850 --> 00:46:58,877
That's right.
Why's she like that anyway?

548
00:46:59,531 --> 00:47:02,558
<i>Let's go on
to the fourth case, ho!</i>

549
00:47:02,890 --> 00:47:07,469
<i>Doing it with No. 469, ho!</i>

550
00:47:07,658 --> 00:47:11,789
<i>Can't do it without
asking her name, ho, ho!</i>

551
00:47:12,867 --> 00:47:16,668
<i>Let's go on
to the fifth case, ho!</i>

552
00:47:16,804 --> 00:47:20,764
<i>Doing it with No. 469, ho!</i>

553
00:47:20,908 --> 00:47:25,676
<i>Do it on a desk
instead of a bed, ho, ho!</i>

554
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:29,783
<i>Let's go on
to the sixth case, ho!</i>

555
00:47:29,884 --> 00:47:34,686
<i>Doing it with No. 469, ho!</i>

556
00:47:34,822 --> 00:47:38,816
<i>Do it during an exam, ho, ho!</i>

557
00:47:39,894 --> 00:47:41,726
<i>What about the examiner?</i>

558
00:47:41,762 --> 00:47:44,755
<i>There's only one.</i>

559
00:47:45,633 --> 00:47:46,862
<i>There's gotta be more.</i>

560
00:47:49,837 --> 00:47:52,773
<i>- Who'll handle him?
- Leave it to me.</i>

561
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:54,832
<i>You can't handle him, Ueda.</i>

562
00:47:55,776 --> 00:47:58,678
<i>Ueda's too clumsy.
I'll do it.</i>

563
00:48:01,525 --> 00:48:03,687
<i>It doesn't matter
how we get rid of him.</i>

564
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:05,681
<i>Yeah, just get rid of him.</i>

565
00:48:06,419 --> 00:48:07,614
<i>No. 469.</i>

566
00:48:07,955 --> 00:48:09,856
<i>Where's she sitting?</i>

567
00:48:10,017 --> 00:48:11,918
<i>Near the front.</i>

568
00:48:12,860 --> 00:48:15,887
<i>- Ueda knows her face?
- Who'll talk to her?</i>

569
00:48:16,897 --> 00:48:20,857
<i>- Maruyama's a smooth talker.
- Yeah, let him do it.</i>

570
00:48:20,968 --> 00:48:24,700
<i>- No, I'm no good at talking.
- Just drag her down.</i>

571
00:48:24,772 --> 00:48:28,675
<i>- What about the others?
- It doesn't matter.</i>

572
00:48:51,866 --> 00:48:54,700
<i>She's thrashing around like a fish.</i>

573
00:48:54,735 --> 00:48:57,762
<i>- You're in trouble.
- She's a fighter.</i>

574
00:49:12,853 --> 00:49:16,756
<i>- What do you do then?
- I can't exactly show you.</i>

575
00:49:19,793 --> 00:49:22,695
<i>All he did
was wrestle with her.</i>

576
00:49:31,805 --> 00:49:33,706
<i>He only got her shoes off.</i>

577
00:49:33,774 --> 00:49:35,902
<i>Someone might try to help her.</i>

578
00:49:36,618 --> 00:49:37,870
<i>Yeah, some do-gooder.</i>

579
00:49:37,912 --> 00:49:40,780
<i>- Someone'll have to beat him up.
- Who?</i>

580
00:49:40,814 --> 00:49:42,783
<i>- I'll do it.
- You will?</i>

581
00:49:42,883 --> 00:49:44,818
<i>Ueda, go on.</i>

582
00:49:44,885 --> 00:49:46,877
<i>Just don't get beaten up yourself.</i>

583
00:50:04,838 --> 00:50:07,808
<i>You know her uniform
has a top and a bottom?</i>

584
00:50:07,841 --> 00:50:09,901
<i>She's out cold.</i>

585
00:50:09,944 --> 00:50:11,936
<i>He sure is taking his time.</i>

586
00:50:14,748 --> 00:50:17,809
<i>Think he can really do it?</i>

587
00:50:19,019 --> 00:50:21,716
<i>You're done already?</i>

588
00:50:21,755 --> 00:50:23,815
<i>Chicken out at the last minute?</i>

589
00:50:23,924 --> 00:50:26,723
<i>It's not like a simple fistfight.</i>

590
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:28,023
<i>My turn.</i>

591
00:50:34,628 --> 00:50:36,722
<i>Is she unconscious
in Hiroi's version too?</i>

592
00:50:36,841 --> 00:50:38,554
<i>Better that way.</i>

593
00:50:38,748 --> 00:50:40,649
<i>More realistic.</i>

594
00:50:48,751 --> 00:50:51,744
<i>- I'll rip her clothes off.
- Hurry up and do it.</i>

595
00:50:55,438 --> 00:50:56,918
<i>It's not like a public bathhouse.</i>

596
00:50:57,691 --> 00:50:58,989
<i>You gotta be kidding.</i>

597
00:51:10,804 --> 00:51:12,830
<i>None of you guys
actually fucked her.</i>

598
00:51:12,906 --> 00:51:15,842
<i>She's completely out
and just lying there.</i>

599
00:51:15,909 --> 00:51:18,708
<i>My turn.</i>

600
00:51:19,648 --> 00:51:22,641
<i>- Show us.
- Think you can do it?</i>

601
00:51:23,287 --> 00:51:26,416
<i>- I'm not like you guys.
- You gonna do something weird?</i>

602
00:51:29,427 --> 00:51:31,396
<i>What are you gonna do?</i>

603
00:51:31,523 --> 00:51:35,688
<i>The others will rush to the desk
for their exam papers.</i>

604
00:51:41,393 --> 00:51:43,645
<i>What'll you do
with them all around?</i>

605
00:51:43,771 --> 00:51:45,763
<i>You guys might not see.</i>

606
00:51:55,916 --> 00:51:58,681
<i>So what'll you do?</i>

607
00:52:01,722 --> 00:52:03,691
That was exhausting.

608
00:52:16,621 --> 00:52:20,717
Think you could tell No. 469
what we just imagined?

609
00:52:21,008 --> 00:52:23,807
Sure. Why not?

610
00:52:39,927 --> 00:52:41,759
What do you want?

611
00:52:42,796 --> 00:52:43,855
I... um...

612
00:52:57,539 --> 00:53:00,532
Me? Sure I could.

613
00:53:20,834 --> 00:53:22,826
What is it?

614
00:54:23,617 --> 00:54:25,472
You have something to tell me?

615
00:54:25,833 --> 00:54:27,699
No.

616
00:54:33,679 --> 00:54:36,774
Turns out it's hard
to imagine telling her

617
00:54:36,910 --> 00:54:38,902
what we imagined doing to her.

618
00:54:38,946 --> 00:54:41,780
The house you see her living in
is too small.

619
00:54:41,849 --> 00:54:44,842
If you're gonna dream,
dream big.

620
00:54:59,867 --> 00:55:01,665
The four of us –

621
00:55:12,779 --> 00:55:16,807
<i>Let's begin
with the first case, ho, ho!</i>

622
00:55:17,731 --> 00:55:21,862
<i>Doing it with an only daughter, ho!</i>

623
00:55:23,690 --> 00:55:28,788
<i>Ask her parents'
permission first, ho, ho!</i>

624
00:55:48,190 --> 00:55:49,843
It was a lie, right?

625
00:55:51,885 --> 00:55:55,788
You lied when you said
you killed Mr. Otake, right?

626
00:55:56,643 --> 00:55:58,578
I'm glad I came back.

627
00:55:58,759 --> 00:56:02,753
- Of course.
- Would we be sitting here singing?

628
00:56:02,796 --> 00:56:06,756
- You came back to ask that?
- All the way from Fukaya.

629
00:56:12,334 --> 00:56:13,529
No more singing?

630
00:56:14,875 --> 00:56:16,776
May I sing one?

631
00:56:16,877 --> 00:56:18,778
You know a song?

632
00:56:19,518 --> 00:56:21,020
- May I?
- Sure.

633
00:56:21,308 --> 00:56:23,300
Sounds like fun.

634
00:56:23,448 --> 00:56:25,440
Okay by you, Nakamura?

635
00:56:27,888 --> 00:56:35,819
<i>One dark and drizzly night</i>

636
00:56:37,798 --> 00:56:45,831
<i>Peeping through my window</i>

637
00:56:47,469 --> 00:56:55,844
<i>Is a fool in a uniform
of the Southern Manchuria Railway</i>

638
00:56:57,751 --> 00:57:05,852
<i>Fifty</i> sen <i>for touching</i>
<i>Peeking is free</i>

639
00:57:07,894 --> 00:57:16,769
<i>If you give me three yen</i>
<i>and 50</i> sen

640
00:57:18,805 --> 00:57:27,874
<i>I'll be with you
until the rooster crows</i>

641
00:57:43,864 --> 00:57:45,833
What kind of song is that?

642
00:57:46,458 --> 00:57:47,653
A women's song.

643
00:57:48,296 --> 00:57:49,491
Where'd you learn it?

644
00:57:50,937 --> 00:57:58,640
<i>Are you coming in or going home?</i>

645
00:57:59,780 --> 00:58:06,653
<i>Please decide right now</i>

646
00:58:07,754 --> 00:58:14,684
<i>If you're staying,
take off your sandals and come on in</i>

647
00:58:15,762 --> 00:58:21,861
<i>Paper is expensive
these days, mister</i>

648
00:58:23,665 --> 00:58:30,595
<i>My boss is watching</i>

649
00:58:31,912 --> 00:58:39,718
<i>Tip me 50</i> sen

650
00:58:40,921 --> 00:58:48,658
<i>Then I'll hold you tight</i>

651
00:58:50,534 --> 00:58:57,566
<i>And give you extra time</i>

652
00:58:58,872 --> 00:59:06,644
<i>And stay with you
until the rooster crows</i>

653
00:59:09,275 --> 00:59:10,402
That's all.

654
00:59:17,791 --> 00:59:19,851
Maybe I did kill Mr. Otake.

655
00:59:20,861 --> 00:59:22,853
The gas hose was loose.

656
00:59:22,896 --> 00:59:25,695
I could've saved him,

657
00:59:25,766 --> 00:59:27,792
but I left him to die.

658
00:59:34,674 --> 00:59:35,869
Give me 10 yen.

659
00:59:41,780 --> 00:59:44,773
Will you tell that to Miss Tanigawa,

660
00:59:44,885 --> 00:59:47,821
Mr. Otake's friend?

661
00:59:49,572 --> 00:59:50,665
Will you?

662
01:00:29,509 --> 01:00:31,960
She wants you to hurry over there.

663
01:00:32,667 --> 01:00:34,568
You hear me?

664
01:00:34,891 --> 01:00:36,883
We're calling the university.

665
01:00:49,683 --> 01:00:53,677
Hey, I know who No. 469 is!

666
01:00:53,887 --> 01:00:55,879
We're gonna go see
Mayuko Fujiwara.

667
01:01:06,411 --> 01:01:12,322
Gentlemen, we're thinking
of publishing his writings.

668
01:01:12,539 --> 01:01:13,734
What do you think?

669
01:01:14,608 --> 01:01:18,545
We mustn't leave out
his study of mounted nomads.

670
01:01:19,481 --> 01:01:23,475
Then we must include the political
essays from his student days.

671
01:01:23,601 --> 01:01:26,503
No, there's no point.

672
01:01:26,604 --> 01:01:30,666
Maybe his diary
from that period?

673
01:01:31,925 --> 01:01:36,863
His political essays from back then
seem immature today.

674
01:01:36,930 --> 01:01:39,866
He'd hate for them to be published.

675
01:01:39,933 --> 01:01:43,870
His diaries really show
his state of mind

676
01:01:43,904 --> 01:01:46,703
and the circumstances of the time.

677
01:01:46,773 --> 01:01:49,766
- What about his letters?
- Absolutely.

678
01:01:49,809 --> 01:01:53,871
Miss Tanigawa, you have
a lot of his letters, don't you?

679
01:01:55,672 --> 01:01:56,799
Miss Tanigawa.

680
01:01:58,683 --> 01:02:00,618
Leave her alone.

681
01:02:01,678 --> 01:02:05,672
Give her some time.
We can talk to her later.

682
01:02:08,501 --> 01:02:10,663
Gentlemen,
let's sing some more.

683
01:02:11,898 --> 01:02:16,734
<i>Guard the way ahead</i>

684
01:02:16,937 --> 01:02:21,739
<i>Young friends</i>

685
01:02:21,908 --> 01:02:26,710
<i>Join the students in their songs</i>

686
01:02:26,846 --> 01:02:30,942
<i>Don't let the bright sun
and blue sky</i>

687
01:02:31,818 --> 01:02:35,914
<i>Be clouded by the fires of war</i>

688
01:02:36,471 --> 01:02:40,567
<i>Even an atomic bomb</i>

689
01:02:40,961 --> 01:02:45,661
<i>Can't cast a shadow
upon our friendship</i>

690
01:02:45,799 --> 01:02:49,861
<i>Our fighting spirit burns bright</i>

691
01:02:50,770 --> 01:02:54,901
<i>We must struggle for peace</i>

692
01:02:55,571 --> 01:02:59,565
<i>Strongly united</i>

693
01:02:59,980 --> 01:03:04,884
<i>Guard the way ahead</i>

694
01:03:05,698 --> 01:03:07,690
One more...

695
01:03:07,921 --> 01:03:10,686
to give his death meaning.

696
01:03:11,473 --> 01:03:16,571
<i>A battle fought</i>

697
01:03:16,760 --> 01:03:20,663
<i>In the name of justice</i>

698
01:03:20,934 --> 01:03:23,733
<i>O you valiant –</i>

699
01:03:23,803 --> 01:03:24,896
Enough!

700
01:03:24,938 --> 01:03:27,806
What the hell is his death
supposed to mean?

701
01:03:27,907 --> 01:03:29,739
What's wrong with you?

702
01:03:29,809 --> 01:03:31,903
He died
on National Foundation Day

703
01:03:31,945 --> 01:03:34,813
to protest the revival
of that reactionary holiday.

704
01:03:34,848 --> 01:03:37,818
- Bullshit!
- No death is meaningful!

705
01:03:38,485 --> 01:03:39,742
Some are!

706
01:03:39,819 --> 01:03:42,087
Its meaning depends on us.

707
01:03:42,255 --> 01:03:43,348
Cut the crap!

708
01:03:43,694 --> 01:03:46,562
Son of a bitch!
You're insulting the dead!

709
01:03:46,632 --> 01:03:49,625
- I am not!
- You are!

710
01:03:49,710 --> 01:03:51,804
Think about how
Miss Tanigawa feels.

711
01:03:53,700 --> 01:03:56,670
Remember the time and place
before you speak.

712
01:03:56,870 --> 01:04:01,899
<i>A cloud of atrocities
blocks out the light</i>

713
01:04:02,509 --> 01:04:07,470
<i>The enemy's storm rages</i>

714
01:04:07,623 --> 01:04:10,872
<i>Let's begin
with the first case, ho, ho!</i>

715
01:04:11,885 --> 01:04:16,823
<i>Doing it with an only daughter, ho!</i>

716
01:04:19,926 --> 01:04:22,896
Stop it! That's enough!

717
01:04:23,730 --> 01:04:24,925
Cut it out!

718
01:04:30,703 --> 01:04:33,901
Would you all please leave now?

719
01:04:35,594 --> 01:04:37,586
Is this where she lives?

720
01:04:37,715 --> 01:04:38,842
Yes, No. 469.

721
01:04:39,321 --> 01:04:41,290
Mayuko Fujiwara's house.

722
01:04:41,848 --> 01:04:43,783
Are we going to see her?

723
01:04:44,629 --> 01:04:47,622
It's a folk song rally
against the Vietnam War.

724
01:04:49,669 --> 01:04:52,662
- What do we do?
- We've come this far.

725
01:04:52,792 --> 01:04:54,784
We at least have to go in.

726
01:05:02,902 --> 01:05:05,770
Won't they charge admission?

727
01:05:05,805 --> 01:05:08,798
- We're here on business.
- Let's go back.

728
01:05:09,470 --> 01:05:11,405
Not before we talk to her.

729
01:05:11,508 --> 01:05:15,502
Then hurry up.
I'm worried about Nakamura.

730
01:05:25,792 --> 01:05:27,920
Ueda, you're the only one
who's seen her.

731
01:05:28,564 --> 01:05:31,659
I thought it was smaller.

732
01:05:31,831 --> 01:05:33,697
Let's go.

733
01:05:53,653 --> 01:05:54,780
Maybe we should sing too.

734
01:06:00,860 --> 01:06:04,661
<i>Let's begin
with the first case, ho, ho!</i>

735
01:06:04,764 --> 01:06:05,891
Hiroi!

736
01:06:07,667 --> 01:06:11,695
<i>Doing it with an only daughter, ho!</i>

737
01:06:14,674 --> 01:06:17,803
<i>Let's go on
to the second case, ho, ho!</i>

738
01:06:22,916 --> 01:06:26,683
<i>Let's go on
to the third case, ho!</i>

739
01:06:26,786 --> 01:06:30,780
<i>Doing it with an ugly girl, ho!</i>

740
01:06:38,932 --> 01:06:40,833
Shall we go?

741
01:06:43,636 --> 01:06:44,865
Here she comes.

742
01:07:05,658 --> 01:07:06,785
Ueda.

743
01:07:09,696 --> 01:07:10,857
Hiroi.

744
01:07:12,865 --> 01:07:14,766
Maruyama.

745
01:07:32,919 --> 01:07:35,684
Maybe I'm to blame.

746
01:07:37,745 --> 01:07:40,806
I'm saying
I may have killed Mr. Otake.

747
01:07:43,394 --> 01:07:46,497
He was asleep
when I entered the room.

748
01:07:48,835 --> 01:07:50,827
It was full of gas.

749
01:07:53,223 --> 01:07:56,216
I could have turned off the gas.

750
01:08:03,950 --> 01:08:06,647
I can't believe it.

751
01:08:07,887 --> 01:08:10,582
Don't if you don't want to.

752
01:08:10,790 --> 01:08:13,658
Then why'd you come here
to tell me that?

753
01:08:23,870 --> 01:08:26,669
Excuse me.
I forgot something.

754
01:08:34,881 --> 01:08:36,713
Mr. Otake.

755
01:08:51,394 --> 01:08:53,363
What did you do then?

756
01:09:01,354 --> 01:09:02,481
Mr. Otake!

757
01:09:15,855 --> 01:09:17,881
Why didn't you turn off the gas?

758
01:09:22,862 --> 01:09:24,888
You didn't want to save him,
did you?

759
01:09:29,769 --> 01:09:31,761
You wanted him to die.

760
01:09:36,363 --> 01:09:38,389
What on earth were you feeling?

761
01:09:39,296 --> 01:09:41,322
I didn't feel anything.

762
01:09:46,286 --> 01:09:47,413
Go on.

763
01:09:57,348 --> 01:09:59,756
<i>Let's begin
with the first case, ho, ho!</i>

764
01:09:59,999 --> 01:10:02,764
Stop it.
That's enough of that song.

765
01:10:02,802 --> 01:10:04,896
- I sang it just like that.
- Liar.

766
01:10:04,937 --> 01:10:06,929
Not at a time like that.

767
01:10:07,411 --> 01:10:10,609
<i>Doing it with an only daughter, ho!</i>

768
01:10:10,943 --> 01:10:12,844
You liar!

769
01:10:14,710 --> 01:10:16,838
Everything you're saying
is rubbish!

770
01:10:22,922 --> 01:10:24,823
What should I do?

771
01:10:25,078 --> 01:10:27,301
Will you repeat
the exams next year?

772
01:10:27,557 --> 01:10:30,677
Maybe I'll worm my way
into a crap university.

773
01:10:30,830 --> 01:10:33,800
Yeah, don't waste another year
studying for exams.

774
01:10:33,833 --> 01:10:36,769
Easy for you to say.
You think you passed.

775
01:10:36,969 --> 01:10:41,703
My folks won't send
any more money if I don't pass.

776
01:10:41,908 --> 01:10:44,901
I'll have to work my way
through cram school.

777
01:10:45,544 --> 01:10:47,479
That'd be rough.

778
01:10:48,432 --> 01:10:50,458
What happened to Nakamura?

779
01:10:50,602 --> 01:10:52,594
He said he thought he passed.

780
01:10:52,670 --> 01:10:54,571
No, I mean right now.

781
01:10:54,688 --> 01:10:56,748
I'm sure he's fine.

782
01:10:57,924 --> 01:11:00,590
But he's at Mr. Otake's apartment.

783
01:11:00,725 --> 01:11:03,718
- With that woman.
- With the dyed hair.

784
01:11:03,996 --> 01:11:06,932
- They're talking.
- About what?

785
01:11:13,906 --> 01:11:15,807
Are the trains still running?

786
01:11:16,812 --> 01:11:18,713
They've gotta be.

787
01:11:19,712 --> 01:11:22,944
<i>The path you travel is endless</i>

788
01:11:23,429 --> 01:11:24,843
This one's in Japanese.

789
01:11:25,551 --> 01:11:33,721
<i>So why clench your teeth
in such effort?</i>

790
01:11:34,827 --> 01:11:42,894
<i>Why go to such great lengths?</i>

791
01:11:43,903 --> 01:11:52,676
<i>The person you loved is gone</i>

792
01:11:56,816 --> 01:12:00,912
I'll go find Nakamura,
even if I have to go alone.

793
01:12:01,821 --> 01:12:03,813
He's probably gone by now.

794
01:12:03,890 --> 01:12:07,918
I'll bet he's pulling a Lawrence
right now with some sweet talk.

795
01:12:08,076 --> 01:12:10,068
He isn't pulling a Lawrence.

796
01:12:11,133 --> 01:12:12,690
It's something more important.

797
01:12:13,331 --> 01:12:14,560
You leaving?

798
01:12:15,749 --> 01:12:17,809
No, I'm going to sing.

799
01:12:17,937 --> 01:12:19,803
Why?

800
01:12:19,939 --> 01:12:21,840
For Nakamura.

801
01:12:33,753 --> 01:12:38,851
<i>On a dark and drizzly night</i>

802
01:12:41,606 --> 01:12:48,570
<i>Peeping through my window</i>

803
01:12:56,909 --> 01:12:58,969
Don't give up.

804
01:12:59,812 --> 01:13:02,873
<i>Now let's go on
to the second case, ho, ho!</i>

805
01:13:03,548 --> 01:13:07,451
<i>When doing it with two sisters, ho!</i>

806
01:13:07,639 --> 01:13:11,735
<i>Do the older one first, ho, ho!</i>

807
01:13:12,644 --> 01:13:15,739
<i>Let's go on
to the third case, ho, ho!</i>

808
01:13:16,520 --> 01:13:20,616
<i>Doing it with an ugly girl, ho!</i>

809
01:13:20,822 --> 01:13:25,726
<i>Cover her head with a bucket, ho, ho!</i>

810
01:13:25,905 --> 01:13:28,932
<i>Let's go on
to the fourth case, ho!</i>

811
01:13:29,618 --> 01:13:33,737
<i>When doing it upstairs, ho!</i>

812
01:13:34,714 --> 01:13:38,742
<i>Be quiet so you won't
be heard, ho, ho!</i>

813
01:13:38,951 --> 01:13:42,683
<i>Let's go on
to the fifth case, ho, ho!</i>

814
01:13:42,855 --> 01:13:46,849
<i>Doing it with the same old girl, ho!</i>

815
01:13:47,660 --> 01:13:51,791
<i>Do it the same old way, ho, ho!</i>

816
01:13:51,864 --> 01:13:54,959
<i>Let's go on
to the sixth case, ho, ho!</i>

817
01:13:55,801 --> 01:13:59,704
<i>Doing it with an old friend, ho!</i>

818
01:14:18,791 --> 01:14:20,987
<i>Let's go on
to the eighth case, ho, ho!</i>

819
01:14:21,794 --> 01:14:25,788
<i>Doing it with
a grocer's daughter, ho!</i>

820
01:14:25,898 --> 01:14:29,926
<i>Use a pumpkin for a pillow, ho, ho!</i>

821
01:14:30,600 --> 01:14:33,593
<i>Let's go on
to the ninth case, ho, ho!</i>

822
01:14:34,707 --> 01:14:38,838
<i>Doing it with the principal's
daughter, ho!</i>

823
01:14:38,911 --> 01:14:43,679
<i>Be ready to be expelled, ho, ho!</i>

824
01:14:43,849 --> 01:14:47,684
<i>Let's go on
to the tenth case, ho, ho!</i>

825
01:14:47,853 --> 01:14:51,881
<i>Doing it with a blueblood, ho!</i>

826
01:14:52,758 --> 01:14:56,889
<i>Do it in formal wear, ho, ho!</i>

827
01:15:32,698 --> 01:15:33,893
Is that all?

828
01:15:41,741 --> 01:15:44,836
<i>Let's go on
to the eleventh case, ho, ho!</i>

829
01:15:45,778 --> 01:15:49,840
<i>Doing it with Takako Tanigawa, ho!</i>

830
01:15:49,882 --> 01:15:51,748
Stop it!

831
01:16:04,864 --> 01:16:11,862
<i>Are you coming in or going home?</i>

832
01:16:12,905 --> 01:16:19,869
<i>Please decide right now</i>

833
01:16:20,880 --> 01:16:28,686
<i>If you're staying,
take off your sandals and come on in</i>

834
01:16:28,788 --> 01:16:34,887
<i>Paper is expensive
these days, mister</i>

835
01:16:35,928 --> 01:16:42,664
<i>My boss is watching</i>

836
01:16:43,669 --> 01:16:49,870
<i>Tip me 50</i> sen

837
01:16:50,876 --> 01:16:57,749
<i>Then I'll hold you tight</i>

838
01:16:58,851 --> 01:17:04,757
<i>And give you extra time</i>

839
01:17:05,858 --> 01:17:12,890
<i>And stay with you
until the rooster crows</i>

840
01:17:59,879 --> 01:18:01,745
<i>Thank you.</i>

841
01:18:05,624 --> 01:18:08,423
I'm Ueda from Maebashi High.

842
01:18:08,460 --> 01:18:09,553
I'm Maruyama.

843
01:18:09,628 --> 01:18:12,655
- I'm Hiroi.
- We're –

844
01:18:13,070 --> 01:18:15,164
You're a wonderful group.

845
01:18:15,267 --> 01:18:17,236
Please enjoy yourselves.

846
01:18:18,570 --> 01:18:20,664
Thanks for coming all this way.

847
01:18:21,379 --> 01:18:24,474
Was that a new folk song?
Who wrote it?

848
01:18:24,643 --> 01:18:26,635
Well, it's a –

849
01:18:27,367 --> 01:18:28,562
African?

850
01:18:28,681 --> 01:18:30,650
A Japanese folk song?

851
01:19:35,411 --> 01:19:37,403
"The steam pump...

852
01:19:38,650 --> 01:19:41,552
behind the steam pump
I let you have me.

853
01:19:41,587 --> 01:19:43,579
That's when it began."

854
01:19:43,655 --> 01:19:45,487
What's that?

855
01:19:45,557 --> 01:19:50,689
"The assistant foreman would give me
a special assignment if I let him."

856
01:19:51,697 --> 01:19:53,666
It's a women's song.

857
01:19:54,600 --> 01:19:58,560
You always knew this would happen,
didn't you? Well, I –

858
01:19:58,670 --> 01:20:01,572
- I didn't expect this.
- Not at all?

859
01:20:02,924 --> 01:20:06,793
<i>Who to do it with?</i>

860
01:20:07,911 --> 01:20:11,712
<i>Who will do it with me?</i>

861
01:20:12,550 --> 01:20:14,712
<i>What shall I do?</i>

862
01:20:14,952 --> 01:20:16,921
That's a song about
farm boys and girls, right?

863
01:20:18,956 --> 01:20:20,857
You know what it means?

864
01:20:20,924 --> 01:20:24,952
A man and woman can do it
out in the paddies.

865
01:20:26,756 --> 01:20:29,590
Even in a boardinghouse.
- You're wrong.

866
01:20:29,755 --> 01:20:33,783
It's not that easy
in a farming village or coal mine.

867
01:20:33,937 --> 01:20:36,031
I did it in front of my dead teacher.

868
01:20:38,401 --> 01:20:40,370
It's not usually that easy.

869
01:20:40,453 --> 01:20:44,390
People had to make up a special song
to get into the spirit.

870
01:20:44,882 --> 01:20:46,976
Just like you and I did.

871
01:20:47,293 --> 01:20:48,488
I'm different.

872
01:20:51,717 --> 01:20:55,779
Young female coal miners
used to wear white undergarments.

873
01:20:56,239 --> 01:20:59,209
They called them mine shirts
and mine skirts.

874
01:20:59,353 --> 01:21:02,517
The skirts only went
halfway down their thighs.

875
01:21:02,933 --> 01:21:05,869
You could see their white legs
down to their knees.

876
01:21:05,903 --> 01:21:07,929
The young girls
went dressed like that

877
01:21:08,024 --> 01:21:10,474
every day and night
down into the deepest pits.

878
01:21:11,273 --> 01:21:14,243
When the girls came up,
the boys went in.

879
01:21:14,360 --> 01:21:18,422
The boys would tease the girls
by touching their thighs.

880
01:21:19,473 --> 01:21:23,604
The girls would then slap their own thighs
and break out laughing.

881
01:21:24,955 --> 01:21:27,948
Once there was a boy
entering the pit for the first time.

882
01:21:28,864 --> 01:21:31,766
The girls made fun of him,
as they usually did.

883
01:21:31,862 --> 01:21:34,730
The boy was beet-red
going down into the pit.

884
01:21:34,965 --> 01:21:39,835
There was one young girl who took pity
and treated him kindly.

885
01:21:40,553 --> 01:21:45,685
Though they never spoke, at some point
they began to nod to each other.

886
01:21:46,616 --> 01:21:49,814
<i>Who to do it with?</i>

887
01:21:50,803 --> 01:21:53,602
They only saw each other
inside the mine.

888
01:21:53,917 --> 01:21:57,877
They snuck away and made love
in an old abandoned shaft.

889
01:21:58,889 --> 01:22:00,881
When winter turned to spring,

890
01:22:00,924 --> 01:22:03,723
she asked the boy
to meet her parents.

891
01:22:04,828 --> 01:22:06,922
She was asking him to marry her.

892
01:22:07,323 --> 01:22:10,350
<i>Who will do it with me?</i>

893
01:22:10,600 --> 01:22:13,593
They planned to meet
above ground for the first time

894
01:22:13,738 --> 01:22:16,537
so that he could meet
her parents.

895
01:22:16,940 --> 01:22:19,000
<i>What shall I do?</i>

896
01:22:19,447 --> 01:22:20,608
What do you think happened?

897
01:22:20,828 --> 01:22:23,559
<i>I don't really care</i>

898
01:22:25,916 --> 01:22:27,817
I don't know.

899
01:22:28,952 --> 01:22:32,855
The pit was dark,
and the work was strenuous.

900
01:22:33,367 --> 01:22:37,498
No matter how hard you worked,
disaster could strike at any moment.

901
01:22:38,242 --> 01:22:42,179
No matter how great your love,
you could be separated at any moment.

902
01:22:42,582 --> 01:22:45,552
You never knew
what the morning might bring.

903
01:22:47,476 --> 01:22:50,571
Even the man who told me
this story died a sudden death.

904
01:22:52,277 --> 01:22:53,301
Mr. Otake?

905
01:22:53,585 --> 01:22:55,611
One spring seven years ago.

906
01:22:57,881 --> 01:23:01,875
The next day,
the boy visited the girl's home.

907
01:23:02,235 --> 01:23:04,431
The young woman had died.
- That day?

908
01:23:05,536 --> 01:23:08,529
No. She'd died
before he'd ever met her.

909
01:23:13,818 --> 01:23:15,810
Her parents told the young man

910
01:23:15,933 --> 01:23:18,903
he'd seen her wandering soul.

911
01:23:19,766 --> 01:23:21,632
Her soul, huh?

912
01:23:21,838 --> 01:23:24,808
He was wedded to
the dead girl's mortuary tablet

913
01:23:25,344 --> 01:23:27,729
and lived with her parents
ever after.

914
01:23:28,925 --> 01:23:31,656
Was it all in his imagination?

915
01:23:31,802 --> 01:23:34,897
In any case, he married
her mortuary tablet.

916
01:23:37,330 --> 01:23:38,695
What did I imagine?

917
01:23:38,956 --> 01:23:43,408
You imagined Mr. Otake's death,
but you should be over that by now.

918
01:23:43,577 --> 01:23:44,704
I imagined something else.

919
01:23:45,279 --> 01:23:46,689
You killed another person?

920
01:23:46,897 --> 01:23:48,866
I raped a girl.

921
01:23:49,800 --> 01:23:52,770
Maruyama, Ueda, Hiroi, and I

922
01:23:53,435 --> 01:23:55,597
fantasized about raping a girl.

923
01:23:56,446 --> 01:23:57,641
Who was she?

924
01:23:58,875 --> 01:24:00,969
They've gone to tell her about it.

925
01:24:02,357 --> 01:24:04,383
And then what?

926
01:24:04,633 --> 01:24:06,625
I wonder that myself.

927
01:24:08,437 --> 01:24:12,431
They went to tell her
they fantasized about raping her?

928
01:24:13,924 --> 01:24:16,917
They're lascivious.
You know what that means?

929
01:24:18,895 --> 01:24:20,887
Who is she?
Where is she?

930
01:24:21,832 --> 01:24:24,927
She's probably prettier
than that female coal miner.

931
01:24:27,313 --> 01:24:28,440
Let's go.

932
01:24:29,706 --> 01:24:30,833
What for?

933
01:24:31,508 --> 01:24:32,703
Let's go and see.

934
01:24:33,379 --> 01:24:34,574
For their sake?

935
01:24:36,647 --> 01:24:38,548
For the girl's sake?

936
01:24:38,597 --> 01:24:40,532
For our sake.

937
01:24:40,917 --> 01:24:42,681
Our sake?

938
01:24:42,753 --> 01:24:46,690
Or more precisely,
for each of our sakes.

939
01:26:22,986 --> 01:26:24,818
That dress!

940
01:26:24,888 --> 01:26:26,823
Did they...

941
01:26:27,348 --> 01:26:29,249
Sons of bitches!

942
01:27:02,959 --> 01:27:04,791
What happened?

943
01:27:13,904 --> 01:27:15,770
Stop singing!

944
01:27:17,874 --> 01:27:18,898
Idiots!

945
01:27:19,676 --> 01:27:20,803
Bastard!

946
01:27:37,302 --> 01:27:38,429
Shall we go?

947
01:27:42,436 --> 01:27:43,631
Let's sit down.

948
01:27:55,384 --> 01:27:56,545
That's her, isn't it?

949
01:28:01,407 --> 01:28:04,468
I wonder if they told her
about that fantasy.

950
01:28:19,560 --> 01:28:21,495
You told her, didn't you?

951
01:28:22,973 --> 01:28:26,808
That's why
this happened to Kaneda.

952
01:28:27,262 --> 01:28:28,872
No, we couldn't do it.

953
01:28:30,321 --> 01:28:32,415
Sorry about what happened.
Let's be friends.

954
01:28:32,667 --> 01:28:34,636
Peaceful coexistence.

955
01:28:47,864 --> 01:28:49,730
Drink this.

956
01:28:53,770 --> 01:28:55,671
Nakamura.

957
01:29:03,446 --> 01:29:06,507
Are you hurting?
You must be.

958
01:29:07,472 --> 01:29:09,600
It's better to feel the pain,
Kaneda.

959
01:29:10,263 --> 01:29:13,392
I don't feel anything anymore.

960
01:29:14,524 --> 01:29:16,550
Even when Otake died,

961
01:29:16,809 --> 01:29:19,802
I wasn't sure
I was really sad.

962
01:29:22,634 --> 01:29:24,694
We'd been together seven years...

963
01:29:26,270 --> 01:29:28,364
but we never married.

964
01:29:29,573 --> 01:29:33,669
Of course
I dreamed about marrying him,

965
01:29:34,911 --> 01:29:37,881
but it was nothing more
than a dream.

966
01:29:39,196 --> 01:29:42,223
It wasn't because of differences
in thinking or lifestyle.

967
01:29:44,184 --> 01:29:48,383
We no longer had
the time or place to feel pain.

968
01:29:51,665 --> 01:29:53,691
If I'd married him,

969
01:29:53,930 --> 01:29:56,695
he wouldn't have died.

970
01:29:57,466 --> 01:29:59,662
If I'd been able to feel pain,

971
01:30:00,003 --> 01:30:01,938
he'd still be alive.

972
01:30:03,511 --> 01:30:05,503
I killed him.

973
01:30:07,944 --> 01:30:09,913
I killed him.

974
01:30:13,016 --> 01:30:16,851
Kaneda, don't forget
the pain you feel today.

975
01:30:17,587 --> 01:30:19,579
Remember it all your life.

976
01:30:34,525 --> 01:30:36,517
I wonder if she understood.

977
01:30:42,712 --> 01:30:47,776
<i>One dark and drizzly night</i>

978
01:30:47,884 --> 01:30:52,913
<i>Peeping through my window</i>

979
01:30:53,445 --> 01:30:58,440
<i>Is a fool in a uniform
of the Southern Manchuria Railway</i>

980
01:30:58,895 --> 01:31:03,890
<i>Fifty</i> sen <i>for touching</i>
<i>Peeking is free</i>

981
01:31:05,766 --> 01:31:08,634
- That dress?
- It's hers.

982
01:31:32,568 --> 01:31:36,664
In 1949, I was born.

983
01:31:38,968 --> 01:31:42,700
In June of 1960,

984
01:31:42,906 --> 01:31:45,671
I was born once again.

985
01:31:46,550 --> 01:31:48,485
Women and blood.

986
01:31:49,879 --> 01:31:52,678
Now, in 1967...

987
01:31:53,206 --> 01:31:56,199
we're still in the hands of the gods.

988
01:31:57,921 --> 01:32:00,720
The god of January 1st

989
01:32:00,790 --> 01:32:04,727
gives life to a girl
who has no reason to live.

990
01:32:05,829 --> 01:32:07,730
January 15.

991
01:32:08,390 --> 01:32:11,292
The girl has a piece
of white paper in her hand,

992
01:32:12,233 --> 01:32:14,464
but in a minute
it's snatched away.

993
01:32:16,205 --> 01:32:18,299
The god of freezing February

994
01:32:19,068 --> 01:32:20,467
teaches a girl how to love

995
01:32:21,638 --> 01:32:23,732
and a boy how to die.

996
01:32:26,015 --> 01:32:29,816
<i>A black sun</i>

997
01:32:30,177 --> 01:32:33,170
<i>Is rising</i>

998
01:32:34,427 --> 01:32:37,488
<i>1967</i>

999
01:32:37,671 --> 01:32:40,573
<i>Spring in Japan</i>

1000
01:32:41,798 --> 01:32:43,699
We raped you.

1001
01:32:43,867 --> 01:32:48,805
The four of us fantasized
about raping you.

1002
01:32:53,277 --> 01:32:56,486
<i>On that day</i>

1003
01:32:56,667 --> 01:32:59,660
<i>The peach blossoms
withered and died</i>

1004
01:33:00,517 --> 01:33:06,582
<i>And the nightingale's
throat was torn</i>

1005
01:33:10,568 --> 01:33:12,662
We raped you in that classroom.

1006
01:33:12,789 --> 01:33:15,554
<i>Don't stop loving</i>

1007
01:33:15,593 --> 01:33:17,585
We raped you
in the examination hall.

1008
01:33:18,543 --> 01:33:22,537
<i>Don't let go of what you've found</i>

1009
01:33:23,940 --> 01:33:25,909
We stripped you naked.

1010
01:33:27,850 --> 01:33:30,843
Believe us!
We raped you!

1011
01:33:31,915 --> 01:33:35,852
<i>In freezing February
we learned how to love and die</i>

1012
01:33:35,919 --> 01:33:37,854
Don't you believe us?

1013
01:33:37,954 --> 01:33:39,855
Stop it!

1014
01:33:43,860 --> 01:33:48,798
<i>The festival of the black sun
is upon us</i>

1015
01:33:49,553 --> 01:33:52,682
<i>1967</i>

1016
01:33:52,747 --> 01:33:55,546
<i>Spring in Japan</i>

1017
01:33:55,905 --> 01:33:58,898
<i>Plunder the festival</i>

1018
01:33:59,249 --> 01:34:02,276
<i>Shoot at the sun</i>

1019
01:34:03,610 --> 01:34:09,709
<i>With tender love
and cold, hard death</i>

1020
01:34:23,900 --> 01:34:27,837
Let's go to that imaginary
classroom of yours.

1021
01:35:46,635 --> 01:35:50,629
Please begin.
Exactly as you imagined it.

1022
01:36:14,741 --> 01:36:18,417
2,627 years ago,
on February 11,

1023
01:36:18,555 --> 01:36:21,548
Emperor Jimmu was crowned
first emperor of Japan

1024
01:36:21,636 --> 01:36:24,629
at Kashiwara Shrine in Yamato.

1025
01:36:24,712 --> 01:36:28,740
He was dubbed
"founding emperor of the land."

1026
01:36:29,727 --> 01:36:31,719
But there was another emperor

1027
01:36:31,830 --> 01:36:34,766
who was given that title:

1028
01:36:35,020 --> 01:36:38,013
Emperor Sujin,
the tenth emperor.

1029
01:36:38,901 --> 01:36:42,838
The <i>Kojiki</i> says Emperor Sujin
had yet another name:

1030
01:36:42,872 --> 01:36:46,386
"the founding emperor
from Mimaki."

1031
01:36:46,525 --> 01:36:48,790
Mimaki means "Mima Castle" –

1032
01:36:49,280 --> 01:36:52,512
the imperial palace in Mima.

1033
01:36:53,584 --> 01:36:56,520
<i>Let's begin
with the first case, ho, ho!</i>

1034
01:36:56,886 --> 01:37:01,429
<i>Doing it with an only daughter, ho!</i>

1035
01:37:01,595 --> 01:37:03,564
Where was Mima?

1036
01:37:03,701 --> 01:37:08,469
Mima, or "Imna" in Korean,
is in modern-day South Korea.

1037
01:37:19,770 --> 01:37:22,672
"Princess Kushinada,
pregnant with child,

1038
01:37:22,731 --> 01:37:25,565
sought a suitable place

1039
01:37:25,677 --> 01:37:27,703
in which to give birth.

1040
01:37:27,780 --> 01:37:29,806
She came to Japan
and proclaimed,

1041
01:37:30,217 --> 01:37:34,211
'What a deep valley!
I shall call it Bear Valley.'"

1042
01:37:34,991 --> 01:37:38,928
The father of
Princess Kushinada's child

1043
01:37:39,147 --> 01:37:41,082
was Prince Susanoo.

1044
01:37:41,360 --> 01:37:44,421
When he went to slay
the eight-headed serpent Orochi,

1045
01:37:44,566 --> 01:37:48,435
he turned Kushinada into a comb,

1046
01:37:48,520 --> 01:37:50,614
placed her in his hair,
and set off.

1047
01:37:51,510 --> 01:37:54,309
According to the <i>Nihon Shoki,</i>
Susanoo once traveled

1048
01:37:54,451 --> 01:37:56,511
to the kingdom of Silla.

1049
01:37:56,801 --> 01:38:01,569
It's said he traveled from there
to the Hi River in Izumo.

1050
01:38:01,684 --> 01:38:03,846
Silla... or present-day South Korea.

1051
01:38:04,706 --> 01:38:07,642
From the third
to the fifth centuries,

1052
01:38:07,761 --> 01:38:11,698
mounted nomads from Manchuria,
Mongolia, and North China

1053
01:38:11,774 --> 01:38:15,711
poured into the Korean peninsula
with horses and new weapons,

1054
01:38:15,778 --> 01:38:20,614
and then into Japan, landing in
northern Kyushu or western Honshu.

1055
01:38:21,299 --> 01:38:24,971
The Izumo clan,
centered around Izumo Shrine,

1056
01:38:25,249 --> 01:38:28,678
had created a culture
of wealth and leisure.

1057
01:38:31,724 --> 01:38:35,066
The Izumo Shrine
rose high into the sky,

1058
01:38:35,257 --> 01:38:39,695
nearly twice as tall as the Marunouchi
Building in modern Tokyo.

1059
01:38:39,789 --> 01:38:41,781
Yet the mounted nomads

1060
01:38:41,824 --> 01:38:45,761
chased off the members
of the Izumo clan

1061
01:38:45,828 --> 01:38:50,926
and sent the shrine
crashing into the Sea of Japan.

1062
01:38:59,512 --> 01:39:03,449
The Japanese come from Korea!

1063
01:39:04,324 --> 01:39:07,488
During the Taika Reforms,
Prince Naka no Oe drew his sword

1064
01:39:07,950 --> 01:39:10,886
and murdered Soga no Iruka
in the imperial palace.

1065
01:39:11,255 --> 01:39:14,560
After witnessing this carnage,
Prince Furuhito staggered

1066
01:39:14,611 --> 01:39:17,581
back to his chambers
and said to his aide,

1067
01:39:18,399 --> 01:39:22,598
"The man from Han has killed
the saddler. I'm filled with grief."

1068
01:39:25,898 --> 01:39:28,732
"The saddler"
referred to Soga no Iruka.

1069
01:39:29,467 --> 01:39:31,865
"Han" was the name
they used for Korea.

1070
01:39:31,908 --> 01:39:34,673
"The Korean
has killed Soga no Iruka."

1071
01:39:34,710 --> 01:39:37,703
Why would he be
filled with grief?

1072
01:39:38,452 --> 01:39:40,716
The Taika Reforms
were really a revolution

1073
01:39:40,783 --> 01:39:43,685
in which the Yamato Court,
descended from Koreans,

1074
01:39:43,719 --> 01:39:48,714
wiped out the Izumo clan's power,
laying the foundation

1075
01:39:48,791 --> 01:39:51,818
for the perpetual rule
of the mounted nomads in Japan.

1076
01:39:52,252 --> 01:39:55,381
<i>Let's go on
to the tenth case, ho, ho!</i>

1077
01:39:55,802 --> 01:39:59,796
<i>Doing it with a blueblood, ho!</i>

1078
01:40:00,112 --> 01:40:04,140
<i>Do it in formal wear, ho, ho!</i>

1079
01:40:04,529 --> 01:40:06,464
Take me instead of her.

1080
01:40:17,616 --> 01:40:19,414
Wait.

1081
01:40:19,439 --> 01:40:22,637
I'm the one they imagined raping.
Don't pretend otherwise.

1082
01:40:24,258 --> 01:40:26,250
Show me if you can really do it.

1083
01:40:37,561 --> 01:40:39,553
Go ahead.

1084
01:40:41,911 --> 01:40:43,709
Fucking bitch!

1085
01:41:15,945 --> 01:41:17,811
Is that it?

1086
01:42:35,825 --> 01:42:37,760
It's real this time...

1087
01:42:38,961 --> 01:42:40,930
right?

1088
01:43:22,705 --> 01:43:24,901
THE END

1089
01:43:26,742 --> 01:43:30,702
