1
00:00:44,962 --> 00:00:49,634
I'm Mohammad Ali Keshavarz,
the actor who plays the director.

2
00:00:49,967 --> 00:00:52,553
The other actors are all locals.

3
00:00:53,221 --> 00:00:56,557
We're in Koker, about 250 miles -

4
00:00:56,682 --> 00:00:59,644
no, 220 miles north of Tehran,

5
00:00:59,769 --> 00:01:03,064
where an earthquake
destroyed everything last year.

6
00:01:03,231 --> 00:01:06,776
Sir, the girls are hungry
and have a long way to go.

7
00:01:06,901 --> 00:01:08,778
Could we speed it up?

8
00:01:08,986 --> 00:01:11,739
We've come to this rebuilt school

9
00:01:11,989 --> 00:01:14,242
to choose a young actress.

10
00:01:19,497 --> 00:01:22,625
Sorry it's taking so long.

11
00:01:34,387 --> 00:01:36,764
What's your name?
- Mehri Ziai.

12
00:01:38,391 --> 00:01:40,768
- And yours?
- Sima Ali Mohammadi.

13
00:01:40,935 --> 00:01:43,104
- What?
- Sima Ali Mohammadi.

14
00:01:44,105 --> 00:01:46,440
- And yours?
- Leyla Naghipour.

15
00:01:48,609 --> 00:01:51,404
- Your name?
- Tahereh Ladanian.

16
00:01:51,612 --> 00:01:54,282
Mrs. Shiva,
take down this girl's address.

17
00:01:54,448 --> 00:01:57,618
Your address?
- Near the Lakeh bazaar.

18
00:01:57,743 --> 00:02:00,621
- Your name?
- Tahereh Ladanian.

19
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:03,749
- Your address?
- Near the Lakeh bazaar.

20
00:02:03,874 --> 00:02:06,961
- What's your name?
- Fariba Jafari.

21
00:02:08,087 --> 00:02:10,423
- What year?
- Third year, literature.

22
00:02:10,548 --> 00:02:13,009
Mrs. Shiva, get her name too.

23
00:02:13,217 --> 00:02:14,969
Tell me your name...

24
00:02:15,177 --> 00:02:17,346
- And you?
- Nazila Khadem.

25
00:02:17,471 --> 00:02:19,140
Mrs. Shiva, get her name.

26
00:02:19,348 --> 00:02:20,808
Your address?

27
00:02:20,975 --> 00:02:22,893
I don't have an exact address.

28
00:02:23,019 --> 00:02:25,062
But where do you live?

29
00:02:25,187 --> 00:02:27,481
Rostamabad, in Jalaliyeh.

30
00:02:30,401 --> 00:02:32,153
What's your name?

31
00:02:32,278 --> 00:02:33,988
Zeynab Hassanpour.

32
00:02:36,991 --> 00:02:39,076
Stay in your lines.

33
00:02:39,201 --> 00:02:41,495
Sir, will you show this film?

34
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:45,082
What's it matter to us if you film us...

35
00:02:45,333 --> 00:02:47,501
but don't show it anywhere?

36
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:49,670
- You mean on TV?
- Yes.

37
00:02:49,837 --> 00:02:50,963
You're right.

38
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:53,674
But is that any reason not to film?

39
00:02:53,841 --> 00:02:55,843
At least show it to us.

40
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:58,179
Your last film was on Channel 2.

41
00:02:58,346 --> 00:03:01,015
We don't get that here.
Why bother?

42
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:03,851
What do you girls say?
Should we film or not?

43
00:03:03,976 --> 00:03:05,770
Film!

44
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:07,897
But you have to show it!

45
00:03:08,522 --> 00:03:10,441
You have to show it!

46
00:03:10,649 --> 00:03:12,860
- What's your name?
- Tahereh.

47
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:14,862
- Tahereh what?
- Poursadeghi.

48
00:03:15,905 --> 00:03:19,116
Mrs. Shiva, get her name too.

49
00:03:27,083 --> 00:03:29,668
- What's your name?
- Zahra Jenab.

50
00:03:29,877 --> 00:03:31,670
- From where?
- Rostamabad.

51
00:03:31,796 --> 00:03:34,256
- How old are you?
- Fifteen.

52
00:03:35,341 --> 00:03:37,885
Mrs. Shiva, get her name.

53
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:39,887
- Your name?
- Zahra Jenab.

54
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,230
- Address?
- Rostamabad, in Koker.

ABBAS KIAROSTAMI

68
00:04:54,128 --> 00:04:56,547
<i>This is your historical calendar.</i>

69
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:08,559
<i>Today is Sunday...</i>

70
00:05:08,684 --> 00:05:13,230
<i>ninth day of the month of Khorad,
year 1372 in the solar Hegira...</i>

71
00:05:30,289 --> 00:05:33,250
- Hello.
- Good morning.

72
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:35,961
- How are you?
- Fine, thanks.

73
00:05:36,086 --> 00:05:37,796
Why were you walking?

74
00:05:37,922 --> 00:05:40,716
I thought I might miss the bus,

75
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:43,802
so I set out to catch it.

76
00:05:44,053 --> 00:05:47,431
We worked late last night,
and I overslept.

77
00:05:47,723 --> 00:05:49,808
Here's that stuff you wanted.

78
00:05:49,934 --> 00:05:51,352
This is chalk?

79
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:55,189
Yes, just not the kind you wanted.

80
00:05:55,523 --> 00:05:58,025
The students made this.

81
00:05:58,317 --> 00:06:00,861
They didn't sift it very well.

82
00:06:01,028 --> 00:06:04,031
There may be small stones in it.

83
00:06:04,573 --> 00:06:07,952
If it doesn't write well...

84
00:06:08,577 --> 00:06:12,915
break it in two
and it will work better.

85
00:06:13,374 --> 00:06:18,045
You might find better chalk
at the school when you get there.

86
00:06:18,212 --> 00:06:20,214
We're not going to the school.

87
00:06:20,923 --> 00:06:22,925
Then why do you need chalk?

88
00:06:23,884 --> 00:06:25,594
For the clapboard.

89
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:27,596
What's that?

90
00:06:28,055 --> 00:06:30,057
It's used to identify shots.

91
00:06:30,224 --> 00:06:33,602
We write on it,
like on a blackboard.

92
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:37,523
- I see. A board for -
- For filming.

93
00:06:37,648 --> 00:06:41,110
<i>Like</i> I <i>saw on the set of
Where Is the Friend's House?</i>

94
00:06:41,235 --> 00:06:44,363
That's right.
You were very good in that film.

95
00:06:44,488 --> 00:06:48,450
You're very kind.
I played the teacher.

96
00:06:48,576 --> 00:06:51,745
I remember.
You were perfect in the part.

97
00:06:51,996 --> 00:06:54,290
Well, it's my profession.

98
00:06:54,415 --> 00:06:56,709
I play that part every day.

99
00:06:57,418 --> 00:07:00,421
In fact, I have a little favor to ask -

100
00:07:00,588 --> 00:07:04,091
Excuse me, but could you
catch up with the bus?

101
00:07:04,341 --> 00:07:07,511
The school system sends a bus
for its teachers?

102
00:07:07,636 --> 00:07:10,723
No, the bus belongs
to the shoe factory.

103
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:14,310
It drops us off at the factory,

104
00:07:14,435 --> 00:07:18,647
and we walk
the last half mile to Saramarz.

105
00:07:23,569 --> 00:07:26,030
About that favor...

106
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:32,369
I don't really like film and art
and that kind of stuff.

107
00:07:33,537 --> 00:07:35,456
But with the earthquake...

108
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:37,916
I'm in a tough spot.

109
00:07:38,292 --> 00:07:41,879
If you could possibly get me

110
00:07:42,004 --> 00:07:44,965
a small part in your film -

111
00:07:45,132 --> 00:07:47,509
- Of course.
- Thank you very much.

112
00:07:47,635 --> 00:07:49,678
Take this little shortcut.

113
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:51,972
- This way?
- Yes.

114
00:08:00,105 --> 00:08:02,650
- You won't forget?
- Don't worry.

115
00:08:02,816 --> 00:08:05,110
Good-bye.

116
00:08:50,197 --> 00:08:52,866
Tahereh?

117
00:08:55,369 --> 00:08:57,329
Miss Tahereh?

118
00:08:58,247 --> 00:09:00,874
Grandmother?
- Yes?

119
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:03,043
Good morning, ma'am.

120
00:09:03,168 --> 00:09:05,295
How are you?
- Fine, thank God.

121
00:09:05,421 --> 00:09:08,632
- Where has Tahereh gone?
- I don't know.

122
00:09:09,341 --> 00:09:11,510
We were to meet at 7:30.

123
00:09:11,635 --> 00:09:14,430
She had to meet someone, all right.

124
00:09:14,555 --> 00:09:18,517
She left at dawn to go borrow
a dress from a friend.

125
00:09:18,976 --> 00:09:21,895
I don't know where she is now.

126
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:24,773
- So what do I do?
- Make yourself comfortable.

127
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:28,444
- Thank you.
- Come up here.

128
00:09:28,736 --> 00:09:30,654
Come sit down.

129
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:34,783
Come sit with me.

130
00:09:34,908 --> 00:09:36,994
<i>I'll</i> just wait for her here.

131
00:09:37,119 --> 00:09:38,829
She told me...

132
00:09:38,954 --> 00:09:41,874
she was going to borrow a dress.

133
00:09:42,166 --> 00:09:44,501
I'm really not sure.

134
00:09:44,752 --> 00:09:47,087
I never know what she's up to.

135
00:09:47,337 --> 00:09:49,590
You never know
what she's thinking.

136
00:09:49,715 --> 00:09:53,552
Is she coming back here
or going on to school?

137
00:09:53,677 --> 00:09:56,138
Should I wait?
- I don't know.

138
00:09:56,263 --> 00:10:00,100
At that age, you're always flitting about.
You never keep your word.

139
00:10:00,726 --> 00:10:03,604
It was a mistake
to try to pin her down.

140
00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:08,150
I sent her to the well earlier,

141
00:10:08,275 --> 00:10:10,778
but she left the water downstairs.

142
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:13,906
With my bad legs,
I can't get down there.

143
00:10:14,031 --> 00:10:17,284
By the time I get down there,
my food's burned.

144
00:10:17,409 --> 00:10:19,119
She doesn't listen.

145
00:10:20,579 --> 00:10:22,915
She's so headstrong.

146
00:10:31,006 --> 00:10:33,383
She left her book here.

147
00:10:36,053 --> 00:10:38,222
Good of you to bring that up.

148
00:10:38,347 --> 00:10:41,350
- Shall I pour you some?
- Yes, please.

149
00:10:41,475 --> 00:10:43,018
Very kind of you.

150
00:10:45,813 --> 00:10:47,856
Now you show up?

151
00:10:48,065 --> 00:10:50,025
It's about time!

152
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:51,902
I went to my friend's house.

153
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:54,822
I thought
you might be ready early.

154
00:10:55,614 --> 00:10:57,741
I went to borrow a dress.

155
00:10:57,866 --> 00:11:00,327
- And did you get one?
- Yes.

156
00:11:00,494 --> 00:11:01,870
Let me see.

157
00:11:08,252 --> 00:11:11,505
That's no peasant dress.
You have to wear a peasant dress!

158
00:11:15,259 --> 00:11:19,012
My friend said it looked good on me.
It just needs taking in.

159
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,182
I tell her to wear a peasant dress,

160
00:11:22,307 --> 00:11:24,768
and she says she'll take it in!

161
00:11:25,143 --> 00:11:28,856
You have to wear a peasant dress!
- Just let me try it on.

162
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:32,109
No matter what I say,
you do as you please.

163
00:11:32,234 --> 00:11:36,363
You have to wear a peasant dress.
I won't say it again.

164
00:11:38,156 --> 00:11:41,535
- It just needs taking in.
- I said no!

165
00:11:42,369 --> 00:11:44,371
<i>I'll</i> just try it on.

166
00:11:44,538 --> 00:11:46,039
It may be fine.

167
00:11:49,543 --> 00:11:52,087
It's hopeless.
She does as she pleases.

168
00:11:52,212 --> 00:11:56,216
You have to wear a peasant dress.
You understand?

169
00:11:57,509 --> 00:12:00,137
No one wears peasant dresses
these days.

170
00:12:00,262 --> 00:12:03,682
- Shall I pour you some water?
- Yes, please.

171
00:12:03,807 --> 00:12:05,893
Thank you very much.

172
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:08,478
What did you say?

173
00:12:08,937 --> 00:12:11,565
No one wears dresses
like that anymore.

174
00:12:11,732 --> 00:12:15,319
Your grandmother's wearing
a very pretty one.

175
00:12:16,236 --> 00:12:18,155
Old people wear them.

176
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:21,825
I've seen young people wear them,
and they looked very nice.

177
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:25,162
But they were peasants,
illiterate peasants!

178
00:12:25,287 --> 00:12:28,498
Students don't wear them.
You saw that.

179
00:12:28,624 --> 00:12:32,252
Not at school, of course.
Those are school rules.

180
00:12:32,419 --> 00:12:34,796
But you have to wear one for us.

181
00:12:34,922 --> 00:12:39,176
How on earth did you bring her up?
She won't stop arguing.

182
00:12:39,301 --> 00:12:41,345
I didn't bring her up.

183
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:44,431
Her mother did, God rest her soul.

184
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,141
What is it?

185
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:50,479
That's a lovely dress,
and it's very nice on you,

186
00:12:50,729 --> 00:12:52,898
but it's not what we need.

187
00:12:53,023 --> 00:12:54,691
It's all I have.

188
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:57,945
Leave it to me.
<i>I'll</i> figure something out.

189
00:12:58,445 --> 00:13:00,614
But I won't wear -

190
00:13:00,739 --> 00:13:02,616
She's making excuses.

191
00:13:02,783 --> 00:13:05,619
She can take her mother's dress
from the chest.

192
00:13:05,744 --> 00:13:08,830
May I borrow a flowerpot?
<i>I'll</i> bring it back.

193
00:13:08,956 --> 00:13:11,291
- Take that one.
- I prefer this one.

194
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:13,543
That stem's too long.

195
00:13:14,127 --> 00:13:17,673
- Thank you. Good-bye.
- God be with you.

196
00:13:32,354 --> 00:13:34,439
<i>I'll</i> come for you at 1:00.

197
00:13:34,815 --> 00:13:36,608
You hear? At 1:00.

198
00:13:52,457 --> 00:13:54,251
<i>Mrs. Shiva!</i>

199
00:14:09,224 --> 00:14:10,517
Hello.

200
00:14:10,642 --> 00:14:13,061
How are you?
You only have one pot?

201
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:16,606
Yes, but Babak's bringing
two more.

202
00:14:16,732 --> 00:14:19,609
- I see. What's your name?
- Ahmad.

203
00:14:20,736 --> 00:14:22,863
- Ahmad what?
- Ahmadpour.

204
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:26,366
Ahmad Ahmadpour.
Put that in the back.

205
00:14:26,491 --> 00:14:28,785
Careful you don't break the stern.

206
00:14:28,994 --> 00:14:31,747
Watch the stern!
- All right.

207
00:14:31,872 --> 00:14:33,832
And the flower too!

208
00:14:33,957 --> 00:14:35,292
Hello.

209
00:14:35,667 --> 00:14:37,711
They're so dry!

210
00:14:37,836 --> 00:14:40,130
This is all they had.

211
00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:43,925
Put them in back with the others.

212
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:47,471
Thanks, boys.
Where are you going?

213
00:14:47,596 --> 00:14:49,139
To school.

214
00:14:49,848 --> 00:14:51,516
We have exams.

215
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:56,063
<i>I'll</i> give you a ride.

216
00:14:56,188 --> 00:14:59,524
Thanks, but it's just over there,
in the tents.

217
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,651
Very well.

218
00:15:01,777 --> 00:15:03,570
Thanks, and good-bye.

219
00:15:12,746 --> 00:15:16,291
Would you like to come
to the set after your exams?

220
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:18,335
You know where it is?
- Koker.

221
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:21,713
That's right.
Come by if you'd like.

222
00:15:21,838 --> 00:15:23,381
Good-bye.

223
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:47,614
Scene 4, shot 1, take 1.

224
00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:50,617
Action!

225
00:15:50,742 --> 00:15:53,120
Fine. You can stay there.

226
00:15:53,787 --> 00:15:55,122
Hello.

227
00:15:55,247 --> 00:15:56,790
Hello.

228
00:16:01,378 --> 00:16:03,296
Hello.

229
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:06,049
God be with you.

230
00:16:07,509 --> 00:16:08,677
Cut!

231
00:16:08,802 --> 00:16:11,096
Why don't you answer?

232
00:16:11,221 --> 00:16:14,641
After she says that, you say,
“May you be well.”

233
00:16:14,808 --> 00:16:17,853
Then you ask her for water,
and that's all.

234
00:16:18,812 --> 00:16:21,314
Come back down with the plaster.

235
00:16:25,777 --> 00:16:27,195
You understand?

236
00:16:28,989 --> 00:16:30,365
Let's go.

237
00:16:30,657 --> 00:16:31,825
Ready?

238
00:16:32,367 --> 00:16:33,702
Take 2.

239
00:16:34,161 --> 00:16:36,496
Fine. You can stay there.

240
00:16:37,247 --> 00:16:39,583
Hello.

241
00:16:45,547 --> 00:16:46,756
Hello.

242
00:16:49,009 --> 00:16:50,510
God be with you.

243
00:16:53,096 --> 00:16:54,264
Cut!

244
00:16:54,389 --> 00:16:56,766
Speak, my friend!

245
00:16:57,392 --> 00:17:00,854
When she greets you,
say your lines!

246
00:17:01,771 --> 00:17:03,899
Come back down with the plaster.

247
00:17:09,905 --> 00:17:10,989
Farhad...

248
00:17:11,114 --> 00:17:14,242
when he says hello,
look at him for a second.

249
00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:16,119
Then answer him.

250
00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:19,623
Let's go.

251
00:17:19,748 --> 00:17:21,791
- Sound?
- Rolling.

252
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:23,460
Camera?

253
00:17:24,461 --> 00:17:25,879
Take 3.

254
00:17:26,421 --> 00:17:28,715
Fine. You can stay there.

255
00:17:29,174 --> 00:17:31,259
Hello.

256
00:17:37,349 --> 00:17:39,351
Hello.

257
00:17:39,851 --> 00:17:41,478
God be with you.

258
00:17:43,647 --> 00:17:46,191
Why don't you say something?

259
00:17:46,608 --> 00:17:48,193
Did you forget your line?

260
00:17:48,318 --> 00:17:50,278
Come back down with the sack.

261
00:17:51,446 --> 00:17:53,073
Come back down.

262
00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:00,956
Sir, I can't do it.

263
00:18:01,248 --> 00:18:02,582
What?

264
00:18:02,749 --> 00:18:04,167
I can't do it.

265
00:18:04,292 --> 00:18:06,169
What do you mean?

266
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:09,923
- Could you come here a minute?
- What?

267
00:18:10,048 --> 00:18:12,092
Could you come here a minute?

268
00:18:23,395 --> 00:18:24,896
What's wrong?

269
00:18:25,605 --> 00:18:27,315
I stammer.

270
00:18:27,941 --> 00:18:29,442
What?

271
00:18:29,776 --> 00:18:32,320
You were speaking just fine earlier.

272
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,781
But...

273
00:18:35,699 --> 00:18:38,618
when I speak to a girl...

274
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,746
I start stammering.

275
00:18:42,872 --> 00:18:44,291
I see.

276
00:18:44,874 --> 00:18:46,334
You can go.

277
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:48,670
I'm sorry.

278
00:18:49,421 --> 00:18:51,256
We'll drive you back.

279
00:18:51,381 --> 00:18:52,841
- Mrs. Shiva.
- Yes?

280
00:18:52,966 --> 00:18:55,302
Take him back
and bring Hossein here.

281
00:18:55,468 --> 00:18:57,137
Hossein who?

282
00:18:57,304 --> 00:18:59,514
- Hossein at the camp.
- All right.

283
00:18:59,931 --> 00:19:02,642
Get in the truck.
<i>I'll</i> take you back.

284
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:21,870
Mrs. Shiva.

285
00:19:21,995 --> 00:19:24,998
Rehearse with Hossein in the car.
And hurry.

286
00:19:25,165 --> 00:19:27,167
We're short on time.

287
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:57,280
Mr. Jafarian,
should I cover this or leave it?

288
00:20:01,618 --> 00:20:03,578
Shall we pack up the camera?

289
00:20:03,703 --> 00:20:06,039
No, they're coming back.

290
00:20:12,379 --> 00:20:16,716
Boys, you can't come over
to this side of the rope,

291
00:20:16,841 --> 00:20:19,302
but may I come over to yours?

292
00:20:19,427 --> 00:20:22,389
<i>'</i> No!
<i>'</i> Yes!

293
00:20:22,555 --> 00:20:25,225
- Yes or no?
- Yes!

294
00:20:31,481 --> 00:20:32,982
Tell me...

295
00:20:33,817 --> 00:20:35,777
don't you have exams?

296
00:20:35,902 --> 00:20:38,238
- No.
- Yes, we do.

297
00:20:38,363 --> 00:20:40,615
Then what are you doing here?

298
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:42,784
We came to watch the shoot.

299
00:20:42,909 --> 00:20:45,703
- You came all this way?
- Yes.

300
00:20:45,829 --> 00:20:47,872
How many miles?

301
00:20:47,997 --> 00:20:50,041
Six!

302
00:20:51,334 --> 00:20:53,420
<i>I'll</i> ask you a question.

303
00:20:53,545 --> 00:20:54,963
Ask me!

304
00:20:55,213 --> 00:20:56,756
Just wait.

305
00:20:57,674 --> 00:21:01,928
Children, can you tell me
what “cooperation” is?

306
00:21:02,053 --> 00:21:04,139
I know! Can I answer?

307
00:21:04,973 --> 00:21:08,101
- Calm down. You answer.
- Working with each other.

308
00:21:08,226 --> 00:21:09,727
Working with each other.

309
00:21:09,853 --> 00:21:12,439
Can I answer?
Helping each other.

310
00:21:13,314 --> 00:21:15,984
- I said that already.
- Yes, you did.

311
00:21:16,192 --> 00:21:19,028
Let's see if you can tell me...

312
00:21:20,029 --> 00:21:22,031
the capital of Gilan province.

313
00:21:22,657 --> 00:21:24,909
- I know!
- I know!

314
00:21:25,034 --> 00:21:26,953
<i>Rash“!</i>

315
00:21:28,788 --> 00:21:31,583
What do you say?
Rasht. That's right.

316
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:35,628
What is Rostamabad near?
- Poshteh!

317
00:21:35,753 --> 00:21:38,465
Gilan.

318
00:21:40,258 --> 00:21:43,761
Near Rudbar.
And what is Rudbar known for?

319
00:21:43,928 --> 00:21:45,472
Olives!

320
00:21:57,859 --> 00:22:01,070
- Go through it once.
- Ma'am, I know it.

321
00:22:01,446 --> 00:22:05,074
Don't worry.
- Just to put my mind at ease.

322
00:22:05,992 --> 00:22:09,662
I walk up the stairs
with the plaster on my shoulder.

323
00:22:12,081 --> 00:22:14,459
Could it be something
other than plaster?

324
00:22:14,751 --> 00:22:17,587
Remember:
You have to do what we tell you.

325
00:22:19,255 --> 00:22:20,715
Fine.

326
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:24,719
I take the plaster upstairs,
and a woman up there says...

327
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:27,430
“Thank you.”

328
00:22:27,555 --> 00:22:29,349
No. “God be with you.”

329
00:22:29,516 --> 00:22:31,684
Sorry. “God be with you.”

330
00:22:31,851 --> 00:22:35,438
And I reply,
“Could I have some water?”

331
00:22:36,397 --> 00:22:38,691
Did I remember right?

332
00:22:40,235 --> 00:22:41,861
Did I remember?

333
00:22:45,907 --> 00:22:49,035
What's going on?
You're blocking the road.

334
00:22:50,703 --> 00:22:51,955
<i>We'll move it.</i>

335
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:55,708
How can I get by
with your truck and bricks in the way?

336
00:22:55,875 --> 00:22:57,877
We'll move it soon.

337
00:22:58,211 --> 00:23:00,171
I have to get through!

338
00:23:00,296 --> 00:23:03,174
You will. Just wait half an hour.

339
00:23:03,383 --> 00:23:06,219
Are you kidding?
I have tons to do!

340
00:23:06,386 --> 00:23:08,137
So do we.

341
00:23:08,263 --> 00:23:12,600
We come from the provinces
and slave away here for others,

342
00:23:12,725 --> 00:23:15,812
all just to feed our families.

343
00:23:15,937 --> 00:23:17,939
That's no answer.

344
00:23:18,064 --> 00:23:19,524
How do I get by?

345
00:23:19,649 --> 00:23:22,443
We'll ask a worker
to clear the road.

346
00:23:22,569 --> 00:23:25,488
But we can only spare one!

347
00:23:25,613 --> 00:23:27,156
That's not my problem.

348
00:23:27,282 --> 00:23:28,575
I'm in a hurry!

349
00:23:28,741 --> 00:23:31,578
Then your worker
can help move the bricks

350
00:23:31,703 --> 00:23:33,746
and clear the road.

351
00:23:33,871 --> 00:23:36,165
We'll all finish faster.

352
00:23:36,291 --> 00:23:38,042
That's not his job.

353
00:23:38,167 --> 00:23:40,837
It's yours!
- There's nothing I can do.

354
00:23:40,962 --> 00:23:42,922
You're blocking the road!

355
00:23:43,089 --> 00:23:45,091
It's easy enough to clear.

356
00:23:45,425 --> 00:23:48,219
Just throw the bricks on the pile.

357
00:23:48,511 --> 00:23:50,471
Ma'am, I'm really sorry.

358
00:23:50,805 --> 00:23:54,475
<i>I'll</i> gladly do anything you ask,
but not masonry.

359
00:23:54,601 --> 00:23:57,645
I'm not in construction anymore.

360
00:23:57,895 --> 00:24:00,273
You said to come be in your film.

361
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,734
But I won't lay bricks.

362
00:24:39,145 --> 00:24:40,521
Yes?

363
00:24:40,647 --> 00:24:43,191
The road to Koker, please?

364
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:46,527
- Back the way you came!
- It's blocked.

365
00:24:46,653 --> 00:24:49,572
Keep going.
There's a road just past the bridge.

366
00:24:49,697 --> 00:24:52,325
Hossein, don't get a big head!

367
00:24:56,829 --> 00:25:01,125
Ma'am, why ask them
when I'm right here?

368
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:03,586
I'm from around here too.

369
00:25:04,337 --> 00:25:08,508
Since you no longer
touch plaster or do masonry,

370
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:11,511
I thought you didn't give
directions either.

371
00:25:11,636 --> 00:25:13,763
“I only want to be an actor.”

372
00:25:14,472 --> 00:25:16,766
That's why I asked someone else.

373
00:25:18,935 --> 00:25:20,395
Now, then...

374
00:25:24,941 --> 00:25:28,236
Whom should I ask?
- Me, sir!

375
00:25:28,361 --> 00:25:30,822
You're very smart,

376
00:25:30,947 --> 00:25:33,533
but your citizenship
could use improvement.

377
00:25:33,658 --> 00:25:36,202
We'll continue this later, children.

378
00:25:48,005 --> 00:25:50,383
- Ready, Mr. Panahi?
- Yes.

379
00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:52,677
Hossein, hurry up.

380
00:26:05,064 --> 00:26:06,649
Where's Mr. Jafarian?

381
00:26:06,774 --> 00:26:09,402
- Mr. Jafarian?
- Corning.

382
00:26:10,069 --> 00:26:12,280
Mrs. Shiva, quickly.

383
00:26:14,615 --> 00:26:16,743
Same scene.

384
00:26:17,201 --> 00:26:19,746
Mr. Kheradmand, quickly, please.

385
00:26:22,373 --> 00:26:23,791
Ready when you are.

386
00:26:23,916 --> 00:26:25,585
Shot 1, take 1.

387
00:26:25,793 --> 00:26:26,961
Action.

388
00:26:27,336 --> 00:26:29,589
Fine. You can stay there.

389
00:26:30,465 --> 00:26:32,091
Hello.

390
00:26:42,518 --> 00:26:43,936
Hello.

391
00:26:47,315 --> 00:26:48,566
Cut!

392
00:26:49,275 --> 00:26:52,195
Hossein,
why don't you say your line?

393
00:26:54,197 --> 00:26:56,491
Come back down with the sack.

394
00:27:05,708 --> 00:27:08,294
Boys, stay on that side!

395
00:27:08,628 --> 00:27:12,465
Farhad, don't look at him
too long as he goes upstairs.

396
00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:15,426
Farhad! Understand?
- Yes.

397
00:27:15,551 --> 00:27:16,761
Take 2.

398
00:27:17,678 --> 00:27:20,014
Fine. You can stay there.

399
00:27:20,681 --> 00:27:22,266
Hello.

400
00:27:33,027 --> 00:27:34,362
Hello.

401
00:27:36,322 --> 00:27:38,241
Cut!

402
00:27:39,033 --> 00:27:41,452
Mrs. Shiva,
didn't you rehearse with him?

403
00:27:41,577 --> 00:27:43,913
Yes. He was fine in the truck.

404
00:27:44,455 --> 00:27:46,374
Come back down with the sack.

405
00:27:47,124 --> 00:27:49,877
When I say hello to her...

406
00:27:50,795 --> 00:27:53,172
she doesn't answer.

407
00:27:54,549 --> 00:27:58,219
She doesn't answer
when I say hello.

408
00:27:59,554 --> 00:28:01,848
- She doesn't say hello?
- No.

409
00:28:27,206 --> 00:28:31,669
Listen, we stopped filming
today because of you,

410
00:28:31,794 --> 00:28:35,047
so tell me why that girl
wouldn't say hello.

411
00:28:44,432 --> 00:28:46,058
Tell me.

412
00:28:47,602 --> 00:28:51,856
It was at Eynollah's -
God rest his soul -

413
00:28:52,815 --> 00:28:54,984
where I used to work.

414
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:58,362
That girl used to live

415
00:28:58,487 --> 00:29:01,032
right across from there.

416
00:29:01,574 --> 00:29:06,037
She was sitting
on the stairs studying.

417
00:29:06,913 --> 00:29:10,750
Sitting there across from me,

418
00:29:10,875 --> 00:29:13,461
she looked so gentle and decent,

419
00:29:13,586 --> 00:29:17,256
the kind of girl
I could see myself marrying.

420
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:21,010
So I got the idea in my head
to marry her.

421
00:29:22,053 --> 00:29:26,933
Then I went back to work until dusk.

422
00:29:27,058 --> 00:29:30,227
When I went to wash up,

423
00:29:30,436 --> 00:29:33,105
I saw her mother

424
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:36,400
coming over
to the spring to get water.

425
00:29:38,027 --> 00:29:40,696
I spoke to her about her daughter.
She got annoyed.

426
00:29:40,821 --> 00:29:41,781
Why?

427
00:29:43,783 --> 00:29:46,452
Maybe she thought
I wasn't serious enough...

428
00:29:47,161 --> 00:29:51,248
that her daughter's reputation
would suffer,

429
00:29:51,374 --> 00:29:54,460
that I didn't really want her,

430
00:29:55,252 --> 00:29:57,463
that I didn't deserve her.

431
00:29:57,630 --> 00:29:59,215
And then?

432
00:29:59,799 --> 00:30:03,219
That evening
I went to change my clothes,

433
00:30:03,511 --> 00:30:06,180
and Eynollah told me not to bother

434
00:30:06,305 --> 00:30:09,100
coming to work the next day.

435
00:30:09,225 --> 00:30:12,979
I heard that the mother
asked him to fire me

436
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:16,816
and offered him a good worker

437
00:30:17,149 --> 00:30:19,318
in my place.

438
00:30:19,443 --> 00:30:23,030
That was the night
the earthquake struck.

439
00:30:23,447 --> 00:30:25,992
Eynollah's family...

440
00:30:26,158 --> 00:30:28,285
God rest their souls...

441
00:30:28,869 --> 00:30:33,082
and the family of this girl,
Tahereh, were killed.

442
00:30:34,125 --> 00:30:36,711
- Tahereh's parents?
- Yes.

443
00:30:39,005 --> 00:30:41,716
- And then?
- They all died.

444
00:30:42,883 --> 00:30:45,886
On the third day of mourning...

445
00:30:47,346 --> 00:30:49,640
I went to the cemetery.

446
00:30:49,765 --> 00:30:51,892
There were so many people there

447
00:30:52,184 --> 00:30:55,104
that I wasn't able to see her.

448
00:30:55,354 --> 00:30:57,565
On the seventh day of mourning...

449
00:30:58,524 --> 00:31:02,862
I saw her at her parents' grave.

450
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:06,615
I wanted to talk to her...

451
00:31:06,907 --> 00:31:10,578
but her grandmother told me
to pray for the dead.

452
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:14,874
Before I was halfway
through my prayer,

453
00:31:15,458 --> 00:31:17,585
they had disappeared.

454
00:31:17,835 --> 00:31:20,838
And you haven't seen her since?

455
00:31:20,963 --> 00:31:22,506
<i>No.</i>

456
00:31:22,715 --> 00:31:26,802
Just once,
on the 40th day of mourning.

457
00:31:27,053 --> 00:31:29,889
- And what did you do?
- On the 40th day...

458
00:31:30,264 --> 00:31:33,267
I went back to the cemetery.
Her grandmother was there.

459
00:31:33,392 --> 00:31:35,644
I told myself
that those poor people

460
00:31:35,770 --> 00:31:40,066
now knew that the world is cruel
and that life is short...

461
00:31:40,649 --> 00:31:42,902
and so they wouldn't
break my heart.

462
00:31:43,611 --> 00:31:47,698
If these people
had treated me better earlier...

463
00:31:48,616 --> 00:31:50,534
perhaps all these troubles

464
00:31:50,659 --> 00:31:52,661
wouldn't have happened to them.

465
00:31:54,121 --> 00:31:58,000
I told myself
it was the sighing of my heart...

466
00:31:59,043 --> 00:32:01,253
that had destroyed all these houses.

467
00:32:01,378 --> 00:32:05,883
How could I afford
a house like those?

468
00:32:06,008 --> 00:32:08,094
My heart was heavy,

469
00:32:08,219 --> 00:32:10,513
and I wanted to relieve my sorrow

470
00:32:10,679 --> 00:32:12,765
by pouring it out on them.

471
00:32:12,890 --> 00:32:15,893
I said to them,
“Now that no one...

472
00:32:17,269 --> 00:32:19,980
has a house anymore,

473
00:32:20,106 --> 00:32:22,858
we're all on an equal footing.

474
00:32:22,983 --> 00:32:25,111
I have no house...

475
00:32:25,361 --> 00:32:27,196
but neither do you.

476
00:32:27,363 --> 00:32:30,116
What's your reply
to my marriage proposal now?”

477
00:32:30,324 --> 00:32:33,494
They gave me a reply...

478
00:32:34,328 --> 00:32:36,747
that still stings my heart today.

479
00:32:36,872 --> 00:32:41,335
“Are you blind?
Can't you see people are rebuilding?”

480
00:32:41,585 --> 00:32:43,170
I see.

481
00:32:51,095 --> 00:32:53,305
Ever since I was 11...

482
00:32:53,806 --> 00:32:56,267
I've worked on other people's houses.

483
00:32:56,392 --> 00:32:58,018
What was your trade?

484
00:32:58,185 --> 00:33:00,437
I worked with a mason.

485
00:33:00,563 --> 00:33:01,939
What did you do?

486
00:33:02,064 --> 00:33:04,567
I laid bricks,

487
00:33:04,692 --> 00:33:06,986
clay or cement bricks.

488
00:33:07,319 --> 00:33:09,989
That sort of work.

489
00:33:10,239 --> 00:33:12,616
But people have always told me...

490
00:33:12,741 --> 00:33:14,410
“No house, no woman!”

491
00:33:14,535 --> 00:33:16,954
Since I didn't have a house,

492
00:33:17,079 --> 00:33:19,623
no one would give me
a woman to marry.

493
00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:22,501
But it takes time to build a house.

494
00:33:22,626 --> 00:33:24,670
And you haven't seen her since?

495
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:27,506
Yes, I have.

496
00:33:27,673 --> 00:33:29,425
Not last Thursday...

497
00:33:29,675 --> 00:33:33,012
but the one before that,

498
00:33:33,345 --> 00:33:36,390
the day I met all of you.

499
00:33:38,017 --> 00:33:39,393
And?

500
00:33:39,518 --> 00:33:42,521
I asked for her hand
in marriage again.

501
00:33:43,397 --> 00:33:45,524
I didn't want to see them again.

502
00:33:45,649 --> 00:33:47,943
I'm not even sure why I went.

503
00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:52,406
Where?

504
00:33:53,866 --> 00:33:55,576
The cemetery.

505
00:33:56,202 --> 00:33:58,078
I saw them there.

506
00:34:22,269 --> 00:34:25,898
<i>That boy won't leave us alone.
Go on home.</i>

507
00:34:30,277 --> 00:34:32,738
<i>- The key.
- I'll be right there.</i>

508
00:34:32,863 --> 00:34:35,241
<i>He won't leave us in peace.</i>

509
00:36:18,010 --> 00:36:20,512
Hello.

510
00:36:20,846 --> 00:36:23,098
- How are you?
- Fine, thank God.

511
00:36:23,349 --> 00:36:26,393
- May I have your answer?
- The answer's no.

512
00:36:26,518 --> 00:36:29,730
Your granddaughter seems willing,
so why -

513
00:36:29,855 --> 00:36:32,691
You want my answer?
It's no!

514
00:36:32,816 --> 00:36:34,693
Think of me too!

515
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:38,322
Everyone tells me
she wants to get married,

516
00:36:38,447 --> 00:36:41,617
but you keep stubbornly saying,
“The answer's no.”

517
00:36:41,742 --> 00:36:44,745
The answer's no!

518
00:36:44,870 --> 00:36:47,706
Give me at least
two good reasons.

519
00:36:47,831 --> 00:36:50,834
You're illiterate,
and you have no house.

520
00:36:50,959 --> 00:36:54,505
It's decency, intelligence,
and understanding that's important.

521
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:56,840
You may be decent
and understanding,

522
00:36:56,965 --> 00:36:59,009
but you need a house.

523
00:36:59,218 --> 00:37:02,262
She chose me. You're keeping us
from living together.

524
00:37:02,388 --> 00:37:04,098
The answer's no.

525
00:37:04,223 --> 00:37:07,226
You have no house,
you're illiterate,

526
00:37:07,726 --> 00:37:10,729
and you're empty-headed.

527
00:37:10,896 --> 00:37:12,981
Mind your own business.

528
00:37:13,107 --> 00:37:16,235
She'll never be yours.

529
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:20,239
Stop thinking about her,
or <i>I'll</i> make your life hell.

530
00:37:21,657 --> 00:37:24,076
If her parents were still alive,

531
00:37:24,243 --> 00:37:26,745
I'd at least have some hope.

532
00:37:26,954 --> 00:37:29,081
But with you, nothing.

533
00:37:30,416 --> 00:37:32,960
If they were alive,

534
00:37:33,085 --> 00:37:36,630
they wouldn't give her
to you either.

535
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:45,597
Are you sure that's how
your granddaughter feels?

536
00:37:45,931 --> 00:37:48,308
My answer's no!

537
00:38:01,196 --> 00:38:02,448
Cut!

538
00:38:02,614 --> 00:38:04,408
Wait a minute.

539
00:38:04,783 --> 00:38:07,453
What are you doing there?

540
00:38:09,288 --> 00:38:11,290
Come here quickly!

541
00:38:12,166 --> 00:38:13,792
Hurry!

542
00:38:14,501 --> 00:38:17,004
Quickly!

543
00:38:17,463 --> 00:38:19,214
Over here.

544
00:38:20,174 --> 00:38:21,633
Back here.

545
00:38:27,306 --> 00:38:29,308
Back here. Sound?

546
00:38:29,641 --> 00:38:31,518
Sound?

547
00:38:32,644 --> 00:38:33,645
Camera.

548
00:38:33,812 --> 00:38:36,106
Scene 7, shot 2, take 2.

549
00:38:37,024 --> 00:38:38,442
Action!

550
00:39:13,977 --> 00:39:16,355
After I take Tahereh home,

551
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,941
shall I go get the other one...?

552
00:39:19,233 --> 00:39:20,526
Which one?

553
00:39:30,619 --> 00:39:34,039
After I take Tahereh home,
shall I go get Poursadeghi?

554
00:39:34,206 --> 00:39:37,376
- Who's that?
- The girl with the green eyes.

555
00:39:37,709 --> 00:39:39,211
Talk to Tahereh.

556
00:39:39,836 --> 00:39:41,380
She's better for the part.

557
00:39:41,547 --> 00:39:44,091
I can't do anything
if she won't speak.

558
00:39:44,216 --> 00:39:46,176
She won't listen or say her lines.

559
00:39:47,094 --> 00:39:49,388
It's obvious he's the problem.

560
00:39:49,638 --> 00:39:53,392
There was no problem
with the other boy.

561
00:39:54,184 --> 00:39:58,021
Let's avoid more problems.
- How?

562
00:39:58,146 --> 00:40:01,775
Do what you can.
- I'm not sure what I can do.

563
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:03,652
- Try anyway.
- Okay.

564
00:41:27,152 --> 00:41:30,197
Hossein, bring my cigarettes
from the car.

565
00:41:30,322 --> 00:41:33,659
- What?
- Bring my cigarettes from the car.

566
00:41:33,825 --> 00:41:35,077
All right.

567
00:41:35,285 --> 00:41:37,412
- Hello, Bagheri.
- Hello.

568
00:41:37,537 --> 00:41:39,581
- How are you?
- Very well, thanks.

569
00:41:39,873 --> 00:41:41,667
Glad to hear it.

570
00:41:42,125 --> 00:41:44,961
That smells great.
What are you cooking?

571
00:41:45,087 --> 00:41:46,838
Grilled eggplant.

572
00:41:47,923 --> 00:41:50,384
The crew requested it for dinner.

573
00:41:50,509 --> 00:41:52,386
<i>- Bagheri?
- Yes?</i>

574
00:41:52,511 --> 00:41:57,599
What was that dish
the night before last?

575
00:41:57,724 --> 00:41:59,685
Sour herb stew.

576
00:42:00,894 --> 00:42:03,855
How do you make that?
- Sour herb stew?

577
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:07,567
On second thought,
tell me this instead:

578
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:12,572
isn't your wife jealous
that you're the better cook?

579
00:42:12,823 --> 00:42:14,825
She used to <i>be...</i>

580
00:42:15,158 --> 00:42:17,452
but she isn't around anymore.

581
00:42:17,577 --> 00:42:19,788
- You mean...?
- Yes, she's dead.

582
00:42:19,913 --> 00:42:21,873
Killed in the quake.

583
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:23,792
God rest her soul.

584
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,378
So you're alone now?
- Yes.

585
00:42:26,545 --> 00:42:29,381
- Cigarette?
- No, I just had one.

586
00:42:33,343 --> 00:42:34,386
Bagheri?

587
00:42:34,553 --> 00:42:36,054
Yes?

588
00:42:36,722 --> 00:42:38,598
Aren't you thinking...

589
00:42:41,351 --> 00:42:44,730
of finding a companion now?

590
00:42:45,355 --> 00:42:47,315
No, I don't want to remarry.

591
00:42:47,482 --> 00:42:49,151
But you're all alone.

592
00:42:49,276 --> 00:42:52,028
I lived with her for 50 years.

593
00:42:52,446 --> 00:42:54,656
She gave me six children.

594
00:42:56,199 --> 00:42:58,577
It wouldn't be right.

595
00:43:00,328 --> 00:43:03,290
But your children have all left home.

596
00:43:03,457 --> 00:43:07,419
You need a companion
in your later years.

597
00:43:07,544 --> 00:43:09,588
My life's coming to an end.

598
00:43:10,088 --> 00:43:13,300
Come on!
You're still in your prime!

599
00:43:14,676 --> 00:43:17,929
A lot of women here
have lost their husbands,

600
00:43:18,054 --> 00:43:21,808
and a lot of husbands
their wives.

601
00:43:21,933 --> 00:43:25,103
Maybe, but I don't want
to get married.

602
00:43:26,563 --> 00:43:28,774
After 50 years with someone,

603
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:31,401
it's not right to remarry.

604
00:43:34,821 --> 00:43:37,949
For me, at 60 or 65,

605
00:43:38,116 --> 00:43:40,911
it's not right.

606
00:44:16,446 --> 00:44:18,323
- Hossein.
- Yes?

607
00:44:18,657 --> 00:44:21,326
Clean this pot out for me.

608
00:44:21,451 --> 00:44:22,953
Right away.

609
00:44:26,706 --> 00:44:28,291
Are you coming?

610
00:44:28,917 --> 00:44:30,961
We didn't look after our parents.

611
00:44:31,086 --> 00:44:33,213
Why should our children
look after us,

612
00:44:33,338 --> 00:44:35,632
with their hectic lives in Tehran?

613
00:44:35,757 --> 00:44:37,801
What do your children do?

614
00:44:37,926 --> 00:44:39,678
They live in Tehran.

615
00:44:40,178 --> 00:44:44,099
One works for an oil company,
Falate Gharreh.

616
00:44:44,224 --> 00:44:46,226
- An oil company?
- Yes.

617
00:44:46,643 --> 00:44:49,354
He goes to the island of Lavan...

618
00:44:51,398 --> 00:44:54,693
to the port of Genaveh.

619
00:44:55,402 --> 00:44:57,863
It's hot there.
- Is it?

620
00:44:57,988 --> 00:45:02,576
And your other son who works
for a drilling company...

621
00:45:02,701 --> 00:45:05,328
does he have kids?
- Yes, three.

622
00:45:06,371 --> 00:45:10,125
- And your two sons here?
- They're drivers.

623
00:45:10,750 --> 00:45:15,046
One drives a truck,
and the other works at the town hall.

624
00:45:16,381 --> 00:45:17,883
How did it go?

625
00:45:19,050 --> 00:45:21,094
She refuses to listen.

626
00:45:21,386 --> 00:45:23,930
She says we hired her
for one day

627
00:45:24,055 --> 00:45:26,725
and that she has
to study for exams.

628
00:45:26,892 --> 00:45:30,228
I said,
“Fine. You can study on the set.”

629
00:45:30,395 --> 00:45:33,857
It's clear she doesn't want
to be with that boy.

630
00:45:34,024 --> 00:45:36,026
She just doesn't want to.

631
00:45:36,401 --> 00:45:39,905
I think we have
to replace one or the other.

632
00:45:40,405 --> 00:45:43,074
Either the girl or Hossein.

633
00:45:45,076 --> 00:45:48,538
Hossein, the flowers need water.
They're drying up.

634
00:45:48,663 --> 00:45:51,833
- You haven't done it in two days.
- You never told me.

635
00:45:51,958 --> 00:45:54,294
- Whom did I tell?
- Mohammadi.

636
00:45:54,419 --> 00:45:56,963
Mohammadi says I told you...

637
00:45:57,213 --> 00:46:01,259
and you say I told Mohammadi.

638
00:46:01,509 --> 00:46:03,261
What do I have to do?

639
00:46:03,428 --> 00:46:06,264
I'd have done it if you'd told me.

640
00:46:06,431 --> 00:46:09,434
- You just forgot.
- I did not.

641
00:46:10,810 --> 00:46:13,063
I was a bit crafty.

642
00:46:13,313 --> 00:46:16,107
I told her to hurry up and decide,

643
00:46:16,441 --> 00:46:19,611
or I'd go get Miss Poursadeghi.

644
00:46:19,945 --> 00:46:22,280
She reacted immediately and said...

645
00:46:22,447 --> 00:46:24,574
“Come back tomorrow.
<i>I'll</i> see then.”

646
00:46:25,116 --> 00:46:27,327
If you ask <i>me...</i>

647
00:46:27,619 --> 00:46:30,205
we have to replace one or the other.

648
00:46:30,330 --> 00:46:32,999
The girl could cause problems later.

649
00:46:33,208 --> 00:46:35,043
We'll find a solution.

650
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:37,671
What you were saying, Bagheri?

651
00:46:54,729 --> 00:46:57,607
Hossein, get up!

652
00:46:58,233 --> 00:47:01,277
How long are you going to sleep?

653
00:47:03,989 --> 00:47:05,949
Get up. It's late.

654
00:47:06,157 --> 00:47:07,492
Morning, ma'am.

655
00:47:07,867 --> 00:47:09,869
Good morning.

656
00:47:10,078 --> 00:47:12,038
Hossein, it's very late.

657
00:47:12,163 --> 00:47:13,707
Get up.

658
00:47:14,457 --> 00:47:17,502
You got up late too.
The crew wants tea.

659
00:47:17,627 --> 00:47:19,754
Hossein kept me awake all night.

660
00:47:19,879 --> 00:47:23,717
He kept shouting in his sleep,
“Where are my white socks?”

661
00:47:24,217 --> 00:47:27,012
Between him and the wind,
I got no sleep.

662
00:47:27,178 --> 00:47:29,180
I had to put my cot outside.

663
00:47:29,305 --> 00:47:32,225
Well, make some tea
while I wake the others.

664
00:47:43,862 --> 00:47:45,405
Mr. Karimi?

665
00:47:54,039 --> 00:47:55,790
Good morning.

666
00:47:59,461 --> 00:48:01,880
Good morning, Mrs. Shiva.

667
00:48:02,047 --> 00:48:05,383
- Is Mr. Ghafari up?
- Yes, he went jogging.

668
00:48:06,176 --> 00:48:08,011
Mr. Samakbashi?

669
00:48:08,678 --> 00:48:10,680
It's very late.

670
00:48:10,889 --> 00:48:12,057
Okay, ma'am.

671
00:48:12,223 --> 00:48:14,309
Good morning.

672
00:48:19,439 --> 00:48:21,149
Mr. Jafarian?

673
00:48:24,527 --> 00:48:25,904
I'm awake.

674
00:48:26,362 --> 00:48:27,655
Good morning.

675
00:48:27,781 --> 00:48:30,700
- Mr. Jafarian?
- Good morning.

676
00:48:31,743 --> 00:48:33,411
Good morning to you.

677
00:48:34,412 --> 00:48:36,039
Mr. Kheradmand?

678
00:48:38,666 --> 00:48:40,126
Over here!

679
00:48:40,251 --> 00:48:41,836
Good morning.

680
00:48:41,961 --> 00:48:44,714
'Morning, Farhad.
'Morning, Mrs. Shiva.

681
00:48:45,215 --> 00:48:47,425
Good morning, Mrs. Shiva.

682
00:48:48,593 --> 00:48:52,514
If you don't need Hossein right away,
let him sleep a bit.

683
00:48:52,639 --> 00:48:55,100
He didn't sleep well.
He's very tired.

684
00:48:55,266 --> 00:48:57,143
I didn't hear you.

685
00:48:57,435 --> 00:49:00,271
Ma'am, I'm awake!

686
00:49:00,563 --> 00:49:02,398
Good morning.

687
00:49:02,524 --> 00:49:06,069
Gather the cups
from the tents and wash them.

688
00:49:06,194 --> 00:49:08,696
You say I'm asleep
when I'm awake!

689
00:49:09,072 --> 00:49:10,532
I wasn't asleep.

690
00:49:10,657 --> 00:49:13,034
Correction, everyone:

691
00:49:13,368 --> 00:49:15,328
Hossein was up early!

692
00:49:15,453 --> 00:49:17,080
Okay!

693
00:49:18,248 --> 00:49:20,959
The poor guy overslept.
Now he's worried.

694
00:49:22,919 --> 00:49:25,547
I had a hard time getting up too.

695
00:49:26,422 --> 00:49:28,466
You didn't sleep well?

696
00:49:28,967 --> 00:49:31,302
I could feel the mattress springs.

697
00:49:31,553 --> 00:49:33,471
My back hurt...

698
00:49:33,972 --> 00:49:36,266
and it was damp on the ground.

699
00:49:37,559 --> 00:49:39,853
That's how my night went.

700
00:49:40,186 --> 00:49:43,231
But the pure morning air
makes it all worthwhile!

701
00:49:43,481 --> 00:49:45,900
This air is delightful.

702
00:49:46,651 --> 00:49:50,780
Seems like all the people
around here are gone, huh?

703
00:49:50,905 --> 00:49:53,908
Yes, most died in the earthquake,

704
00:49:54,033 --> 00:49:57,036
and the survivors moved
down by the main road.

705
00:49:57,162 --> 00:50:00,456
You've seen those tiny places
they've thrown up, right?

706
00:50:00,999 --> 00:50:05,044
They preferred the highway
to the wonderful air here?

707
00:50:05,295 --> 00:50:06,838
I guess so.

708
00:50:07,297 --> 00:50:09,507
And the poor devils were right.

709
00:50:09,632 --> 00:50:12,552
After the quake
the roads were blocked,

710
00:50:12,677 --> 00:50:15,180
and help couldn't reach them.

711
00:50:15,346 --> 00:50:18,016
Many of them died,
and the survivors left.

712
00:50:18,183 --> 00:50:21,436
Besides, you can't live
on fresh air alone.

713
00:50:21,644 --> 00:50:25,523
You need other things,
things found down by the highway.

714
00:50:25,690 --> 00:50:28,902
And from there,
they can go wherever they need to.

715
00:50:29,027 --> 00:50:31,321
Thus you get cities of 12 million.

716
00:50:31,446 --> 00:50:34,449
Listen to us with our platitudes!

717
00:50:35,450 --> 00:50:38,536
But let me tell you
something about this place.

718
00:50:38,661 --> 00:50:41,623
If you greet the souls
of the inhabitants here,

719
00:50:41,748 --> 00:50:43,249
they answer you.

720
00:50:43,374 --> 00:50:45,418
- Greet their souls?
- Yes.

721
00:50:45,710 --> 00:50:47,378
Hello.

722
00:50:47,545 --> 00:50:50,548
Say it like that
and only I can hear.

723
00:50:50,673 --> 00:50:52,842
Louder, so they can hear.

724
00:50:56,721 --> 00:50:58,056
Hear that?

725
00:50:58,514 --> 00:51:01,142
- Now you're pulling my leg.
- Why?

726
00:51:01,267 --> 00:51:03,811
It's obviously an echo.

727
00:51:03,937 --> 00:51:06,689
Then try saying something else.

728
00:51:06,814 --> 00:51:08,566
You'll see.

729
00:51:08,816 --> 00:51:10,443
What should I say?

730
00:51:11,319 --> 00:51:13,696
Pouya! Pouya!

731
00:51:13,821 --> 00:51:15,281
<i>Yes?</i>

732
00:51:16,241 --> 00:51:18,493
No, nothing!

733
00:51:19,827 --> 00:51:23,581
One thing: They only answer
to hello and good-bye.

734
00:51:23,748 --> 00:51:25,208
Listen.

735
00:51:25,416 --> 00:51:27,460
Good-bye!

736
00:51:30,129 --> 00:51:33,091
But if you say good-bye
and don't leave,

737
00:51:33,258 --> 00:51:35,260
they won't answer
your hello anymore.

738
00:51:35,385 --> 00:51:37,595
Just hello and good-bye.

739
00:51:37,929 --> 00:51:39,389
I'm off.

740
00:51:39,514 --> 00:51:41,015
See you.

741
00:51:42,475 --> 00:51:44,185
Farhad...

742
00:51:44,310 --> 00:51:47,105
give these to Mr. Panahi.
<i>I'll</i> catch up with you.

743
00:51:47,272 --> 00:51:48,856
See you later.

744
00:52:37,030 --> 00:52:38,614
Sit here in front!

745
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:42,160
I want to see how Hossein's doing.

746
00:52:44,037 --> 00:52:45,496
Are you okay?

747
00:52:46,873 --> 00:52:48,708
I'm fine, thanks.

748
00:52:49,167 --> 00:52:51,085
You don't look too happy.

749
00:52:51,586 --> 00:52:52,670
I'm okay.

750
00:52:53,129 --> 00:52:55,340
You look worn out.

751
00:52:57,550 --> 00:52:59,927
Seems you didn't sleep well, huh?

752
00:53:00,094 --> 00:53:02,221
I just got to sleep late.

753
00:53:02,513 --> 00:53:06,017
You don't look like someone
who didn't sleep much.

754
00:53:06,184 --> 00:53:08,644
You look like something's eating you.

755
00:53:08,770 --> 00:53:10,355
Am I right?

756
00:53:10,521 --> 00:53:12,607
No, nothing's eating me.

757
00:53:12,732 --> 00:53:14,484
Yes, something is.

758
00:53:16,319 --> 00:53:17,987
You know, sir...

759
00:53:18,112 --> 00:53:20,990
the deceased souls of Poshteh...

760
00:53:23,117 --> 00:53:28,873
have far better manners
than Miss Tahereh.

761
00:53:29,332 --> 00:53:30,875
How so?

762
00:53:31,292 --> 00:53:35,213
When you greeted them earlier,
at least they replied.

763
00:53:35,380 --> 00:53:36,881
That's true.

764
00:53:37,131 --> 00:53:40,635
I greeted her three times yesterday,
and she didn't reply once.

765
00:53:40,968 --> 00:53:42,970
Usually you just say hello once.

766
00:53:43,096 --> 00:53:45,890
If there's no reply,
you don't keep saying it.

767
00:53:46,057 --> 00:53:48,684
You were in the wrong.
- You told me to!

768
00:53:49,060 --> 00:53:50,520
I did?

769
00:53:51,270 --> 00:53:53,689
I told you to say it once.

770
00:54:01,364 --> 00:54:03,699
I thought if I greeted her...

771
00:54:06,577 --> 00:54:09,664
maybe she'd reply, but no.

772
00:54:09,997 --> 00:54:12,917
I'm not saying hello to her again.

773
00:54:19,507 --> 00:54:21,134
Will she...

774
00:54:22,260 --> 00:54:24,095
be there today?

775
00:54:24,220 --> 00:54:25,638
I don't know. Maybe.

776
00:54:25,763 --> 00:54:28,015
Mrs. Shiva?
- Yes?

777
00:54:28,933 --> 00:54:30,935
Stop for these people.

778
00:54:36,399 --> 00:54:39,068
Hossein, help them up.

779
00:55:18,816 --> 00:55:21,527
Where are you coming from
with so much stuff?

780
00:55:21,652 --> 00:55:23,529
I don't speak Persian.

781
00:55:23,654 --> 00:55:26,157
We were at the public baths.

782
00:55:26,282 --> 00:55:27,992
And where are they?

783
00:55:28,159 --> 00:55:30,578
The other side of Shima.

784
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:36,501
There are baths around here.
Why go so far?

785
00:55:36,834 --> 00:55:40,838
There are shops there,
and the bazaar.

786
00:55:41,506 --> 00:55:43,424
There's a bakery too.

787
00:55:43,549 --> 00:55:46,135
Our daughters come with us.

788
00:55:46,427 --> 00:55:49,639
Isn't it hard on you
going all that way?

789
00:55:49,805 --> 00:55:53,392
Maybe, but it's better there.
It's quieter.

790
00:55:54,060 --> 00:55:58,189
Won't you catch cold up here?

791
00:55:58,356 --> 00:56:02,318
We're cold,
but we have to get home.

792
00:56:04,153 --> 00:56:05,404
Cold and heat

793
00:56:05,530 --> 00:56:07,198
don't bother us.

794
00:56:07,990 --> 00:56:09,325
We can't change it...

795
00:56:09,450 --> 00:56:10,868
even if it's hard.

796
00:56:11,035 --> 00:56:13,704
Things are less hectic there.

797
00:56:15,748 --> 00:56:18,251
- Is she your daughter?
- Yes.

798
00:56:20,545 --> 00:56:22,547
She doesn't look like you.

799
00:56:22,672 --> 00:56:25,841
She looks like her brother.

800
00:56:25,967 --> 00:56:28,761
Then her brother
must take after his father.

801
00:56:28,886 --> 00:56:30,304
He does.

802
00:56:30,429 --> 00:56:33,057
So she takes after her father.

803
00:56:33,849 --> 00:56:37,061
Where's her father now?
- He died.

804
00:56:37,728 --> 00:56:40,439
- In the earthquake?
- Yes.

805
00:56:42,275 --> 00:56:43,943
God rest his soul.

806
00:56:46,904 --> 00:56:52,076
Do you think your daughter
would like to be in our film?

807
00:56:52,243 --> 00:56:55,162
Would you like to be in our film?
- No.

808
00:56:56,622 --> 00:56:59,083
- Why?
- She doesn't know how to act.

809
00:56:59,375 --> 00:57:00,835
It's not hard.

810
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:04,005
She just has to wash dishes
by a spring.

811
00:57:04,130 --> 00:57:07,216
You could do that, right?

812
00:57:07,508 --> 00:57:09,260
Or no?

813
00:57:12,555 --> 00:57:13,764
What's your name?

814
00:57:16,142 --> 00:57:17,768
Look at me.

815
00:57:19,103 --> 00:57:20,730
Excuse me, sir.

816
00:57:20,855 --> 00:57:24,317
People here don't tell
the names of women or girls

817
00:57:24,442 --> 00:57:26,110
to strangers.

818
00:57:26,277 --> 00:57:28,279
It's not our custom.

819
00:57:34,035 --> 00:57:37,538
Are there still people
living around here?

820
00:57:38,706 --> 00:57:40,458
Very few.

821
00:57:40,583 --> 00:57:42,793
Only those with cattle and sheep.

822
00:57:42,918 --> 00:57:45,463
The rest have moved down
by the highway.

823
00:57:45,588 --> 00:57:49,091
- Do you have cattle too?
- We have nothing anymore.

824
00:57:49,258 --> 00:57:50,635
Then why stay?

825
00:57:50,760 --> 00:57:54,096
The side of the road
is no place to live.

826
00:57:54,722 --> 00:57:56,682
There's no peace and quiet there.

827
00:57:57,975 --> 00:57:59,894
Where are you from?

828
00:58:00,227 --> 00:58:02,063
We're all from Talesh-Tolab.

829
00:58:02,188 --> 00:58:03,981
- Talesh-Tolab?
- Yes.

830
00:58:04,148 --> 00:58:06,776
There we had flies,
tea plantations,

831
00:58:07,151 --> 00:58:09,236
trees, rice fields...

832
00:58:10,154 --> 00:58:11,906
and silk.

833
00:58:12,031 --> 00:58:14,659
- Flies?
- Honey flies. Bees.

834
00:58:14,784 --> 00:58:17,578
We left it all to come here.

835
00:58:17,703 --> 00:58:21,248
But to give up this place
to live by the highway...

836
00:58:21,374 --> 00:58:23,167
we couldn't do that.

837
00:58:23,292 --> 00:58:25,503
Have you ever been
to Talesh-Tolab?

838
00:58:25,670 --> 00:58:27,922
<i>No.</i>

839
00:58:28,756 --> 00:58:33,386
If you had, you wouldn't ask
why we don't move to the highway.

840
00:58:34,387 --> 00:58:36,681
That's no place to live.

841
00:58:36,847 --> 00:58:40,810
All that smoke
and asphalt and traffic!

842
00:58:40,935 --> 00:58:42,520
You're right.

843
00:58:42,645 --> 00:58:45,356
Thanks a lot.
We'll walk from here.

844
00:58:45,481 --> 00:58:47,358
Mrs. Shiva...

845
00:58:47,483 --> 00:58:49,443
let them off here.

846
00:58:53,072 --> 00:58:56,283
Ma'am, give me your address.

847
00:58:56,409 --> 00:58:58,119
We don't have one.

848
00:58:58,619 --> 00:59:01,288
We may have work for you.

849
00:59:01,414 --> 00:59:04,375
We have no address.
Why do you want it?

850
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:07,211
- You can trust me.
- We have no address.

851
00:59:07,712 --> 00:59:09,380
Good-bye.

852
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:11,590
Ma'am, come here.

853
00:59:11,716 --> 00:59:15,052
Mrs. Shiva, get her address.

854
00:59:15,261 --> 00:59:17,972
- Yes?
- What's your address, ma'am?

855
00:59:18,723 --> 00:59:22,393
We have no address.
We're over past that tree.

856
00:59:22,518 --> 00:59:25,271
We have no phone.
Our tents are over there.

857
00:59:25,396 --> 00:59:28,733
- I didn't ask for a phone.
- We have no address.

858
00:59:28,858 --> 00:59:31,736
Our tents are just past that tree.

859
00:59:31,861 --> 00:59:34,196
We have no address. Nothing.

860
00:59:34,488 --> 00:59:37,867
- What's your name?
- Zahra Norouzi.

861
00:59:38,284 --> 00:59:41,412
- If I need you, will you be there?
- Yes.

862
00:59:41,579 --> 00:59:44,206
We're over there.
- <i>I'll</i> come look for you.

863
00:59:44,331 --> 00:59:45,916
Good-bye.

864
01:00:04,185 --> 01:00:06,479
What did you want that woman for?

865
01:00:06,604 --> 01:00:08,105
Her?

866
01:00:08,689 --> 01:00:10,775
I wasn't interested in her.

867
01:00:11,108 --> 01:00:13,277
I was thinking of her daughter

868
01:00:13,444 --> 01:00:15,404
for the scene at the spring.

869
01:00:15,529 --> 01:00:17,448
If that doesn't work out...

870
01:00:17,615 --> 01:00:20,034
I have an idea involving Hossein.

871
01:00:20,618 --> 01:00:22,620
What do you say, Hossein?

872
01:00:24,288 --> 01:00:26,290
She doesn't interest me.

873
01:00:26,832 --> 01:00:29,460
Why? She's a pretty girl.

874
01:00:31,462 --> 01:00:34,298
She may be pretty...

875
01:00:34,465 --> 01:00:36,133
but she's illiterate.

876
01:00:36,300 --> 01:00:39,011
- How do you know?
- They're peasants.

877
01:00:39,136 --> 01:00:41,055
They've had no education.

878
01:00:41,180 --> 01:00:45,559
When I get married and have kids,

879
01:00:45,684 --> 01:00:48,312
if my wife is illiterate like me,

880
01:00:48,646 --> 01:00:51,565
who'll help the children
with their homework?

881
01:00:51,690 --> 01:00:53,234
I see.

882
01:00:53,359 --> 01:00:57,822
Maybe you two would get along better,
since you're illiterate too.

883
01:00:57,947 --> 01:01:00,699
I don't know how to read,

884
01:01:00,825 --> 01:01:03,536
so I have to find
someone who's educated,

885
01:01:03,994 --> 01:01:07,540
and sociable too,
who can read and write,

886
01:01:07,665 --> 01:01:10,167
so that one of us

887
01:01:10,876 --> 01:01:14,171
can help the children

888
01:01:14,338 --> 01:01:16,841
with their homework and tests.

889
01:01:17,550 --> 01:01:20,177
If we're both illiterate...

890
01:01:20,678 --> 01:01:22,513
it would never work.

891
01:01:22,763 --> 01:01:27,351
So you don't want her
because she's illiterate.

892
01:01:30,354 --> 01:01:34,191
But that's the same reason
Tahereh doesn't want you.

893
01:01:34,358 --> 01:01:37,027
That's what's eating you, isn't it?

894
01:01:38,445 --> 01:01:40,447
There's nothing eating me.

895
01:01:40,573 --> 01:01:43,492
Yes, there is. Just a bit.

896
01:01:44,535 --> 01:01:46,245
I think...

897
01:01:47,955 --> 01:01:52,877
if homeowners married homeowners,
the rich married the rich...

898
01:01:54,128 --> 01:01:57,840
and the illiterate married the illiterate,
nothing would work.

899
01:01:58,716 --> 01:02:00,467
Much better

900
01:02:00,593 --> 01:02:03,262
if the literate marry the illiterate...

901
01:02:04,305 --> 01:02:06,932
the rich marry the poor...

902
01:02:09,393 --> 01:02:12,271
and those with houses
marry those without.

903
01:02:12,646 --> 01:02:16,567
That way they can all
help each other out.

904
01:02:16,734 --> 01:02:19,028
If two people marry

905
01:02:19,278 --> 01:02:21,739
and end up with two houses,

906
01:02:21,906 --> 01:02:25,826
they can't live with their heads in one
and their feet in the other.

907
01:02:26,285 --> 01:02:28,746
Right? Can they?

908
01:02:29,413 --> 01:02:32,082
Of course not.

909
01:02:33,083 --> 01:02:35,753
But they can live in one

910
01:02:35,878 --> 01:02:38,255
and rent out the other, right?

911
01:02:39,423 --> 01:02:40,799
Right?

912
01:02:43,427 --> 01:02:46,055
Yes, you're right.

913
01:03:11,538 --> 01:03:13,248
Tahereh?

914
01:03:14,500 --> 01:03:16,126
Miss Tahereh?

915
01:03:20,214 --> 01:03:21,882
Grandmother?

916
01:03:59,628 --> 01:04:01,964
Good morning.

917
01:04:02,339 --> 01:04:03,966
Good morning, Tahereh.

918
01:04:07,469 --> 01:04:09,763
Scene 14, shot 1, take 1.

919
01:04:10,973 --> 01:04:11,807
Action!

920
01:04:11,932 --> 01:04:13,517
Tahereh!

921
01:04:14,018 --> 01:04:16,979
Where did you put
my white socks?

922
01:04:17,104 --> 01:04:18,772
Look with your other clothes.

923
01:04:18,897 --> 01:04:21,358
I looked. They're not there.

924
01:04:21,942 --> 01:04:23,652
Maybe on the shelf.

925
01:04:24,153 --> 01:04:25,779
They're not there either.

926
01:04:25,946 --> 01:04:28,615
I never know
where you put my things!

927
01:04:29,283 --> 01:04:31,702
You must have left them
in your shoes.

928
01:04:32,327 --> 01:04:33,996
<i>I'll take a look...</i>

929
01:04:34,121 --> 01:04:37,541
but I know they're not there.

930
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,252
But if you say so, fine.

931
01:04:40,627 --> 01:04:42,463
<i>I'll</i> look in my shoes.

932
01:04:46,675 --> 01:04:49,344
They're here.
My white socks are here.

933
01:04:51,221 --> 01:04:53,390
You seem like newlyweds.

934
01:04:54,058 --> 01:04:55,225
We are.

935
01:04:55,392 --> 01:04:57,978
- How long has it been?
- Five days.

936
01:04:58,103 --> 01:05:00,105
Five days or five months?

937
01:05:00,773 --> 01:05:02,316
Five days.

938
01:05:02,858 --> 01:05:05,694
- The night of the earthquake?
- No...

939
01:05:05,819 --> 01:05:07,237
the next day.

940
01:05:07,362 --> 01:05:08,697
<i>Cut.</i>

941
01:05:08,822 --> 01:05:11,700
Hossein, don't look down.

942
01:05:11,909 --> 01:05:13,952
Look up when you talk.

943
01:05:14,369 --> 01:05:15,954
Again.

944
01:05:16,747 --> 01:05:18,916
Sound ready?

945
01:05:19,208 --> 01:05:20,375
Rolling.

946
01:05:20,501 --> 01:05:21,960
Camera.

947
01:05:22,086 --> 01:05:23,921
Scene 14, shot 1, take 2.

948
01:05:24,088 --> 01:05:25,214
Action!

949
01:05:25,589 --> 01:05:28,383
Tahereh, where did you put
my white socks?

950
01:05:28,509 --> 01:05:30,719
Look with your other clothes.

951
01:05:30,928 --> 01:05:35,307
I looked. They're not there.

952
01:05:36,266 --> 01:05:37,976
Maybe on the shelf.

953
01:05:38,102 --> 01:05:39,478
I looked.

954
01:05:39,603 --> 01:05:42,064
I never know
where you put my things!

955
01:05:42,189 --> 01:05:44,191
You must have left them
in your shoes.

956
01:05:44,316 --> 01:05:46,276
I know they're not there.

957
01:05:46,401 --> 01:05:48,654
But if you say so, fine.

958
01:05:48,779 --> 01:05:52,241
I'll look in my shoes,
but I know they're not there.

959
01:05:57,996 --> 01:06:00,457
They're here.
They were in my shoes.

960
01:06:00,874 --> 01:06:02,876
You seem like newlyweds.

961
01:06:03,752 --> 01:06:04,920
We are.

962
01:06:05,420 --> 01:06:06,964
How long has it been?

963
01:06:07,214 --> 01:06:08,632
Five days.

964
01:06:09,758 --> 01:06:11,677
Five days or five months?

965
01:06:11,802 --> 01:06:13,345
Five days.

966
01:06:14,471 --> 01:06:16,348
The night of the earthquake?

967
01:06:16,473 --> 01:06:18,392
No, the next day.

968
01:06:18,642 --> 01:06:20,018
Hey!

969
01:06:20,894 --> 01:06:22,437
What's going on?

970
01:06:22,563 --> 01:06:24,398
Hey, don't pour water down here!

971
01:06:24,523 --> 01:06:26,859
- I was watering the flowers.
- Watering?

972
01:06:26,984 --> 01:06:29,820
Look to see
if anyone's down here first!

973
01:06:29,945 --> 01:06:30,946
Fine.

974
01:06:31,071 --> 01:06:33,073
I'm not saying don't water.

975
01:06:33,198 --> 01:06:35,742
Just look down below first!

976
01:06:35,951 --> 01:06:37,161
Sorry.

977
01:06:37,286 --> 01:06:40,873
With roofs caving in
on people's heads,

978
01:06:41,165 --> 01:06:44,376
a little water
falling on mine is nothing.

979
01:06:44,751 --> 01:06:46,378
Don't yell at her.

980
01:06:47,921 --> 01:06:52,134
There can't have been
many victims in your family

981
01:06:52,509 --> 01:06:55,679
if you married the next day.

982
01:06:55,971 --> 01:06:59,141
Sure there were:
cousins, aunts, uncles.

983
01:06:59,349 --> 01:07:03,353
All told,
it must have been be 25 dead -

984
01:07:03,687 --> 01:07:06,315
Cut. It's 65.

985
01:07:06,440 --> 01:07:08,400
No, sir, I lost 25 people.

986
01:07:08,525 --> 01:07:10,694
No, it's 65. Once again.

987
01:07:10,861 --> 01:07:12,404
Hossein, get ready.

988
01:07:12,529 --> 01:07:14,198
Just a second.

989
01:07:14,364 --> 01:07:16,742
Ahmad, go sit over there.

990
01:07:16,867 --> 01:07:18,535
Hurry.

991
01:07:19,494 --> 01:07:22,414
- Ready?
- Yes.

992
01:07:22,539 --> 01:07:23,999
Hurry!

993
01:07:24,124 --> 01:07:25,792
Are we ready?

994
01:07:25,918 --> 01:07:27,336
Hossein, ready?

995
01:07:27,461 --> 01:07:30,714
Hold on.
The sun's gone behind the clouds.

996
01:07:31,381 --> 01:07:33,634
Wait four minutes. Maybe less.

997
01:07:39,014 --> 01:07:42,392
While we're waiting,
could you listen to this?

998
01:07:42,684 --> 01:07:46,396
There's some kind of noise.
Does it bother you?

999
01:07:46,980 --> 01:07:49,816
Let me listen.

1000
01:07:49,942 --> 01:07:51,902
We have a little problem.

1001
01:07:52,069 --> 01:07:55,280
Do you want a close-up?

1002
01:07:55,656 --> 01:07:58,116
Wait, I'm listening to the sound.

1003
01:08:09,753 --> 01:08:11,380
Tahereh...

1004
01:08:11,505 --> 01:08:14,466
when I ask about the socks,

1005
01:08:14,758 --> 01:08:17,469
don't think that's how I really am.

1006
01:08:17,594 --> 01:08:20,973
That's what the director
told me to say.

1007
01:08:21,265 --> 01:08:24,601
I'm not the kind to keep asking...

1008
01:08:25,811 --> 01:08:29,690
“Where are my socks?”

1009
01:08:29,815 --> 01:08:31,817
If I get married...

1010
01:08:32,234 --> 01:08:36,989
<i>I'll</i> have enough sense to put away
my own socks and clothes

1011
01:08:37,572 --> 01:08:40,450
and all my other things.

1012
01:08:40,701 --> 01:08:44,746
I want to get married
simply to be happy,

1013
01:08:45,205 --> 01:08:47,666
not to find someone to cook for me

1014
01:08:47,791 --> 01:08:50,544
or take care of my clothes.

1015
01:08:51,461 --> 01:08:56,091
I'd like you to continue
your studies while I work.

1016
01:08:56,216 --> 01:08:59,594
I can easily eat at the bazaar.

1017
01:09:00,220 --> 01:09:05,142
The only thing I want...

1018
01:09:06,184 --> 01:09:08,061
is your happiness.

1019
01:09:08,186 --> 01:09:10,272
I want to make you happy.

1020
01:09:13,817 --> 01:09:15,819
What does your heart say?

1021
01:09:15,944 --> 01:09:19,072
Are you with me or not?

1022
01:09:19,197 --> 01:09:21,241
Scene 14, shot 1, take 3.

1023
01:09:21,533 --> 01:09:23,160
Action!

1024
01:09:26,246 --> 01:09:29,666
Why doesn't he start?
Hossein, why don't you start?

1025
01:09:29,791 --> 01:09:31,626
Tahereh!

1026
01:09:32,044 --> 01:09:33,962
Where are my socks?

1027
01:09:34,087 --> 01:09:35,839
Look with your other clothes.

1028
01:09:36,006 --> 01:09:37,632
I looked.

1029
01:09:37,841 --> 01:09:39,593
They're not there.

1030
01:09:40,594 --> 01:09:42,012
Maybe on the shelf.

1031
01:09:42,179 --> 01:09:44,222
They're not there either.

1032
01:09:44,348 --> 01:09:47,934
I never know
where you put my things!

1033
01:09:48,852 --> 01:09:50,228
Look in your shoes.

1034
01:09:50,354 --> 01:09:52,773
They're not there either,

1035
01:09:52,898 --> 01:09:56,026
but if you say so, fine.

1036
01:09:57,361 --> 01:10:00,072
<i>I'll</i> have a look.

1037
01:10:00,364 --> 01:10:02,240
If you say so, fine.

1038
01:10:04,493 --> 01:10:07,037
Here they are, with my shoes!

1039
01:10:08,914 --> 01:10:11,083
You seem like newlyweds.

1040
01:10:11,416 --> 01:10:12,793
We are.

1041
01:10:12,918 --> 01:10:14,503
How long has it been?

1042
01:10:14,795 --> 01:10:16,296
Five days.

1043
01:10:16,755 --> 01:10:18,799
Five days or five months?

1044
01:10:18,924 --> 01:10:20,467
Five days.

1045
01:10:23,470 --> 01:10:25,430
The night of the earthquake?

1046
01:10:25,555 --> 01:10:27,724
No, the next day.

1047
01:10:32,020 --> 01:10:33,939
Don't pour water down here!

1048
01:10:34,064 --> 01:10:35,774
Sorry, I was watering.

1049
01:10:35,899 --> 01:10:37,359
That's fine...

1050
01:10:37,484 --> 01:10:40,779
but check to see
if anyone's down here first!

1051
01:10:40,987 --> 01:10:42,989
- Sorry.
- It's all right.

1052
01:10:43,532 --> 01:10:45,826
With roofs caving in
on people's heads,

1053
01:10:45,951 --> 01:10:48,954
a little water
falling on mine is nothing.

1054
01:10:52,124 --> 01:10:53,667
Tell me...

1055
01:10:54,209 --> 01:10:56,795
there can't have been
many victims in your family

1056
01:10:56,920 --> 01:10:58,630
if you married the next day.

1057
01:10:59,089 --> 01:11:02,551
Sure there were:
cousins, aunts, uncles.

1058
01:11:02,676 --> 01:11:06,138
All told,
it must have been 25 dead.

1059
01:11:07,389 --> 01:11:09,724
<i>Not 25. 65.</i>

1060
01:11:10,058 --> 01:11:12,978
You have to say 65.
- 65?

1061
01:11:13,311 --> 01:11:16,356
But I swear I only lost 25!

1062
01:11:16,606 --> 01:11:18,275
Say 65 anyway.

1063
01:11:19,609 --> 01:11:22,988
- We have to change film.
- Hossein, go back upstairs.

1064
01:11:24,489 --> 01:11:27,617
Esmail, undo the ropes.
Let's put the canvas away.

1065
01:11:28,034 --> 01:11:29,870
We need shadow there.

1066
01:11:42,966 --> 01:11:45,635
Mrs. Shiva,
could I have some paper?

1067
01:11:47,721 --> 01:11:49,723
Whose pen is this?

1068
01:11:58,857 --> 01:12:02,903
Tahereh, you and I
haven't even had

1069
01:12:03,028 --> 01:12:06,406
a chance to talk yet.

1070
01:12:06,531 --> 01:12:09,326
I've only spoken
to your late mother

1071
01:12:09,451 --> 01:12:11,495
and your grandmother.

1072
01:12:12,954 --> 01:12:16,458
But old people don't understand
what the young feel.

1073
01:12:16,583 --> 01:12:19,336
They've forgotten their own youth.

1074
01:12:20,378 --> 01:12:23,840
I want to know if your heart...

1075
01:12:24,466 --> 01:12:26,676
is with me or not.

1076
01:12:30,013 --> 01:12:31,681
That's right...

1077
01:12:33,433 --> 01:12:36,520
read your book
and pay no attention to them.

1078
01:12:36,645 --> 01:12:38,480
They're busy.

1079
01:12:38,605 --> 01:12:41,149
They're paying no attention to us.

1080
01:12:41,274 --> 01:12:44,444
If you're too shy
to say yes to me,

1081
01:12:44,653 --> 01:12:46,905
turn the page in your book.

1082
01:12:47,030 --> 01:12:49,282
That will be my answer.

1083
01:12:57,332 --> 01:13:00,210
I think the real problem
is the house.

1084
01:13:01,545 --> 01:13:05,215
<i>I'll</i> go talk to the owner

1085
01:13:06,007 --> 01:13:08,385
about us living here.

1086
01:13:09,052 --> 01:13:11,388
It doesn't need a lot of work.

1087
01:13:11,555 --> 01:13:14,391
We'll be happy here,

1088
01:13:14,558 --> 01:13:17,644
because it will bring us luck.

1089
01:13:18,061 --> 01:13:20,188
Since we've been here,

1090
01:13:20,313 --> 01:13:22,566
flowers have grown up inside,

1091
01:13:22,816 --> 01:13:25,944
flowers to wish us welcome.

1092
01:13:26,861 --> 01:13:29,823
We don't need
that plaster anymore!

1093
01:13:29,948 --> 01:13:31,950
It's not ours.

1094
01:13:32,242 --> 01:13:34,160
Just set it aside.

1095
01:13:36,246 --> 01:13:39,416
<i>I'll</i> ask them
for some of that plaster

1096
01:13:39,541 --> 01:13:42,127
and buy two more sacks.

1097
01:13:42,335 --> 01:13:45,922
I can make this a beautiful house.

1098
01:13:46,298 --> 01:13:48,633
<i>I'll</i> put in a window over there.

1099
01:13:48,758 --> 01:13:51,094
When you wake up in the morning,

1100
01:13:51,261 --> 01:13:53,471
you can open it

1101
01:13:53,888 --> 01:13:56,266
and look out at the mountains.

1102
01:13:56,433 --> 01:13:58,476
It will lift your spirits.

1103
01:13:58,768 --> 01:14:02,397
I swore I'd never do
masonry work again.

1104
01:14:02,522 --> 01:14:05,358
If I do, it will be just for you.

1105
01:14:05,483 --> 01:14:09,195
But I want to know
if your heart is with me.

1106
01:14:10,447 --> 01:14:12,699
Don't worry about the others.

1107
01:14:13,491 --> 01:14:17,454
If you turn a page in your book,

1108
01:14:17,579 --> 01:14:19,456
<i>I'll</i> have my answer.

1109
01:14:29,716 --> 01:14:32,469
Mr. Jafarian, let's start.
Ready?

1110
01:14:32,927 --> 01:14:34,846
Sound?
- Rolling.

1111
01:14:34,971 --> 01:14:36,556
Camera?

1112
01:14:37,390 --> 01:14:39,225
Scene 14, shot 1, take 4.

1113
01:14:39,351 --> 01:14:41,144
Action!

1114
01:14:42,771 --> 01:14:44,814
- Hossein!
- Yes.

1115
01:14:44,939 --> 01:14:48,443
Why don't you speak?
You awake up there? Go on!

1116
01:14:48,735 --> 01:14:50,278
Tahereh!

1117
01:14:51,279 --> 01:14:52,656
Where are my white socks?

1118
01:14:52,989 --> 01:14:55,158
Look with your other clothes.

1119
01:14:55,950 --> 01:14:58,536
I looked. They're not there.

1120
01:14:59,621 --> 01:15:01,122
Maybe on the shelf.

1121
01:15:01,247 --> 01:15:02,707
They're not there.

1122
01:15:02,916 --> 01:15:05,752
I never know
where you put my things!

1123
01:15:06,378 --> 01:15:08,338
You must have left them
in your shoes.

1124
01:15:08,463 --> 01:15:10,298
I don't think so.

1125
01:15:10,423 --> 01:15:12,842
But if you say so, fine.

1126
01:15:13,259 --> 01:15:16,262
<i>I'll</i> look in my shoes.

1127
01:15:18,890 --> 01:15:21,017
They're in my shoes!

1128
01:15:23,478 --> 01:15:26,022
You seem like newlyweds.

1129
01:15:26,272 --> 01:15:27,524
We are.

1130
01:15:27,649 --> 01:15:29,275
How long has it been?

1131
01:15:29,401 --> 01:15:30,819
Five days.

1132
01:15:31,319 --> 01:15:33,071
Five days or five months?

1133
01:15:33,196 --> 01:15:34,698
Five days.

1134
01:15:35,615 --> 01:15:37,575
The night of the earthquake?

1135
01:15:37,701 --> 01:15:39,160
No...

1136
01:15:39,285 --> 01:15:41,413
the next day.

1137
01:15:45,583 --> 01:15:47,460
Don't pour water down here!

1138
01:15:47,585 --> 01:15:49,212
I was watering the flowers.

1139
01:15:49,337 --> 01:15:52,966
You can water,
but check down below first!

1140
01:15:53,258 --> 01:15:54,968
All right. Sorry.

1141
01:15:55,093 --> 01:15:56,678
Don't yell at her.

1142
01:15:56,803 --> 01:15:59,597
With roofs caving in
on people's heads,

1143
01:15:59,723 --> 01:16:02,851
a little water
falling on mine is nothing.

1144
01:16:04,936 --> 01:16:08,064
But there can't have been
many victims in your family

1145
01:16:08,189 --> 01:16:11,234
if you married the next day.

1146
01:16:11,401 --> 01:16:15,613
Sure there were:
cousins, aunts, uncles.

1147
01:16:15,739 --> 01:16:17,782
All told, I lost 65 relatives.

1148
01:16:17,907 --> 01:16:20,618
I thought if I waited
for the elders' approval,

1149
01:16:20,744 --> 01:16:22,996
one would say to wait...

1150
01:16:24,247 --> 01:16:27,667
until the third day of mourning,
another the seventh day,

1151
01:16:27,792 --> 01:16:29,252
another the 40th,

1152
01:16:29,377 --> 01:16:32,005
or even to wait a whole year.

1153
01:16:32,130 --> 01:16:35,592
We figured
we'd be waiting a long time!

1154
01:16:35,759 --> 01:16:39,179
So we decided to get married
and come here

1155
01:16:39,304 --> 01:16:41,806
and get it over and done with!

1156
01:16:42,140 --> 01:16:43,933
- You brought her here?
- Yes.

1157
01:16:44,100 --> 01:16:45,643
No, not here.

1158
01:16:45,769 --> 01:16:47,771
We've been here three days.

1159
01:16:47,937 --> 01:16:50,732
At first we lived under plastic.

1160
01:16:50,857 --> 01:16:53,109
Under plastic?

1161
01:16:53,234 --> 01:16:54,652
What do you mean?

1162
01:16:54,778 --> 01:16:58,406
I'd bought 20 yards of plastic
for the rice fields.

1163
01:16:58,531 --> 01:17:00,742
But I put it to a different use.

1164
01:17:00,867 --> 01:17:03,369
I stuck four stakes in the ground

1165
01:17:03,495 --> 01:17:06,080
and laid the plastic on top,

1166
01:17:06,206 --> 01:17:08,458
and we moved in beneath it.

1167
01:17:08,583 --> 01:17:11,044
- That was your nuptial chamber.
- Yes.

1168
01:17:13,630 --> 01:17:16,049
Then what did you do?

1169
01:17:17,300 --> 01:17:19,469
What did you do for food?

1170
01:17:19,636 --> 01:17:22,430
We had no plates or utensils.

1171
01:17:22,555 --> 01:17:24,641
We thought we'd go look

1172
01:17:24,766 --> 01:17:27,143
where I'd been living before.

1173
01:17:27,310 --> 01:17:30,730
To see if we could find anything.

1174
01:17:30,897 --> 01:17:33,191
We looked through the rubble,

1175
01:17:33,525 --> 01:17:37,278
and we found a pot,
a plate, and two spoons.

1176
01:17:37,403 --> 01:17:39,697
We washed them...

1177
01:17:39,864 --> 01:17:42,909
and brought them back
to our plastic shelter.

1178
01:17:43,034 --> 01:17:45,203
Then I went to the bazaar

1179
01:17:45,328 --> 01:17:48,998
to see if I could find
something to eat.

1180
01:17:49,290 --> 01:17:51,876
I saw two trucks
from rescue services

1181
01:17:52,043 --> 01:17:55,338
parked alongside the highway.

1182
01:17:55,505 --> 01:17:58,967
One was giving out tents
and the other tomatoes.

1183
01:17:59,384 --> 01:18:01,719
We were too late for the tents,

1184
01:18:01,845 --> 01:18:04,889
but we managed to get
a few tomatoes.

1185
01:18:05,306 --> 01:18:07,308
I washed them.

1186
01:18:08,434 --> 01:18:10,728
I made a wooden skewer

1187
01:18:11,187 --> 01:18:14,148
and grilled the tomatoes on it
like kabob,

1188
01:18:14,274 --> 01:18:16,276
and we ate that.

1189
01:18:16,568 --> 01:18:18,862
- Your wedding banquet?
- Right.

1190
01:18:19,237 --> 01:18:20,572
<i>Cut.</i>

1191
01:18:21,030 --> 01:18:23,032
That was good. We're done.

1192
01:18:23,533 --> 01:18:25,368
Thanks, everyone.

1193
01:18:25,493 --> 01:18:28,538
Hossein,
would you bring us some tea?

1194
01:18:45,680 --> 01:18:47,599
- Ma'am?
- No, thank you.

1195
01:20:41,671 --> 01:20:43,506
This is how it'll be.

1196
01:20:44,799 --> 01:20:47,760
Sometimes <i>I'll</i> serve the tea...

1197
01:20:48,594 --> 01:20:51,055
and sometimes you will.

1198
01:20:53,474 --> 01:20:55,685
That's how I see married life.

1199
01:20:58,146 --> 01:20:59,939
That's what life is about.

1200
01:21:00,440 --> 01:21:02,233
- Hossein!
- Yes?

1201
01:21:03,317 --> 01:21:05,111
Mr. Nazari?

1202
01:21:07,572 --> 01:21:11,743
Plant one of the plants here.
They're too dry.

1203
01:21:22,920 --> 01:21:25,882
Hossein, grab a pick and help us.

1204
01:21:26,049 --> 01:21:28,676
Hossein's tired. Let him rest.

1205
01:21:29,802 --> 01:21:34,432
Mr. Hossein won't dirty his hands
with picks and bricks.

1206
01:21:35,683 --> 01:21:39,103
If he won't, we shouldn't either.

1207
01:21:39,395 --> 01:21:42,106
He's decided
not to do masonry anymore.

1208
01:21:42,356 --> 01:21:44,233
Mrs. Shiva is right.

1209
01:21:44,525 --> 01:21:47,445
I swore I'd never do
that work again.

1210
01:21:47,779 --> 01:21:51,741
If I ever do,
it will be just for you.

1211
01:21:51,866 --> 01:21:54,911
The pay isn't bad these days.

1212
01:21:55,078 --> 01:21:57,747
I could make 1,500 <i>roman</i> a day,

1213
01:21:57,872 --> 01:22:00,083
more than doctors or engineers.

1214
01:22:00,541 --> 01:22:04,003
That's 45,000 <i>roman</i> a month.

1215
01:22:04,128 --> 01:22:07,840
We could set aside 10,000
for expenses and tuition

1216
01:22:07,965 --> 01:22:10,301
and transportation and -

1217
01:22:10,426 --> 01:22:12,053
- Hossein?
- Yes.

1218
01:22:12,178 --> 01:22:14,055
- Where are you?
- Up here.

1219
01:22:14,180 --> 01:22:16,349
- Where's your jacket?
- Downstairs.

1220
01:22:16,474 --> 01:22:19,393
- Go put it on. Hurry!
- Okay.

1221
01:22:20,895 --> 01:22:22,396
Ready, ma'am?

1222
01:22:22,522 --> 01:22:24,440
- Sound?
- Rolling.

1223
01:22:24,732 --> 01:22:25,942
Camera.

1224
01:22:26,067 --> 01:22:29,112
- Scene 14, shot 2, take 1.
- Action!

1225
01:22:34,867 --> 01:22:38,079
Did those who died know
what was coming?

1226
01:22:38,204 --> 01:22:41,791
As long as we're still alive,
we have to start a family.

1227
01:22:42,083 --> 01:22:44,752
The next quake might kill us too.

1228
01:22:45,253 --> 01:22:47,463
Am I wrong?
- No.

1229
01:22:50,299 --> 01:22:52,093
Look, you forgot this.

1230
01:22:56,848 --> 01:22:57,723
Cut!

1231
01:22:58,224 --> 01:23:00,893
Why “look”?
Doesn't he have a name?

1232
01:23:01,102 --> 01:23:02,562
“Mr. Hossein.”

1233
01:23:02,687 --> 01:23:05,356
“Mr. Hossein, you forgot this.”
That's all.

1234
01:23:05,982 --> 01:23:07,108
Again.

1235
01:23:07,692 --> 01:23:09,235
Scene 14, shot 2, take 2.

1236
01:23:09,527 --> 01:23:10,778
Action!

1237
01:23:11,237 --> 01:23:13,990
Did those who died know
what was coming?

1238
01:23:14,157 --> 01:23:17,660
As long as we're still alive,
we have to start a family.

1239
01:23:17,785 --> 01:23:20,496
The next quake might kill us too.

1240
01:23:20,955 --> 01:23:22,415
Am I wrong?

1241
01:23:22,540 --> 01:23:24,125
No, you're right.

1242
01:23:25,084 --> 01:23:27,837
Hossein, you forgot this.

1243
01:23:29,589 --> 01:23:32,258
Farhad,
he hasn't extended his hand.

1244
01:23:32,383 --> 01:23:34,218
Why hold out yours?

1245
01:23:34,844 --> 01:23:37,889
Miss Tahereh, it's “Mr. Hossein.”

1246
01:23:38,556 --> 01:23:39,932
Once again.

1247
01:23:40,600 --> 01:23:43,144
Ready? Sound?

1248
01:23:44,061 --> 01:23:45,855
- Rolling.
- Camera.

1249
01:23:46,689 --> 01:23:48,149
Shot 2, take 3.

1250
01:23:48,649 --> 01:23:49,609
Action!

1251
01:23:49,734 --> 01:23:52,653
Did those who died know
what was coming?

1252
01:23:52,778 --> 01:23:56,407
As long as we're still alive,
we have to start a family.

1253
01:23:56,532 --> 01:23:59,285
The next quake might kill us too.

1254
01:24:00,119 --> 01:24:02,205
- Am I wrong?
- No, you're right.

1255
01:24:03,956 --> 01:24:05,583
Hossein, you forgot this.

1256
01:24:06,125 --> 01:24:07,251
<i>Cut.</i>

1257
01:24:07,376 --> 01:24:09,712
You have to say “Mr. Hossein.”

1258
01:24:09,879 --> 01:24:12,340
How many times must I tell you?

1259
01:24:13,049 --> 01:24:14,175
Take 4.

1260
01:24:15,092 --> 01:24:17,970
Did those who died know
what was coming?

1261
01:24:18,554 --> 01:24:22,016
As long as we're still alive,
we have to start a family.

1262
01:24:22,225 --> 01:24:24,769
The next quake might kill us too.

1263
01:24:25,686 --> 01:24:28,105
Am I wrong?
- No, you're right.

1264
01:24:30,942 --> 01:24:32,401
Hossein, you forgot this.

1265
01:24:32,568 --> 01:24:33,736
Cut!

1266
01:24:33,903 --> 01:24:35,863
Tahereh, you said “Hossein” again.

1267
01:24:35,988 --> 01:24:39,158
I told you:
You have to say “Mr. Hossein.”

1268
01:24:39,909 --> 01:24:40,910
Take 5.

1269
01:24:42,078 --> 01:24:44,914
Did those who died know
what was coming?

1270
01:24:45,081 --> 01:24:48,751
As long as we're still alive,
we have to start a family.

1271
01:24:49,669 --> 01:24:51,796
The next quake might kill us too.

1272
01:24:51,921 --> 01:24:54,298
Am I wrong?
- No, you're right.

1273
01:24:55,424 --> 01:24:56,968
Hossein, you forgot this.

1274
01:25:04,100 --> 01:25:05,393
Cut!

1275
01:25:08,854 --> 01:25:10,773
She still didn't say it.

1276
01:25:16,028 --> 01:25:18,155
Excuse me, sir.

1277
01:25:18,281 --> 01:25:20,283
Some women around here

1278
01:25:20,408 --> 01:25:23,744
no longer address
their husbands with “Mister.”

1279
01:25:24,453 --> 01:25:28,624
If Miss Tahereh
doesn't call me “Mister,”

1280
01:25:29,166 --> 01:25:33,087
I don't think it will seem
implausible in the film.

1281
01:25:33,879 --> 01:25:36,590
No, it won't seem implausible.

1282
01:25:36,716 --> 01:25:38,092
- Once again?
- No.

1283
01:25:38,217 --> 01:25:39,969
- It's a wrap?
- Yes.

1284
01:25:40,094 --> 01:25:43,264
Thanks, guys.
Let's pack everything up.

1285
01:25:43,389 --> 01:25:45,308
Thank you, Mr. Jafarian.

1286
01:25:46,392 --> 01:25:49,729
Hossein, put the glasses in the truck.
It's getting late.

1287
01:25:50,438 --> 01:25:52,606
Tahereh, get your book.
We're done.

1288
01:25:52,732 --> 01:25:54,942
- I'm all done?
- Yes.

1289
01:25:55,067 --> 01:25:57,320
You won't say your lines properly.

1290
01:25:57,903 --> 01:26:00,323
Where are the Ahmadpour boys?

1291
01:26:00,990 --> 01:26:02,199
Right here!

1292
01:26:02,325 --> 01:26:05,619
Find your flowerpots
and put them in the truck.

1293
01:26:05,745 --> 01:26:08,539
Tahereh, take yours too.

1294
01:26:12,084 --> 01:26:15,212
You know which it is?
Don't take someone else's.

1295
01:26:16,088 --> 01:26:18,883
Boys, go get your flowerpots.

1296
01:26:19,550 --> 01:26:22,303
Wait. Let Tahereh come down first.

1297
01:26:24,055 --> 01:26:25,848
Put them in back.

1298
01:26:26,515 --> 01:26:28,017
We're leaving now.

1299
01:26:28,517 --> 01:26:30,686
Hurry, boys.

1300
01:26:34,231 --> 01:26:36,359
You know which is yours?

1301
01:26:37,276 --> 01:26:39,111
How many did you have, Babak?

1302
01:26:39,653 --> 01:26:42,365
- Two.
- Don't dawdle!

1303
01:26:42,531 --> 01:26:44,533
Mine had two red flowers.

1304
01:26:44,700 --> 01:26:47,203
Well, look for it, but hurry!

1305
01:26:47,661 --> 01:26:49,455
Isn't it that one?

1306
01:26:49,580 --> 01:26:52,333
Yes, it's the one on the end.

1307
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:55,378
Careful you don't break the stern.

1308
01:26:59,715 --> 01:27:03,135
Put them in back,
and don't break the stems.

1309
01:27:06,722 --> 01:27:08,432
Where's Mr. Nazari?

1310
01:27:13,729 --> 01:27:16,982
Is the minibus here yet?
- It's coming back.

1311
01:27:17,900 --> 01:27:21,153
Tahereh,
put that in back and get in.

1312
01:27:37,420 --> 01:27:41,090
Hossein, change your shoes,
then put the flowerpots away.

1313
01:27:41,257 --> 01:27:42,675
All right.

1314
01:27:43,676 --> 01:27:46,637
Move that rock there.
That's good.

1315
01:27:46,804 --> 01:27:49,598
Leave it there.

1316
01:27:51,976 --> 01:27:54,895
Hossein,
would you untie the ropes?

1317
01:27:55,020 --> 01:27:57,022
We're putting the canvas away.

1318
01:27:57,398 --> 01:27:58,774
All right.

1319
01:27:58,899 --> 01:28:01,318
Could you serve us some tea?

1320
01:28:02,528 --> 01:28:04,405
I just served tea.

1321
01:28:04,530 --> 01:28:06,991
Reza drank mine.

1322
01:28:09,243 --> 01:28:12,455
Guys, Hossein's tired.
Leave him alone.

1323
01:28:13,080 --> 01:28:17,293
Hossein, put the glasses
in the truck and get in.

1324
01:28:18,502 --> 01:28:21,589
Mr. Karimi,
don't put that in the truck.

1325
01:28:21,714 --> 01:28:25,384
Wait for the minibus.
The truck's full.

1326
01:28:25,509 --> 01:28:29,555
- There won't be room.
- What do we do, Mr. Panahi?

1327
01:28:29,680 --> 01:28:33,100
Let the children go in the truck.
The minibus will come soon.

1328
01:28:33,225 --> 01:28:36,145
Hossein, don't put those
in the truck yet.

1329
01:28:36,312 --> 01:28:39,023
We have to be organized
and professional.

1330
01:28:39,231 --> 01:28:41,609
Three people can take the minibus

1331
01:28:41,734 --> 01:28:43,486
with the flowerpots in their laps.

1332
01:28:43,652 --> 01:28:45,696
How can we carry all this stuff?

1333
01:28:45,821 --> 01:28:48,157
You don't have that much.

1334
01:28:48,282 --> 01:28:51,619
- We have this platform.
- Why'd you bring that?

1335
01:28:51,869 --> 01:28:57,541
Why didn't you work
something out with Mr. Jafarian?

1336
01:28:57,666 --> 01:29:02,588
We couldn't predict the weather!

1337
01:29:02,713 --> 01:29:04,673
It's a clear day!

1338
01:29:04,798 --> 01:29:07,259
What if it had started raining?

1339
01:29:07,384 --> 01:29:09,678
What if it had rained?

1340
01:29:09,845 --> 01:29:12,139
Getting angry doesn't help.

1341
01:29:12,264 --> 01:29:14,517
We'll find a solution.

1342
01:29:15,518 --> 01:29:18,020
We're professionals.

1343
01:29:18,229 --> 01:29:20,439
We decide what to bring.

1344
01:29:22,024 --> 01:29:25,069
We use this instead of a ladder.

1345
01:29:25,194 --> 01:29:29,323
The children have exams.
We should get them back quickly.

1346
01:29:46,382 --> 01:29:49,552
Mrs. Shiva?

1347
01:29:54,265 --> 01:29:57,059
Mr. Panahi?

1348
01:29:57,226 --> 01:29:58,227
What?

1349
01:29:58,519 --> 01:30:01,021
She left.
- Who did?

1350
01:30:01,146 --> 01:30:03,023
Miss Tahereh.

1351
01:30:09,029 --> 01:30:11,991
Tahereh, we'll drive you back.
It's a long way.

1352
01:30:12,116 --> 01:30:14,577
Thanks. I know a shortcut.

1353
01:30:28,424 --> 01:30:31,594
Hossein, can't you see
we're squabbling over transportation?

1354
01:30:31,760 --> 01:30:34,597
You're young, you can walk.
Go on!

1355
01:31:21,644 --> 01:31:23,062
Tahereh!

1356
01:31:33,322 --> 01:31:34,740
Miss Tahereh.

1357
01:31:39,536 --> 01:31:41,997
I may not see you again.

1358
01:31:42,247 --> 01:31:45,709
If you're going to give me
an answer, do it now.

1359
01:31:46,001 --> 01:31:48,671
I may not see you again.

1360
01:31:48,837 --> 01:31:51,632
Don't listen to your grandmother.

1361
01:31:51,757 --> 01:31:55,719
All that old women
think about is rich men

1362
01:31:56,011 --> 01:31:58,347
with houses and factories.

1363
01:31:58,597 --> 01:32:02,685
That's all they think of.

1364
01:32:03,352 --> 01:32:07,940
But intelligence and understanding
are important too.

1365
01:32:08,315 --> 01:32:10,359
You have
no father or mother now.

1366
01:32:10,484 --> 01:32:12,486
You need a good husband,

1367
01:32:12,611 --> 01:32:15,114
not any old crook or burn.

1368
01:32:15,239 --> 01:32:17,324
I really want to live with you.

1369
01:32:17,449 --> 01:32:19,660
I'm not out to deceive you.

1370
01:32:19,785 --> 01:32:21,912
As God is my witness...

1371
01:32:22,496 --> 01:32:24,873
it's not just your beauty.

1372
01:32:25,040 --> 01:32:28,001
I want you to have
a place in life,

1373
01:32:28,127 --> 01:32:30,337
safe from worries.

1374
01:32:30,462 --> 01:32:32,548
Let's live life together,
hand in hand.

1375
01:32:32,673 --> 01:32:35,300
Whatever your answer is,
tell me now.

1376
01:32:35,801 --> 01:32:38,303
The good Lord gave you a tongue

1377
01:32:38,429 --> 01:32:41,098
to answer a man like me.

1378
01:32:47,146 --> 01:32:49,231
And if you don't want to answer,

1379
01:32:49,356 --> 01:32:51,400
I want an explanation

1380
01:32:51,525 --> 01:32:54,528
for that look
you gave me at the cemetery

1381
01:32:54,653 --> 01:32:57,614
that drew me to you
and made me pursue you

1382
01:32:57,740 --> 01:33:00,284
all this time to get an answer.

1383
01:33:00,409 --> 01:33:03,871
I want your answer,
not your grandmother's.

1384
01:33:03,996 --> 01:33:06,999
I never want to see
or speak to her again.

1385
01:33:07,124 --> 01:33:08,917
When she got married,

1386
01:33:09,084 --> 01:33:13,046
or when your parents got married -
God rest their souls -

1387
01:33:13,213 --> 01:33:15,382
did they have a house?

1388
01:33:15,716 --> 01:33:17,009
<i>No.</i>

1389
01:33:17,134 --> 01:33:20,512
So we'll work too.
We'll build our house too.

1390
01:33:20,637 --> 01:33:24,516
Your grandmother says without a house,
I won't find a wife.

1391
01:33:24,933 --> 01:33:28,729
But I'll work!
Bit by bit, I'll have a house too.

1392
01:33:28,854 --> 01:33:31,148
I'm as capable as anyone else.

1393
01:33:31,273 --> 01:33:33,901
We'll be so happy together

1394
01:33:34,026 --> 01:33:36,779
that other people will be jealous.

1395
01:33:37,154 --> 01:33:39,239
We're just as good as anyone else.

1396
01:33:39,364 --> 01:33:41,825
Who had a house around here?
Ask anyone!

1397
01:33:41,950 --> 01:33:45,704
Did they have a house
when they got married?

1398
01:33:46,246 --> 01:33:48,248
Even rich people

1399
01:33:48,373 --> 01:33:51,460
don't have a house
when they get married.

1400
01:33:52,085 --> 01:33:56,006
They move in with their parents
until they can buy one.

1401
01:33:56,131 --> 01:33:59,468
But those of us without parents
have no house either.

1402
01:33:59,635 --> 01:34:02,304
We have to work harder
for a house.

1403
01:34:02,471 --> 01:34:04,932
Like the director said:

1404
01:34:05,057 --> 01:34:07,267
Did those who died know
what was coming?

1405
01:34:07,392 --> 01:34:09,478
He must know!

1406
01:34:09,645 --> 01:34:12,189
He studied in Tehran.

1407
01:34:12,314 --> 01:34:14,775
That's a big city.

1408
01:34:15,567 --> 01:34:18,153
He knows what he's talking about.
Listen to him.

1409
01:34:18,320 --> 01:34:20,322
It's logical.

1410
01:34:20,489 --> 01:34:22,491
You have to admit it.

1411
01:34:22,658 --> 01:34:25,160
And even if you don't agree,

1412
01:34:25,494 --> 01:34:27,496
say something!

1413
01:34:28,038 --> 01:34:29,957
Give me an answer today.

1414
01:34:30,082 --> 01:34:33,377
Filming is over.
I won't see you again.

1415
01:34:33,502 --> 01:34:36,505
If you don't answer today,

1416
01:34:36,713 --> 01:34:40,217
I won't bother you anymore.
But give me your answer.

1417
01:34:40,425 --> 01:34:43,345
If you like me, say...
“Yes, I like you.”

1418
01:34:43,512 --> 01:34:45,472
And if you don't,

1419
01:34:45,597 --> 01:34:49,518
explain that look
you gave me at the cemetery.

1420
01:34:49,810 --> 01:34:52,771
It's the only reason
I've been pursuing you...

1421
01:34:53,188 --> 01:34:55,983
thinking maybe you like me

1422
01:34:56,108 --> 01:34:58,777
but that you're scared
of your grandmother.

1423
01:34:59,570 --> 01:35:02,030
There are girls
more beautiful than you...

1424
01:35:02,698 --> 01:35:04,825
girls better than you.

1425
01:35:04,950 --> 01:35:07,035
I could marry one, but I won't.

1426
01:35:07,160 --> 01:35:09,246
I want to marry you...

1427
01:35:09,872 --> 01:35:12,457
you who've lost father and mother.

1428
01:35:12,583 --> 01:35:14,793
Just give me your answer!

1429
01:35:17,129 --> 01:35:19,131
If you won't answer,

1430
01:35:19,256 --> 01:35:21,633
at least let me carry
the flowerpot.

1431
01:35:21,842 --> 01:35:26,013
If I'd known it was yours,
I'd have watered it.

1432
01:35:26,305 --> 01:35:29,016
I wouldn't have let
Mohammadi touch it.

1433
01:35:31,351 --> 01:35:34,730
Is your heart
made of stone or what?

1434
01:35:36,064 --> 01:35:38,150
Is your heart made of stone?

1435
01:36:04,760 --> 01:36:09,222
Are you only concerned
with how you'll look?

1436
01:36:09,348 --> 01:36:12,809
I'm doing this for you alone,
to give you a future.

1437
01:36:12,935 --> 01:36:14,937
Hossein can have plenty of women.

1438
01:36:15,145 --> 01:36:17,147
I can find one anywhere.

1439
01:36:25,322 --> 01:36:28,158
Tahereh,
for God's sake, answer me!

1440
01:36:28,283 --> 01:36:30,494
If anyone saw us together,

1441
01:36:30,619 --> 01:36:33,330
they'd think
we were meeting secretly!

1442
01:36:33,914 --> 01:36:36,249
They'd never guess
you just won't answer

1443
01:36:36,375 --> 01:36:38,877
or that you haven't got a tongue!
