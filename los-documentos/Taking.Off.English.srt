1
00:02:30,621 --> 00:02:33,096
And with your eyelids closed
continue to look upward.

2
00:02:33,225 --> 00:02:35,801
Now take a deep breath and hold it.

3
00:02:35,969 --> 00:02:39,208
Hold, hold, ready, three.
Exhale.

4
00:02:39,292 --> 00:02:42,074
Let your eyes relax
and let your body float.

5
00:02:42,499 --> 00:02:46,793
Imagine yourself floating, floating
down, right through the chair.

6
00:02:47,206 --> 00:02:49,012
As you concentrate on the floating

7
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:52,561
I'm going to concentrate
on your left arm and hand.

8
00:02:52,663 --> 00:02:55,504
Your left hand will lift upward,
your left elbow bend,

9
00:02:55,588 --> 00:02:59,511
your forearm float
into an upright position.

10
00:03:00,074 --> 00:03:02,771
Sometimes you may get a feeling
of a magnetic pole

11
00:03:02,965 --> 00:03:04,412
on the back of your hand.

12
00:03:06,785 --> 00:03:11,802
Now your hand in this upright position
becomes for you a signal

13
00:03:11,891 --> 00:03:14,861
to enter a state of meditation.

14
00:03:15,135 --> 00:03:18,685
Are you for your body
or are you not?

15
00:03:18,979 --> 00:03:21,586
Are you for living
or are you not?

16
00:03:21,692 --> 00:03:23,741
Now of course
if you're not for living

17
00:03:23,984 --> 00:03:25,305
keep on smoking,

18
00:03:25,424 --> 00:03:29,596
arrange for a cremation
and end it all in smoke.

19
00:03:30,038 --> 00:03:33,569
But if the idea of living
is still exciting

20
00:03:35,935 --> 00:03:38,589
concentrate on this feeling of floating

21
00:03:39,119 --> 00:03:40,944
and at the same time

22
00:03:41,155 --> 00:03:46,006
listen to these three critical points.

23
00:03:50,778 --> 00:03:53,610
For you body, smoking is a poison.

24
00:03:54,374 --> 00:03:56,760
You need your body to live.

25
00:03:57,474 --> 00:04:01,813
And you owe your body
this respect and protection.

26
00:04:01,917 --> 00:04:05,809
Then reflect on what this means
to you in a private sense,

27
00:04:06,189 --> 00:04:10,476
and bring yourself out of this state
of concentration this way:

28
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:16,630
Roll up your eyes and do it now

29
00:04:16,714 --> 00:04:20,179
and at one just let your eyes
open slowly.

30
00:04:23,083 --> 00:04:24,791
And when they're back in focus

31
00:04:25,001 --> 00:04:28,102
slowly make a fist
with the hand that's up

32
00:04:28,677 --> 00:04:30,726
and as you open your fist slowly

33
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:34,026
your usual sensation
and control return,

34
00:04:34,168 --> 00:04:36,096
you let it float down.

35
00:04:38,248 --> 00:04:40,646
Now suppose one or two
hours have passed

36
00:04:40,731 --> 00:04:45,399
and you want to do the exercise,
but you don't have privacy.

37
00:04:46,228 --> 00:04:48,704
Here's the way you camouflage
the method,

38
00:04:48,761 --> 00:04:50,221
you make two changes:

39
00:04:50,378 --> 00:04:53,250
First you close your eyelids
then roll your eyes up,

40
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:55,468
so that the eyeroll is private.

41
00:04:55,552 --> 00:04:58,563
Second, instead of your hand
coming up like this,

42
00:04:58,647 --> 00:05:01,379
let it come up like this.

43
00:05:34,796 --> 00:05:36,029
Thank you.

44
00:05:36,113 --> 00:05:37,753
Next.

45
00:05:39,155 --> 00:05:42,195
I would like you all to know
that I'm also an acrobat.

46
00:05:50,045 --> 00:05:52,583
Thank you, next.

47
00:06:25,847 --> 00:06:26,724
What's your name?

48
00:06:26,765 --> 00:06:28,724
- Arlene Baker.
- Jeannie Tyne

49
00:06:28,862 --> 00:06:30,471
Arlene Baker.

50
00:06:30,555 --> 00:06:33,897
Jeannie Tyne.

51
00:06:35,578 --> 00:06:36,439
How old are you?

52
00:06:36,525 --> 00:06:39,172
- Sixteen.
- Sixteen.

53
00:06:40,137 --> 00:06:42,006
Fifteen and a half.

54
00:06:43,764 --> 00:06:45,511
Would you go over there, please?

55
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,244
Hello.

56
00:07:03,285 --> 00:07:06,265
This is Lynn Tyne,
Jeannie Tyne's mother.

57
00:07:06,872 --> 00:07:09,026
I'm sorry to bother you
but I was wondering,

58
00:07:09,202 --> 00:07:11,015
have you heard from the girls?

59
00:07:12,501 --> 00:07:15,393
Well, Jeannie and Corinna were
supposed to go to the city today.

60
00:07:17,895 --> 00:07:20,452
No, you're wrong, Mrs Tyne.

61
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:23,322
Corinna hasn't been to the city today.

62
00:07:27,392 --> 00:07:28,824
I don't understand.

63
00:07:29,059 --> 00:07:31,688
Mrs Divito, could I speak
to Corinna please?

64
00:07:36,237 --> 00:07:37,843
Well, it's just that I thought

65
00:07:37,867 --> 00:07:39,790
that maybe she didn't tell you
that she went to the city

66
00:07:39,843 --> 00:07:42,150
or maybe Jeannie said
something to her and...

67
00:07:42,951 --> 00:07:45,989
No. I don't think so.
No, I'm sure. No, she didn't.

68
00:07:47,623 --> 00:07:49,535
Thank you.

69
00:07:52,377 --> 00:07:55,418
- You talk to Jeannie Tyne today?
- No.

70
00:07:56,673 --> 00:07:58,585
Erica Enright,

71
00:08:00,636 --> 00:08:01,913
Bonnie Marcus,

72
00:08:03,295 --> 00:08:04,353
Jessica Harper.

73
00:08:04,588 --> 00:08:06,527
You should see the girls
in the bathroom though.

74
00:08:07,268 --> 00:08:08,706
They're all throwing up.

75
00:08:08,919 --> 00:08:11,971
They had coke,
they're so nervous.

76
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:16,069
They're all throwing up
in the bathroom.

77
00:08:17,193 --> 00:08:18,886
Are you here to audition?

78
00:08:19,918 --> 00:08:21,527
So am I.

79
00:08:21,551 --> 00:08:22,784
Are you professional?

80
00:08:23,618 --> 00:08:25,374
No, are you?

81
00:08:25,783 --> 00:08:28,282
I can't even sing very well.

82
00:10:02,014 --> 00:10:05,298
I'm sorry.
Can I come back?

83
00:10:06,976 --> 00:10:08,720
Next please.

84
00:12:03,428 --> 00:12:06,004
Sorry. What's the words?

85
00:12:41,593 --> 00:12:43,337
Lynn.

86
00:12:43,886 --> 00:12:46,261
Why do you think she ran away?

87
00:12:47,684 --> 00:12:51,017
I'm not saying she ran away.
I'm just speaking generally.

88
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:55,227
Did you check her room?

89
00:13:43,031 --> 00:13:44,777
Who's on the line please?

90
00:13:45,451 --> 00:13:47,195
Is it a wrong number?

91
00:13:49,746 --> 00:13:51,491
I can hear somebody breathing.

92
00:13:57,295 --> 00:13:59,040
Still breathing.

93
00:14:09,433 --> 00:14:13,351
Can you? speak freely?
Just answer "yes" or "no".

94
00:14:15,857 --> 00:14:17,732
They hung up.

95
00:16:18,734 --> 00:16:21,357
- Does she smoke?
- No.

96
00:16:21,986 --> 00:16:24,858
- Does she smoke a lot?
- No, not at all!

97
00:17:00,945 --> 00:17:03,317
Didn't you ever fit her
for a diaphragm?

98
00:17:04,530 --> 00:17:06,739
No, she's just a baby.

99
00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:12,121
I thought she had one
and it was missing.

100
00:17:12,707 --> 00:17:14,450
You know what I mean?

101
00:17:50,328 --> 00:17:51,869
You can't sing well?

102
00:17:53,454 --> 00:17:54,383
Neither can I.

103
00:17:55,083 --> 00:17:56,682
I sing so flat.

104
00:17:57,823 --> 00:17:59,157
I'm awful, you know.

105
00:18:00,071 --> 00:18:01,345
But when I take

106
00:18:01,795 --> 00:18:03,444
this Mighty Quinn,

107
00:18:05,568 --> 00:18:07,031
I sing so good.

108
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:11,022
Oh, I sing so beautiful.

109
00:18:13,853 --> 00:18:15,764
What's Mighty Quinn?

110
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:17,528
What? Mighty Quinn?

111
00:18:18,029 --> 00:18:21,006
You know, acid. When I take it...

112
00:18:22,751 --> 00:18:24,470
Oh, it's good stuff.

113
00:18:26,698 --> 00:18:28,005
Do you sing well?

114
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,494
No.

115
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,587
Do you want one?

116
00:18:55,544 --> 00:18:57,421
- No, you can't!
- It's all over.

117
00:18:57,505 --> 00:18:59,580
It's over, I hear it.

118
00:18:59,984 --> 00:19:00,955
It's not over.

119
00:19:03,237 --> 00:19:05,897
I know but I sing so...

120
00:19:42,446 --> 00:19:44,396
Larry, please!

121
00:19:45,524 --> 00:19:46,954
You know what the chances are

122
00:19:47,038 --> 00:19:48,983
I go out in the middle
of the night and find her,

123
00:19:49,193 --> 00:19:51,118
just wandering
around in the streets?

124
00:19:51,202 --> 00:19:53,935
I don't know where to start.
It's a million to one.

125
00:19:56,043 --> 00:19:58,500
Am I right?
It's a million to one shot.

126
00:19:58,892 --> 00:20:02,211
I just can't have it
on my concience

127
00:20:02,295 --> 00:20:05,022
that we're just sitting
here doing nothing!

128
00:20:10,316 --> 00:20:13,358
What if she's out there
and she needs us?

129
00:20:14,819 --> 00:20:16,585
We can't just sit here.

130
00:20:18,595 --> 00:20:20,353
You just have to...

131
00:20:22,028 --> 00:20:25,916
But the point is "out where"
needing us?

132
00:20:26,025 --> 00:20:28,328
Where am I going to look?

133
00:20:29,994 --> 00:20:31,953
Do something, do anything!

134
00:22:08,888 --> 00:22:10,666
Christ, you're her father!

135
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:14,195
Can't you just get up and go out.
Is it too much to ask?

136
00:22:14,279 --> 00:22:16,054
What are you gonna do?

137
00:22:16,563 --> 00:22:18,011
What are you gonna do
if I go out there?

138
00:22:18,272 --> 00:22:20,661
What happens if you get
a phone call? What will you do?

139
00:22:20,727 --> 00:22:22,630
I can answer the phone!

140
00:22:37,126 --> 00:22:39,334
- Do you have a picture of her?
- Yes.

141
00:22:40,211 --> 00:22:41,958
Can I see it?

142
00:22:42,090 --> 00:22:44,266
This is one I always carry,
it's the one in my wallet.

143
00:22:44,549 --> 00:22:46,676
That's four years old.

144
00:22:50,807 --> 00:22:52,550
You're kidding!

145
00:22:57,021 --> 00:22:59,146
That's too big. It's too heavy.

146
00:22:59,650 --> 00:23:01,941
You know what I mean,
I can't carry that.

147
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:04,816
Yes, I can.

148
00:23:26,510 --> 00:23:29,513
Lynn, we're at the station now.

149
00:23:29,597 --> 00:23:32,305
- Here are four pieces, sir.
- Thank you very much.

150
00:23:32,338 --> 00:23:33,717
You're welcome.

151
00:23:33,884 --> 00:23:34,821
They don't know anything.

152
00:23:34,984 --> 00:23:36,382
They've checked the hospitals,

153
00:23:36,457 --> 00:23:39,851
there have been no accidents,
nobody's been arrested.

154
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:41,805
I don't know.

155
00:23:42,019 --> 00:23:43,690
They've given us
the name of some places

156
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:46,671
where the kids hang out in town,
we're gonna go look at them.

157
00:23:57,168 --> 00:23:58,944
- What do you want?
- Scotch.

158
00:23:59,145 --> 00:24:01,784
Scotch. Two.

159
00:24:01,808 --> 00:24:04,102
I'm sorry to have dragged
Tony into this.

160
00:24:04,591 --> 00:24:05,681
That's alright.

161
00:24:08,887 --> 00:24:11,465
He has to get up early
in the morning, doesn't he?

162
00:24:13,099 --> 00:24:14,347
That's alright.

163
00:24:14,525 --> 00:24:17,250
He doesn't sleep anyway.

164
00:24:22,109 --> 00:24:24,732
I see the house, it's very quiet.

165
00:24:25,237 --> 00:24:26,322
You mean tonight,

166
00:24:26,387 --> 00:24:28,258
before you came over here?

167
00:24:29,451 --> 00:24:30,498
Yes.

168
00:24:32,828 --> 00:24:34,493
And before that?

169
00:24:35,165 --> 00:24:36,065
This morning.

170
00:24:37,791 --> 00:24:39,127
And before that?

171
00:24:40,587 --> 00:24:42,264
Last night was bowling,

172
00:24:43,345 --> 00:24:44,786
but in the morning

173
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:46,694
twice.

174
00:24:48,438 --> 00:24:49,747
Twice?

175
00:24:50,179 --> 00:24:51,563
He's crazy.

176
00:24:51,770 --> 00:24:54,888
I can't even get undressed
that he goes...

177
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:00,428
I was doing the dishes the other
night and I took off my blouse,

178
00:25:00,512 --> 00:25:02,364
so I wouldn't ruin it.

179
00:25:02,513 --> 00:25:03,992
He came in.

180
00:25:08,407 --> 00:25:09,944
In the kitchen?

181
00:25:11,410 --> 00:25:13,142
He's an animal.

182
00:25:15,832 --> 00:25:17,493
Do you wanna know what happened?

183
00:25:17,841 --> 00:25:19,820
He woke me up
in the middle of the night,

184
00:25:20,403 --> 00:25:24,273
told me to get out of bed
and he wanted me to...

185
00:25:28,053 --> 00:25:29,168
What?

186
00:25:30,971 --> 00:25:32,717
...to sing.

187
00:25:34,934 --> 00:25:36,680
To sing?

188
00:25:37,543 --> 00:25:39,366
Sing. I got out of bed

189
00:25:41,608 --> 00:25:43,487
and I sang,
and he said: "Sing louder"

190
00:25:43,596 --> 00:25:45,455
and I said,
"What about the neighbours?"

191
00:25:46,112 --> 00:25:48,262
"Sing louder" so I sang louder
and he wanted me to dance,

192
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:50,049
so I danced.

193
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:55,323
And then?

194
00:25:59,210 --> 00:26:01,584
What did you sing?

195
00:26:02,577 --> 00:26:04,707
It's really stupid.

196
00:26:06,382 --> 00:26:08,716
Please, tell me.

197
00:26:09,806 --> 00:26:12,216
I'm embarrassed. It's so ridiculous.

198
00:26:13,954 --> 00:26:16,147
Don't be embarrassed, what?

199
00:26:18,521 --> 00:26:21,438
Smoking is a poison for my body.

200
00:26:21,655 --> 00:26:23,135
That's very good.

201
00:26:24,194 --> 00:26:25,565
Now two:

202
00:26:26,394 --> 00:26:29,980
I need my body to live.

203
00:26:30,826 --> 00:26:33,416
I need my body to live.

204
00:26:33,583 --> 00:26:35,338
Yes, now...

205
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:38,582
No, tell me, tell me!

206
00:26:38,792 --> 00:26:43,293
I owe my body
this respect and protection.

207
00:26:43,922 --> 00:26:46,020
Roll down you eyes, then open them.

208
00:26:46,714 --> 00:26:49,961
Like a fist. Tight, tight fist!

209
00:26:49,985 --> 00:26:53,343
# I came down dah wid my
hat pulled in, doo dah doo dah

210
00:26:53,558 --> 00:26:57,095
# I go back home wid a pocket
full of tin, Oh, doo-dah day!

211
00:26:57,269 --> 00:27:00,685
# Gonna run all night,
gonna run all day.

212
00:27:00,769 --> 00:27:04,725
# I bet my money on de bob-tail nag,
somebody bet on de bay.

213
00:28:18,729 --> 00:28:22,977
I think we should get some
fresh air before we go home.

214
00:28:45,925 --> 00:28:47,837
I think they're here.

215
00:29:29,052 --> 00:29:30,796
Yes?

216
00:29:32,390 --> 00:29:34,133
Yes.

217
00:29:39,019 --> 00:29:40,896
Yes, this is Dr Bronson.

218
00:29:46,029 --> 00:29:47,772
Yes.

219
00:30:00,458 --> 00:30:02,418
Who am I speaking with, please?

220
00:30:05,464 --> 00:30:07,377
Oh, Mrs Tyne!

221
00:30:10,261 --> 00:30:12,756
Alright hang on.
I'll be right back.

222
00:30:12,827 --> 00:30:14,430
Yes.

223
00:30:19,895 --> 00:30:20,979
Jeannie,

224
00:30:21,548 --> 00:30:23,543
momma knows
that you took something.

225
00:30:23,774 --> 00:30:25,514
Honey, I have to know what it is.

226
00:30:25,551 --> 00:30:27,599
Did you take something
with a needle?

227
00:30:28,655 --> 00:30:30,399
Did you smoke something?

228
00:30:31,656 --> 00:30:33,651
Did you take a pill?

229
00:30:34,576 --> 00:30:37,581
Ask her if she sniffed something.
I read they sniff it.

230
00:30:38,248 --> 00:30:40,707
Did you? Did you sniff something?

231
00:30:42,577 --> 00:30:45,113
Honey, Moma is not gonna
be mad at you.

232
00:30:45,197 --> 00:30:49,315
I just have to know what it is.
It's very important.

233
00:30:51,743 --> 00:30:54,132
I don't mean to nag at you but

234
00:30:54,219 --> 00:30:57,483
if I don't ask you, you're
not gonna tell me anything.

235
00:30:57,727 --> 00:31:00,681
You won't tell me,
so I have to ask you.

236
00:31:08,531 --> 00:31:12,241
She's alright.
She came home by herself.

237
00:31:15,536 --> 00:31:17,448
Dartling, tell momma.

238
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:20,623
You know Dr Bronson.

239
00:31:21,502 --> 00:31:25,002
He told me to ask you
what you'd taken

240
00:31:25,295 --> 00:31:27,540
and then he'll tell me what to do.

241
00:31:31,053 --> 00:31:34,605
She's alright, she's on something
but she's gonna tell me what it is.

242
00:31:34,629 --> 00:31:38,012
Jeannie it's very important that
you tell momma what you've taken.

243
00:31:38,728 --> 00:31:40,971
What's the matter with you?
Are you out of your mind?

244
00:31:42,417 --> 00:31:43,641
You are drunk!

245
00:31:43,708 --> 00:31:45,884
What do you mean
she's on something?

246
00:31:45,943 --> 00:31:48,978
- What kind of a father are you?
- What do you mean I'm drunk?

247
00:31:49,062 --> 00:31:50,158
Because she's on something,

248
00:31:50,257 --> 00:31:51,925
I'm drunk
and I'm going to hit her!

249
00:31:52,576 --> 00:31:55,066
You went out to look for her
and you got drunk.

250
00:31:59,582 --> 00:32:01,540
Did we find her?

251
00:32:01,932 --> 00:32:06,677
Come on, Jeannie. Out!
Come on. Out, out, out.

252
00:32:14,724 --> 00:32:17,685
Does she know what
a great father she has?

253
00:32:19,602 --> 00:32:23,769
Do you know how many times
I've tried to give up smoking?

254
00:32:25,816 --> 00:32:27,693
Tell them, Margo.

255
00:32:31,197 --> 00:32:33,773
- Tell them!
- Eleven!

256
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:36,619
Doctor Bronson!

257
00:32:51,331 --> 00:32:53,659
She never told me what she took!

258
00:32:55,975 --> 00:32:58,526
You talk to Doctor Bronson.

259
00:33:06,386 --> 00:33:08,031
Hello.

260
00:33:12,672 --> 00:33:13,591
Hello.

261
00:33:17,209 --> 00:33:18,307
That's strange.

262
00:33:18,531 --> 00:33:21,217
He doesn't answer,
but I hear breathing.

263
00:33:27,339 --> 00:33:29,084
Jeannie!

264
00:36:10,881 --> 00:36:12,121
Hello.

265
00:36:13,010 --> 00:36:14,754
Yes, this is she.

266
00:36:15,637 --> 00:36:17,383
Yes.

267
00:36:19,516 --> 00:36:21,101
Yes.

268
00:36:21,185 --> 00:36:23,062
Yes, my daughter is...

269
00:36:27,108 --> 00:36:28,223
What?

270
00:36:40,623 --> 00:36:41,523
Miss?

271
00:36:42,024 --> 00:36:43,667
Could you do me a favour?

272
00:36:46,768 --> 00:36:47,578
Just

273
00:36:47,788 --> 00:36:51,667
if you could look at that picture
and tell me if you've seen that girl.

274
00:36:52,426 --> 00:36:54,256
It's my daughter.

275
00:36:58,807 --> 00:37:00,600
No, not her.

276
00:37:02,729 --> 00:37:07,474
Maybe you could hang onto it
and if you do recognise her,

277
00:37:07,567 --> 00:37:09,776
it's got my phone number.

278
00:37:13,781 --> 00:37:16,820
Could I look at those pictures?

279
00:37:17,576 --> 00:37:19,321
Thank you.

280
00:37:53,614 --> 00:37:55,442
Psst, miss?

281
00:37:57,659 --> 00:37:59,404
Yes?

282
00:38:00,621 --> 00:38:02,365
Take a look at that.

283
00:38:03,457 --> 00:38:06,498
Look over there, in the booth.

284
00:38:06,629 --> 00:38:07,854
See the girl?

285
00:38:08,384 --> 00:38:09,506
It's this girl.

286
00:38:10,256 --> 00:38:11,724
It's the girl in the picture.

287
00:38:11,816 --> 00:38:12,995
I don't know.

288
00:38:13,594 --> 00:38:16,965
No, that's not my business.
Leave me alone.

289
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:19,784
Look at the picture
and look at the girl.

290
00:38:20,315 --> 00:38:21,924
- It's the same.
- No, I don't know.

291
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:23,674
What do you keep, what's all this?

292
00:38:24,021 --> 00:38:27,854
What if my...?

293
00:38:28,316 --> 00:38:29,432
No.

294
00:38:55,341 --> 00:38:56,238
Hello.

295
00:38:56,420 --> 00:38:59,053
Is Mr or Mrs Lockston?

296
00:38:59,728 --> 00:39:00,628
Mrs Lockston?

297
00:39:01,834 --> 00:39:02,611
Mrs Lockston,

298
00:39:02,695 --> 00:39:04,567
do you have a missing daughter?

299
00:39:05,251 --> 00:39:06,060
My...?

300
00:39:06,072 --> 00:39:06,882
Tyne.

301
00:39:08,130 --> 00:39:09,168
Tyne, Larry Tyne.

302
00:39:09,339 --> 00:39:10,555
It doesn't matter Mrs Lockston.

303
00:39:10,912 --> 00:39:11,613
You don't know me.

304
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:15,111
I think I found your daughter.
She's in a luncheonette.

305
00:39:15,281 --> 00:39:16,383
What?

306
00:39:16,453 --> 00:39:19,132
No, I saw her picture in a luncheon...

307
00:39:20,996 --> 00:39:23,204
Yes, I'm sure it's her.

308
00:39:23,416 --> 00:39:26,833
Her picture's in a luncheonette
and she's sitting right here.

309
00:39:28,087 --> 00:39:29,203
What?

310
00:39:30,129 --> 00:39:31,793
I don't know.
Wait a minute, I'll find out.

311
00:39:33,095 --> 00:39:34,006
Wait a minute.

312
00:39:34,495 --> 00:39:35,817
Hey!

313
00:39:36,511 --> 00:39:38,312
What's the address here?

314
00:39:38,422 --> 00:39:40,143
The address here.

315
00:39:40,184 --> 00:39:42,550
I don't know.
I don't wanna tell you nothing.

316
00:39:42,593 --> 00:39:44,438
I don't know nothing.

317
00:39:47,721 --> 00:39:49,220
It's on First Avenue,

318
00:39:49,333 --> 00:39:51,383
between 6th and 7th.

319
00:39:51,526 --> 00:39:53,405
It's just a little lunch counter.

320
00:39:54,948 --> 00:39:57,489
Yes, of course I'm sure it's her.

321
00:39:58,617 --> 00:39:59,774
I'll wait.

322
00:40:00,023 --> 00:40:01,399
Yes, right here.

323
00:40:07,753 --> 00:40:08,836
Miss,

324
00:40:09,678 --> 00:40:11,697
can I have a cup of coffee, please?

325
00:40:43,151 --> 00:40:43,897
Excuse me,

326
00:40:44,041 --> 00:40:46,399
can I talk to you for just a second?
Let me ask you a question.

327
00:40:47,019 --> 00:40:47,942
One...

328
00:40:47,966 --> 00:40:50,389
Hey creep, what are you
bothering my chick for?

329
00:40:50,641 --> 00:40:52,966
I'm not bothering her, I just
want to ask her a question.

330
00:40:53,021 --> 00:40:54,260
You're bothering her.

331
00:40:54,776 --> 00:40:55,813
What are you doing off your stall?

332
00:40:56,017 --> 00:40:58,206
Sit down and take care
of what you gotta take care of.

333
00:40:58,338 --> 00:41:02,222
- I'm not bothering anybody.
- So what are you doing with her?

334
00:41:02,307 --> 00:41:05,298
It so happens this girl
is a missing person.

335
00:41:05,408 --> 00:41:06,655
Where'd you get my picture from?

336
00:41:08,275 --> 00:41:11,320
- Nancy Lockston. She's missing from...
- You a detective? You carry a gun?

337
00:41:11,885 --> 00:41:15,128
- No, I happen to be a father.
- Her father?

338
00:41:15,805 --> 00:41:18,698
Then what are you worried about?
She's not your kid, she's with me.

339
00:41:19,224 --> 00:41:20,019
You know, tell to mother/father,

340
00:41:20,184 --> 00:41:22,218
I got her, they want her,
they can't have her, she's mine,

341
00:41:22,256 --> 00:41:23,570
Wherever she is, goodbye, uh?

342
00:42:08,893 --> 00:42:10,158
Nancy!

343
00:42:14,646 --> 00:42:16,703
Nancy, come back here!

344
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:19,634
Lady, you didn't pay!

345
00:42:51,616 --> 00:42:54,433
Nancy, will you stop?

346
00:42:54,457 --> 00:42:56,744
Lady!

347
00:43:18,053 --> 00:43:20,086
- In here!
- What?

348
00:43:21,617 --> 00:43:25,825
She went in one of these places.
I called you, I'm Mr Tyne.

349
00:43:26,727 --> 00:43:28,530
Oh, thank you.

350
00:43:54,479 --> 00:43:57,656
It's impossible.
I'm exhausted.

351
00:43:57,995 --> 00:43:59,488
I'm terribly sorry.

352
00:44:00,454 --> 00:44:03,177
Please, don't you be sorry.

353
00:44:03,381 --> 00:44:08,075
My goodness, it was so sweet
of you to help me.

354
00:44:08,099 --> 00:44:10,333
I don't know
how you find anyone in this city.

355
00:44:10,511 --> 00:44:11,805
I know.

356
00:44:15,237 --> 00:44:17,904
It was so kind of you to call me.

357
00:44:24,392 --> 00:44:26,419
How long have you been a member?

358
00:44:28,913 --> 00:44:29,955
I beg your pardon?

359
00:44:30,207 --> 00:44:33,075
You are a member, aren't you?

360
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:34,575
Of what?

361
00:44:34,754 --> 00:44:37,952
Oh, you're not a member of SPFC?

362
00:44:39,382 --> 00:44:40,882
I don't know what that is.

363
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:46,527
Oh, it's the Society for the Parents
of Fugitive Children.

364
00:44:47,682 --> 00:44:49,682
You've heard of it, haven't you?

365
00:44:51,438 --> 00:44:53,349
I don't know.

366
00:44:54,416 --> 00:44:55,758
It's very well known.

367
00:44:55,907 --> 00:44:58,028
It's been in all the newspapers.

368
00:44:58,986 --> 00:45:02,490
We had an article in Time magazine.
Didn't you read about it?

369
00:45:04,413 --> 00:45:07,242
I think I read some... You know,
there's been no reason for me

370
00:45:07,266 --> 00:45:10,391
to pay any attention
to anything like that until now.

371
00:45:12,338 --> 00:45:16,174
- How long has she been gone, Mr Tyne?
- Larry.

372
00:45:18,299 --> 00:45:19,767
About a week.

373
00:45:22,434 --> 00:45:24,043
What about your girl?

374
00:45:24,435 --> 00:45:27,036
Oh, mine's been gone
for seven months.

375
00:45:31,231 --> 00:45:34,690
I don't feel any responsibilty for it.

376
00:45:36,332 --> 00:45:38,079
I'll tell you what my philosophy is.

377
00:45:38,163 --> 00:45:41,010
I think that everything
that happens to us in life is

378
00:45:42,173 --> 00:45:43,945
it's just another life experience

379
00:45:44,102 --> 00:45:47,376
and we should get everything out
of it we can.

380
00:45:49,746 --> 00:45:51,118
It's a life experience.

381
00:45:52,170 --> 00:45:53,189
You know what I mean?

382
00:45:57,114 --> 00:45:59,191
It's a marvellous philosophy.

383
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:10,927
You know, you could

384
00:46:10,951 --> 00:46:15,315
find that this experience could be
a very profound one for you and your...

385
00:46:16,130 --> 00:46:18,103
You are married, aren't you?

386
00:46:18,187 --> 00:46:19,633
You're not divorced or

387
00:46:19,806 --> 00:46:21,473
widowed or anything like that?

388
00:46:21,583 --> 00:46:22,535
No.

389
00:46:23,792 --> 00:46:26,528
Well, Ben and I, Ben,
that's my husband,

390
00:46:26,667 --> 00:46:29,464
we found since Nancy's been gone,

391
00:46:29,576 --> 00:46:32,435
just in looking for her
it's brought us closer together.

392
00:46:33,272 --> 00:46:36,715
Really our relationship is closer.

393
00:46:37,673 --> 00:46:38,637
More profound.

394
00:46:48,376 --> 00:46:51,492
Maybe you and I can look
some more, together.

395
00:46:51,665 --> 00:46:53,477
For your girl.

396
00:46:54,759 --> 00:46:59,970
- Not up on those roofs?
- No, I mean on the street.

397
00:47:02,393 --> 00:47:05,665
Oh yeah, that would be very nice.

398
00:47:05,898 --> 00:47:08,057
I'd like that.

399
00:47:08,816 --> 00:47:14,145
- Good. Let me make one
short phone call, ok? - Alright.

400
00:47:30,409 --> 00:47:32,395
Lynn, don't get excited.

401
00:47:32,479 --> 00:47:35,474
I have not found her but I have
found someone who's seen her...

402
00:47:35,904 --> 00:47:38,211
She's arrested.
She's arrested for shoplifting.

403
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:40,683
She's in jail. She's 300 miles away.

404
00:47:40,767 --> 00:47:43,641
She's in upstate New York.
We have to go and bring her home.

405
00:48:29,727 --> 00:48:31,302
What did she steal?

406
00:48:34,367 --> 00:48:37,110
A Japanese portable television set.

407
00:48:38,748 --> 00:48:40,492
Sony?

408
00:48:43,835 --> 00:48:45,582
Mitsubishi.

409
00:48:45,671 --> 00:48:48,794
- Mr & Mrs Tyne?
- Yes.

410
00:49:08,781 --> 00:49:10,610
Where is she?

411
00:49:12,159 --> 00:49:14,569
- What?
- I said where is she.

412
00:49:15,036 --> 00:49:17,364
- Where's who?
- Where's our daughter.

413
00:49:18,374 --> 00:49:20,271
She's sitting right over there
in the bench.

414
00:49:20,454 --> 00:49:22,424
No, that's Corrina Divito.

415
00:49:24,128 --> 00:49:27,284
No, this is Jeannie Tyne.

416
00:49:27,922 --> 00:49:29,566
- No, no. That's...
- Now wait a minute.

417
00:49:29,867 --> 00:49:32,402
- You're Mr & Mrs Tyne?
- Yes, of course but...

418
00:49:32,701 --> 00:49:36,894
- What's your name?
- Corrina Divito.

419
00:49:36,978 --> 00:49:40,312
Please Mrs D.. Mrs Tyne!
Go ahead, what's your name?

420
00:49:42,899 --> 00:49:45,358
Give me a couple of minutes.
Thank you very much.

421
00:49:50,159 --> 00:49:51,314
What happened?

422
00:49:51,484 --> 00:49:54,837
I don't know.

423
00:50:05,050 --> 00:50:07,672
This girl is not your daughter.

424
00:50:08,930 --> 00:50:12,513
She now maintains her name
is Corrina Divito.

425
00:50:13,809 --> 00:50:17,143
She says she knows nothing
of your daughter's wherebaouts

426
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:21,022
and used her name as an alias
at the time of apprehension to...

427
00:50:22,527 --> 00:50:25,530
for fear of parental disapproval.

428
00:50:25,988 --> 00:50:28,779
I'm sorry this had to happen, but

429
00:50:31,578 --> 00:50:33,787
if you'd like some coffee...

430
00:50:35,748 --> 00:50:38,208
When that call came
from the policeman

431
00:50:39,379 --> 00:50:42,666
and he said Jeannie was
arrested for shoplifting,

432
00:50:43,425 --> 00:50:45,113
it was so awful.

433
00:50:46,386 --> 00:50:48,344
Anything but that, anything!

434
00:50:51,141 --> 00:50:53,553
And then when we went there,

435
00:50:54,437 --> 00:50:57,271
and we saw that little
girl sitting in the chair,

436
00:50:58,732 --> 00:51:01,641
I wished it had been Jeannie.

437
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:05,238
Look, Lynn. There's nothing
wrong with her.

438
00:51:05,322 --> 00:51:07,347
She's not under arrest,
she hasn't had an accident.

439
00:51:07,431 --> 00:51:10,020
She's off somewhere having
a terrific time with her friends.

440
00:51:10,104 --> 00:51:13,300
She's having fun while we're breaking
our necks running around

441
00:51:13,384 --> 00:51:16,268
and driving from place to place
like a couple of maniacs.

442
00:51:16,352 --> 00:51:19,038
If we were smart, we'd be having
as much fun as she is!

443
00:51:19,922 --> 00:51:20,766
That's what we ought to do,

444
00:51:20,935 --> 00:51:23,872
go somewhere and have some fun,
goddamnit!

445
00:52:34,754 --> 00:52:37,000
I'd like another gin gimlet
on the rocks.

446
00:52:37,075 --> 00:52:38,415
No, wait a minute!

447
00:52:40,635 --> 00:52:44,848
- Another gin gimlet on the rocks.
- Hang on a minute, we've had enough.

448
00:52:44,932 --> 00:52:47,851
- But you're the one that said...
- Just the cheque, please.

449
00:52:48,101 --> 00:52:51,605
- No, just a second.
- Just the cheque, that's all ok.

450
00:52:51,689 --> 00:52:56,484
We've had a good time but we've
got 4 hours drive back to New York.

451
00:52:56,861 --> 00:52:59,686
- Are you tired?
- I am tired.

452
00:52:59,946 --> 00:53:03,781
- Are you very very tired?
- Yes, I'm very very tired.

453
00:53:03,868 --> 00:53:06,078
Well, why don't we stay the night?

454
00:53:27,561 --> 00:53:30,896
I'd like that gin gimlet now.
On the rocks.

455
00:53:39,157 --> 00:53:42,113
Honey, don't take the keys.
Sit here.

456
00:53:45,081 --> 00:53:46,957
Come on, let's go to sleep.

457
00:53:47,165 --> 00:53:50,123
Oh, I wanna dance!

458
00:53:51,418 --> 00:53:52,284
I'm tired.

459
00:53:52,435 --> 00:53:54,526
I can't do that kind of dancing.

460
00:53:54,757 --> 00:53:57,464
- Yes, you can.
- Oh, come on!

461
00:53:58,636 --> 00:54:00,846
Well, let's just watch them.

462
00:54:05,685 --> 00:54:08,308
Or we could just look at each other.

463
00:54:12,108 --> 00:54:14,305
- Ok.
- Look at me.

464
00:54:14,389 --> 00:54:15,528
Ok.

465
00:54:17,617 --> 00:54:20,571
- You're not looking at me.
- I am looking at you.

466
00:54:20,785 --> 00:54:24,452
- You're not seeing me!
- Of course I'm seeing you.

467
00:54:26,584 --> 00:54:28,497
What am I doing?

468
00:54:29,838 --> 00:54:31,749
What am I doing?

469
00:54:43,924 --> 00:54:45,166
Well, look, I'm gonna go to bed.

470
00:54:45,186 --> 00:54:49,098
If you wanna come on, come on.
If you wanna stay here, stay.

471
00:55:18,196 --> 00:55:21,280
- Is somebody sitting here?
- No.

472
00:55:22,018 --> 00:55:25,916
- Somebody was sitting here?
- Yes.

473
00:55:25,940 --> 00:55:26,948
Are they coming back?

474
00:55:28,358 --> 00:55:29,180
No.

475
00:55:31,196 --> 00:55:33,736
My name's Norman.

476
00:55:34,199 --> 00:55:36,409
- This is my friend Schuyler.
- What?

477
00:55:36,494 --> 00:55:38,453
My name is Schuyler.

478
00:55:38,747 --> 00:55:41,493
- That's a funny name.
- Yeah, he's a funny guy.

479
00:55:42,625 --> 00:55:45,333
- What's your name?
- Lynn.

480
00:55:45,417 --> 00:55:46,833
What are you drinking, Lynn?

481
00:55:47,073 --> 00:55:50,678
Gin gimlet on the rocks.

482
00:55:50,702 --> 00:55:56,424
- Gin what?
- Gin gimlet on the rocks.

483
00:55:57,433 --> 00:55:59,510
Gin gimlet, alright.

484
00:55:59,934 --> 00:56:01,311
You didn't look funny to me.

485
00:56:01,476 --> 00:56:04,243
He's got some funny stories,
he cracks me up.

486
00:56:04,523 --> 00:56:07,046
You could take him to a funeral,
you'd be on the floor laughing.

487
00:56:07,659 --> 00:56:10,735
Tell her that, you know,
that one about Bob.

488
00:56:12,823 --> 00:56:14,613
It's the funniest story
I ever heard in my life.

489
00:56:14,697 --> 00:56:17,196
But this is not a joke,
this is a real story.

490
00:56:17,465 --> 00:56:21,473
It's a story, it's a joke. If you tell
something terrible very funny

491
00:56:21,574 --> 00:56:23,798
people are gonna laugh,
don't you understand that?

492
00:56:23,882 --> 00:56:26,317
Gentlemen, it's been very nice.

493
00:56:26,495 --> 00:56:28,295
You gotta go to the little girl's room?

494
00:56:28,301 --> 00:56:32,582
- Very nice meeting you, Schuyler.
- You coming back? Lynn?

495
00:56:34,140 --> 00:56:36,472
What are you looking?
Go after her, she wants you.

496
00:56:36,582 --> 00:56:38,620
- She doesn't want me.
- Do you want her?

497
00:56:38,801 --> 00:56:40,385
No.

498
00:56:42,607 --> 00:56:44,893
- Can I go after her?
- If you want to.

499
00:56:44,977 --> 00:56:48,529
If I want to? What am I up
here for, to play ping-pong?

500
00:57:17,854 --> 00:57:19,847
Don't put up the light.

501
00:57:20,022 --> 00:57:21,447
It's me, Schuyler.

502
00:57:21,612 --> 00:57:25,365
You know,
the funny guy from the bar.

503
00:57:26,653 --> 00:57:29,609
I'll be with you in a second.

504
00:57:50,597 --> 00:57:52,253
I'll be right there.

505
00:58:43,695 --> 00:58:45,376
Do you have anything
you'd like to add?

506
00:58:45,798 --> 00:58:47,740
Yes, I do.

507
00:58:48,118 --> 00:58:50,080
We have with us this evening

508
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:52,256
Miss Ellen Lubar.

509
00:58:52,832 --> 00:58:55,211
She is seated right over there.

510
00:58:55,417 --> 00:58:56,711
Now Miss Lubar

511
00:58:57,092 --> 00:59:00,248
has been away
from home for six months.

512
00:59:00,675 --> 00:59:05,635
She may have seen your child
or children, as the case may be,

513
00:59:06,179 --> 00:59:09,191
and she will be very happy
to answer your questions.

514
00:59:09,374 --> 00:59:14,246
If you will, form a line and show
her pictures of your child,

515
00:59:14,564 --> 00:59:16,974
you might be one of the lucky ones,

516
00:59:17,357 --> 00:59:20,695
and you might be able to locate
your child through her.

517
00:59:23,864 --> 00:59:27,982
Yes, let us give her
a good round of applause!

518
01:00:14,420 --> 01:00:18,204
- I think I know her.
- This is my son.

519
01:00:20,223 --> 01:00:21,528
Hey!

520
01:00:23,804 --> 01:00:26,048
Honey, somebody's waving at us.

521
01:00:26,516 --> 01:00:27,982
Hey, Ben, come on.

522
01:00:28,143 --> 01:00:29,708
I want you to meet a friend of mine.

523
01:00:29,897 --> 01:00:31,770
She's coming over.

524
01:00:31,854 --> 01:00:34,119
You know, you remember
that man I told you I met.

525
01:00:34,278 --> 01:00:36,518
Excuse me, please. I'm sorry.

526
01:00:39,198 --> 01:00:42,155
Hello, how are you?

527
01:00:45,247 --> 01:00:47,037
Momma?

528
01:00:56,466 --> 01:00:58,212
Momma?

529
01:01:08,937 --> 01:01:10,683
Is anybody home?

530
01:01:14,817 --> 01:01:17,111
Friends,

531
01:01:18,239 --> 01:01:21,777
- ladies and gentlemen...
- Annie, come on. We're starting.

532
01:01:22,911 --> 01:01:24,705
- See you later.
- Nice seeing you.

533
01:01:27,250 --> 01:01:29,909
Friends, as you know,

534
01:01:30,251 --> 01:01:33,805
the purpose and the aim
of our "Society for the

535
01:01:34,037 --> 01:01:36,177
Parents of Fugitive Children"

536
01:01:37,051 --> 01:01:39,754
is not only to try to find
those children,

537
01:01:40,495 --> 01:01:42,678
but to try to understand them.

538
01:01:43,058 --> 01:01:46,975
How many times have
we found our children

539
01:01:47,519 --> 01:01:49,523
only to lose them again?

540
01:01:49,856 --> 01:01:54,152
And perhaps the most difficult
problem we now face

541
01:01:54,490 --> 01:01:58,492
lies in the fields of understanding
the urges and pressures

542
01:01:58,949 --> 01:02:02,999
that lead our children
into the taking of drugs.

543
01:02:05,165 --> 01:02:09,546
And with us, please,
please, ladies and gentlemen,

544
01:02:09,671 --> 01:02:15,123
with us tonight we have the
eminant American psychologist

545
01:02:15,884 --> 01:02:18,214
Dr. Besh, Dr. Bob Besh,

546
01:02:18,401 --> 01:02:20,739
whose book you probably know.

547
01:02:21,349 --> 01:02:23,261
Doctor Besh?

548
01:02:41,579 --> 01:02:44,028
Friends, everything
I emphasized at dinner

549
01:02:44,374 --> 01:02:45,681
is all true

550
01:02:47,169 --> 01:02:49,213
but really useless.

551
01:02:50,132 --> 01:02:52,594
For you to understand your youngster

552
01:02:52,723 --> 01:02:54,490
and what he's going through,

553
01:02:54,636 --> 01:02:57,639
you really have to have
a similar experience.

554
01:03:03,770 --> 01:03:06,194
Friends, I propose that we

555
01:03:06,422 --> 01:03:09,060
conduct an experiment here
this evening.

556
01:03:09,861 --> 01:03:12,505
As you know, or many
of you I think know,

557
01:03:12,946 --> 01:03:17,241
I'm a lawyer and what I'm
doing here now is illegal.

558
01:03:17,912 --> 01:03:19,538
However there are considerations

559
01:03:20,309 --> 01:03:24,081
that transcend the legalities
of the situation,

560
01:03:24,750 --> 01:03:28,230
and that is the consideration
of our children,

561
01:03:28,296 --> 01:03:33,150
about whom we're all
deeply concerned.

562
01:03:34,554 --> 01:03:37,313
And that is why this marijuana,

563
01:03:37,504 --> 01:03:40,483
which I am told is particulary
pure in form,

564
01:03:40,507 --> 01:03:44,557
and therefore perhaps particulary
effective as to reaction,

565
01:03:45,607 --> 01:03:47,957
is what I propose that you

566
01:03:48,832 --> 01:03:51,252
indulge in here, with me.

567
01:03:51,615 --> 01:03:55,388
This is my first indulgence

568
01:03:55,659 --> 01:04:00,410
and perhaps this will aid us
to understand, hopefully,

569
01:04:00,500 --> 01:04:02,405
what it is that our children

570
01:04:03,150 --> 01:04:03,958
are involved in

571
01:04:04,270 --> 01:04:06,157
and perhaps why.

572
01:04:13,954 --> 01:04:17,133
To help with our experiment tonight,

573
01:04:17,401 --> 01:04:18,600
we're all fortunate

574
01:04:18,815 --> 01:04:20,805
to have one of my patients,

575
01:04:21,198 --> 01:04:23,566
Vincent Scarelli. Vince?

576
01:04:28,572 --> 01:04:30,400
Alright.

577
01:04:32,284 --> 01:04:34,446
This is a joint.

578
01:04:36,412 --> 01:04:38,947
The joint has two ends.

579
01:04:39,414 --> 01:04:44,613
It has one end which is rolled shut
and another end which is open.

580
01:04:46,508 --> 01:04:50,219
Take the joint
with the open end facing you,

581
01:04:50,303 --> 01:04:56,142
firmly between between your
thumb and index fingers, like this.

582
01:04:58,270 --> 01:05:00,307
Do you know what I'm saying?

583
01:05:02,108 --> 01:05:04,979
Then you take it
and put it in your mouth,

584
01:05:06,194 --> 01:05:08,072
like this.

585
01:05:09,156 --> 01:05:12,491
Then you take out a match,
you light it,

586
01:05:12,575 --> 01:05:17,500
you put it to the end
and you inhale very deeply like,

587
01:05:19,626 --> 01:05:21,420
like that.

588
01:05:22,926 --> 01:05:25,985
And as you inhale, curl up
the edges of your mouth,

589
01:05:26,048 --> 01:05:29,804
so that you let in a lot of oxygen
along with the smoke.

590
01:05:29,888 --> 01:05:34,090
It is very important to get
a mixture of grass and oxygen.

591
01:05:34,268 --> 01:05:37,804
After you inhale,
do not exhale immediately,

592
01:05:38,105 --> 01:05:40,683
but inhale very far into your back

593
01:05:40,942 --> 01:05:44,920
and hold it in with your diaphragm
for a count of ten.

594
01:05:50,868 --> 01:05:55,458
And then exhale,
preferably through your nose.

595
01:05:58,838 --> 01:06:00,581
You got that?

596
01:06:02,756 --> 01:06:04,816
Now the other thing
you must remember

597
01:06:05,031 --> 01:06:06,564
is that after you inhale

598
01:06:06,734 --> 01:06:12,177
you take the joint and pass it
to the person sitting next to you.

599
01:06:13,781 --> 01:06:17,995
Do not, repeat,
do not hold onto the joint.

600
01:06:18,237 --> 01:06:21,738
This is called bogarting the joint,
and it is very rude.

601
01:06:21,904 --> 01:06:25,075
So you take it and you pass it
to the person sitting next to you

602
01:06:25,490 --> 01:06:29,573
until the joint gets passed
around and it's very very small.

603
01:06:30,369 --> 01:06:32,579
That is called a roach.

604
01:06:32,997 --> 01:06:35,597
- The remnant is a roach?
- Yes.

605
01:06:35,796 --> 01:06:37,054
Roach.

606
01:06:40,338 --> 01:06:42,253
And I will collect those.

607
01:06:44,009 --> 01:06:46,927
Now, are there any other questions
before we light up?

608
01:06:47,011 --> 01:06:49,809
Yes, you said we should count to ten.

609
01:06:49,845 --> 01:06:51,656
How fast should we count?

610
01:06:53,145 --> 01:06:56,268
Just fast enough,
so that you don't pass out.

611
01:06:58,777 --> 01:07:01,815
How many years in prison
does this represent?

612
01:07:02,571 --> 01:07:03,972
A man in Michigan

613
01:07:04,164 --> 01:07:06,532
was sentenced to ten years in prison

614
01:07:06,734 --> 01:07:08,684
for having two joints.

615
01:07:09,454 --> 01:07:10,364
Yes.

616
01:07:10,955 --> 01:07:13,139
For a person who has quit smoking

617
01:07:13,189 --> 01:07:15,530
is it dangerous?

618
01:07:15,669 --> 01:07:18,581
Marijuana contains no nicotine.

619
01:07:20,299 --> 01:07:22,176
Any other questions?

620
01:07:22,761 --> 01:07:24,470
Yes.

621
01:07:24,555 --> 01:07:28,092
I think we all had drinks with dinner.

622
01:07:28,557 --> 01:07:32,143
The dope and the alcohol mix?

623
01:07:32,980 --> 01:07:34,857
Oh, they'll mix.

624
01:07:36,233 --> 01:07:38,313
Thank you.

625
01:07:38,737 --> 01:07:41,670
Alright everybody,
now we're going to light up.

626
01:07:41,993 --> 01:07:43,756
Get your matches ready.

627
01:07:44,910 --> 01:07:46,490
Strike the match.

628
01:07:52,126 --> 01:07:54,120
We're waiting for you.

629
01:07:57,006 --> 01:07:59,665
Very good.
Light the joint.

630
01:08:20,240 --> 01:08:22,154
Inhale.

631
01:08:25,077 --> 01:08:27,036
Pass the joint.

632
01:08:32,212 --> 01:08:34,297
3, 4, 5, 6, 7,

633
01:08:37,718 --> 01:08:40,425
- 8, 9...
- Think of bogarting hands.

634
01:08:44,221 --> 01:08:46,682
Don't forget to curl your lips.

635
01:08:51,356 --> 01:08:53,643
Hey lady, don't cheat!

636
01:08:56,153 --> 01:08:58,486
- Who me?
- Yeah, you!

637
01:08:58,613 --> 01:09:03,281
- I have trouble with my windpipe.
- Well, just pass it along.

638
01:09:14,840 --> 01:09:17,465
- Do you feel anything?
- No.

639
01:09:18,178 --> 01:09:20,920
It smells like stinkweed.

640
01:09:27,145 --> 01:09:29,770
Do you feel anything?

641
01:09:39,285 --> 01:09:42,109
And now, feel anything now?

642
01:10:04,897 --> 01:10:06,852
Nothing!

643
01:10:20,912 --> 01:10:22,788
Just relax everybody.

644
01:10:24,876 --> 01:10:28,497
Relax and just fly.
Feel like a big bird.

645
01:11:08,714 --> 01:11:10,559
Relax, just breathe.

646
01:11:10,732 --> 01:11:13,327
That's all you have to do,
just breathe.

647
01:11:13,846 --> 01:11:16,629
Let the rhythm take you
and go with the music.

648
01:11:16,838 --> 01:11:18,759
Just fly away.

649
01:11:19,176 --> 01:11:22,462
Float, just float all the way up.

650
01:11:22,546 --> 01:11:25,836
Just feel your whole, dig your
whole body just floating away.

651
01:11:28,737 --> 01:11:30,777
Gentlemen,

652
01:11:31,779 --> 01:11:34,164
I think I'm beginning
to feel something.

653
01:11:34,296 --> 01:11:35,537
Well, go on!

654
01:11:37,373 --> 01:11:39,075
Vibrations.

655
01:11:43,086 --> 01:11:46,618
It's like a strange fuzzy.

656
01:11:48,673 --> 01:11:50,667
See, isn't it beautiful?
Beautiful

657
01:11:51,259 --> 01:11:55,156
Just do whatever you like,
whatever you feel like doing.

658
01:11:55,472 --> 01:11:57,550
Whatever comes into your mind.

659
01:11:58,183 --> 01:12:02,467
And go with it, go with it
all the way. Don't hold on.

660
01:12:05,106 --> 01:12:09,358
Relax and let it happen!
Don't sit on it, just...

661
01:12:09,446 --> 01:12:12,023
Let it fly!

662
01:12:22,876 --> 01:12:25,129
What is it? Here it is!

663
01:12:25,304 --> 01:12:26,474
Don't think about it.

664
01:12:26,674 --> 01:12:29,323
Just move with the moment.

665
01:12:29,965 --> 01:12:33,467
Take the impulse and move with it!

666
01:13:04,001 --> 01:13:05,913
I don't feel anything.

667
01:13:12,693 --> 01:13:16,138
Oh, what a beautiful house.

668
01:13:16,222 --> 01:13:19,925
Hey, Ben. Come here, look!
No, that one over there.

669
01:13:20,228 --> 01:13:22,296
- Look at it here.
- Yeah, looks very nice.

670
01:13:23,653 --> 01:13:24,910
Now look, look, look.

671
01:13:26,103 --> 01:13:27,166
Now look at it here.

672
01:13:27,343 --> 01:13:30,667
Hey, that's the damnedest thing
I've ever seen!

673
01:13:34,197 --> 01:13:35,778
- Ain't that something?
- That's remarkable.

674
01:13:36,338 --> 01:13:38,466
That's what I mean
by a work of art.

675
01:13:40,458 --> 01:13:42,669
Oh, the bottle collection!

676
01:13:52,810 --> 01:13:54,923
Cards, are we really gonna play?

677
01:13:55,032 --> 01:13:58,728
We are gonna play a hand
of the Duchesses Fanny.

678
01:14:00,553 --> 01:14:02,067
But I don't know how to play that.

679
01:14:02,278 --> 01:14:05,234
It's very simple. We're not gonna
play that, we're gonna play...

680
01:14:06,067 --> 01:14:07,455
I don't know how to play anything.

681
01:14:07,589 --> 01:14:09,556
- You mean you don't know
how to play poker? - No.

682
01:14:11,469 --> 01:14:15,201
I never heard of anybody who didn't
know how to play poker before.

683
01:14:15,609 --> 01:14:16,780
Look, I don't wanna lose.

684
01:14:16,906 --> 01:14:20,217
I don't care what happens,
if I don't lose it's alright.

685
01:14:20,513 --> 01:14:21,559
No, if I lose I quit.

686
01:14:21,735 --> 01:14:24,998
Well, that's silly. I don't think
this woman's got no backbone.

687
01:14:25,393 --> 01:14:28,722
I know but we're
having her operated on.

688
01:14:29,813 --> 01:14:31,164
I wish I said that!

689
01:14:31,246 --> 01:14:33,549
- We are gonna play...
- I wish you had too!

690
01:14:33,930 --> 01:14:38,575
We are gonna play,
Texas one card showdown.

691
01:14:39,244 --> 01:14:41,905
- I never heard of it.
- Everone takes one card

692
01:14:42,372 --> 01:14:44,617
and the low man is the loser.

693
01:14:44,699 --> 01:14:45,706
- Wait.
- What?

694
01:14:45,766 --> 01:14:47,220
I'm not ready.

695
01:14:53,407 --> 01:14:56,545
- All right.
- Ok, you ready now?

696
01:14:58,067 --> 01:14:59,632
- Are you ready?
- I'm ready.

697
01:14:59,716 --> 01:15:04,618
- Oh, she's ready, ok.
- You cut the cards, Larry.

698
01:15:06,559 --> 01:15:09,228
You want to take the first?

699
01:15:09,691 --> 01:15:12,102
- I don't wanna be first.
- Lynn?

700
01:15:12,737 --> 01:15:14,903
Anybody but me, you!

701
01:15:16,246 --> 01:15:17,193
Ok.

702
01:15:25,780 --> 01:15:30,174
I knew it, I knew I would lose.
I don't wanna play, I'm gonna lose.

703
01:15:30,435 --> 01:15:32,604
Well, c'est la vie.

704
01:15:32,688 --> 01:15:35,266
- Ok!
- Ok what?

705
01:15:35,400 --> 01:15:37,454
Come on, you gotta take
something off.

706
01:15:38,322 --> 01:15:39,559
She's gotta take something off.

707
01:15:40,494 --> 01:15:42,203
Yeah, you have take something off.

708
01:15:42,663 --> 01:15:46,540
The rules of Texas one card showdown

709
01:15:47,104 --> 01:15:48,841
is that you have to

710
01:15:49,408 --> 01:15:51,224
- take something off.
- I did.

711
01:15:52,260 --> 01:15:52,978
What did you take off?

712
01:15:54,014 --> 01:15:57,618
- My shoes.
- Hey, she did! Look!

713
01:15:59,098 --> 01:16:02,624
- You gotta take off your shoes...
- Hey, those are beautiful shoes!

714
01:16:02,708 --> 01:16:05,381
- Thank you.
- This is Texas one card showdown!

715
01:16:05,673 --> 01:16:08,768
You hold 'em up.
Now down on the floor.

716
01:16:09,356 --> 01:16:11,777
That's Rhode Island showdown.

717
01:16:13,591 --> 01:16:16,791
They would lynch you in Texas.
You're beautiful!

718
01:16:19,764 --> 01:16:21,932
- Bravo!
- Again!

719
01:16:23,314 --> 01:16:24,587
Go ahead.

720
01:16:30,617 --> 01:16:33,817
- Who is it now?
- Not me!

721
01:16:35,625 --> 01:16:37,504
Larry.

722
01:16:41,678 --> 01:16:43,839
Over!

723
01:16:47,377 --> 01:16:49,060
Again!

724
01:18:49,641 --> 01:18:50,997
It's me!

725
01:18:51,464 --> 01:18:53,473
You're gonna let me play this game?

726
01:19:01,286 --> 01:19:04,078
You got a dirty laugh, lady.

727
01:19:04,167 --> 01:19:07,629
Oh, come on.
You can't sit like that.

728
01:19:07,713 --> 01:19:08,889
Seriously,

729
01:19:09,740 --> 01:19:14,111
several doctors have told me
that it's very bad for your spine.

730
01:19:14,558 --> 01:19:16,580
You're a bad man.

731
01:19:19,733 --> 01:19:21,897
Cheers!

732
01:19:22,696 --> 01:19:25,868
She's wonderful, you know!
She's really wonderful.

733
01:19:26,702 --> 01:19:29,886
- Come on, draw.
- I can even reach for it.

734
01:19:37,095 --> 01:19:39,589
I didn't lose this time!

735
01:19:41,519 --> 01:19:42,976
Okay, oh see.

736
01:19:48,239 --> 01:19:50,198
He lost again.

737
01:19:56,336 --> 01:19:59,154
I don't know, he hasn't got
anything to take off.

738
01:19:59,504 --> 01:20:01,770
He's naked!

739
01:20:10,830 --> 01:20:12,235
Okay, Larry, get up!

740
01:20:12,390 --> 01:20:15,580
You don't have anything
to take off, right?

741
01:20:53,207 --> 01:20:55,948
I think that we should be going.

742
01:20:57,604 --> 01:20:59,809
Yeah, I guess that means we better.

743
01:21:05,157 --> 01:21:06,797
Let's go, Annie.

744
01:21:10,252 --> 01:21:12,481
Yeah.
I guess we better...

745
01:21:14,124 --> 01:21:16,638
- I guess we better be going.
- Thank you.

746
01:21:18,102 --> 01:21:19,700
for taking us into
your home here.

747
01:21:20,642 --> 01:21:23,904
Watch your trousers there.

748
01:21:23,928 --> 01:21:26,815
It was... thanks very much.

749
01:21:27,531 --> 01:21:29,446
Annie!

750
01:21:36,212 --> 01:21:39,417
It was really a terrific evening,
wasn't it, Ben?

751
01:21:42,430 --> 01:21:44,472
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

752
01:21:45,185 --> 01:21:47,228
Oh, I have to get...

753
01:21:52,360 --> 01:21:55,746
You know that marijuana's
really amazing.

754
01:21:55,967 --> 01:21:59,188
The way it affected...

755
01:21:59,833 --> 01:22:01,978
I'm so high.

756
01:22:08,389 --> 01:22:10,267
Night.

757
01:23:02,772 --> 01:23:05,565
Don't you think
we ought to talk to her?

758
01:23:09,451 --> 01:23:13,072
I just don't wanna argue.

759
01:23:15,250 --> 01:23:17,294
I don't wanna argue.

760
01:23:46,163 --> 01:23:48,291
Are you alright?

761
01:23:54,005 --> 01:23:56,298
We were worried about you.

762
01:24:03,975 --> 01:24:05,934
Where were you?

763
01:24:15,570 --> 01:24:17,529
Were you with a boy?

764
01:24:22,869 --> 01:24:25,163
You were with a boy, weren't you?

765
01:24:36,799 --> 01:24:38,885
Do we know him?

766
01:24:43,432 --> 01:24:46,340
Don't you think
we should get to know him?

767
01:24:47,768 --> 01:24:50,015
Don't you think
we should meet him?

768
01:24:52,983 --> 01:24:55,622
You tell him
that we would like to meet him

769
01:24:56,010 --> 01:24:58,876
and you invite him to dinner here,

770
01:24:59,991 --> 01:25:03,162
and if he's not a coward, he'll come.

771
01:25:07,205 --> 01:25:09,285
Do you understand?

772
01:25:42,034 --> 01:25:44,407
This is Jamie. This is my father.

773
01:25:45,914 --> 01:25:47,873
Come in.

774
01:25:51,710 --> 01:25:53,587
Hello, Jamie.

775
01:26:01,846 --> 01:26:03,675
I'll get your mother.

776
01:26:07,020 --> 01:26:09,062
Come in, sit down.

777
01:26:22,658 --> 01:26:24,572
Lynn,

778
01:26:47,935 --> 01:26:49,978
there's nothing to worry about.

779
01:26:52,440 --> 01:26:54,398
Don't cry.

780
01:27:32,315 --> 01:27:35,354
So you're a musician, huh?

781
01:27:42,367 --> 01:27:44,443
What do you play?

782
01:27:47,997 --> 01:27:52,669
He plays the organ and the bass
and the piano. And he sings.

783
01:27:54,462 --> 01:27:56,457
Ah, really?

784
01:28:00,928 --> 01:28:03,180
He writes his own music too.

785
01:28:08,142 --> 01:28:10,305
You make any money at it?

786
01:28:13,399 --> 01:28:15,227
How much?

787
01:28:16,192 --> 01:28:19,235
Last year I made $290,000.

788
01:28:23,702 --> 01:28:25,495
What did you say?

789
01:28:26,621 --> 01:28:30,041
$290,000, before taxes.

790
01:28:33,877 --> 01:28:36,247
It's a very funny thing.

791
01:28:36,589 --> 01:28:40,562
You see a lot of things
that the government is doing,

792
01:28:42,763 --> 01:28:46,929
that it makes you kinda angry.
So you write some songs about it.

793
01:28:48,601 --> 01:28:50,444
You try to reach
as many people as you can,

794
01:28:52,817 --> 01:28:56,022
and in the end you end up paying for

795
01:28:56,106 --> 01:28:58,835
those very same things that made
you angry in the first place.

796
01:29:04,161 --> 01:29:07,066
I guess I accept contradictions.

797
01:29:11,417 --> 01:29:13,910
But I live on a very frugal budget.

798
01:29:14,002 --> 01:29:17,855
I'm saving up so I can buy
an intercontinental ballistic missile.

799
01:29:17,879 --> 01:29:21,031
I think that we ought to change
the balance of power a little bit.

800
01:29:24,265 --> 01:29:27,765
Maybe after dinner
you'll sing something for us?

801
01:29:28,018 --> 01:29:29,671
He didn't bring his instruments.

802
01:29:30,820 --> 01:29:32,816
Well, he can use the piano.

803
01:29:35,859 --> 01:29:38,022
I really don't know.

804
01:29:39,611 --> 01:29:42,866
I'd like to hear something,
I really would, I'm interested.

805
01:29:42,950 --> 01:29:44,206
I really don't know if I could,

806
01:29:44,666 --> 01:29:48,779
under the circumstances
get my rocks off.
