1
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:58,340
<i>"My dear boy,</i>

2
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:03,510
<i>I am working,
can you imagine that?</i>

3
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:08,540
<i>And what's even more surprising,</i>

4
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,600
<i>it's socially useful work, too.</i>

5
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:17,090
<i>I've calculated a new day.</i>

6
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:24,100
<i>It's 7,200 minutes by the
old system.</i>

7
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:28,160
<i>It's not as pointless as
one might think</i>

8
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:34,800
<i>because day and night
are now all twilight.</i>

9
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:40,490
<i>When God created the world,</i>

10
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:44,740
<i>even He needed to have
some notion of time.</i>

11
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:48,730
<i>He divided light
from darkness</i>

12
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:52,990
<i>and called them day and night.</i>

13
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:06,440
<i>I've proposed a new
unit of time:</i>

14
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,870
<i>One twilight</i>

15
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:15,080
<i>because there is no more
diversity in this world.</i>

16
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,510
<i>Your mother and I</i>

17
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,690
<i>are staying in the shelter
beneath the museum</i>

18
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:26,710
<i>together with its staff.</i>

19
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:30,230
<i>We will wait for you here</i>

20
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:35,310
<i>and then we'll go to the
central bunker together.</i>

21
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,950
<i>You can come here
via the street,</i>

22
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:45,200
<i>but you'll have to climb up
the wall first."</i>

23
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:52,960
Good morning.

24
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:58,950
What time is it now?

25
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:02,500
I don't know.

26
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:05,510
Why wake me up then?

27
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:08,380
I feel it's daytime.

28
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:14,210
- Did you turn on the ventilation?
- She is suffocating.

29
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:18,260
Then put on a bandage.

30
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:21,430
Thank you.

31
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:49,220
I'll turn it off.

32
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:53,660
<i>"Dear Eric,</i>

33
00:04:53,890 --> 00:05:00,470
<i>Before all of us - you, mother and I -
become grains of the universe,</i>

34
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:02,780
<i>for each of us is mortal,</i>

35
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:09,320
<i>we'll have a lot of happy hours and days,
even if we use my notion of time.</i>

36
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:19,660
<i>Mother is much better today.</i>

37
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:27,020
<i>We haven't talked that much
in a long time."</i>

38
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:20,100
LETTERS FROM A DEAD MAN

39
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:26,540
- Have you had the inspection yet?
- They are here right now. I am nervous.

40
00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:29,980
Holy God, save and protect me.

41
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:35,000
Take off your clothes and come inside.
I have to go.

42
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:45,440
- Who's in charge?
- Me.

43
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:48,670
Come here.

44
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:55,300
- How many people are here?
- Twelve.

45
00:10:55,510 --> 00:11:00,490
- Is everyone in here?
- Yes, everyone.

46
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:04,780
- This is our guest.
- No, I have a permit.

47
00:11:08,650 --> 00:11:13,190
- Whose children are these?
- They are what is left of the orphanage.

48
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:18,350
There was an orphanage here, 40 children.
Almost all of them are dead now.

49
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:22,210
- So they do not have parents?
- No parents.

50
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:29,110
They never talk.
I think they are in shock.

51
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:34,300
I see. Stuporous state.

52
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:39,350
They understand everything.
Almost everything. But they don't talk.

53
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:45,860
You... Go behind the screen.

54
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:47,920
Maybe it's better to
start with the children...

55
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,720
- No.
- as they should go to sleep soon. Why?

56
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,590
Because!

57
00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:02,840
What is your name?

58
00:12:03,770 --> 00:12:05,420
Look here.

59
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:08,310
Do you hear me?

60
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:36,440
I see.

61
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:45,360
Children don't count.

62
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:49,280
Turn around.

63
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,800
Move your hands up.

64
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,590
Put them down.

65
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:03,980
Turn around.

66
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:09,200
Put on your clothes.

67
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:13,990
- Should I call the old man?
- No need.

68
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:19,460
- Listen, doctor, these children...
- Step aside, you are in the way.

69
00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:25,750
Do you want...
to leave the children here?

70
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:29,690
I don't want anything,
I'm just following the instructions

71
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:34,350
which say the children should be
healthy and with parents.

72
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,100
But that's not possible.

73
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:44,590
You understand what happens if you
leave them here, don't you?

74
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:49,540
It's outside my competence.
Everybody should mind their own business.

75
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:52,870
You're a doctor!
That is your business!

76
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:57,950
They will die anyway.
They're ill.

77
00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:03,630
We can't support the lives of the healthy,
and you want to save the ill!

78
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:09,210
Even if I issued a permit for them,
they would be stopped at the check point.

79
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:13,280
Children without parents
and in catalepsy!

80
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:16,360
I would be shot for
issuing a false permit!

81
00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:18,190
We have martial law!

82
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:22,320
That's final! They will be taken care of
by the special service.

83
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:27,210
- And who will take care of you?
- What's the problem?

84
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:32,370
You will leave them here
and hide yourself in the bunker.

85
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:37,500
But they will come to you anyway,
they will come to you dead,

86
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:40,100
and they will sit before
you just like now.

87
00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:43,990
How will you look
in their dead eyes?

88
00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:47,550
How will you live after that?

89
00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:51,110
Which special service
will help you then?

90
00:14:51,650 --> 00:14:55,080
- How old are you?
- What difference does it make?

91
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:58,010
A big difference.
For you.

92
00:14:58,770 --> 00:15:01,760
Because we don't
need old men either.

93
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:06,190
So you better go find your
birth certificate and shut up.

94
00:15:06,190 --> 00:15:08,490
You're interfering with my work.

95
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:11,750
Everything you want to say,
I've already heard.

96
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:14,570
Ten, twenty, a hundred times!

97
00:15:15,130 --> 00:15:16,850
Come here!

98
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:22,510
You should go the day after tomorrow.
Take nothing unnecessary with you.

99
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:25,580
Clothes, blanket and food, if any.
That is all.

100
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:28,890
I won't go anywhere without children!
You can't...

101
00:15:28,890 --> 00:15:31,830
Don't go then.
That's your choice.

102
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:27,220
By the time of the disaster
every field of human activity

103
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:31,170
had been in a state of grave crisis.

104
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:32,280
Full stop.

105
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:37,170
Scientific efforts were focused on
weapons of mass destruction,

106
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:42,640
each of which could eliminate
the life on the planet.

107
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:43,710
Full stop.

108
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:48,280
Technology had been destroying
nature and the environment.

109
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:50,160
Full stop. New paragraph.

110
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:54,760
Political relations had become
unduly ambitious and paranoid.

111
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:57,130
Full stop. New paragraph.

112
00:16:57,130 --> 00:17:06,020
Art had become inhuman and had been
pandering to vile tastes.

113
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,890
Good morning.

114
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:25,510
I feel like a different person.

115
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:30,770
I feel a wonderful lightness.

116
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:33,940
A complete adaptation.

117
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:37,120
I just need to get used to the cold.

118
00:17:42,170 --> 00:17:46,220
<i>Oh, I forgot:
How is your wife?</i>

119
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:49,040
Bad.

120
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:15,410
Stand still.

121
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:20,360
The doctor mentioned some lists...

122
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:23,920
...in the central bunker.

123
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:35,780
When I came close they stopped talking.
They didn't want me to hear.

124
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:42,470
I am nervous.

125
00:18:47,810 --> 00:18:50,240
We've decided to go today.

126
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:54,290
What about you?

127
00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:01,290
I don't know.

128
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:07,350
I haven't decided yet.

129
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:16,370
Here are the pills for the headache.
Water-soluble.

130
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,690
Thank you very much.

131
00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:25,360
Don't laugh at crazy people.

132
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:28,890
He's no more crazy
than you or I.

133
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:37,460
What's all this paper?

134
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:54,180
I asked you a question.

135
00:19:57,670 --> 00:20:00,480
I was trying to read seismograms.

136
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:07,790
If the war is ongoing,
they should show the explosions.

137
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:11,050
And if not...

138
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:18,620
- Then what?
- Then it is proof.

139
00:20:20,930 --> 00:20:22,670
Proof?

140
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:29,730
You think if you find proof,

141
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:34,330
the world will come back to life?

142
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:42,380
Can't you see...

143
00:20:44,430 --> 00:20:49,810
what's going on around you?

144
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:59,520
Can't you see
what's happening to me either?

145
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:19,870
Do you know when you went crazy?

146
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:30,080
When?

147
00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:35,360
Before all of this started.

148
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:40,790
After you had made your discoveries.

149
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:44,740
After that Nobel prize.

150
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:46,830
That is possible.

151
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:52,790
Now take your medicine.

152
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:34,870
My son thinks we should go
to the central bunker tomorrow.

153
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,720
After lunch.

154
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:42,880
We should take into account
possible problems at the check point.

155
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:47,260
What do you think?

156
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:49,130
That is possible.

157
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:04,040
To be honest,
everything seems so unreal.

158
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:11,110
Has anyone here read
"The Human Mole"?

159
00:23:12,130 --> 00:23:13,990
An interesting book.

160
00:23:17,810 --> 00:23:23,320
How do you imagine
underground mankind?

161
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:33,460
It poses quite serious problems.

162
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:36,590
But what else can we do?

163
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:42,500
That's our only chance.

164
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:46,780
I disagree.

165
00:23:47,890 --> 00:23:50,480
I don't believe that
the world is doomed.

166
00:23:53,550 --> 00:23:56,650
- Are you serious?
- I am.

167
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:59,870
I've formulated a logical theory.

168
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:05,710
As of now I have 25 hypotheses

169
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:09,190
but each of them can be checked.

170
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:12,730
Not all at once, but in time.

171
00:24:16,450 --> 00:24:19,250
I've read book by a scientist

172
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:25,330
that states the human race is in
a state of rapid evolution

173
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:31,020
and can adapt itself to anything.

174
00:24:32,030 --> 00:24:34,560
But the body must be
allowed to breathe.

175
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:39,190
The body should be naked.

176
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:47,170
I've decided to try it.

177
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:50,600
I've already started
breathing exercises.

178
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:53,210
<i>Excuse me...</i>

179
00:24:53,210 --> 00:24:56,510
- Am I talking nonsense?
- Yes.

180
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:13,740
Here, drink this.
It's a painkiller.

181
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:23,850
Drink it.

182
00:25:25,890 --> 00:25:27,540
Drink a bit more.

183
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:06,050
Do you have a photo of Eric?

184
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:10,720
Of course I don't,
there is no such thing.

185
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:15,910
He died outside.

186
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:20,330
Burned.

187
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:22,740
How do you know?

188
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:28,480
I saw it in my dream.

189
00:26:29,970 --> 00:26:33,120
Now try to sleep.

190
00:26:34,950 --> 00:26:37,100
You better go...

191
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:40,240
Don't wait.

192
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:41,160
<i>Attention! Attention!</i>

193
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:45,140
<i>Going outside during curfew hours
is not allowed.</i>

194
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:50,270
<i>Individuals with a curfew pass
should always carry it with them.</i>

195
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:54,210
<i>Attention, using internal tunnels
during curfew hours...</i>

196
00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:09,900
A week ago it was possible to buy
a painkiller on the black market.

197
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:12,940
One ampoule for one can of food.

198
00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:15,090
I'll try to go there now.

199
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:19,840
Be careful, it's curfew time.
You'll be shot on sight.

200
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:24,860
That's all we can do for Anna.

201
00:29:29,670 --> 00:29:31,330
What about escatomon?

202
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:36,540
It's not a medicine,
just a stimulator.

203
00:29:40,610 --> 00:29:42,710
Any news?

204
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:48,220
An order arrived to evacuate
to the central bunker.

205
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:50,070
We'll go today.

206
00:29:50,070 --> 00:29:53,640
- What about the soldiers?
- What about them?

207
00:29:56,570 --> 00:29:59,370
They should know something by now.

208
00:29:59,510 --> 00:30:02,230
They know nothing.
They have their instructions.

209
00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:03,870
What instructions?

210
00:30:03,870 --> 00:30:08,350
The same.
Evacuate to the central bunker.

211
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:11,760
Deep conservation, and so on.

212
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:14,380
Conservation? What's that?

213
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:18,670
Thirty years underground.
Or fifty.

214
00:30:19,230 --> 00:30:21,190
Or maybe forever.

215
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:32,640
That's the end.

216
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:38,460
Our planet is uninhabitable.

217
00:30:42,470 --> 00:30:44,310
That's impossible.

218
00:30:45,350 --> 00:30:50,430
Intuition tells me that it
simply cannot be.

219
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:56,370
It's impossible.

220
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:02,330
I can't believe that.

221
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:05,260
My...

222
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:11,280
My whole family was
burned to death.

223
00:31:12,090 --> 00:31:14,300
Can you believe that?

224
00:31:25,770 --> 00:31:29,270
I don't know.
I've got problems with my head.

225
00:31:29,730 --> 00:31:32,270
Maybe an amnesia.

226
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:34,780
You know...

227
00:31:35,290 --> 00:31:39,420
I should think logically,
make a hypothesis...

228
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:42,730
I really don't know
what I should do.

229
00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:50,790
You need mountain air
and some rest.

230
00:32:21,970 --> 00:32:26,180
- I need some medicine. A painkiller.
- What do you have?

231
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:27,820
Canned food.

232
00:32:31,210 --> 00:32:34,200
- Is this meat?
- Meat. Stored in a cellar.

233
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:36,360
Just follow me.

234
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:02,780
<i>Raid!</i>

235
00:33:13,350 --> 00:33:19,480
<i>Attention! Anyone attempting to breach
the cordon will be shot!</i>

236
00:33:55,810 --> 00:33:57,430
Let me...

237
00:33:59,710 --> 00:34:02,400
Let me on behalf of

238
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:07,370
every museum employee
who is still alive

239
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:12,770
express our deepest sorrow

240
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:17,920
<i>over the death of your wife.</i>

241
00:34:52,010 --> 00:34:54,280
<i>"Dear Eric...</i>

242
00:35:03,510 --> 00:35:06,590
<i>Dear Eric,</i>

243
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:15,290
<i>Some say that children live by the
joy of learning the world.</i>

244
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:22,680
<i>However I am convinced that even
in their happiest moments,</i>

245
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:25,320
<i>children live in fear.</i>

246
00:35:26,210 --> 00:35:30,650
<i>When I was a child, I lived
in fear of locomotives.</i>

247
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:34,400
<i>My parents said that
when I was a baby,</i>

248
00:35:34,670 --> 00:35:40,210
<i>I saw a locomotive
run over a cow.</i>

249
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:43,150
<i>I don't remember that,</i>

250
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:45,730
<i>but I know...</i>

251
00:35:48,530 --> 00:35:50,750
<i>I had nightmares about</i>

252
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:54,790
<i>a huge black locomotive
trying to run me over.</i>

253
00:35:55,900 --> 00:36:01,380
<i>My feet felt rooted to the ground.
I woke up screaming.</i>

254
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:06,470
<i>I've been having that dream again
recently.</i>

255
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:10,910
<i>I am standing on the rail tracks</i>

256
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:14,940
<i>and at the same time I am
driving the locomotive.</i>

257
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:21,460
<i>I keep running towards myself
and I can't stop.</i>

258
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:28,990
<i>My life and my research have turned into
that black merciless locomotive</i>

259
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:33,060
<i>that has now run down
the whole human race.</i>

260
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:40,440
<i>I imagine various people
driving that locomotive:</i>

261
00:36:42,730 --> 00:36:47,250
<i>From the great Niels Bohr
to our President.</i>

262
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:55,730
<i>But the most terrible
nightmare, Eric,</i>

263
00:36:56,720 --> 00:37:00,090
<i>is the one with you standing
on the tracks.</i>

264
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:03,850
<i>My dear boy,</i>

265
00:37:04,390 --> 00:37:07,940
<i>If anything should happen to
me or your mother,</i>

266
00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:11,670
<i>although that's not very likely,</i>

267
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:16,240
<i>I've asked that we be buried
near the red wardrobe</i>

268
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:18,730
<i>with the Egyptian skulls,</i>

269
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:22,340
<i>in the left corner of the storeroom."</i>

270
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:46,410
Yesterday,
after we'd had an argument,

271
00:39:48,490 --> 00:39:54,680
I went ahead and wrote a draft
message for a future civilization

272
00:39:56,040 --> 00:40:02,690
which I hope
will be reborn some day.

273
00:40:03,550 --> 00:40:05,800
I'm sorry, my colleague,
I do not quite understand:

274
00:40:05,810 --> 00:40:07,950
Who are you addressing?

275
00:40:09,190 --> 00:40:12,340
I don't know. Anybody.

276
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:17,380
There will be someone.

277
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:20,250
Visitors from space.

278
00:40:20,510 --> 00:40:22,120
Mutants.

279
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:25,930
Mutants?

280
00:40:27,030 --> 00:40:30,790
I'm sorry but I must go.
I have a lot of work to do.

281
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,220
Excuse me.

282
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:46,930
I think the discussion of this text
can be postponed till tomorrow.

283
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:51,060
Perhaps. Today is not the time.

284
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:54,730
Such a sad day.

285
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:02,140
<i>We should acknowledge the fact</i>

286
00:41:03,050 --> 00:41:05,640
<i>that the whole history of mankind</i>

287
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:09,820
is a history of a slow suicide;

288
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:12,890
of a living matter
that by sheer accident

289
00:41:12,890 --> 00:41:16,320
acquired an ability to think

290
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:22,030
but that did not know what to do
with this fateful ability.

291
00:41:22,030 --> 00:41:23,390
Full stop.

292
00:41:23,390 --> 00:41:26,430
It could not find any better use
for this ability

293
00:41:26,590 --> 00:41:31,350
than invention of the most
effective ways

294
00:41:31,350 --> 00:41:34,060
of global suicide.

295
00:41:34,060 --> 00:41:35,410
Full stop.

296
00:41:35,540 --> 00:41:37,490
From Judas rope...

297
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:42,740
- I can't stand this any longer.
<i>- ...to the latest neutron bomb,</i>

298
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:46,430
<i>genetic, bacteriological,</i>

299
00:41:46,540 --> 00:41:49,950
<i>and the devil knows
what other weapons.</i>

300
00:41:50,170 --> 00:41:54,790
<i>An admirable progress,
the triumph of the mind!</i>

301
00:41:54,940 --> 00:41:56,220
<i>Full stop.</i>

302
00:41:56,500 --> 00:42:00,320
<i>That is the essence of science!</i>

303
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:03,130
Perhaps in some sense...

304
00:42:05,610 --> 00:42:07,660
our colleague is right.

305
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:12,750
What do you mean to say?

306
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:15,990
All the old values are gone.

307
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:19,910
They turned out to be groundless

308
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:26,000
out there.

309
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:31,760
Here under the ground
we will create a new mankind.

310
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:38,500
We'll have a new set
of commandments:

311
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:41,990
"Hate thy neighbour.

312
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:45,390
Hate everyone else.

313
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:49,480
Hate thine own self."

314
00:42:53,130 --> 00:42:57,880
I can imagine what you'll create.

315
00:43:00,090 --> 00:43:01,800
I understand you.

316
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:05,170
It is alien to you.

317
00:43:07,690 --> 00:43:09,740
You are just like my father.

318
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:15,710
Excuse my frankness,

319
00:43:17,330 --> 00:43:19,510
but you're the last humanists.

320
00:43:20,890 --> 00:43:24,420
Like... mammoths.

321
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:35,560
I have to go.

322
00:43:43,430 --> 00:43:45,670
I'll go with you, Father.

323
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,860
<i>Mountains of corpses
and rivers of blood.</i>

324
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:54,350
<i>That's your museum, up there!</i>

325
00:43:55,230 --> 00:43:58,050
<i>What's down here is but
a smoke-screen.</i>

326
00:43:58,050 --> 00:44:01,240
<i>We must finally accept that we
completely failed,</i>

327
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:03,670
<i>that we disgraced ourselves</i>

328
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:08,500
<i>without even using a fraction of
what we were given.</i>

329
00:44:08,690 --> 00:44:11,420
<i>If there is an intellect in space,</i>

330
00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:15,640
<i>it should look on us with
scorn and disdain.</i>

331
00:44:15,850 --> 00:44:20,040
<i>We are nothing but
arrogant monkeys...</i>

332
00:44:36,410 --> 00:44:38,570
<i>"Dear Eric,</i>

333
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:43,520
<i>I am working a lot and am
close to understanding</i>

334
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:47,290
<i>a thing of universal importance.</i>

335
00:44:48,170 --> 00:44:52,380
<i>But my work is hindered by
various distractions.</i>

336
00:44:52,580 --> 00:45:00,380
<i>I'm certain I heard the operator on
duty at the electronic centre shout:</i>

337
00:45:00,530 --> 00:45:05,150
<i>'A computer error,
cancel the missile launch'</i>

338
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:11,450
<i>Yes, he said 'Cancel the
missile launch command!'</i>

339
00:45:13,060 --> 00:45:18,070
<i>He said he was drinking coffee
and he choked...</i>

340
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:21,650
<i>He was 7 seconds too late.</i>

341
00:45:22,010 --> 00:45:25,610
<i>Seven... Perhaps there is
something in this number,</i>

342
00:45:25,610 --> 00:45:28,560
<i>even if we forget
the commonplace things.</i>

343
00:45:29,190 --> 00:45:31,740
<i>By the way, I remember his face.</i>

344
00:45:31,990 --> 00:45:36,830
<i>He went along the hall,
a drop of sweat on his nose.</i>

345
00:45:37,060 --> 00:45:40,890
<i>He was smiling and he unzipped
his pants as he walked.</i>

346
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:45,460
<i>He hanged himself in the bathroom.</i>

347
00:45:47,210 --> 00:45:50,530
<i>He knew there were only
14 minutes left.</i>

348
00:45:53,070 --> 00:45:59,340
<i>Why did this deadly wind have to start
its journey across the world here,</i>

349
00:45:59,820 --> 00:46:02,230
<i>in our miserable town?</i>

350
00:46:02,450 --> 00:46:04,330
<i>Why?"</i>

351
00:47:43,220 --> 00:47:45,660
Your son is not registered!

352
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:48,130
Please wait!

353
00:47:48,130 --> 00:47:50,580
It must be a mistake.

354
00:47:52,140 --> 00:47:54,310
Do you hear me?

355
00:47:54,310 --> 00:47:55,690
Yes I do.

356
00:47:56,410 --> 00:47:59,300
But registration isn't
over yet, is it?

357
00:48:01,300 --> 00:48:03,190
I can't hear anything!

358
00:48:03,340 --> 00:48:05,120
What did you say?

359
00:48:08,670 --> 00:48:11,290
Give me my child!

360
00:48:25,260 --> 00:48:29,680
It's forbidden to go out
to the surface.

361
00:48:29,690 --> 00:48:31,230
I beg you...

362
00:48:31,390 --> 00:48:33,850
You are responsible
for the guards.

363
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:38,210
No, not anymore.

364
00:48:39,020 --> 00:48:41,170
New regulations since morning:

365
00:48:41,710 --> 00:48:46,500
The guards obey no one;
they only follow special orders.

366
00:48:47,050 --> 00:48:49,290
I understand that,
but I must get outside.

367
00:48:49,820 --> 00:48:51,280
Any way will do.

368
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:54,580
Eric is there, Anna is there!

369
00:48:54,590 --> 00:49:01,540
Until there is a special order,
only the dead can go outside.

370
00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:04,940
Call later.

371
00:49:07,970 --> 00:49:09,420
Do you understand?

372
00:49:11,700 --> 00:49:13,080
No.

373
00:49:14,300 --> 00:49:19,210
You can go out through the
funeral tunnel.

374
00:49:19,210 --> 00:49:22,500
Are you willing to take that risk?

375
00:49:23,070 --> 00:49:24,570
Of course.

376
00:49:37,630 --> 00:49:41,770
Be careful, especially at the checkpoint.
There is a side tunnel there!

377
00:50:39,860 --> 00:50:42,730
Give me a gas mask!

378
00:51:52,090 --> 00:51:54,420
Let me through
to the children's department!

379
00:51:54,420 --> 00:51:56,880
It's a place best avoided.

380
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:01,330
- Don't drive yourself crazy.
- He's in there, I feel it!

381
00:52:01,330 --> 00:52:03,070
And you don't let me in!

382
00:52:03,070 --> 00:52:06,200
There are no children
of his age in there!

383
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:08,640
I beg you to let me through!
You're not a father!

384
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:11,280
Okay, okay! Go!

385
00:52:11,630 --> 00:52:13,280
Let him through!

386
00:54:49,140 --> 00:54:50,690
<i>Therefore,</i>

387
00:54:52,840 --> 00:54:59,950
<i>all evidence suggests that the
history of mankind has ended.</i>

388
00:55:01,850 --> 00:55:06,350
<i>It's time to sum up the outcome.</i>

389
00:55:07,380 --> 00:55:13,030
And I think it should be done calmly,
without vulgar histrionics.

390
00:55:16,310 --> 00:55:24,350
Today I want to talk to you as
a dead man to other dead men.

391
00:55:25,790 --> 00:55:27,520
That is - frankly.

392
00:55:31,210 --> 00:55:33,390
Permit me a short speech

393
00:55:33,390 --> 00:55:38,720
in defense of man
as a biological species.

394
00:55:44,210 --> 00:55:48,510
Mankind was a tragic species,

395
00:55:50,050 --> 00:55:55,270
doomed, perhaps,
from the very beginning.

396
00:55:57,280 --> 00:56:00,880
Our fateful tragedy was that

397
00:56:01,660 --> 00:56:07,160
we always strove to
outdo ourselves.

398
00:56:08,290 --> 00:56:12,480
To be better
than nature intended.

399
00:56:14,110 --> 00:56:19,140
We found a place in ourselves
for compassion,

400
00:56:20,730 --> 00:56:25,240
even though this contradicted
the laws of survival.

401
00:56:26,490 --> 00:56:29,840
We had a sense of dignity,

402
00:56:30,860 --> 00:56:34,250
even if it was
always trampled on.

403
00:56:34,980 --> 00:56:37,830
We created masterpieces of art,

404
00:56:38,460 --> 00:56:41,390
yet knew they were
ultimately useless

405
00:56:42,790 --> 00:56:45,240
and short lived.

406
00:56:45,780 --> 00:56:49,790
We found in ourselves
the ability to love.

407
00:56:50,180 --> 00:56:53,430
Oh Lord, it was so difficult!

408
00:56:54,650 --> 00:56:59,970
For inexorable time
caused our bodies, thoughts...

409
00:57:00,350 --> 00:57:03,900
and senses to decay.

410
00:57:04,350 --> 00:57:07,570
But a man continued to love.

411
00:57:08,440 --> 00:57:12,040
And love created art,

412
00:57:12,660 --> 00:57:19,350
an art which reflects our unbearable
yearning for perfection,

413
00:57:20,490 --> 00:57:26,620
our immense despair
and our endless cry of terror,

414
00:57:27,640 --> 00:57:33,440
a howl of desolate
thinking creatures

415
00:57:34,780 --> 00:57:39,490
in the cold and impassive
space desert.

416
00:57:43,310 --> 00:57:50,620
In this room, a lot of hateful words
had been said about mankind,

417
00:57:51,670 --> 00:57:53,610
contemptuous

418
00:57:55,320 --> 00:57:57,060
and scornful.

419
00:57:59,050 --> 00:58:01,830
But I won't throw a stone
at it today.

420
00:58:01,980 --> 00:58:03,410
No.

421
00:58:04,180 --> 00:58:06,080
This is what I say:

422
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:10,130
I loved mankind.

423
00:58:10,660 --> 00:58:15,470
I love it even more now
that it no longer exists.

424
00:58:16,430 --> 00:58:20,110
I love it for its tragic fate.

425
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:23,920
And I want to say to you,
colleagues,

426
00:58:25,900 --> 00:58:27,840
I want to say that

427
00:58:29,960 --> 00:58:31,910
I love you.

428
00:58:35,030 --> 00:58:40,870
There's a moment of truth
for every person.

429
00:58:41,190 --> 00:58:43,660
This one is mine.

430
00:58:47,430 --> 00:58:50,120
Now I will go to my room

431
00:58:51,060 --> 00:58:53,520
and everything will end for me.

432
00:58:54,170 --> 00:58:56,160
After all...

433
00:58:57,090 --> 00:58:59,210
we are adults

434
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:03,820
and death is not so frightening

435
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:09,160
when everything has
already died.

436
00:59:11,810 --> 00:59:13,830
And yet...

437
00:59:14,410 --> 00:59:16,230
Are you really...

438
00:59:22,610 --> 00:59:24,250
My son...

439
00:59:26,780 --> 00:59:28,460
has understood me

440
00:59:29,660 --> 00:59:31,380
and forgives me.

441
00:59:33,550 --> 00:59:38,200
I hope you will also understand

442
00:59:39,760 --> 00:59:41,680
and will not condemn me.

443
01:00:56,790 --> 01:00:59,960
Forgive me, O Lord.

444
01:01:53,990 --> 01:01:56,010
Permit me to express...

445
01:01:59,980 --> 01:02:01,550
our deepest...

446
01:02:04,540 --> 01:02:06,000
and...

447
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:13,680
our deepest...

448
01:02:16,690 --> 01:02:19,230
and most sincere
condolences...

449
01:02:20,590 --> 01:02:26,350
at the untimely death...

450
01:02:29,730 --> 01:02:32,090
of your father.

451
01:02:37,340 --> 01:02:41,280
I've never met another man...

452
01:02:45,690 --> 01:02:47,440
who was...

453
01:02:49,730 --> 01:02:55,140
so committed to art.

454
01:02:56,870 --> 01:02:58,290
You can...

455
01:03:32,390 --> 01:03:36,750
Everybody's underground.
It's the end.

456
01:03:37,220 --> 01:03:41,300
"A wasteland under the cold
void of the sky".

457
01:03:41,300 --> 01:03:44,060
Remember that?
No? A pity.

458
01:03:44,590 --> 01:03:47,490
A long time since I last saw you.

459
01:03:47,850 --> 01:03:50,960
I thought you were dead.
It's in fashion now.

460
01:03:51,450 --> 01:03:55,040
But don't take it to heart.
You look wonderful.

461
01:03:55,440 --> 01:03:59,770
I found that reference book
that you wanted.

462
01:04:00,200 --> 01:04:04,200
Volume 7 only, I'm afraid.
Volume 8 is missing.

463
01:04:05,600 --> 01:04:08,810
By the way I've been thinking
about your idea

464
01:04:08,810 --> 01:04:11,730
that the world hasn't
come to an end.

465
01:04:12,280 --> 01:04:14,740
About your proof, that is.

466
01:04:14,740 --> 01:04:21,100
A nice idea, but very stupid.
Not worthy of you, professor.

467
01:04:21,350 --> 01:04:24,710
What proof can there be?
It is ridiculous!

468
01:04:24,860 --> 01:04:29,340
Even the one who had come to save
mankind called it doomed.

469
01:04:29,340 --> 01:04:31,510
And that was two thousand years ago.

470
01:04:31,510 --> 01:04:34,790
"I've come to save the doomed",
he said.

471
01:04:35,090 --> 01:04:38,790
Want me to tell you a secret?

472
01:04:38,910 --> 01:04:43,200
There was no war.
No. There was no war at all.

473
01:04:43,390 --> 01:04:45,380
What happened was not a war.

474
01:04:45,390 --> 01:04:49,240
It was a fulfilled prophecy.
Doomsday.

475
01:04:49,500 --> 01:04:51,920
The apocalypse!

476
01:04:52,170 --> 01:04:57,030
Everything was programmed
in advance, from birth to death.

477
01:04:57,030 --> 01:05:02,010
Exactly on the predicted day
and hour.

478
01:05:02,110 --> 01:05:05,970
That is why astrology was
always so popular.

479
01:05:05,970 --> 01:05:12,640
All soothsayers and fortune-tellers
predicted with uncanny accuracy...

480
01:05:12,750 --> 01:05:17,830
What other proof is needed?
It's obvious!

481
01:06:15,440 --> 01:06:17,570
<i>"Dear Eric,</i>

482
01:06:18,700 --> 01:06:21,440
<i>Today I woke up, got dressed,</i>

483
01:06:21,780 --> 01:06:26,120
<i>and solved the Dan-Cooper equation
in one hour.</i>

484
01:06:27,200 --> 01:06:30,460
<i>Of course that doesn't mean
anything to you,</i>

485
01:06:30,630 --> 01:06:34,890
<i>but my research institute struggled
with this problem for 30 years,</i>

486
01:06:35,020 --> 01:06:36,850
<i>or maybe more.</i>

487
01:06:38,460 --> 01:06:42,900
<i>Something is wrong with my brain.</i>

488
01:06:43,960 --> 01:06:48,860
<i>If I had 11 tables, I could
calculate the probability</i>

489
01:06:48,860 --> 01:06:52,690
<i>of the survival of living matter.</i>

490
01:06:53,350 --> 01:06:56,080
<i>But I was only able to find 3.</i>

491
01:06:57,470 --> 01:07:01,640
<i>Military reference books are now
priceless on the black market,</i>

492
01:07:01,640 --> 01:07:05,780
<i>because of thick hard covers
and natural paper pages.</i>

493
01:07:06,310 --> 01:07:10,780
<i>They produce a lot of heat
when they're burned.</i>

494
01:07:12,080 --> 01:07:15,840
<i>Books serve a new purpose
nowadays.</i>

495
01:07:20,070 --> 01:07:22,840
<i>Lately...</i>

496
01:07:25,250 --> 01:07:28,740
<i>I've been having the same dream
over and over.</i>

497
01:07:30,740 --> 01:07:33,720
<i>About a bottle of soda water</i>

498
01:07:35,060 --> 01:07:37,480
<i>that I left unfinished.</i>

499
01:07:38,680 --> 01:07:40,470
<i>Why?"</i>

500
01:07:50,920 --> 01:07:55,050
I went out to look for you.

501
01:07:55,930 --> 01:07:59,080
They didn't accept the children.

502
01:07:59,640 --> 01:08:02,690
I've decided to bring them to you.

503
01:08:04,240 --> 01:08:08,570
You did the right thing.

504
01:08:08,570 --> 01:08:12,570
You wouldn't believe what's
happening in the central bunker.

505
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:16,280
It's so overcrowded...

506
01:08:20,150 --> 01:08:23,060
My pass is valid for one day.

507
01:08:24,110 --> 01:08:26,260
I have to go back.

508
01:08:27,100 --> 01:08:29,510
I understand.

509
01:08:30,250 --> 01:08:31,890
How is the pastor?

510
01:08:35,630 --> 01:08:37,610
He's dead.

511
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:20,050
We must leave at once.
Pack your things.

512
01:09:20,500 --> 01:09:22,980
I'm remaining here.
You know that.

513
01:09:24,880 --> 01:09:28,640
- That's a pity.
- Farewell.

514
01:10:32,980 --> 01:10:34,770
I'll be back right away.

515
01:10:38,490 --> 01:10:40,340
I'll bring the firewood.

516
01:10:45,040 --> 01:10:46,970
I'll be right back.

517
01:10:47,510 --> 01:10:49,350
Don't you believe me?

518
01:11:05,830 --> 01:11:08,320
Don't be afraid, I'll be back.

519
01:11:43,400 --> 01:11:44,940
It's late.

520
01:11:45,270 --> 01:11:46,910
Time for bed.

521
01:12:19,510 --> 01:12:21,610
<i>"Dear Eric,</i>

522
01:12:25,380 --> 01:12:31,220
<i>I long wanted to tell you about
that awful night in September.</i>

523
01:12:33,660 --> 01:12:39,020
<i>You came in when your mother
was shouting at me.</i>

524
01:12:39,020 --> 01:12:41,510
<i>Then she slapped my face.</i>

525
01:12:44,030 --> 01:12:48,670
<i>Juveniles do not know mercy
and understanding</i>

526
01:12:51,030 --> 01:12:54,310
<i>but have a tendency to analysis.</i>

527
01:12:55,530 --> 01:12:58,460
<i>I hope this will help you
to understand</i>

528
01:12:59,570 --> 01:13:04,970
<i>that I have always
loved your mother,</i>

529
01:13:06,120 --> 01:13:08,480
<i>and she loved me.</i>

530
01:13:09,320 --> 01:13:11,870
<i>Nothing else matters.</i>

531
01:13:15,300 --> 01:13:16,900
<i>Anyway...</i>

532
01:13:18,360 --> 01:13:21,330
<i>today, according to my own
calendar,</i>

533
01:13:21,700 --> 01:13:25,760
<i>is the 7th twilight
of the first snow month,</i>

534
01:13:27,130 --> 01:13:31,910
<i>which means today is
Christmas Eve."</i>

535
01:13:41,350 --> 01:13:43,160
I want you to remember

536
01:13:44,880 --> 01:13:46,890
that on Christmas Eve

537
01:13:48,700 --> 01:13:55,140
people always tried to bring some
happiness to each other.

538
01:13:58,590 --> 01:14:00,490
They gave presents,

539
01:14:04,480 --> 01:14:06,730
cooked wonderful feasts

540
01:14:08,970 --> 01:14:13,490
or just sat together
in warm, cosy rooms...

541
01:14:17,140 --> 01:14:18,780
and talked.

542
01:14:26,170 --> 01:14:27,710
And then

543
01:14:30,310 --> 01:14:35,190
everybody would go outside to
welcome the first star in the sky.

544
01:14:37,050 --> 01:14:39,280
Whoever saw the first star

545
01:14:42,080 --> 01:14:44,250
was blessed with good luck

546
01:14:44,990 --> 01:14:47,750
and all their wishes were
supposed to come true.

547
01:14:49,280 --> 01:14:54,230
Today we will also go out
to welcome the first star.

548
01:15:01,660 --> 01:15:04,110
The snow has started to fall.

549
01:15:08,180 --> 01:15:10,950
It should always snow on Christmas.

550
01:15:16,720 --> 01:15:19,960
Well, is it time to light the tree?

551
01:15:59,950 --> 01:16:01,490
That's it.

552
01:16:05,720 --> 01:16:08,720
Now we have a real Christmas tree.

553
01:19:51,810 --> 01:19:54,270
<i>"Dear Eric,</i>

554
01:19:56,150 --> 01:20:02,260
<i>I feel that by exerting all of
my will-power,</i>

555
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:07,810
<i>and because I finally found some
purpose in life again,</i>

556
01:20:08,260 --> 01:20:16,570
<i>I've gained the upper hand over
my now enfeebled body.</i>

557
01:20:18,880 --> 01:20:24,010
<i>Another important thing,</i>

558
01:20:29,140 --> 01:20:30,760
<i>Eric,</i>

559
01:20:34,260 --> 01:20:35,980
<i>my dear boy, is this:</i>

560
01:20:36,220 --> 01:20:39,000
<i>Don't leave me alone
in this world!"</i>

561
01:20:50,670 --> 01:20:53,930
<i>And on the sixth day,</i>

562
01:20:54,150 --> 01:20:56,560
<i>from the beginning
of the world's end,</i>

563
01:20:56,810 --> 01:21:00,180
<i>Teresa led them to another place</i>

564
01:21:00,390 --> 01:21:03,190
<i>like the pastor prophesied.</i>

565
01:21:03,630 --> 01:21:07,560
<i>And she left them there
and went away.</i>

566
01:21:08,270 --> 01:21:10,170
<i>And a man adopted them,</i>

567
01:21:10,170 --> 01:21:12,580
<i>a man with no name,</i>

568
01:21:13,210 --> 01:21:16,810
<i>like the pastor prophesied.</i>

569
01:21:17,030 --> 01:21:19,110
<i>And the eldest child</i>

570
01:21:19,120 --> 01:21:24,850
<i>wrote a note about it in his notebook,
like the pastor taught.</i>

571
01:21:25,110 --> 01:21:27,190
<i>He wrote about everything</i>

572
01:21:27,190 --> 01:21:30,180
<i>that happened each
and every day,</i>

573
01:21:30,180 --> 01:21:33,080
<i>until the day of the great exodus.</i>

574
01:21:33,480 --> 01:21:34,930
<i>And it was so:</i>

575
01:21:35,430 --> 01:21:40,490
<i>On the Christmas day he gathered
everyone around the tree</i>

576
01:21:41,090 --> 01:21:42,950
<i>and lit the candles.</i>

577
01:21:43,730 --> 01:21:46,860
<i>And he admonished them by saying:</i>

578
01:21:47,040 --> 01:21:50,610
<i>"Remember:
The world has not died."</i>

579
01:21:51,130 --> 01:21:52,850
<i>That was his exhortation.</i>

580
01:21:53,100 --> 01:21:57,260
<i>And he led them to welcome
the first star.</i>

581
01:21:57,530 --> 01:21:59,200
<i>And he said:</i>

582
01:21:59,410 --> 01:22:02,680
<i>"Look and you shall see a star."</i>

583
01:22:03,300 --> 01:22:05,750
<i>But there were no stars in the sky,</i>

584
01:22:05,860 --> 01:22:08,860
<i>for the darkness
took over the world.</i>

585
01:22:09,810 --> 01:22:11,810
<i>And when the night came,</i>

586
01:22:12,210 --> 01:22:16,270
<i>he lay down near the furnace
and did not get up anymore.</i>

587
01:22:16,530 --> 01:22:20,020
<i>And he said, "I will die soon."</i>

588
01:22:20,470 --> 01:22:22,530
<i>That's what he said.</i>

589
01:22:22,960 --> 01:22:27,010
<i>And then the eldest child
came up to him and asked,</i>

590
01:22:27,020 --> 01:22:31,900
<i>"Can I ask you a question?"</i>

591
01:22:32,290 --> 01:22:34,870
<i>"Yes", he said.</i>

592
01:22:35,310 --> 01:22:38,310
<i>"No", said the eldest child,</i>

593
01:22:39,150 --> 01:22:43,470
<i>"We know that people always tell lies</i>

594
01:22:43,810 --> 01:22:46,940
<i>and tell the truth only when
they are dying.</i>

595
01:22:47,120 --> 01:22:50,910
<i>We will wait until you are dying."</i>

596
01:22:51,780 --> 01:22:56,490
<i>"Ask away", he said.
"It is time."</i>

597
01:22:57,010 --> 01:22:59,070
<i>And they all came up to him</i>

598
01:22:59,400 --> 01:23:01,700
<i>and looked into his eyes.</i>

599
01:23:02,330 --> 01:23:04,870
<i>And the eldest one asked,</i>

600
01:23:05,060 --> 01:23:08,020
<i>"Have you told the truth today?</i>

601
01:23:08,940 --> 01:23:12,030
<i>Do you believe in what you said?"</i>

602
01:23:13,530 --> 01:23:16,630
<i>"Go", he answered.</i>

603
01:23:17,400 --> 01:23:20,080
<i>"Go while you have the strength.</i>

604
01:23:21,550 --> 01:23:23,930
<i>For while a man walks on,</i>

605
01:23:24,900 --> 01:23:27,820
<i>there is still hope for him."</i>

606
01:26:29,180 --> 01:26:33,010
"THERE LIES BEFORE US, IF WE CHOOSE,
CONTINUAL PROGRESS IN HAPPINESS,

607
01:26:33,020 --> 01:26:35,110
KNOWLEDGE, AND WISDOM.

608
01:26:35,120 --> 01:26:37,340
SHALL WE, INSTEAD,
CHOOSE DEATH,

609
01:26:37,340 --> 01:26:40,350
BECAUSE WE CANNOT FORGET
OUR QUARRELS?

610
01:26:40,360 --> 01:26:43,190
WE APPEAL AS HUMAN BEINGS
TO HUMAN BEINGS:

611
01:26:43,190 --> 01:26:47,010
REMEMBER YOUR HUMANITY,
AND FORGET THE REST."
