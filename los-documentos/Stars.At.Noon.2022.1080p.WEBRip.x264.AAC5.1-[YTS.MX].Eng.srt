1
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,922
No meat today.
Sorry, miss.

2
00:03:13,302 --> 00:03:15,434
No coke, miss.
Sprite.

3
00:03:16,305 --> 00:03:17,304
Sprite.

4
00:03:49,503 --> 00:03:50,601
- <i> Senorita?</i>

5
00:03:51,967 --> 00:03:54,308
<i>-Senorita?</i>

6
00:03:56,939 --> 00:03:59,379
<i>Senorita,</i> you tell to me

7
00:03:59,414 --> 00:04:01,381
if you're intending
to remain very long.

8
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:04,879
<i>Senorita?</i>

9
00:04:08,522 --> 00:04:10,423
<i>-Senorita?</i>

10
00:04:14,495 --> 00:04:16,594
<i>Senorita?</i>

11
00:04:16,629 --> 00:04:19,993
If possible
I will wait for you.

12
00:04:21,535 --> 00:04:23,502
<i>-Senorita?</i>

13
00:04:24,098 --> 00:04:25,438
<i>Si, si, si, si.</i>

14
00:04:31,644 --> 00:04:32,973
So good to
see you again.

15
00:05:14,456 --> 00:05:16,654
Young rebels
used to be so sexy.

16
00:05:18,493 --> 00:05:19,624
Aren't you
looking at me?

17
00:05:27,667 --> 00:05:29,667
-Are you coming?
-Yeah.

18
00:05:29,702 --> 00:05:30,932
-Are you coming?

19
00:05:30,967 --> 00:05:31,933
<i>-Si.</i>
-Are you coming?

20
00:05:31,968 --> 00:05:33,737
-Uh-huh.<i> Si.</i>
-So, come!

21
00:05:43,518 --> 00:05:44,913
What a fucking joke.

22
00:06:02,735 --> 00:06:04,900
- You are getting
more skinny, eh.

23
00:06:06,475 --> 00:06:08,871
If you get
any more skinny,

24
00:06:09,874 --> 00:06:11,511
I don't want you
no more.

25
00:06:23,558 --> 00:06:25,789
-Do you have
any talcum powder?
<i>-Que?</i>

26
00:06:38,606 --> 00:06:40,441
No, talcum powder.

27
00:06:43,875 --> 00:06:45,611
I must tell you
something.

28
00:06:54,556 --> 00:06:55,555
Yes.

29
00:06:59,121 --> 00:07:00,659
The moment has come

30
00:07:00,694 --> 00:07:02,595
when I must
take your press card

31
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:04,058
and your letter
of authority.

32
00:07:05,732 --> 00:07:06,797
What are you saying?

33
00:07:09,131 --> 00:07:10,570
You're not a journalist.

34
00:07:13,135 --> 00:07:14,904
Yes, I am.

35
00:07:15,742 --> 00:07:16,807
No, you're not.

36
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:19,139
I am, too,
a journalist.

37
00:07:19,812 --> 00:07:21,746
No, you're not.

38
00:07:21,781 --> 00:07:23,814
Hey, hey. What...
Give me that!

39
00:07:25,983 --> 00:07:28,049
And the press card?

40
00:07:28,084 --> 00:07:29,853
-Where is the press card?
-I don't have my press card.

41
00:07:29,888 --> 00:07:31,789
-Yes, you have.
-No, I don't.
It's back at the motel.

42
00:07:31,824 --> 00:07:33,186
-No, it's not.
-Yes, it is.

43
00:07:37,324 --> 00:07:38,829
It is invalidated.

44
00:07:38,864 --> 00:07:39,863
Who invalidated it?

45
00:07:41,735 --> 00:07:42,734
I am forced to.

46
00:07:46,267 --> 00:07:48,168
One of these days,

47
00:07:48,203 --> 00:07:49,774
the army will
arrest you.

48
00:07:51,008 --> 00:07:52,205
And this letter

49
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:54,812
carries my name.

50
00:07:55,683 --> 00:07:56,781
This is my name.

51
00:07:57,619 --> 00:07:58,651
Veraguas.

52
00:07:58,686 --> 00:08:00,686
-You understand?
-I understand.

53
00:08:00,721 --> 00:08:02,556
Everyone who reads it
sees my name.

54
00:08:02,591 --> 00:08:04,525
Fucking all pimps.
You're all fucking pimps!

55
00:08:05,121 --> 00:08:06,285
Fucking jackass.

56
00:08:08,124 --> 00:08:09,123
- Yes!

57
00:08:10,599 --> 00:08:11,598
Yes!

58
00:08:13,063 --> 00:08:15,899
I left many
messages for you,

59
00:08:16,737 --> 00:08:18,264
but you never responded.

60
00:08:18,299 --> 00:08:19,298
Why that is?

61
00:08:21,137 --> 00:08:22,642
I am forced...

62
00:08:26,175 --> 00:08:28,109
I am forced to wonder.

63
00:08:29,376 --> 00:08:31,211
-You were
forced to wonder?
-Mm-hmm.

64
00:08:32,214 --> 00:08:33,347
I am forced
to tell you that

65
00:08:33,382 --> 00:08:37,019
you said you would
replace my phone
which you broke.

66
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:47,700
I'll be needing
some shampoo.

67
00:08:47,735 --> 00:08:50,901
I will buy for you
the shampoo with
much pleasure.

68
00:08:53,037 --> 00:08:55,576
Very generous,
<i>Subtenente</i> Verga.

69
00:09:15,796 --> 00:09:17,928
I'm waiting for
my chauffeur.

70
00:09:20,768 --> 00:09:22,669
If it is quite okay...

71
00:09:24,431 --> 00:09:28,169
If it is quite okay
not to call me
under this name,

72
00:09:28,204 --> 00:09:29,742
Verga.

73
00:09:29,777 --> 00:09:33,174
My name, it's Veraguas.

74
00:09:33,209 --> 00:09:37,948
And it is
<i>"subtenente".</i>

75
00:09:40,788 --> 00:09:44,020
<i>Subtenente.</i>

76
00:09:54,934 --> 00:09:56,230
- Where do
you wish to go?

77
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:01,367
- You wish
the InterContinental.

78
00:10:01,402 --> 00:10:03,105
- Yes. I wish.

79
00:10:07,177 --> 00:10:10,684
Car reeks big time
even with the mask on.

80
00:11:00,329 --> 00:11:01,361
<i>Senor?</i>

81
00:11:01,968 --> 00:11:03,066
<i>Ola!</i>

82
00:11:49,576 --> 00:11:50,916
- <i> Gracias.</i>

83
00:12:37,525 --> 00:12:39,096
Martini,<i> por favor.</i>

84
00:12:39,131 --> 00:12:40,394
<i>Como estas?</i>

85
00:13:08,424 --> 00:13:09,423
- <i> Gracias.</i>

86
00:13:25,606 --> 00:13:26,946
May I have a cigarette?

87
00:13:30,644 --> 00:13:32,380
Uh, evening.

88
00:13:32,415 --> 00:13:34,514
I have none on me,
I'm sorry.

89
00:13:36,089 --> 00:13:37,187
You're English.

90
00:13:38,025 --> 00:13:39,090
I am.

91
00:13:40,423 --> 00:13:42,060
London, currently.

92
00:13:43,426 --> 00:13:44,491
Where are you from?

93
00:13:46,396 --> 00:13:48,231
Uh, here and there
and yonder.

94
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:50,497
What about yourself?

95
00:13:51,698 --> 00:13:53,236
Didn't we just do that?

96
00:14:00,113 --> 00:14:01,145
Miguel?

97
00:14:03,083 --> 00:14:04,313
Alphonso?

98
00:14:05,283 --> 00:14:06,315
Roberto?

99
00:14:07,648 --> 00:14:09,054
<i>Si.</i>

100
00:14:09,089 --> 00:14:10,121
She's a little wet.

101
00:14:11,355 --> 00:14:12,552
There's too
much vermouth.

102
00:14:17,097 --> 00:14:18,360
Smell the bamboo
in here?

103
00:14:22,201 --> 00:14:23,662
It's not the nicest
smell, is it?

104
00:14:27,338 --> 00:14:28,535
You have the kind of
good manners

105
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:30,042
that eventually
get you killed.

106
00:14:32,112 --> 00:14:33,111
<i>Gracias.</i>

107
00:14:37,546 --> 00:14:40,085
We have 45 minutes
till the bar closes.

108
00:14:41,682 --> 00:14:43,154
Long enough
to get swacked.

109
00:14:44,685 --> 00:14:46,091
Wanna try a gin
with me?

110
00:14:47,061 --> 00:14:48,291
What brought you here?

111
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:51,393
I came on a plane.

112
00:14:53,232 --> 00:14:55,034
I suppose I met
all your motives.

113
00:14:56,070 --> 00:14:57,333
I can tell you
my motives.

114
00:14:58,633 --> 00:15:02,173
I wanted to know
the exact dimensions
of hell.

115
00:15:22,096 --> 00:15:23,359
Are you for sale?

116
00:15:24,659 --> 00:15:26,032
I'm press.

117
00:15:26,496 --> 00:15:27,660
We're all press.

118
00:15:29,499 --> 00:15:31,235
Then we're all
for sale.

119
00:15:33,804 --> 00:15:38,110
I came here as
a special correspondent
up in the north area.

120
00:15:40,081 --> 00:15:41,080
Really?

121
00:15:42,644 --> 00:15:44,446
It's one of
the rougher spots,
is it not?

122
00:15:45,119 --> 00:15:46,118
In a sense.

123
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:48,784
What made you leave?

124
00:15:52,654 --> 00:15:54,093
It was nothing.

125
00:15:55,558 --> 00:15:58,097
Girl scout camp
for refugees.

126
00:15:58,132 --> 00:15:59,395
Right, right, right.

127
00:16:02,499 --> 00:16:03,663
And what about you?

128
00:16:06,173 --> 00:16:08,173
Me? I'm, uh...

129
00:16:08,208 --> 00:16:11,176
I'm here with
the Watts people.

130
00:16:12,476 --> 00:16:14,707
I say "with",
but I'm here alone.

131
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:18,216
The Watts people,
the oil company?

132
00:16:18,713 --> 00:16:21,318
Yeah, on, uh,

133
00:16:21,353 --> 00:16:24,255
a charitable cause,
you could say.

134
00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:26,488
-Please don't go
into detail.

135
00:16:28,195 --> 00:16:29,293
No, I just mean,
how many companies

136
00:16:29,328 --> 00:16:30,261
do you think,
at the moment,

137
00:16:30,296 --> 00:16:32,395
would consider investing
in a place like this?

138
00:16:33,299 --> 00:16:34,727
Not many I'd imagine.

139
00:16:36,104 --> 00:16:37,367
No, next to none.

140
00:16:38,634 --> 00:16:42,834
That's all in the name
of profit, but, uh...

141
00:16:42,869 --> 00:16:44,638
I don't know,
I still that the idea
of throwing

142
00:16:44,673 --> 00:16:48,081
some business
their way has
humanitarian overtones.

143
00:16:53,385 --> 00:16:55,418
Now that we know
each other so well...

144
00:16:58,786 --> 00:17:00,423
...care for some supper?

145
00:17:03,857 --> 00:17:05,692
I think
it's kind of late.

146
00:17:06,893 --> 00:17:08,299
For a price,
I'll sleep with you.

147
00:17:57,713 --> 00:17:59,251
- Your skin
is so white.

148
00:18:00,551 --> 00:18:01,583
It's like

149
00:18:02,586 --> 00:18:04,223
being fucked
by a cloud.

150
00:18:06,854 --> 00:18:08,227
You're just a mist.

151
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:09,558
Yes.

152
00:18:10,825 --> 00:18:12,198
A mist.

153
00:19:57,371 --> 00:19:58,799
Don't panic, baby.

154
00:20:02,376 --> 00:20:03,408
It's your room.

155
00:20:07,876 --> 00:20:09,612
I wanna be paid
in dollars.

156
00:20:15,389 --> 00:20:16,685
Everybody wants dollars.

157
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:20,788
There's talk
they're gonna roll up
the Cordoba.

158
00:20:25,894 --> 00:20:27,025
Roll up?

159
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:28,598
Yeah.

160
00:20:30,833 --> 00:20:31,865
- Fuck me.

161
00:20:32,901 --> 00:20:34,571
Would I have to
pay extra for that?

162
00:20:38,478 --> 00:20:40,412
I have no
dollar supply.

163
00:20:41,514 --> 00:20:44,383
I live entirely on
black-market Cordobas.

164
00:20:53,361 --> 00:20:54,426
Don't worry.

165
00:20:57,827 --> 00:20:59,959
You don't have
to start thinking
how to ditch me.

166
00:21:01,897 --> 00:21:03,435
I'm not here
for your dollars,

167
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:05,305
I'm here for
the air-conditioning.

168
00:21:12,006 --> 00:21:13,907
You're thinking so
hard how to ditch me

169
00:21:13,942 --> 00:21:15,513
that your head
is smoking.

170
00:21:19,948 --> 00:21:22,454
What do you have
to say about that?

171
00:21:22,489 --> 00:21:24,654
I was thinking
about something
quite a bit different.

172
00:21:34,061 --> 00:21:35,995
I commit
adultery often.

173
00:21:46,678 --> 00:21:48,513
I never really
miss anybody.

174
00:21:55,687 --> 00:21:57,885
I feel I'm in
danger of throwing
my life away.

175
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,063
Shall we meet again?

176
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:48,936
Again and again.

177
00:22:50,874 --> 00:22:52,907
Anytime you have 50 US.

178
00:22:52,942 --> 00:22:55,074
Right. Of course.

179
00:22:58,519 --> 00:23:01,487
I don't usually
fall asleep in
somebody else's bed.

180
00:23:04,525 --> 00:23:06,019
I like your style.

181
00:23:08,793 --> 00:23:10,859
Normally,
in my dark heart,

182
00:23:11,928 --> 00:23:13,862
I look down on
the impoverished

183
00:23:13,897 --> 00:23:15,798
lackeys of
pig billionaires

184
00:23:15,833 --> 00:23:17,932
with their poor
report string back.

185
00:23:31,046 --> 00:23:32,210
Take a shower
if you want.

186
00:23:36,722 --> 00:23:38,986
I have running water
in my hotel, baby.

187
00:23:42,090 --> 00:23:44,860
"Impoverished lackeys."

188
00:24:46,594 --> 00:24:48,891
See how fast
the tropics sap you?

189
00:27:40,097 --> 00:27:42,097
<i>-Buenos dias.</i>
-- <i> Buenos dias.</i>

190
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:24,969
No.

191
00:30:15,153 --> 00:30:16,449
-- Hello.
<i>-Hello.</i>

192
00:30:18,422 --> 00:30:20,618
-Hello?
<i>Can you hear me now?</i>

193
00:30:20,653 --> 00:30:22,422
- I've got you.
I've got you fine.

194
00:30:22,457 --> 00:30:23,929
<i>-Okay.</i>
-Hi.

195
00:30:23,964 --> 00:30:25,557
<i>First of all,</i>
<i>it's very early here.</i>

196
00:30:25,592 --> 00:30:27,229
<i>I mean, I'll just say</i>
<i>what I said again.</i>

197
00:30:27,264 --> 00:30:30,166
<i>Why would</i>
<i>a monthly magazine</i>

198
00:30:30,201 --> 00:30:34,566
<i>that specializes</i>
<i>in sustainable</i>
<i>high-class travel,</i>

199
00:30:34,601 --> 00:30:36,403
<i>be interested in</i>

200
00:30:37,241 --> 00:30:39,307
<i>any events,</i>

201
00:30:39,342 --> 00:30:41,947
<i>any person,</i>
<i>any fucking thing</i>

202
00:30:41,982 --> 00:30:44,950
<i>from the continent</i>
<i>of Nicaragua?</i>

203
00:30:44,985 --> 00:30:47,315
Continent? Uh,
your geography is
a little off there, buddy.

204
00:30:47,350 --> 00:30:49,581
But I'm saying that
I can get you
a wonderful piece

205
00:30:49,616 --> 00:30:52,683
on a nature reserve
in, in Costa Rica.

206
00:30:52,718 --> 00:30:55,026
You'll wake up
to the sound of
howler monkeys,

207
00:30:55,061 --> 00:30:56,621
you'll have
a deluxe tent

208
00:30:56,656 --> 00:30:57,722
and a private
bathroom,

209
00:30:57,757 --> 00:30:59,558
which is a real steal
in the midst this pandemic.

210
00:31:00,231 --> 00:31:01,164
<i>Yeah.</i>

211
00:31:01,199 --> 00:31:02,627
<i>Well, I'd love to</i>
<i>be woken up</i>

212
00:31:02,662 --> 00:31:04,695
by howler monkeys
at- 00 a.m.,

213
00:31:04,730 --> 00:31:08,105
<i>but not by you,</i>
<i>Trish. No offense.</i>

214
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:10,668
<i>Is this gonna be</i>
<i>another one</i>
<i>of these, like,</i>

215
00:31:10,703 --> 00:31:12,003
<i>"Send me</i>
<i>X amount of cash</i>

216
00:31:12,038 --> 00:31:14,474
<i>"and you'll never,</i>
<i>ever hear from</i>
<i>me again"?</i>

217
00:31:14,509 --> 00:31:16,443
<i>Because we already</i>
<i>did that.</i>

218
00:31:16,478 --> 00:31:18,544
You're hearing
from me right now.

219
00:31:18,579 --> 00:31:21,646
And if you could just
get me to Costa Rica,

220
00:31:21,681 --> 00:31:24,418
I promise you
I'll get my act
together.

221
00:31:24,453 --> 00:31:26,519
Things aren't
as simple here
as you wanna think.

222
00:31:26,554 --> 00:31:28,356
<i>Okay.</i>

223
00:31:28,391 --> 00:31:30,655
<i>How about this?</i>
<i>Is this simple enough?</i>

224
00:31:30,690 --> 00:31:32,195
<i>Fuck you.</i>

225
00:31:32,230 --> 00:31:34,296
-I am employed by you.

226
00:31:34,331 --> 00:31:39,268
<i>You have never, ever,</i>
<i>been employed by me.</i>

227
00:31:39,303 --> 00:31:42,469
<i>Not never,</i>
<i>not never, ever.</i>

228
00:31:42,504 --> 00:31:44,636
<i>You did some</i>
<i>piece work for us,</i>
<i>Trish.</i>

229
00:31:46,145 --> 00:31:48,508
<i>That's it. You were</i>
<i>like a temp, okay?</i>

230
00:31:50,083 --> 00:31:52,017
-What are you
trying to say?

231
00:31:52,778 --> 00:31:53,811
<i>I'm trying to</i>
<i>say something</i>

232
00:31:53,846 --> 00:31:56,186
<i>along the lines</i>
<i>of what I just said,</i>

233
00:31:56,221 --> 00:31:57,990
<i>which is,</i>

234
00:31:58,025 --> 00:32:00,256
<i>we don't need</i>
<i>your stories about</i>

235
00:32:00,291 --> 00:32:02,060
<i>missing persons</i>
<i>or murder.</i>

236
00:32:02,095 --> 00:32:04,524
<i>I can watch that</i>
<i>on CNN, okay? Just...</i>

237
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:07,362
<i>Why don't you just</i>
<i>admit to yourself</i>
<i>you're not a journalist?</i>

238
00:32:08,233 --> 00:32:09,265
<i>All right?</i>

239
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:10,970
<i>And stop calling me.</i>

240
00:32:12,732 --> 00:32:15,040
-Can I please, uh...
<i>-Trish? Trish?</i>

241
00:32:15,075 --> 00:32:16,239
<i>Do you have my number?</i>

242
00:32:16,802 --> 00:32:18,307
Yep.

243
00:32:18,342 --> 00:32:20,474
<i>Good.</i>
<i>Lose it, okay?</i>

244
00:32:20,509 --> 00:32:23,213
<i>Bye-bye,</i> senorita.
<i>Bye-bye.</i>

245
00:32:28,286 --> 00:32:29,747
Oh, use the other
fucking door

246
00:32:29,782 --> 00:32:31,155
because this one
doesn't open?

247
00:32:31,190 --> 00:32:32,585
Pay in dollars
or use the other
fucking door?

248
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:33,452
Just wait until
American tanks

249
00:32:33,488 --> 00:32:34,994
come and crush
your hopeless country.

250
00:32:38,197 --> 00:32:39,163
Either way
the American tanks

251
00:32:39,198 --> 00:32:41,429
are gonna come
and fucking crush
your country!

252
00:33:20,437 --> 00:33:22,569
-Only chicken today.
-Rum.

253
00:33:39,258 --> 00:33:40,290
- <i> Gracias.</i>

254
00:34:25,337 --> 00:34:27,403
Um...

255
00:34:32,410 --> 00:34:34,278
I'm an American
journalist,

256
00:34:35,611 --> 00:34:38,282
and I'm going
home tomorrow.

257
00:34:41,386 --> 00:34:42,880
Tomorrow
or the day after.

258
00:34:46,457 --> 00:34:47,456
<i>Muchas gracias.</i>

259
00:35:51,588 --> 00:35:52,587
<i>Gracias.</i>

260
00:36:09,034 --> 00:36:10,033
No, I think
it's great.

261
00:36:10,069 --> 00:36:11,936
It's just a matter of
how much time it takes.

262
00:36:29,054 --> 00:36:30,262
- Great.

263
00:36:31,496 --> 00:36:33,265
Um, it should
be fine...

264
00:37:30,951 --> 00:37:32,588
-- Thanks.
-Welcome, sir.

265
00:38:07,493 --> 00:38:09,493
I had a reason
for ignoring you.

266
00:38:12,597 --> 00:38:13,596
It's okay,

267
00:38:16,029 --> 00:38:17,699
whatever my
true feelings.

268
00:38:18,537 --> 00:38:20,031
Oh. I'm sorry.

269
00:38:24,741 --> 00:38:27,775
Consorting with
unescorted women is
no disgrace, Daniel.

270
00:38:27,810 --> 00:38:29,843
No, it wasn't that.
I was...

271
00:38:30,912 --> 00:38:32,879
I was concerned
for your reputation.

272
00:38:38,051 --> 00:38:39,523
Who's that
friend of yours?

273
00:38:41,857 --> 00:38:44,561
He has a project
to grow rice
with rainwater.

274
00:38:45,564 --> 00:38:46,893
What I do
interests him.

275
00:38:48,963 --> 00:38:50,567
He's a Costa Rican cop.

276
00:38:53,704 --> 00:38:55,066
No.

277
00:38:57,070 --> 00:38:58,377
Yes.

278
00:38:59,072 --> 00:39:00,775
He's from the O-E-Jota.

279
00:39:06,112 --> 00:39:07,980
What do you know
about the OIJ?

280
00:39:08,851 --> 00:39:10,620
O-E-Jota.

281
00:39:10,655 --> 00:39:12,116
Those are
the Costa Rican cops.

282
00:39:12,151 --> 00:39:13,986
No, I know that.

283
00:39:15,088 --> 00:39:16,758
This man's not a cop.

284
00:39:18,894 --> 00:39:20,091
Yes, he is.
And he's waiting
for you

285
00:39:20,126 --> 00:39:21,829
outside of the hotel
right now.

286
00:39:24,163 --> 00:39:25,437
What have you got
to do with them?

287
00:39:25,472 --> 00:39:26,735
Or do I not
want to know?

288
00:39:34,877 --> 00:39:36,008
Is it cold enough?

289
00:39:40,586 --> 00:39:42,520
-I'll take a beer,
thank you.

290
00:39:48,759 --> 00:39:50,825
Are you familiar with
the American expression

291
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:53,795
"you've got your ass
in a sling"?

292
00:39:53,830 --> 00:39:55,995
I'm familiar with most
of your expressions.

293
00:39:58,538 --> 00:40:00,065
I'm familiar with
a lot of things.

294
00:40:03,741 --> 00:40:04,971
If you don't mind me
saying so,

295
00:40:05,006 --> 00:40:07,138
I'm familiar with
the way that whores

296
00:40:07,173 --> 00:40:10,141
try desperately
to act as if
they feel superior

297
00:40:10,176 --> 00:40:11,681
to those of us
who pay them,

298
00:40:11,716 --> 00:40:12,715
when actually,

299
00:40:13,751 --> 00:40:15,487
you feel quite inferior.

300
00:40:17,018 --> 00:40:18,985
Actually, I think
you feel ashamed.

301
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:20,789
Ooh.

302
00:40:22,958 --> 00:40:25,860
Why didn't you look at
the waiter just now?

303
00:40:25,895 --> 00:40:27,763
Why don't you
look at me when
I'm talking to you?

304
00:40:30,163 --> 00:40:32,768
'Cause there's
nothing to see.

305
00:40:32,803 --> 00:40:35,133
If there's nothing
to see, then why
don't you look at me?

306
00:40:35,168 --> 00:40:36,673
If I'm no one.

307
00:40:38,578 --> 00:40:39,577
Okay.

308
00:40:41,746 --> 00:40:43,042
Let's back this up
a little bit, okay?

309
00:40:43,077 --> 00:40:44,879
Because, actually,
I'm not the one

310
00:40:44,914 --> 00:40:47,211
the O-E-Jota's
waiting for outside
the InterContinental,

311
00:40:47,246 --> 00:40:48,520
am I?

312
00:40:49,182 --> 00:40:50,918
Well, he's not the OIJ.

313
00:40:52,185 --> 00:40:53,657
O-E-Jota.

314
00:40:56,893 --> 00:40:57,892
All right.

315
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:02,061
-Thank you.

316
00:41:04,637 --> 00:41:06,637
Can I have one of
those Belmonts, please?

317
00:41:18,013 --> 00:41:19,716
Does he say
he's your friend?

318
00:41:21,984 --> 00:41:23,049
He does.

319
00:41:24,349 --> 00:41:25,986
Then don't talk
to him anymore.

320
00:41:27,187 --> 00:41:28,527
Did he say his name?

321
00:41:31,697 --> 00:41:35,325
-He showed me his ID.
-- Okay.

322
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:36,865
You're so fucking
out of it.

323
00:41:39,837 --> 00:41:41,265
Don't speak
with him anymore.

324
00:41:43,005 --> 00:41:44,103
Forget him.

325
00:41:46,008 --> 00:41:47,172
Do you have a gun?

326
00:41:48,142 --> 00:41:49,174
Shoot him.

327
00:41:49,209 --> 00:41:53,046
I don't have a gun.

328
00:41:57,118 --> 00:41:59,624
I bet that
if we leave this
hotel right now,

329
00:42:01,287 --> 00:42:02,594
he'll follow us.

330
00:42:03,894 --> 00:42:06,026
He's waiting
for you outside.

331
00:42:06,061 --> 00:42:07,929
And he's not gonna
let you get away.

332
00:42:10,131 --> 00:42:11,229
You're drunk.

333
00:42:12,936 --> 00:42:14,133
Would I be
sitting here

334
00:42:14,168 --> 00:42:16,003
if I were the littlest
bit sober?

335
00:42:16,709 --> 00:42:18,038
No, no.

336
00:42:21,714 --> 00:42:22,977
Let's go to my room.

337
00:42:25,850 --> 00:42:27,179
Do you have 50 US?

338
00:42:28,688 --> 00:42:29,951
I have 50 US.

339
00:42:31,053 --> 00:42:32,657
Good.

340
00:42:32,692 --> 00:42:35,088
Give it to me,
I need to buy some
shampoo.

341
00:42:35,123 --> 00:42:37,057
We're gonna go
to the Mercado Oriental

342
00:42:37,092 --> 00:42:38,355
and you'll see
we're being followed.

343
00:42:40,733 --> 00:42:41,963
Let's lose the cop.

344
00:42:45,298 --> 00:42:46,297
<i>Senor?</i>

345
00:42:56,683 --> 00:42:58,210
-- Okay.
-- <i> Gracias.</i>

346
00:43:00,379 --> 00:43:02,654
-Come on.

347
00:43:07,991 --> 00:43:09,826
Nothing like running
away in an old Toyota.

348
00:43:25,778 --> 00:43:27,008
That's him.

349
00:43:27,043 --> 00:43:28,680
That's him right there.

350
00:43:28,715 --> 00:43:29,846
They have
the Costa Rican plates,

351
00:43:29,881 --> 00:43:32,079
they look like the new
California ones.

352
00:43:32,114 --> 00:43:34,081
-You know?
No, I don't know.

353
00:43:41,189 --> 00:43:43,156
It's ridiculous.

354
00:43:43,191 --> 00:43:45,190
I'm pretty sure,
he knows where
I'm staying.

355
00:43:49,263 --> 00:43:51,197
We'll lose them down
at the Mercado.

356
00:43:55,203 --> 00:43:56,268
- No.

357
00:44:10,889 --> 00:44:13,186
What's going on?
Is he still there?

358
00:44:13,221 --> 00:44:16,860
I can't see a thing.

359
00:44:37,443 --> 00:44:38,442
<i>Senor.</i>

360
00:44:49,554 --> 00:44:50,861
I understand.

361
00:44:54,262 --> 00:44:55,492
- Thank you.

362
00:45:13,853 --> 00:45:15,413
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
you all right?

363
00:45:17,956 --> 00:45:19,417
You insist
I'm plastered.

364
00:45:20,024 --> 00:45:21,892
I'm fine.

365
00:45:21,927 --> 00:45:23,520
I have the use
of my legs.

366
00:45:23,555 --> 00:45:24,862
Okay.

367
00:45:25,425 --> 00:45:26,424
Okay, very good.

368
00:45:39,978 --> 00:45:42,044
I need to buy
some shampoo.

369
00:45:42,079 --> 00:45:43,815
- You didn't
like the one you stole
from me?

370
00:45:45,346 --> 00:45:46,345
Okay.

371
00:45:48,316 --> 00:45:49,513
I gotta get some rum.

372
00:46:08,435 --> 00:46:09,500
<i>Gracias.</i>

373
00:46:19,512 --> 00:46:21,512
Aww. Throw this away.

374
00:46:21,547 --> 00:46:24,482
There won't be
any elections, babe.
I promise.

375
00:46:24,517 --> 00:46:25,890
Happening next week.

376
00:46:44,009 --> 00:46:47,538
Rum and shampoo.

377
00:46:58,551 --> 00:46:59,550
<i>Gracias.</i>

378
00:47:06,999 --> 00:47:09,230
I should get my hair
washed by a real
professional.

379
00:47:09,265 --> 00:47:11,001
<i>-Gracias.</i>

380
00:47:13,434 --> 00:47:14,631
- <i> Gracias.</i>

381
00:47:30,154 --> 00:47:33,122
- Mm.

382
00:47:33,157 --> 00:47:34,959
Don't blink
or you'll miss
the whole show.

383
00:47:36,721 --> 00:47:38,424
They'll postpone
the election again,

384
00:47:39,658 --> 00:47:41,064
and they'll blame
the US.

385
00:47:43,134 --> 00:47:44,133
It'll happen.

386
00:47:47,369 --> 00:47:48,669
Why?

387
00:47:48,704 --> 00:47:52,504
Why would they risk
losing all of this power
now that they have it?

388
00:47:52,539 --> 00:47:55,705
Because there are
people here who still
have principles.

389
00:47:55,740 --> 00:47:56,948
- Oh.

390
00:47:57,709 --> 00:48:00,314
Like what?
What principles?

391
00:48:03,319 --> 00:48:04,417
Democracy,

392
00:48:05,288 --> 00:48:06,419
equality.

393
00:48:08,357 --> 00:48:09,356
Starbucks.

394
00:48:13,131 --> 00:48:14,559
I didn't know
why I bother.

395
00:48:16,464 --> 00:48:17,595
Me neither.

396
00:48:19,170 --> 00:48:21,170
-Go, go, go!

397
00:48:23,108 --> 00:48:26,373
You, my friend,
just made
1,000 Cordobas.

398
00:48:28,410 --> 00:48:30,443
-Fuck the Rica!
Fuck the Rica!
-You are a piece of work.

399
00:48:45,592 --> 00:48:48,098
Hey. Stop, stop, stop.

400
00:48:48,133 --> 00:48:49,495
What you doing?
-One moment.

401
00:48:49,530 --> 00:48:50,595
What are you doing?

402
00:48:52,137 --> 00:48:53,136
- <i> Gracias.</i>

403
00:48:54,634 --> 00:48:56,568
That Costa Rican
would've had
plenty of time

404
00:48:56,603 --> 00:48:57,435
to shoot you
in your back.

405
00:48:57,471 --> 00:48:59,010
-Right.
-Bang.

406
00:48:59,045 --> 00:48:59,944
I can feel it.

407
00:48:59,980 --> 00:49:02,574
Bang.

408
00:49:30,802 --> 00:49:32,241
It's my pleasure.

409
00:49:43,320 --> 00:49:44,484
This is my hotel.

410
00:49:46,752 --> 00:49:48,257
- Where's
all the money from?

411
00:49:50,756 --> 00:49:52,558
- That's not
your kind of question.

412
00:49:55,497 --> 00:49:56,595
Are you
a little tense?

413
00:49:58,698 --> 00:49:59,730
Should I be tense?

414
00:50:00,766 --> 00:50:03,074
- Watch out
for dog doo doo
and kitty plop.

415
00:50:06,211 --> 00:50:08,277
You're amazing,
you know that?

416
00:50:08,312 --> 00:50:10,741
Nothing stops you.
Not rain,

417
00:50:10,776 --> 00:50:12,545
not car chases,
not dog shit.

418
00:50:20,588 --> 00:50:22,126
-Any calls?
-No.

419
00:50:23,195 --> 00:50:24,194
Hmm.

420
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:40,705
It's, uh,

421
00:50:41,873 --> 00:50:43,774
nice subdued lighting.

422
00:50:49,815 --> 00:50:52,090
-One bulb.

423
00:51:46,410 --> 00:51:47,574
You have a back door.

424
00:51:48,247 --> 00:51:49,246
Mm-hmm.

425
00:51:51,283 --> 00:51:53,184
This room was originally
hired by the hour.

426
00:51:54,253 --> 00:51:55,648
So,

427
00:51:55,683 --> 00:51:56,847
come through the door,

428
00:51:57,751 --> 00:51:59,388
you pay,

429
00:51:59,423 --> 00:52:01,588
nobody sees your face,

430
00:52:01,623 --> 00:52:02,853
nobody gets your name.

431
00:52:04,692 --> 00:52:07,561
For a life like that.

432
00:52:13,536 --> 00:52:15,536
-It's a life like another.

433
00:52:46,371 --> 00:52:49,735
I think maybe
I've made
a big mistake.

434
00:54:46,821 --> 00:54:48,018
Hey, Englishman.

435
00:54:51,859 --> 00:54:54,464
My sweaty,
sweaty Englishman.

436
00:54:55,764 --> 00:54:57,401
You're gonna
be boiled alive.

437
00:55:38,103 --> 00:55:40,708
Black. No milk today.

438
00:55:47,079 --> 00:55:48,419
<i>Por favor.</i>

439
00:55:58,728 --> 00:56:00,629
Isn't that what you
call my motel?

440
00:56:01,027 --> 00:56:02,631
Today? Tomorrow?

441
00:56:18,979 --> 00:56:20,979
Please speak
very loud and slow.

442
00:56:21,883 --> 00:56:23,883
<i>Yes. Okay.</i>

443
00:56:23,918 --> 00:56:25,918
Can I come
to the office?

444
00:56:27,757 --> 00:56:29,757
-Please say yes.
<i>-Yes.</i>

445
00:56:30,694 --> 00:56:31,759
Soon?

446
00:56:32,498 --> 00:56:33,596
<i>Before noon.</i>

447
00:56:33,631 --> 00:56:36,192
Okay, I'll come
right now.

448
00:56:36,227 --> 00:56:38,568
<i>Certainly,</i>
<i>but don't hurry.</i>

449
00:56:39,197 --> 00:56:40,636
<i>Not to the office.</i>

450
00:56:41,738 --> 00:56:43,738
<i>Wait for me</i>
<i>at my club.</i>

451
00:57:14,606 --> 00:57:15,968
Eat me!

452
00:57:24,814 --> 00:57:25,813
<i>Ola.</i>

453
00:58:06,955 --> 00:58:07,954
<i>Si.</i>

454
00:58:58,875 --> 00:58:59,874
<i>Si.</i>

455
00:59:31,677 --> 00:59:34,777
You know
how I like you.

456
00:59:36,011 --> 00:59:39,881
Not only I like you,
I'm fond of you.

457
00:59:41,049 --> 00:59:42,180
You're very beautiful.

458
00:59:48,826 --> 00:59:49,825
<i>Si.</i>

459
01:00:01,135 --> 01:00:02,134
Please.

460
01:00:04,138 --> 01:00:06,974
Please, please
buy a plane
ticket for me.

461
01:00:07,009 --> 01:00:08,008
Please.

462
01:00:09,110 --> 01:00:10,109
No.

463
01:01:08,004 --> 01:01:09,201
Miss Johnson?

464
01:01:11,942 --> 01:01:13,777
Miss Johnson, it's me,

465
01:01:13,812 --> 01:01:15,042
<i>Subtenente</i> Veraguas.

466
01:01:16,144 --> 01:01:17,242
Miss Johnson?

467
01:01:22,414 --> 01:01:23,446
Miss Johnson?

468
01:01:27,518 --> 01:01:28,924
Miss Johnson?

469
01:01:47,043 --> 01:01:48,405
-Hey.
-Hi.

470
01:01:48,440 --> 01:01:50,341
To The InterContinental,
please.

471
01:01:50,376 --> 01:01:51,375
Okay, sir.

472
01:02:02,025 --> 01:02:03,519
Do you have
some time out of you?

473
01:02:04,225 --> 01:02:05,796
Yes, sir.

474
01:02:05,831 --> 01:02:07,292
Are you able to wait
for a few minutes?

475
01:02:07,327 --> 01:02:09,294
If, uh, near the hotel,

476
01:02:09,329 --> 01:02:10,933
if I ran up for
a quick shower,

477
01:02:10,968 --> 01:02:13,397
and you can
take me to the Plaza
de la Revolucion,

478
01:02:13,432 --> 01:02:15,135
to the Ministry?

479
01:02:15,170 --> 01:02:17,940
-Yes, sir. Yeah.
-- Thank you.

480
01:02:30,889 --> 01:02:32,383
We can stop here.

481
01:02:32,418 --> 01:02:33,890
No, but this way today
to go to the...

482
01:02:33,925 --> 01:02:34,858
No, no, no, no.
It's fine.

483
01:02:34,893 --> 01:02:37,124
We can just wait
here for one,
for a moment.

484
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:44,098
Just one moment.

485
01:02:48,170 --> 01:02:49,367
You see that guy?

486
01:02:51,371 --> 01:02:52,568
Costa Rican scumbags.

487
01:02:54,440 --> 01:02:56,539
What a bullshit.

488
01:02:56,574 --> 01:02:59,146
They'll take anyone
at that hotel.

489
01:02:59,181 --> 01:03:01,049
I have a room
at the hotel.

490
01:03:01,084 --> 01:03:02,985
And a girlfriend
at the motel.

491
01:03:04,549 --> 01:03:05,715
See, man,

492
01:03:05,750 --> 01:03:08,991
this hotel is
high security for
foreigners like you,

493
01:03:09,026 --> 01:03:10,025
not for us.

494
01:03:20,433 --> 01:03:23,203
American puppets.
Your compatriots.

495
01:03:24,536 --> 01:03:26,008
I'm not an American.

496
01:03:30,476 --> 01:03:32,047
You've got problems
with your phone?

497
01:03:32,676 --> 01:03:33,884
No, it's fine.

498
01:03:35,151 --> 01:03:36,645
We can't get them
fixed in here.

499
01:03:36,680 --> 01:03:38,614
It's fine,
thank you.

500
01:03:38,649 --> 01:03:40,220
But what would
you do with it?

501
01:03:40,255 --> 01:03:41,958
I will throw it away.

502
01:03:41,993 --> 01:03:44,092
No, man.
Give it to me.

503
01:03:45,458 --> 01:03:47,128
You don't want it,
you understand?

504
01:03:47,163 --> 01:03:49,328
It's, uh,
it's dangerous.

505
01:03:51,596 --> 01:03:53,365
No, man, not for me.

506
01:03:53,400 --> 01:03:55,400
It's easy to
sell in here.

507
01:03:55,435 --> 01:03:57,369
Show me.
I can make
them traceable.

508
01:04:03,410 --> 01:04:05,278
-Can I keep it?
-Yeah.

509
01:04:06,248 --> 01:04:07,445
What do we do now?

510
01:04:07,480 --> 01:04:09,480
We do nothing.

511
01:04:09,515 --> 01:04:12,351
We, uh, we just wait.

512
01:04:12,386 --> 01:04:15,024
Yeah, fuck them.

513
01:04:50,127 --> 01:04:52,193
I live at a height
above the things.

514
01:04:56,430 --> 01:04:57,693
I believe you
can help me.

515
01:05:00,071 --> 01:05:01,565
How did you find
our eggs?

516
01:05:01,600 --> 01:05:03,072
I have chicken
at my house.

517
01:05:04,339 --> 01:05:06,075
I am fond of eggs,

518
01:05:06,110 --> 01:05:08,473
but I...
I don't need eggs.

519
01:05:08,508 --> 01:05:10,442
I need to speak
to your coyote.

520
01:05:10,477 --> 01:05:12,642
I can get beer,
come my friend's house.

521
01:05:12,677 --> 01:05:14,677
And the man
who will get cash
right here

522
01:05:14,712 --> 01:05:16,745
in the Plaza Espana,
is my cousin.

523
01:05:16,780 --> 01:05:18,989
I can buy cash from him
at a good price.

524
01:05:20,157 --> 01:05:21,420
Can I speak to
the coyote now?

525
01:05:29,133 --> 01:05:30,198
<i>Ola.</i>

526
01:05:36,437 --> 01:05:37,502
<i>Gracias.</i>

527
01:05:59,724 --> 01:06:01,163
I want to verify you.

528
01:06:04,663 --> 01:06:06,630
I don't want you
to verify me.

529
01:06:06,665 --> 01:06:09,765
Then I have no money
for you. No US.

530
01:06:09,800 --> 01:06:12,372
That much money
come from
the black market.

531
01:06:12,407 --> 01:06:14,044
I don't want no trouble.

532
01:06:14,079 --> 01:06:15,078
No.

533
01:06:16,081 --> 01:06:17,311
No trouble.

534
01:06:17,346 --> 01:06:20,050
Hmm. No passport,
no dollars.

535
01:06:22,615 --> 01:06:25,616
-Fuck you.
-Fuck is a good word.

536
01:06:25,651 --> 01:06:28,784
Fuck is the property
of the whole world.

537
01:06:32,196 --> 01:06:36,462
You don't speak Spanish.
You don't speak Spanish.

538
01:06:39,533 --> 01:06:41,170
It's no good for you.

539
01:06:41,205 --> 01:06:43,271
Very bad situation.

540
01:06:43,306 --> 01:06:46,142
People from
Department of Defense
came to see me,

541
01:06:47,508 --> 01:06:48,705
and ask for you.

542
01:06:49,807 --> 01:06:52,610
They were very tough.
This is no good.

543
01:06:52,645 --> 01:06:54,183
Okay. Did you
tell them where I live?

544
01:06:54,218 --> 01:06:55,316
No. No.

545
01:06:56,748 --> 01:07:00,222
But they can
find out easy, fast.

546
01:07:02,787 --> 01:07:04,556
Wait, uh...
What did I do?

547
01:07:05,526 --> 01:07:07,460
Some of them
very bad.

548
01:07:08,166 --> 01:07:11,167
Go. Go now. Today.

549
01:07:11,202 --> 01:07:13,169
But, I...
Let's go outside

550
01:07:13,204 --> 01:07:15,105
and then you can
explain to me in Spanish
what's happening.

551
01:07:15,140 --> 01:07:17,470
-I want to understand.
-No.

552
01:07:17,505 --> 01:07:20,605
We can finish
our conversation
right now.

553
01:07:21,773 --> 01:07:23,311
You're my only
friend here.

554
01:07:23,346 --> 01:07:24,741
-Hmm.
-Please.

555
01:07:24,776 --> 01:07:25,874
Yeah?

556
01:07:25,909 --> 01:07:29,218
I hear you have
a new friend now.

557
01:07:37,162 --> 01:07:38,293
Okay, um...

558
01:07:40,165 --> 01:07:41,164
Fuck.

559
01:07:44,268 --> 01:07:46,433
I appreciate
what you've been
able to do for me.

560
01:08:06,785 --> 01:08:10,391
Hi. Uh, I would like
to speak to one of
your guests.

561
01:08:10,426 --> 01:08:12,492
Mr. Daniel DeHaven,
please.

562
01:08:13,363 --> 01:08:14,362
<i>He's not here.</i>

563
01:08:17,796 --> 01:08:19,664
Uh, can I leave
him a message?

564
01:08:20,964 --> 01:08:22,172
<i>He has checked out.</i>

565
01:08:24,440 --> 01:08:25,439
Um...

566
01:08:27,278 --> 01:08:28,344
Checked out?

567
01:08:28,379 --> 01:08:30,675
You mean
he took his luggage?
He's checked out,

568
01:08:30,710 --> 01:08:31,709
he's left?

569
01:08:32,679 --> 01:08:33,678
<i>Yes.</i>

570
01:08:39,884 --> 01:08:41,785
-Any calls?
-- No, miss.

571
01:09:18,263 --> 01:09:20,923
The Englishman
in trouble
is still here.

572
01:09:32,035 --> 01:09:33,870
The<i> senora</i> let you in?

573
01:09:35,874 --> 01:09:37,478
I've been hiding
here all day.

574
01:09:38,481 --> 01:09:40,514
Mm, really?

575
01:09:40,549 --> 01:09:42,813
And just what are
you planning to do?

576
01:09:57,335 --> 01:09:58,862
I need to go
back to my hotel.

577
01:10:02,505 --> 01:10:03,999
They told me
that you left.

578
01:10:07,070 --> 01:10:08,278
What do you
mean "left"?

579
01:10:09,413 --> 01:10:11,347
They said that
you checked out.

580
01:10:11,382 --> 01:10:12,909
You packed up
and you checked out.

581
01:10:16,453 --> 01:10:17,980
They told you
I checked out?

582
01:10:20,787 --> 01:10:22,325
I don't know.
I could have
got it wrong.

583
01:10:22,360 --> 01:10:24,261
It was over
the phone, so...

584
01:10:34,471 --> 01:10:35,668
Maybe I got it wrong.

585
01:10:42,677 --> 01:10:43,742
Um...

586
01:10:50,784 --> 01:10:52,982
Did you know
the Department of Defense
is after you?

587
01:10:55,624 --> 01:10:57,789
You never said anything
about those people.

588
01:11:02,697 --> 01:11:04,664
I didn't really
think that anyone
was after me.

589
01:11:07,768 --> 01:11:09,031
Do you think it now?

590
01:11:12,102 --> 01:11:14,641
Will you help me
get my things
from my hotel?

591
01:11:16,414 --> 01:11:18,513
Certainly not.

592
01:11:19,978 --> 01:11:21,780
No, I'm serious.
I can't. No.

593
01:11:21,815 --> 01:11:23,683
If I help you,
then I'm going to
end up wishing

594
01:11:23,718 --> 01:11:25,014
that I never
met you once.

595
01:11:33,464 --> 01:11:35,563
Unless, of course,
you have a MasterCard
or an Amex.

596
01:11:35,598 --> 01:11:36,762
Because when you
buy me a plane ticket,

597
01:11:36,797 --> 01:11:38,093
then I'll see what
I can do for you.

598
01:11:39,866 --> 01:11:42,064
I do have an Amex,
but I can't use it.

599
01:11:43,100 --> 01:11:44,133
It's a company card.

600
01:11:44,168 --> 01:11:47,707
I tried to get
money out earlier
and it's blocked.

601
01:11:48,809 --> 01:11:50,545
You said that
you didn't leave
the hotel.

602
01:11:50,580 --> 01:11:52,074
Hmm.

603
01:11:52,109 --> 01:11:54,450
That's fishy.
Guy like you without
a card to his own name.

604
01:11:54,485 --> 01:11:55,946
I do have a card
in my own name.

605
01:11:57,554 --> 01:11:59,081
It's in my coat.

606
01:11:59,116 --> 01:12:01,050
At the hotel.

607
01:12:06,926 --> 01:12:08,860
I'm tired.

608
01:12:08,895 --> 01:12:11,962
I'm tired. I'm tired
and I've got to rest.

609
01:12:11,997 --> 01:12:14,701
And every time
I turn around,

610
01:12:16,100 --> 01:12:17,165
they're jamming
something

611
01:12:17,200 --> 01:12:18,771
under somebody
else's fingernails.

612
01:12:46,163 --> 01:12:47,965
This is the worst
time of day.

613
01:12:50,574 --> 01:12:53,003
This is the worst time
of my whole life.

614
01:13:00,881 --> 01:13:04,553
What did you do
when you were
stateside?

615
01:13:04,588 --> 01:13:05,554
If you don't
mind me asking.

616
01:13:07,888 --> 01:13:10,625
A little of this,
and then a little
bit of that.

617
01:13:13,223 --> 01:13:15,432
Mainly a little
of this, I suppose?

618
01:13:17,194 --> 01:13:19,601
I suppose, that's what
you want to hear.

619
01:13:43,055 --> 01:13:45,088
No, no, no,
no, no, no!

620
01:13:45,123 --> 01:13:47,222
Don't go.
You're in danger.

621
01:13:47,257 --> 01:13:48,993
I need go to
the Intercontinental.

622
01:13:50,260 --> 01:13:51,963
Need to know
if I was checked out.

623
01:13:51,998 --> 01:13:52,997
You're in danger.

624
01:14:00,105 --> 01:14:01,137
Hey!

625
01:14:02,305 --> 01:14:03,975
Wait. Hey!

626
01:14:05,748 --> 01:14:06,945
You walk too fast.

627
01:14:09,719 --> 01:14:10,718
I need a drink.

I recognize

He's from around.

658
01:19:05,476 --> 01:19:07,212
It's too bad
you got checked out.

659
01:19:13,924 --> 01:19:15,352
It's too bad
they took your gun.

660
01:19:18,929 --> 01:19:19,928
What gun?

661
01:19:24,396 --> 01:19:26,099
-No, no, no.
It's British Airways.

662
01:19:26,134 --> 01:19:28,101
I don't control
when their offices
are open.

663
01:19:28,136 --> 01:19:29,135
I told you this before.

664
01:19:31,403 --> 01:19:32,567
Just one more call.

665
01:19:32,602 --> 01:19:34,338
<i>Por favor.</i>

666
01:19:34,373 --> 01:19:35,944
-No!
-It's quick!

667
01:19:37,178 --> 01:19:38,474
I can pay you,
for God's sake.

668
01:19:40,951 --> 01:19:42,251
-I can pay.
-No.

669
01:19:42,286 --> 01:19:44,117
Hey, can you help me?
She doesn't understand
what I'm saying.

670
01:19:44,152 --> 01:19:45,151
Ah, miss?

671
01:19:52,556 --> 01:19:53,896
What's she saying?

672
01:19:53,931 --> 01:19:55,231
She wants you
to pay for the room.

673
01:19:55,266 --> 01:19:58,560
I can pay for the room.
I can pay for the room
and the phone.

674
01:19:58,595 --> 01:20:00,133
So, what's this
about British Airways?

675
01:20:00,168 --> 01:20:01,871
You're planning some
kind of quick exit?

676
01:20:03,402 --> 01:20:06,370
Can you call the hotel?
They have
my ticket information.

677
01:20:06,405 --> 01:20:07,503
Ticket information?

678
01:20:07,538 --> 01:20:09,472
-Why not use
your phone?
-Please!

679
01:20:10,376 --> 01:20:11,540
Please, just call them.

680
01:20:26,524 --> 01:20:27,523
- Thank you.

681
01:20:35,566 --> 01:20:36,598
Okay. Will you
ask for me,

682
01:20:36,633 --> 01:20:39,469
Daniel DeHaven,
Watts Oil.

683
01:20:39,504 --> 01:20:41,603
-Do you expect me
to find you there?
-I don't know.

684
01:20:41,638 --> 01:20:44,947
Just see if
I've been completely
checked out.

685
01:20:44,982 --> 01:20:46,278
And maybe someone's
left something for me.

686
01:20:47,380 --> 01:20:48,544
-A clean shirt...
<i>-Ola.</i>

687
01:20:56,125 --> 01:20:57,223
Says you've checked out.

688
01:21:00,195 --> 01:21:01,359
Okay. Can I
speak to her?

689
01:21:05,431 --> 01:21:08,036
--Can I speak to her?

690
01:21:09,699 --> 01:21:11,237
Hello. This is Daniel.

691
01:21:15,474 --> 01:21:16,506
In English, please.

692
01:21:18,114 --> 01:21:21,247
In English, please.
I can't understand.

693
01:21:21,282 --> 01:21:23,579
I can't understand.
She's speaking
in Spanish. Can you?

694
01:21:54,777 --> 01:21:56,381
I can explain
about the ticket.

695
01:21:57,219 --> 01:21:58,449
Just give me a minute.

696
01:22:02,554 --> 01:22:03,553
Excuse me.

697
01:22:06,063 --> 01:22:07,062
Excuse me.

698
01:22:18,735 --> 01:22:19,734
Please.

699
01:22:32,056 --> 01:22:33,121
Is...

700
01:22:33,750 --> 01:22:34,749
Is something funny?

701
01:22:35,653 --> 01:22:37,191
Hmm?

702
01:22:37,226 --> 01:22:39,391
You're still...
You're laughing.

703
01:22:42,330 --> 01:22:43,593
What is your
name, please?

704
01:22:45,102 --> 01:22:46,101
Hmm?

705
01:22:48,138 --> 01:22:49,467
I have a bad head
for names.

706
01:22:53,704 --> 01:22:56,540
- I lived in the US
for four years.

707
01:22:56,575 --> 01:22:59,510
Got married to
my wife there.

708
01:22:59,545 --> 01:23:02,282
My two little girls,
they go to boarding school
in Virginia.

709
01:23:03,252 --> 01:23:04,548
So, don't fuck with me.

710
01:23:05,716 --> 01:23:06,715
Okay?

711
01:23:07,685 --> 01:23:09,157
That is my statement.

712
01:23:12,129 --> 01:23:12,928
Okay.

713
01:23:14,527 --> 01:23:15,757
-I'm going back...
-Okay.

714
01:23:15,792 --> 01:23:18,430
Excuse me.
No. No.

715
01:23:18,465 --> 01:23:20,069
I told you already once.
Don't fuck with me

716
01:23:20,104 --> 01:23:21,796
or I'm going to
fuck with you.

717
01:23:21,831 --> 01:23:23,534
So, you better let me
take your passport.

718
01:23:23,569 --> 01:23:25,668
-You can't have
my passport.
-I can't?

719
01:23:25,703 --> 01:23:28,275
I'm under
the protection of
the Nicaraguan government.

720
01:23:28,310 --> 01:23:29,543
You are?

721
01:23:29,578 --> 01:23:31,377
You're under
the protection of
the Nicaraguan government.

722
01:23:31,874 --> 01:23:33,082
Where are they?

723
01:23:36,219 --> 01:23:38,252
I know your English
friend is inside.

724
01:23:40,553 --> 01:23:42,256
Do you think
this is a fucking game?

725
01:23:44,788 --> 01:23:45,587
Hm?

726
01:23:47,263 --> 01:23:48,592
-I can't talk.
-What do you believe?

727
01:23:49,298 --> 01:23:50,497
What do you believe?

728
01:23:50,533 --> 01:23:53,564
You believe that
you can take this guy
to the Mercado,

729
01:23:54,567 --> 01:23:55,566
fuck him, it's fine,

730
01:23:55,602 --> 01:23:58,602
and then...
...it's finished?

731
01:23:59,242 --> 01:24:00,241
Huh?

732
01:24:01,310 --> 01:24:03,112
-Did you fuck him?
-Let go of me.

733
01:24:03,147 --> 01:24:04,707
-Huh?
-Hey! Let go of me.
Let go of me.

734
01:24:04,742 --> 01:24:05,774
Let go of me!
Let go of me.

735
01:24:05,809 --> 01:24:06,841
You're just
a Costa Rican cop,

736
01:24:06,876 --> 01:24:07,842
and you have
no control over me.

737
01:24:07,877 --> 01:24:11,252
I am listening outside
of your window, bitch.

738
01:24:14,257 --> 01:24:16,488
Do you know how many
people are playing
in your fucking game?

739
01:24:17,623 --> 01:24:19,425
A lot of people
are involved.

740
01:24:21,165 --> 01:24:22,626
-Hm.

741
01:24:23,563 --> 01:24:24,760
You have some
on you.

742
01:24:26,269 --> 01:24:28,203
Huh?

743
01:24:28,238 --> 01:24:30,535
You think you're
going to take
this guy, fuck him,

744
01:24:30,570 --> 01:24:32,636
and then just like that,
you say, "It's finished"?

745
01:24:32,671 --> 01:24:34,836
No. You're going
to have a lot of
explanation

746
01:24:34,871 --> 01:24:36,343
to take care of,
goddammit!

747
01:24:37,775 --> 01:24:40,248
You're just another
fucking cunt
playing games.

748
01:25:17,452 --> 01:25:20,255
I thought you'd gone.

749
01:25:20,290 --> 01:25:21,289
I'm still here.

750
01:25:22,688 --> 01:25:24,424
- I thought
I got rid of you.

751
01:25:24,855 --> 01:25:25,854
Come inside.

752
01:25:34,403 --> 01:25:35,765
Did you see
who was out there?

753
01:25:35,800 --> 01:25:37,206
Yeah. That's why
I came here.

754
01:25:40,508 --> 01:25:41,771
Says he listens
to us fucking.

755
01:25:43,643 --> 01:25:44,807
I can't think.

756
01:25:45,777 --> 01:25:47,183
My mind won't function.

757
01:25:53,389 --> 01:25:54,718
Fuck you.

758
01:25:59,659 --> 01:26:01,461
I don't need it anymore.
I can get rid of it.

759
01:26:03,927 --> 01:26:04,926
- Your phone.

760
01:26:05,830 --> 01:26:06,829
- Yeah.

761
01:26:10,538 --> 01:26:12,604
Who is he?
Who is that Costa Rican?
What's he doing here?

762
01:26:12,639 --> 01:26:13,803
-What's happening?
-I don't know.

763
01:26:14,806 --> 01:26:15,739
I don't know who he is.

764
01:26:15,774 --> 01:26:16,840
I don't know if he's
operating by himself.

765
01:26:16,875 --> 01:26:19,380
I don't...
I don't know who
he's in touch with.

766
01:26:21,714 --> 01:26:23,450
Okay, well, you're
the one that's
supposed to face him,

767
01:26:23,485 --> 01:26:25,386
and I'm the one
that's getting
my windows peeked into.

768
01:26:28,688 --> 01:26:30,886
You came here to
do business, yeah?

769
01:26:30,921 --> 01:26:31,953
Do you have
any contacts?

770
01:26:31,988 --> 01:26:33,361
I don't have
any contacts.

771
01:26:33,726 --> 01:26:34,725
Do you?

772
01:26:36,795 --> 01:26:37,794
Yeah.

773
01:26:38,995 --> 01:26:41,666
I have a half-senile
VC ministro

774
01:26:41,701 --> 01:26:44,273
at the inter turismo
who can't get hard,

775
01:26:44,308 --> 01:26:46,539
and a<i> subtenente</i>
that can.

776
01:26:48,675 --> 01:26:52,446
And they both just
got done cutting me
loose because of you.

777
01:26:56,650 --> 01:26:58,683
I'll be out, all right?
I'll be out by night.

778
01:26:58,718 --> 01:26:59,915
You can't just
leave me now.

779
01:26:59,950 --> 01:27:01,653
That's fucking horrible.

780
01:27:07,364 --> 01:27:08,363
I'm caught.

781
01:27:11,830 --> 01:27:13,027
All right. I'm caught.

782
01:27:25,415 --> 01:27:26,414
I love you.

783
01:27:57,414 --> 01:27:58,446
No.

784
01:28:36,717 --> 01:28:37,782
<i>Gracias.</i>

785
01:28:51,798 --> 01:28:52,797
You're right.

786
01:29:33,972 --> 01:29:36,478
I told them my<i> esposo</i>
would pay for it.

787
01:29:44,785 --> 01:29:45,784
I'm tired.

788
01:29:47,821 --> 01:29:49,183
I'm having my period.

789
01:30:28,565 --> 01:30:29,729
Be gentle.

790
01:30:41,743 --> 01:30:43,842
You never
did it like this
with you wife?

791
01:30:47,815 --> 01:30:49,111
I'm glad you let me.

792
01:30:54,690 --> 01:30:56,151
Please keep me.

793
01:31:28,691 --> 01:31:29,954
<i>Vamos! Vamos! Vamos!</i>

794
01:31:29,989 --> 01:31:31,021
Get out!

795
01:31:31,056 --> 01:31:32,286
Move it!

796
01:31:32,321 --> 01:31:33,727
Let's go! Move it!

797
01:32:39,091 --> 01:32:40,288
- You don't
want to sit up front?

798
01:32:41,665 --> 01:32:42,895
I'm tired.

799
01:32:44,294 --> 01:32:45,634
Need to rest.

800
01:32:49,431 --> 01:32:51,299
Are you sure
you want to
leave with me?

801
01:32:53,974 --> 01:32:55,237
You're almost
out of gas.

802
01:32:56,845 --> 01:32:57,844
I guess so.

803
01:32:59,276 --> 01:33:00,682
I don't know this city.

804
01:33:04,182 --> 01:33:05,753
See, you do need me.

805
01:33:09,121 --> 01:33:10,120
Yeah.

806
01:33:11,189 --> 01:33:12,320
I need you.

807
01:33:23,399 --> 01:33:24,398
Can you pass me
a cigarette?

808
01:33:58,742 --> 01:34:00,137
This is our honeymoon.

809
01:34:36,043 --> 01:34:37,207
I need to sleep.

810
01:34:48,220 --> 01:34:50,253
Let's just die here.

811
01:34:59,132 --> 01:35:00,736
Are we in a hurry?

812
01:35:05,072 --> 01:35:07,171
Let me try and
take a shower first.

813
01:35:10,407 --> 01:35:11,747
I stink.

814
01:35:13,817 --> 01:35:16,213
Didn't you hear me?
I said we have
no towels.

815
01:35:31,098 --> 01:35:34,000
You want me to think
that you're so tough
and cynical.

816
01:35:37,401 --> 01:35:39,170
I know that you like
to be touched.

817
01:35:42,043 --> 01:35:43,878
There's no need
to pretend to cry.

818
01:35:52,581 --> 01:35:53,921
Suck me.

819
01:37:54,505 --> 01:37:55,911
- Excuse me.

820
01:37:56,342 --> 01:37:58,243
Uh, yes.

821
01:37:58,278 --> 01:37:59,442
You want to...

822
01:37:59,477 --> 01:38:01,015
Do you mind,
uh, sitting down

823
01:38:01,050 --> 01:38:03,116
and watching me
eat my breakfast or...

824
01:38:05,483 --> 01:38:07,252
Whatever I'm eating
is delicious.

825
01:38:12,721 --> 01:38:14,325
Beans, eggs, rice.

826
01:38:15,757 --> 01:38:17,229
Not from here.

827
01:38:17,264 --> 01:38:19,297
Mm. Where's it from?

828
01:38:19,332 --> 01:38:22,036
-Costa Rica.
-Ah. Costa Rica.

829
01:38:22,071 --> 01:38:25,006
Of course. I'm sorry.

830
01:38:25,041 --> 01:38:27,470
It's my first time
down in Central America.

831
01:38:27,505 --> 01:38:29,538
I work for
a consulting firm.

832
01:38:29,573 --> 01:38:31,342
Please, have a seat.

833
01:38:32,378 --> 01:38:33,509
It's my treat.

834
01:38:34,644 --> 01:38:36,985
We're the only customers
in here anyway, right?

835
01:38:39,220 --> 01:38:41,583
-It requires money
to eat here, so...
-Mmm.

836
01:38:41,618 --> 01:38:43,552
...you can bet
nobody in this town
has any.

837
01:38:45,259 --> 01:38:46,720
It's a little hot
over here.

838
01:38:46,755 --> 01:38:49,327
Do you mind moving
to the other side?

839
01:38:49,362 --> 01:38:50,999
It's a little shady
over there.

840
01:39:13,056 --> 01:39:14,781
Okay.

841
01:39:14,816 --> 01:39:18,059
It really gets me
how rude everybody
is down here.

842
01:39:18,094 --> 01:39:20,325
The way you
just ordered food was
just so impolite.

843
01:39:22,725 --> 01:39:25,066
-Impolite?
-Mm-hmm.

844
01:39:25,101 --> 01:39:27,101
Nobody says "please"
or "thank you."

845
01:39:27,136 --> 01:39:28,333
I really miss
the States.

846
01:39:29,204 --> 01:39:30,203
Where are you from?

847
01:39:33,076 --> 01:39:34,174
DC.

848
01:39:34,209 --> 01:39:35,505
This mash is pretty
good, though.

849
01:39:44,285 --> 01:39:46,285
What's the full name
of the company
that you work for?

850
01:39:46,320 --> 01:39:47,253
Because with
all these initials,

851
01:39:47,288 --> 01:39:49,750
you just never know
who you're talking to.

852
01:39:49,785 --> 01:39:52,159
You've got...
You've got "PS".

853
01:39:55,494 --> 01:39:56,592
Mm-hmm.

854
01:39:57,298 --> 01:39:58,396
MAPML.

855
01:39:59,564 --> 01:40:01,300
Don't ask me
what that stands for.

856
01:40:02,435 --> 01:40:03,467
And...

857
01:40:05,372 --> 01:40:06,371
Well...

858
01:40:06,868 --> 01:40:08,406
Then there's CIA.

859
01:40:09,508 --> 01:40:11,310
Well, we're actually
out of Connecticut.

860
01:40:12,181 --> 01:40:14,082
And, um,

861
01:40:14,117 --> 01:40:16,513
consulting is such
a weird business.

862
01:40:16,548 --> 01:40:20,616
Weird in the sense that
it gets completely blown
out of proportion.

863
01:40:20,651 --> 01:40:23,652
I'm not kidding.
I can't even believe
what they pay me.

864
01:40:23,687 --> 01:40:25,753
I'm working on
a report right now,

865
01:40:25,788 --> 01:40:28,525
and if I need anything,
anything at all,

866
01:40:28,560 --> 01:40:30,263
snap my fingers,
just like that.

867
01:40:31,365 --> 01:40:33,827
Say I wanted to
hire you to help me,

868
01:40:33,862 --> 01:40:35,433
hire you to
consult for me,

869
01:40:36,832 --> 01:40:40,273
I could just, um,
snap my fingers, and

870
01:40:42,442 --> 01:40:44,211
envelope of $20,000

871
01:40:46,182 --> 01:40:47,379
in your lap,
like that.

872
01:41:00,328 --> 01:41:03,296
Who are you
consulting for
down here?

873
01:41:05,498 --> 01:41:08,301
Who on Earth would
want to do business
in this country?

874
01:41:08,336 --> 01:41:11,634
Well, it's not
this country,
specifically.

875
01:41:11,669 --> 01:41:14,373
You know, um,
Central America
as whole

876
01:41:14,408 --> 01:41:16,441
is kind of like
a gambler's paradise.

877
01:41:16,476 --> 01:41:18,575
You know,
everybody is giving
the odds a shake,

878
01:41:18,610 --> 01:41:20,709
whichever game
they feel like playing.

879
01:41:20,744 --> 01:41:22,711
But, uh,
in all seriousness,

880
01:41:22,746 --> 01:41:25,417
there's, um,
wheat and rice
conglomerates

881
01:41:25,452 --> 01:41:27,815
that are looking out
at the land
around here.

882
01:41:27,850 --> 01:41:29,190
If you can
believe that.

883
01:41:30,226 --> 01:41:31,291
You bet I do.

884
01:41:35,792 --> 01:41:37,792
You're unbelievably
obvious.

885
01:41:39,697 --> 01:41:42,599
So, I mentioned
oil before, and...

886
01:41:44,372 --> 01:41:45,404
- Okay.

887
01:41:48,838 --> 01:41:50,739
Um, anyways,
I mentioned oil

888
01:41:50,774 --> 01:41:52,576
and parts of my report
actually touch

889
01:41:52,611 --> 01:41:54,512
on the petroleum
outlook in the area,

890
01:41:54,547 --> 01:41:57,812
and your friend
actually pops up in it,

891
01:41:57,847 --> 01:41:59,847
a couple of times,
as a matter of fact.

892
01:41:59,882 --> 01:42:02,520
And that is
if the guy you're
traveling with is

893
01:42:02,555 --> 01:42:04,324
the same person
that I'm thinking of.

894
01:42:04,854 --> 01:42:06,326
But...

895
01:42:08,396 --> 01:42:09,824
Anyway, the local
businesspeople

896
01:42:09,859 --> 01:42:12,398
are very level-headed
and serious.

897
01:42:15,469 --> 01:42:17,766
What do you mean
about my friend?

898
01:42:17,801 --> 01:42:19,207
Well, he's one
of the characters.

899
01:42:19,242 --> 01:42:20,835
Haven't you noticed?

900
01:42:20,870 --> 01:42:23,376
He's taking advantage
of the local elections

901
01:42:23,411 --> 01:42:25,279
and meddling with
the balance of power

902
01:42:25,314 --> 01:42:26,610
that was so difficult
to achieve.

903
01:42:34,917 --> 01:42:37,489
-Uh, coffee, please.
-Okay.

904
01:42:41,330 --> 01:42:42,857
What do you mean
about bringing up
my friend?

905
01:42:44,531 --> 01:42:46,300
My report is about
this region,

906
01:42:46,335 --> 01:42:48,764
and balance is
what this region
is all about.

907
01:42:50,768 --> 01:42:53,406
And so, what does
your job have to do

908
01:42:53,441 --> 01:42:55,705
with my friend?

909
01:42:55,740 --> 01:42:58,642
Well, that's
your friend coming
right now, isn't it?

910
01:43:00,613 --> 01:43:01,612
What does your report

911
01:43:01,648 --> 01:43:04,681
have to do
with my friend,
I've asked you!

912
01:43:04,716 --> 01:43:07,387
Well, like I said,
I don't even know
if it's the same person.

913
01:43:07,422 --> 01:43:10,753
He just happened
to wander in
and receive scrutiny,

914
01:43:10,788 --> 01:43:12,260
kinda like right now.

915
01:43:15,628 --> 01:43:16,825
Don't mind me.

916
01:43:16,860 --> 01:43:18,761
- Of course...
Of course not.

917
01:43:18,796 --> 01:43:20,829
Um, you see,
Central American
countries

918
01:43:20,864 --> 01:43:23,535
are looking for
the best way to
achieve balance,

919
01:43:23,570 --> 01:43:26,307
both economically
and politically.

920
01:43:26,342 --> 01:43:27,605
Even if that means
some sort of

921
01:43:27,640 --> 01:43:29,838
American military
involvement, but, um...

922
01:43:32,040 --> 01:43:34,612
It's not really
what we prefer,
is it?

923
01:43:35,780 --> 01:43:38,418
But then again,

924
01:43:39,553 --> 01:43:40,552
why not?

925
01:43:42,886 --> 01:43:43,951
Why not indeed?

926
01:43:45,691 --> 01:43:47,823
I'm just a consultant.
What do I know?

927
01:43:49,024 --> 01:43:50,826
Maybe enough to tell me
what to order.

928
01:43:51,092 --> 01:43:52,663
Oh.

929
01:43:52,698 --> 01:43:54,632
Well, if you're hungry,

930
01:43:54,667 --> 01:43:56,568
you should have
some of what I had.

931
01:43:56,603 --> 01:43:57,833
It's not bad at all.

932
01:43:59,441 --> 01:44:01,034
First gallo pinto
I've seen.

933
01:44:02,741 --> 01:44:04,543
We're getting closer
to Costa Rica.

934
01:44:06,382 --> 01:44:07,480
Is that where
you are, uh,

935
01:44:07,515 --> 01:44:09,647
where you guys
are heading? CR?

936
01:44:09,682 --> 01:44:10,846
What's going on
down there?

937
01:44:12,487 --> 01:44:14,487
CR, Costa Rica.

938
01:44:16,590 --> 01:44:18,084
Nothing special.

939
01:44:18,119 --> 01:44:20,020
Well, I've been
in San Jose
for about a month.

940
01:44:25,764 --> 01:44:29,062
I thought you said
this was your first time
in Central America.

941
01:44:29,097 --> 01:44:30,833
Pretty accommodating guy,
that Vice Minister

942
01:44:30,868 --> 01:44:32,868
in del turismo,
don't you think?

943
01:44:34,102 --> 01:44:36,036
-- <i> Gracias.</i>

944
01:44:36,071 --> 01:44:38,071
He's the one
that got me into
this whole mess.

945
01:44:40,383 --> 01:44:42,581
Made me change
my dollars
into Cordobas.

946
01:44:44,651 --> 01:44:45,749
Don't worry, babe.

947
01:44:46,917 --> 01:44:48,587
He already knows
all about us.

948
01:44:49,656 --> 01:44:51,359
I figured as much.

949
01:44:51,394 --> 01:44:53,625
- I can give you
a pretty good
exchange rate on those.

950
01:44:53,660 --> 01:44:54,923
If that's
what you want.

951
01:44:56,498 --> 01:44:58,498
Somehow, I'm not
surprised to hear that.

952
01:45:01,129 --> 01:45:02,667
Sorry to change
the subject.

953
01:45:02,702 --> 01:45:05,098
The, uh...
The election
interests me.

954
01:45:06,442 --> 01:45:09,377
Maybe we could
take a walk,
find a newspaper.

955
01:45:09,907 --> 01:45:11,973
- I'm thirsty.

956
01:45:12,008 --> 01:45:13,546
- Whores,
they all are.

957
01:45:14,175 --> 01:45:15,944
- Excuse me?

958
01:45:15,979 --> 01:45:18,012
- I mean,
they'll all do it
for enough money.

959
01:45:18,047 --> 01:45:18,879
Any of these women.

960
01:45:18,915 --> 01:45:23,083
Venezuelan, Costa-Rican,
doesn't matter.

961
01:45:23,118 --> 01:45:24,854
Why don't you go
grab one coming
out of church one day

962
01:45:24,889 --> 01:45:27,153
and give it a try,
and you'll see
what I mean.

963
01:45:27,188 --> 01:45:28,792
They're all as
lonely as widows.

964
01:45:28,827 --> 01:45:30,431
They haven't had
a man's hand
on their thighs

965
01:45:30,466 --> 01:45:31,861
since Jesus
was in diapers,

966
01:45:31,896 --> 01:45:33,467
or Moses
had a pacifier.

967
01:45:37,099 --> 01:45:38,406
We should get going,

968
01:45:39,607 --> 01:45:40,705
find that paper.

969
01:45:46,680 --> 01:45:48,845
Cordobas isn't
your only problem,
I hear.

970
01:45:51,014 --> 01:45:52,882
It seems you have
a passport issue
as well.

971
01:45:56,558 --> 01:45:58,426
How long have
you known him?

972
01:45:58,461 --> 01:46:00,494
Huh? Okay.
I know you haven't
known him for that long.

973
01:46:00,529 --> 01:46:01,957
I can tell by
your body language.

974
01:46:01,992 --> 01:46:03,025
Okay? Please.

975
01:46:03,060 --> 01:46:04,894
How do you know
who he is, who
he says he is?

976
01:46:04,929 --> 01:46:06,126
How do you
know he isn't...

977
01:46:06,161 --> 01:46:07,831
Okay. I get it,

978
01:46:07,866 --> 01:46:09,602
and understand
how exotic
everything feels.

979
01:46:09,637 --> 01:46:11,868
Everything is
ten volts higher.
Okay?

980
01:46:12,871 --> 01:46:13,903
And if I saw
somebody like you,

981
01:46:13,938 --> 01:46:15,542
I wouldn't ask
for references.

982
01:46:15,577 --> 01:46:18,578
So, you didn't
ask for references.
Big deal.

983
01:46:18,613 --> 01:46:19,942
It's a mistake,
but it's not a crime.

984
01:46:19,977 --> 01:46:22,076
Just another
absurd fuckhead.

985
01:46:22,111 --> 01:46:23,715
Look, look.
Listen, Ms. Johnson.

986
01:46:23,750 --> 01:46:27,015
Ms. Johnson, listen,
listen. Okay?

987
01:46:27,050 --> 01:46:29,919
I'm just here...
I don't care
what you think of me.

988
01:46:29,954 --> 01:46:31,087
I'm just here
to offer you

989
01:46:31,122 --> 01:46:33,494
the best deal that
I could make
across two borders.

990
01:46:33,529 --> 01:46:35,562
It's real
and it's straight.

991
01:46:35,597 --> 01:46:36,629
I don't understand
what kind of deal

992
01:46:36,664 --> 01:46:37,828
you think is being
offered to you.

993
01:46:41,999 --> 01:46:44,164
I think
you're offering
to screw me.

994
01:46:44,199 --> 01:46:45,605
Well, that is definitely
the one thing

995
01:46:45,640 --> 01:46:46,936
that I am not
offering to do.

996
01:46:48,104 --> 01:46:49,103
Excuse me.

997
01:46:50,172 --> 01:46:51,809
Is that polite
enough for you?

998
01:46:54,913 --> 01:46:56,209
What were you gonna do?

999
01:46:56,244 --> 01:46:57,782
How are you gonna
cross the border?

1000
01:46:57,817 --> 01:47:00,015
By waving
the American flag, huh?

1001
01:47:01,150 --> 01:47:03,216
- Wait! Wait,
wait, wait, wait!

1002
01:47:22,270 --> 01:47:23,511
Okay.

1003
01:47:24,877 --> 01:47:25,975
Are you mad at me?

1004
01:47:27,209 --> 01:47:28,714
Hey, are you
mad at me?

1005
01:47:28,749 --> 01:47:29,913
Are you mad at me?

1006
01:47:29,948 --> 01:47:31,211
I know.
You're mad at me.

1007
01:47:31,246 --> 01:47:32,850
I know you're
mad at me.

1008
01:47:32,885 --> 01:47:34,885
I know you're mad
at me.

1009
01:47:34,920 --> 01:47:37,250
I know you're
mad at me.

1010
01:47:37,285 --> 01:47:38,284
I know you're
mad at me,

1011
01:47:38,320 --> 01:47:40,759
but are you mad at me
to the point of murder?

1012
01:47:40,794 --> 01:47:42,959
- You're
a North American female,

1013
01:47:42,994 --> 01:47:44,257
prostitute drifter

1014
01:47:44,292 --> 01:47:46,226
with a press card
that's been revoked,

1015
01:47:46,261 --> 01:47:48,162
and you drink like
a fucking Apache.

1016
01:47:49,836 --> 01:47:51,704
You're gonna get us
both fucking killed!

1017
01:47:53,268 --> 01:47:55,807
Just please,

1018
01:47:55,842 --> 01:47:58,975
please level
with me.

1019
01:47:59,010 --> 01:48:00,680
- I need to
feel like I'm moving.

1020
01:48:48,356 --> 01:48:49,597
Fuck!

1021
01:50:00,230 --> 01:50:01,966
You don't have
a passport, do you?

1022
01:50:07,006 --> 01:50:08,137
And this whole
bloody mess

1023
01:50:08,172 --> 01:50:09,776
was so you could
turn me in.

1024
01:50:13,210 --> 01:50:14,682
- You're all wet.

1025
01:50:18,380 --> 01:50:21,216
We're passing
into Costa Rica.

1026
01:50:21,251 --> 01:50:23,823
I'm probably their
most-wanted fugitive.

1027
01:50:24,991 --> 01:50:26,760
- That's much
better for you.

1028
01:50:27,763 --> 01:50:29,697
Because from there,

1029
01:50:29,732 --> 01:50:32,128
we can just cross
over into Panama.

1030
01:50:33,131 --> 01:50:34,427
We'll be fine.

1031
01:50:48,311 --> 01:50:50,311
It's better for you
or better for me?

1032
01:51:02,127 --> 01:51:04,160
You really are
a whore.

1033
01:52:25,210 --> 01:52:26,473
- Vaccination.

1034
01:54:41,676 --> 01:54:44,149
Ah.

1035
01:54:44,184 --> 01:54:46,217
I would've thought
you'd been out of
the country by now.

1036
01:54:48,617 --> 01:54:51,585
I thought we had
some sort of
a connection before,

1037
01:54:51,620 --> 01:54:54,159
um, that maybe
you understood.

1038
01:54:54,194 --> 01:54:56,095
I guess it's possible
I was a little bit
too subtle

1039
01:54:56,130 --> 01:54:58,966
but, um,
I'll be more direct.

1040
01:54:59,001 --> 01:55:00,660
Your British friend
interests me,

1041
01:55:00,695 --> 01:55:02,398
and I wanna include
background on him.

1042
01:55:05,106 --> 01:55:06,468
Your report's
all about him?

1043
01:55:06,503 --> 01:55:07,535
You could say that,

1044
01:55:07,570 --> 01:55:09,669
but, look,
we're Americans.

1045
01:55:09,704 --> 01:55:11,605
We're two
Americans, right?
We're friends.

1046
01:55:12,509 --> 01:55:15,048
And, uh, let's
put it this way.

1047
01:55:15,083 --> 01:55:18,744
Your travel companion
works for a rival outfit.

1048
01:55:18,779 --> 01:55:21,318
And we'd like to
fuck up their action.

1049
01:55:21,353 --> 01:55:23,122
It's basically
that simple, so...

1050
01:55:23,157 --> 01:55:24,255
I just need
a signature on it,

1051
01:55:24,290 --> 01:55:25,685
and that signature
has to be yours.

1052
01:55:25,720 --> 01:55:27,357
I'm not
signing anything.

1053
01:55:30,131 --> 01:55:32,263
Don't you know
what an asshole you are?

1054
01:55:32,298 --> 01:55:34,463
Don't you know
what a delusional
asshole he is?

1055
01:55:34,498 --> 01:55:36,069
Giving charts
and documents

1056
01:55:36,104 --> 01:55:38,269
and a whole
economic future
to a rogue state.

1057
01:55:40,702 --> 01:55:43,439
I believe he did it
in the interest
of fairness.

1058
01:55:43,474 --> 01:55:44,607
Of course, he did.
Right?

1059
01:55:44,642 --> 01:55:46,981
--- <i> Gracias.</i>

1060
01:55:47,610 --> 01:55:49,379
-Yeah, he did.
-Yeah.

1061
01:55:49,414 --> 01:55:50,446
Yeah.

1062
01:55:51,515 --> 01:55:52,679
Yeah!

1063
01:55:52,714 --> 01:55:54,384
And what if
the oil's not there?

1064
01:55:57,092 --> 01:55:58,553
Does that
blur the edges
a little bit?

1065
01:56:33,161 --> 01:56:34,292
We have a flat.

1066
01:56:37,132 --> 01:56:39,165
We have to turn
and buy a new one.

1067
01:56:42,302 --> 01:56:43,334
Go back.

1068
01:57:33,650 --> 01:57:35,815
They smuggle stuff
across the border
every night.

1069
01:57:40,558 --> 01:57:42,096
How much can
we pay them?

1070
01:57:54,869 --> 01:57:56,143
A stolen car?

1071
01:57:56,904 --> 01:57:58,772
Stolen, yeah.

1072
01:58:01,480 --> 01:58:03,150
-Give more.
-Uh...

1073
01:58:08,355 --> 01:58:09,585
I have some money.

1074
01:58:11,952 --> 01:58:13,424
Um...

1075
01:58:14,691 --> 01:58:16,328
Yeah. And watch?

1076
01:58:16,726 --> 01:58:17,725
Okay.

1077
01:58:19,201 --> 01:58:21,201
-Yeah?
-Okay.

1078
01:58:21,236 --> 01:58:22,433
Let me grab something.

1079
01:58:32,313 --> 01:58:33,510
I'm gonna change.

1080
01:59:32,967 --> 01:59:34,604
-He's saying it's white?
-Just put that on

1081
01:59:34,639 --> 01:59:37,002
because you can't
cross in a white
thing at night.

1082
01:59:47,586 --> 01:59:49,685
It's not too late
for you to stay
if you want.

1083
02:00:24,788 --> 02:00:26,425
- Move. Move!

1084
02:00:41,607 --> 02:00:42,705
- Let me see.

1085
02:00:45,611 --> 02:00:47,512
-I'm fine. It's fine.
-Okay. Let me see.

1086
02:00:47,547 --> 02:00:48,777
- Let's get down.

1087
02:00:48,812 --> 02:00:50,515
-- Jesus.
-Come.

1088
02:00:54,884 --> 02:00:56,356
We really fucked up.

1089
02:00:59,955 --> 02:01:01,856
Yeah. I fucked up.

1090
02:02:52,067 --> 02:02:53,165
- Cover me up.

1091
02:02:59,646 --> 02:03:00,744
Cover me up.

1092
02:03:03,815 --> 02:03:06,948
Cover me up. Cover me up.
Cover me up. Cover me up.

1093
02:04:11,718 --> 02:04:14,180
I will practice
my English with you.

1094
02:04:14,215 --> 02:04:16,589
Your man from the CIA
saved you from death.

1095
02:04:18,758 --> 02:04:19,988
- The CIA?

1096
02:04:21,024 --> 02:04:22,727
It's obvious, I suppose.

1097
02:04:30,572 --> 02:04:32,836
You know, you work
for despicable people.

1098
02:04:34,576 --> 02:04:37,104
Maybe we could find
a room somewhere.

1099
02:04:37,139 --> 02:04:39,612
The<i> senorita</i> will
find herself a hotel.

1100
02:04:39,647 --> 02:04:42,747
But you,<i> senor,</i>
you come with us
and be arrested.

1101
02:04:42,782 --> 02:04:44,617
No. No.

1102
02:04:44,652 --> 02:04:46,751
-Hey. Hey. Hey!

1103
02:04:47,886 --> 02:04:49,116
Don't.

1104
02:04:49,151 --> 02:04:50,150
Daniel?

1105
02:04:51,252 --> 02:04:52,251
Daniel?

1106
02:04:55,630 --> 02:04:56,794
Daniel!

1107
02:06:38,392 --> 02:06:40,766
- You're
very much like a team.

1108
02:06:40,801 --> 02:06:42,999
We're an unbeatable team.

1109
02:06:43,034 --> 02:06:45,430
Uh, two beers
and a napkin.
<i>Por favor.</i>

1110
02:06:45,465 --> 02:06:47,003
American? English?

1111
02:07:01,723 --> 02:07:04,086
Ugh. It's terrible.

1112
02:07:08,994 --> 02:07:10,356
I don't like
people like you.

1113
02:07:13,196 --> 02:07:14,932
I don't like
giving you money.

1114
02:07:17,266 --> 02:07:19,398
Now, if you just
come over here,

1115
02:07:19,433 --> 02:07:22,335
I need a signature,
please.

1116
02:07:29,311 --> 02:07:31,377
I know it's a little bit
of a nuisance, but...

1117
02:08:15,192 --> 02:08:16,488
That's good.
Thank you.

1118
02:08:17,799 --> 02:08:18,996
I'm not depressed.

1119
02:08:23,563 --> 02:08:24,771
- It's done.

1120
02:10:03,135 --> 02:10:04,629
- What did
they do to you?

1121
02:10:04,664 --> 02:10:06,268
Let me use a telephone.

1122
02:10:10,637 --> 02:10:12,010
I'm coming, too.

1123
02:10:16,511 --> 02:10:17,576
You could let us pass.

1124
02:11:05,967 --> 02:11:07,164
<i>Senorita</i> Johnson.

1125
02:11:10,334 --> 02:11:11,564
What are you
doing here?

1126
02:11:17,539 --> 02:11:19,341
I came to return
your passport.

1127
02:11:24,249 --> 02:11:25,611
I am forced to say

1128
02:11:27,252 --> 02:11:28,449
I am sad today.

1129
02:11:31,058 --> 02:11:32,453
I'm forced to say

1130
02:11:34,721 --> 02:11:36,028
I will miss you.

1131
02:11:44,203 --> 02:11:45,466
In a way...

1132
02:11:51,474 --> 02:11:53,243
In a way,
you were good to me.
