1
00:00:06,672 --> 00:00:11,143
I was really shocked
the first time I saw Ugetsu.

2
00:00:11,878 --> 00:00:15,548
I'd thought of movies like photographs,
a recording of reality.

3
00:00:15,715 --> 00:00:19,085
But watching Ugetsu,
I forgot about all that.

4
00:00:20,219 --> 00:00:24,624
I knew literature could be fantastical,
and I had read fantasy literature,

5
00:00:24,991 --> 00:00:29,195
but I thought movies were supposed
to be faithful reflections of reality.

6
00:00:29,395 --> 00:00:33,666
<i>But with Ugetsu,
I felt as if the world of fairy tales</i>

7
00:00:33,799 --> 00:00:37,370
<i>and fantasy novels
I'd read as a child</i>

8
00:00:37,537 --> 00:00:39,572
<i>had been perfectly
recreated in images,</i>

9
00:00:39,705 --> 00:00:41,741
<i>and this was a huge surprise.</i>

10
00:00:43,376 --> 00:00:46,579
<i>We see this thing called “reality”
with our eyes,</i>

11
00:00:47,013 --> 00:00:49,882
<i>but since there are
many human beings,</i>

12
00:00:50,016 --> 00:00:52,084
<i>there are many realities.</i>

13
00:00:52,752 --> 00:00:56,255
<i>Choosing which
of those many realities</i>

14
00:00:56,422 --> 00:00:58,991
<i>to accept as one's own</i>

15
00:00:59,292 --> 00:01:01,260
<i>has always been
a great problem.</i>

16
00:01:01,427 --> 00:01:03,462
A ghost of the lake!

17
00:01:04,297 --> 00:01:05,631
No...

18
00:01:05,932 --> 00:01:07,867
I'm not a ghost.

19
00:01:09,402 --> 00:01:12,104
I'm a boatman from Kaizu.

20
00:01:13,205 --> 00:01:17,376
There are so many realities
that they turn into a kind of fantasy.

21
00:01:17,777 --> 00:01:21,514
So we can say
Mizoguchi was a supreme realist

22
00:01:21,681 --> 00:01:23,716
while also being
a supreme fantasist.

23
00:01:23,883 --> 00:01:26,752
He appears before us

24
00:01:26,919 --> 00:01:31,991
as an extremely ambivalent figure.

25
00:01:32,391 --> 00:01:35,695
When we speak of temporal realism,

26
00:01:35,861 --> 00:01:38,598
we generally need three things:

27
00:01:38,764 --> 00:01:43,169
events, narration,
and dramatic progression,

28
00:01:43,336 --> 00:01:47,607
and it's a basic principle of realism
that these have to be integrated.

29
00:01:47,907 --> 00:01:53,980
Mizoguchi broke
all those rules with <i>Ugetsu.</i>

30
00:01:54,113 --> 00:01:57,550
<i>First you think it's realistic narrative,
and then just memory,</i>

31
00:01:57,683 --> 00:02:00,920
<i>but it turns out to be
a terrifying world of fantasy.</i>

32
00:02:01,053 --> 00:02:04,557
<i>But just when you think that
that fantasy world is real,</i>

33
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:07,860
<i>you're suddenly thrown
back into reality.</i>

34
00:02:08,027 --> 00:02:10,596
<i>So you have real time
and fantasy time,</i>

35
00:02:10,763 --> 00:02:13,366
<i>real space and fantasy space,</i>

36
00:02:13,532 --> 00:02:15,801
<i>completely mixed together.</i>

37
00:02:15,935 --> 00:02:20,306
What <i>Ugetsu</i> shows us is that
they're all part of a single world.

38
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:23,609
Of all the films that attempt
to pass back and forth

39
00:02:23,776 --> 00:02:26,779
between these different types
of time and space,

40
00:02:26,912 --> 00:02:31,250
Ugetsu is, in my opinion,
the most successful.

41
00:02:31,417 --> 00:02:34,687
The best illustration of this

42
00:02:34,854 --> 00:02:39,425
is when the protagonist, Genjuro,
finally returns home

43
00:02:39,692 --> 00:02:42,361
after all his adventures.

44
00:02:42,528 --> 00:02:48,501
<i>This scene reminds me a lot
of Japanese</i> e-maki <i>picture scrolls.</i>

45
00:02:48,701 --> 00:02:52,605
<i>As you unroll the scroll,</i>

46
00:02:52,905 --> 00:02:57,176
<i>you start off with a subject</i>

47
00:02:57,343 --> 00:03:00,446
<i>and then follow
the progression through time.</i>

48
00:03:00,613 --> 00:03:03,349
<i>Here he enters his house.</i>

49
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:08,054
<i>There’s a sunken hearth
in the living room.</i>

50
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:10,856
<i>When he enters the house,</i>

51
00:03:11,023 --> 00:03:14,126
<i>no fire is burning in the hearth,</i>

52
00:03:14,293 --> 00:03:16,662
<i>but then he walks
around the place,</i>

53
00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:20,332
<i>and suddenly
a fire is burning.</i>

54
00:03:20,499 --> 00:03:24,403
<i>We see the scene of a happy family
surrounding the hearth.</i>

55
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:29,175
<i>His wife,
who should be dead, is alive.</i>

56
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:32,244
<i>That is to say,
she's alive within him.</i>

57
00:03:32,511 --> 00:03:37,049
<i>It's precisely as if
he were speaking with a ghost.</i>

58
00:03:37,349 --> 00:03:39,919
<i>And this is all one long take.</i>

59
00:03:40,086 --> 00:03:44,824
A performance moving through space
like this was totally unprecedented.

60
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:49,562
<i>But I think it's helpful to think
of Mizoguchi in contrast with Ozu.</i>

61
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:54,767
<i>Ozu doesn't move the camera.</i>

62
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:57,002
And he shoots from a low angle.

63
00:03:57,136 --> 00:03:59,305
For example...

64
00:03:59,472 --> 00:04:02,875
at this moment you and I
are speaking at eye level.

65
00:04:03,042 --> 00:04:07,246
Our view of the ordinary world
is determined largely by our eye level.

66
00:04:07,513 --> 00:04:09,882
This is how we come
to discover things.

67
00:04:10,282 --> 00:04:14,253
But shooting from a low angle,
it's as if you're a Peeping Tom.

68
00:04:14,386 --> 00:04:18,023
If a woman wearing a miniskirt
were to stand up

69
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:21,794
in sight of Ozu's low-angle camera,

70
00:04:21,961 --> 00:04:24,363
he'd be arrested for indecency.

71
00:04:25,464 --> 00:04:28,667
<i>At any rate, women back then
were seated throughout his films,</i>

72
00:04:28,801 --> 00:04:32,505
<i>so even with the low angle,
he wasn't doing anything risque'.</i>

73
00:04:32,872 --> 00:04:36,776
<i>But it was still very unusual,</i>

74
00:04:37,676 --> 00:04:40,079
<i>an extremely out-of-the-ordinary
shooting position.</i>

75
00:04:40,246 --> 00:04:43,849
<i>I like to call Ozu
“the reclining god.”</i>

76
00:04:44,583 --> 00:04:47,720
<i>This reclining god
intently watches humanity</i>

77
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:50,422
<i>while lying on his side.</i>

78
00:04:50,556 --> 00:04:55,861
Ozu shoots from a low angle
from beginning to end,

79
00:04:56,028 --> 00:04:58,864
without panning
or moving the camera.

80
00:04:59,865 --> 00:05:04,003
In this sense he's an auteur
of “absolute cinema.”

81
00:05:04,303 --> 00:05:06,305
<i>But Mizoguchi's camera</i>

82
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:11,544
<i>almost never stops
but just keeps moving.</i>

83
00:05:11,677 --> 00:05:15,881
<i>This movement clearly shows</i>

84
00:05:16,715 --> 00:05:21,453
<i>human lives moving,
as quietly as glaciers.</i>

85
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:25,391
<i>That type of human time</i>

86
00:05:25,724 --> 00:05:29,461
<i>is then skewered by historical time
within the frame of the camera.</i>

87
00:05:29,628 --> 00:05:32,865
<i>You can think of it
as historical time</i>

88
00:05:33,032 --> 00:05:35,801
<i>and the time of human drama</i>

89
00:05:36,101 --> 00:05:38,270
<i>moving together simultaneously.</i>

90
00:05:49,782 --> 00:05:53,319
<i>Fumio Hayasaka
was very accomplished...</i>

91
00:05:54,587 --> 00:05:57,356
<i>as a composer
of pure concert music,</i>

92
00:05:57,523 --> 00:05:59,658
<i>but more importantly,</i>

93
00:05:59,825 --> 00:06:04,930
<i>he completely revolutionized
Japanese film music,</i>

94
00:06:05,097 --> 00:06:07,600
<i>which, until then,
had been very old-fashioned.</i>

95
00:06:07,766 --> 00:06:10,603
<i>He almost completely swept away
the old practices.</i>

96
00:06:10,769 --> 00:06:12,771
<i>He had a tremendous influence.</i>

97
00:06:12,905 --> 00:06:16,942
We see this, of course,
in Kurosawa's Hashomon

98
00:06:17,109 --> 00:06:21,213
and <i>Seven</i> Samurai with which
I assume everyone is familiar.

99
00:06:22,281 --> 00:06:24,516
Collaborating with Mizoguchi,

100
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:28,988
Hayasaka created music for <i>Ugetsu...</i>

101
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:37,529
that may in some respects seem
like traditional Japanese music.

102
00:06:38,697 --> 00:06:40,666
<i>When a ghost appears
in traditional stories,</i>

103
00:06:40,799 --> 00:06:43,802
<i>it's usually accompanied
by the distinctive sound of the koto,</i>

104
00:06:43,936 --> 00:06:48,240
<i>but in Ugetsu, Machiko Kyo's character
appears to the strumming of a harp,</i>

105
00:06:48,374 --> 00:06:51,644
<i>which I think suits
a ghost perfectly.</i>

106
00:06:56,315 --> 00:07:00,619
The Japanese flute was replaced
by the conventional Western flute.

107
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:04,123
<i>But for percussion he used
the tsuzumi of Noh theater,</i>

108
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:07,893
<i>as well as
Noh's rhythmic chanting.</i>

109
00:07:16,201 --> 00:07:19,405
<i>One thing I had noticed</i>

110
00:07:19,672 --> 00:07:26,111
was that Japanese composers
who'd watched lots of foreign movies

111
00:07:26,278 --> 00:07:29,181
and listened to a lot of foreign music

112
00:07:29,348 --> 00:07:32,017
made an effort
to insert beautiful melodies

113
00:07:32,151 --> 00:07:36,055
into their film scores
with violins and so on.

114
00:07:36,288 --> 00:07:39,858
But Mizoguchi and Hayasaka

115
00:07:40,025 --> 00:07:44,163
never succumbed
to that temptation for an instant.

116
00:07:45,097 --> 00:07:48,634
The most fundamental aspect
of Japanese music

117
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:51,737
is the hyoshi, or beat.

118
00:07:52,071 --> 00:07:55,674
This may be translated as “rhythm”
in Western languages,

119
00:07:55,841 --> 00:07:58,711
but what's important to remember

120
00:07:58,877 --> 00:08:02,581
is that the sound differs
depending on what the hands strike.

121
00:08:02,748 --> 00:08:07,686
If you try to transfer this kind of rhythm
with variable timbres to Western music,

122
00:08:07,853 --> 00:08:10,923
you wind up using
different percussion instruments.

123
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:13,993
But with this kind of rhythm going on,

124
00:08:14,126 --> 00:08:18,897
it's difficult for melodic instruments
to work their way in.

125
00:08:19,298 --> 00:08:24,703
They just follow the progress
of the rhythmic sounds.

126
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:28,507
This music allows Ugetsu to approach

127
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:31,377
a depiction of the world of unreality

128
00:08:31,543 --> 00:08:36,015
without merely settling

129
00:08:36,482 --> 00:08:39,651
into the conventions of realism.

130
00:08:39,818 --> 00:08:42,454
<i>I believe this is mainly due</i>

131
00:08:42,588 --> 00:08:47,192
<i>to Hayasaka's mastery
of tone color.</i>

132
00:08:47,626 --> 00:08:52,464
<i>While still making use</i>

133
00:08:52,631 --> 00:08:54,733
<i>of tradition,</i>

134
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:57,736
<i>he was able to create
a new, dramatic,</i>

135
00:08:57,903 --> 00:09:02,074
<i>indeed, avant-garde sound
in this film.</i>

136
00:09:12,151 --> 00:09:16,422
<i>From the very beginning...</i>

137
00:09:17,089 --> 00:09:20,893
<i>Mizoguchi understood that a portrayal
of women shouldn't be limited</i>

138
00:09:21,026 --> 00:09:24,630
<i>to topics such as class
and gender discrimination.</i>

139
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:28,233
<i>He was extremely
ahead of his time in Japan</i>

140
00:09:28,367 --> 00:09:31,303
<i>when it came to the issue of gender.</i>

141
00:09:31,437 --> 00:09:33,539
<i>He had great respect for women</i>

142
00:09:33,705 --> 00:09:37,009
<i>precisely because he'd experienced
a lot of woman troubles.</i>

143
00:09:37,876 --> 00:09:41,313
<i>Whenever any of his protégés
had such troubles,</i>

144
00:09:41,447 --> 00:09:44,349
<i>he'd tell them to get in trouble
with more women,</i>

145
00:09:44,483 --> 00:09:48,887
because the more you experience,
the more you learn about life.

146
00:09:49,054 --> 00:09:52,491
So relationships with women
were worth any expense.

147
00:09:52,624 --> 00:09:57,262
This is a man whose own back
had been slashed by a woman.

148
00:09:57,429 --> 00:10:01,200
He had the scars on his back,
not on his hands.

149
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:04,336
I think Mizoguchi

150
00:10:04,536 --> 00:10:08,273
had a great curiosity

151
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:11,844
about sexual desire.

152
00:10:12,878 --> 00:10:16,715
<i>I don't think he was that consumed
by sexual desire himself.</i>

153
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:21,053
<i>I think he thought
men were no match</i>

154
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:25,124
<i>for women's boundless
thirst for existence.</i>

155
00:10:25,591 --> 00:10:29,862
<i>BY portraying women,</i>

156
00:10:30,095 --> 00:10:33,665
<i>he felt the mystery of the world
would be revealed.</i>

157
00:10:33,832 --> 00:10:39,671
<i>When it came to desire
between men and women,</i>

158
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:42,040
<i>he believed in sexual license.</i>

159
00:10:42,207 --> 00:10:46,712
<i>He didn't think people should
question others in that regard.</i>

160
00:10:47,479 --> 00:10:50,749
This has nothing to do

161
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:53,785
with any kind of
women's liberation movement,

162
00:10:53,952 --> 00:10:57,723
but rather with the relationships
between men and women,

163
00:10:57,890 --> 00:11:02,294
and indeed,
the violence of sexuality.

164
00:11:02,461 --> 00:11:05,664
The idea that this violence
is something beautiful

165
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:10,235
was his “protest,”
if you will, against society.

166
00:11:10,369 --> 00:11:13,705
<i>This was so in both
his prewar and postwar films,</i>

167
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:16,074
<i>because I think he saw clearly</i>

168
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:18,911
<i>that sexuality is a force</i>

169
00:11:19,077 --> 00:11:22,581
<i>that is always
at odds with society.</i>

170
00:11:23,749 --> 00:11:27,719
<i>I was without a doubt
influenced by this film,</i>

171
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:30,923
<i>but I think to make
a film like Ugetsu</i>

172
00:11:31,056 --> 00:11:33,192
<i>is something akin to a miracle.</i>

173
00:11:33,325 --> 00:11:37,596
<i>I think Mizoguchi himself saw it
as a kind of miracle.</i>

174
00:11:37,763 --> 00:11:40,966
Given that Japan lost the war,

175
00:11:41,133 --> 00:11:46,305
the closest parallel to Ugetsu
would be Italian neorealism.

176
00:11:46,772 --> 00:11:50,242
Ugetsu <i>is similar.</i>

177
00:11:50,442 --> 00:11:56,248
<i>You have the mother,
played by Kinuyo Tanaka,</i>

178
00:11:56,548 --> 00:11:59,718
<i>who's attacked by bandits</i>

179
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:04,890
<i>who roam the land like Wolves
in a time of War.</i>

180
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:09,628
<i>Tanaka's character</i>

181
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:13,699
<i>falls into their clutches
and is killed.</i>

182
00:12:13,966 --> 00:12:18,904
<i>It's interesting that for this sequence,
Mizoguchi trades his tracking shots,</i>

183
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:21,006
<i>which have such formal beauty,</i>

184
00:12:21,173 --> 00:12:24,042
<i>for documentary-like shots</i>

185
00:12:24,176 --> 00:12:27,546
<i>that feel like something
from a newsreel.</i>

186
00:12:27,713 --> 00:12:31,850
<i>They're astonishingly realistic.</i>

187
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:35,787
<i>In this scene,
the mercenaries stab the woman</i>

188
00:12:35,954 --> 00:12:39,057
<i>and steal her food.</i>

189
00:12:39,424 --> 00:12:43,795
<i>She's writhing in pain
in the foreground,</i>

190
00:12:43,962 --> 00:12:46,064
<i>while in the background,</i>

191
00:12:46,198 --> 00:12:49,368
<i>the mercenaries
are eating the food.</i>

192
00:12:49,534 --> 00:12:52,504
<i>These two things are happening
in the same frame.</i>

193
00:12:53,338 --> 00:12:55,107
<i>You have this realism</i>

194
00:12:55,240 --> 00:13:00,279
<i>set against the fantasy of a man
caught up in the world of the dead.</i>

195
00:13:00,646 --> 00:13:03,282
<i>What's fascinating is that
the movie camera,</i>

196
00:13:03,448 --> 00:13:06,985
<i>essentially the incarnation
of photographic realism,</i>

197
00:13:07,152 --> 00:13:12,724
<i>has the expressive power
to juxtapose these two worlds.</i>

198
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:16,261
<i>No matter how often
we watch Ugetsu,</i>

199
00:13:16,428 --> 00:13:20,565
<i>we learn something new each time
about the possibilities of cinema.</i>
