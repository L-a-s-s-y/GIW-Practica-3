1
00:03:06,797 --> 00:03:10,958
Boat People

2
00:04:02,493 --> 00:04:04,405
Don't look at the camera...

3
00:04:27,758 --> 00:04:30,594
Greet our Japanese friend Mr. Akutagawa.

4
00:04:33,924 --> 00:04:36,680
Thank you.

5
00:04:38,729 --> 00:04:41,530
Mr. Akutagawa is a world-famous
photo-journalist.

6
00:04:41,732 --> 00:04:43,452
He took our good news

7
00:04:43,654 --> 00:04:45,726
to the world three years ago.

8
00:04:45,936 --> 00:04:47,735
Today he has come back to our country...

9
00:04:47,938 --> 00:04:48,815
to photograph

10
00:04:49,019 --> 00:04:52,094
the children of the Socialist Republic
of Vietnam...

11
00:04:52,302 --> 00:04:54,660
and to show our friend
on other countries...

12
00:04:54,865 --> 00:04:59,385
the new face of ourjov and happiness.

13
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:02,511
Let's show Mr. Akutagawa
our highest respect.

14
00:05:02,713 --> 00:05:04,193
Now we've seen

15
00:05:04,394 --> 00:05:05,431
how well Mr. Akutagawa works...

16
00:05:05,636 --> 00:05:07,036
and how muck he loves us.

17
00:05:07,237 --> 00:05:08,638
We were singing to welcome him...

18
00:05:08,839 --> 00:05:10,559
but he did't forget his job.

19
00:05:10,761 --> 00:05:12,799
I hope we can all follow his example...

20
00:05:13,003 --> 00:05:14,802
and show the same devotion

21
00:05:15,005 --> 00:05:16,759
to our own work.

22
00:05:21,812 --> 00:05:29,613
Go on!

23
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:34,819
That's Right...

24
00:05:35,025 --> 00:05:43,225
Go on!

25
00:05:55,125 --> 00:05:59,088
Last night I dreamed of Chairman Ho.

26
00:05:59,289 --> 00:06:03,002
He has a long, long beard
and silvery hair.

27
00:06:03,213 --> 00:06:10,980
I long to hold him,
to snower kisses on him.

28
00:06:11,181 --> 00:06:15,303
May Chairman Ho live 10000 years!

29
00:06:15,506 --> 00:06:19,549
May Chairman Ho live 10000 years!

30
00:06:23,393 --> 00:06:24,589
Now let's ask Mr. Akutagawa

31
00:06:24,795 --> 00:06:26,708
to sing us a song!

32
00:06:27,317 --> 00:06:29,993
No, no...

33
00:06:34,565 --> 00:06:36,717
This is a song from Japan.

34
00:07:21,371 --> 00:07:22,122
Thank you!

35
00:07:22,893 --> 00:07:24,886
Good health, Mr. Akutagawa.

36
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:33,015
You seem thoughtful, Mr. Akutagawa.

37
00:07:35,225 --> 00:07:38,585
Three years ago,
during the Liberation of Danang.

38
00:07:39,269 --> 00:07:40,624
I took a photo

39
00:07:41,672 --> 00:07:43,106
of a crippled boy...

40
00:07:43,313 --> 00:07:46,114
hobbling down an alley-way.

41
00:07:49,119 --> 00:07:51,920
That image haunted me,

42
00:07:52,723 --> 00:07:53,759
as if it symbolisted

43
00:07:53,964 --> 00:07:56,879
the sufferings of Vietnam's children.

44
00:07:59,089 --> 00:08:01,241
I never thought I'd come back and find...

45
00:08:01,452 --> 00:08:05,449
so many healthy, lively children

46
00:08:06,016 --> 00:08:07,132
I feel very happy.

47
00:08:08,018 --> 00:08:11,218
I could stay here forever, not moving.

48
00:08:13,303 --> 00:08:14,738
Oh dear! I hope I can make you

49
00:08:14,945 --> 00:08:15,537
just as happy...

50
00:08:15,746 --> 00:08:18,057
when we get back to Danang tomorrow.

51
00:08:18,709 --> 00:08:20,747
Comrade Le, with your influence
in the Cultural Bureau...

52
00:08:20,951 --> 00:08:22,830
If you can't, no one can!

53
00:08:25,315 --> 00:08:27,786
Come on, old fellow, have a drink!

54
00:08:28,278 --> 00:08:29,268
Thank you.

55
00:08:31,361 --> 00:08:33,194
Are those boots American?

56
00:08:33,403 --> 00:08:36,079
Yes, he got them

57
00:08:36,286 --> 00:08:38,324
from a GI he killed.

58
00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:41,722
They are GI boots.

59
00:08:42,252 --> 00:08:43,368
Why doesn't he wear them?

60
00:08:43,574 --> 00:08:45,008
He's waiting till he dies.

61
00:08:45,215 --> 00:08:46,331
He'll wear them in his coffin.

62
00:08:46,537 --> 00:08:52,219
Right, I'm saving them for the end.

63
00:09:18,529 --> 00:09:20,806
We will send them to New Economic Zones
before long.

64
00:09:32,302 --> 00:09:33,258
What's going on?

65
00:09:33,584 --> 00:09:34,300
There's a fire!

66
00:09:34,705 --> 00:09:37,062
Please stay here, Mr. Akutagawa.

67
00:09:37,267 --> 00:09:38,702
You forget I'm a reporter!

68
00:09:44,635 --> 00:09:45,147
Who's taking pictures?

69
00:09:45,355 --> 00:09:46,870
Don't run, don't run!

70
00:09:47,518 --> 00:09:49,556
Stay there!

71
00:09:51,281 --> 00:09:51,873
Stay there!

72
00:09:55,125 --> 00:09:57,402
I told you to stay there...

73
00:09:57,608 --> 00:09:58,758
I'll take you with me.

74
00:10:06,897 --> 00:10:09,460
I told you to stop taking pictures...

75
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:11,852
Stop, Comrade, he is a foreign friend.

76
00:10:12,062 --> 00:10:13,543
I am Le Van Quyen of the Cultural Bureau.

77
00:10:16,507 --> 00:10:17,303
Get up.

78
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:20,821
Call an ambulance!

79
00:10:24,635 --> 00:10:25,705
Please don't take any more photos.

80
00:10:26,276 --> 00:10:27,346
Stop that! He's nearly dead!

81
00:10:27,558 --> 00:10:29,117
He's a reactionary elemant.
Came back to his old house...

82
00:10:29,319 --> 00:10:30,720
set fire to it, and killed our Comrade.

83
00:10:31,001 --> 00:10:33,153
You heard he's a reactionary.

84
00:10:34,965 --> 00:10:37,162
I'm sorry the policeman did that.

85
00:10:37,488 --> 00:10:39,002
Do I have to give him my negative?

86
00:10:39,209 --> 00:10:42,090
No need, I'm sure you won't
misuse the pictures.

87
00:10:43,333 --> 00:10:44,688
Are you alright? Not hurt?

88
00:10:45,215 --> 00:10:48,210
Don't worry, I've been kicked before,
in Tokyo.

89
00:11:35,305 --> 00:11:36,341
Inoue-san!

90
00:11:36,787 --> 00:11:38,107
Akutagawa-san!

91
00:11:38,428 --> 00:11:39,179
How are you?

92
00:11:39,389 --> 00:11:41,427
Well, and you?

93
00:11:42,633 --> 00:11:45,548
They told me you were back.

94
00:11:45,756 --> 00:11:48,318
I just came from the office.

95
00:11:49,239 --> 00:11:51,277
Are you alrigth? You don't look well.

96
00:11:51,482 --> 00:11:56,481
Seeing you makes me long
to eat sushi in Ginza.

97
00:11:57,968 --> 00:12:00,929
I really miss my wife and kids.

98
00:12:03,814 --> 00:12:06,376
Your wife asked me

99
00:12:06,577 --> 00:12:08,854
to bring you these cakes.

100
00:12:09,059 --> 00:12:10,095
Thanks.

101
00:12:12,062 --> 00:12:15,854
How did you find the New Economic Zones?

102
00:12:16,747 --> 00:12:21,826
I only saw one Zone.

103
00:12:22,032 --> 00:12:23,227
The kids there

104
00:12:23,434 --> 00:12:25,825
had been wandering the streets.

105
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:35,565
I was impressed.
The kids are well looked after.

106
00:12:35,886 --> 00:12:39,565
They all live together

107
00:12:39,770 --> 00:12:44,895
in one big group...

108
00:12:45,095 --> 00:12:48,056
much happier than kids

109
00:12:48,338 --> 00:12:50,650
I've seen on the streets.

110
00:12:50,861 --> 00:12:54,574
Then I wonder why the government...

111
00:12:54,785 --> 00:12:56,539
cannot persuade, or even force...

112
00:12:56,747 --> 00:12:59,628
city people to move

113
00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:02,631
to the Zones.

114
00:13:02,833 --> 00:13:04,153
Why not?

115
00:13:04,515 --> 00:13:07,988
Maybe I heard wrong.

116
00:13:08,318 --> 00:13:10,356
You're the one who's been there.

117
00:13:13,484 --> 00:13:15,681
This is Officer Nguyen, and Comrade Vu.

118
00:13:17,568 --> 00:13:20,038
You are our good friend,
I'm glad to meet you.

119
00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:21,771
You're very kind...

120
00:13:22,412 --> 00:13:24,166
How do you do.

121
00:13:24,775 --> 00:13:25,845
Please sit down!

122
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:31,176
Beer!

123
00:13:32,142 --> 00:13:33,816
It's French beer.

124
00:13:34,224 --> 00:13:36,457
I wanted to offer you French wine...

125
00:13:36,667 --> 00:13:39,308
but I've checked their stocks...

126
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:41,503
and they don't even have Chinese Moutai!

127
00:13:44,915 --> 00:13:46,635
Don't worry, I'm happy with beer.

128
00:13:47,157 --> 00:13:48,147
Fine.

129
00:13:52,523 --> 00:13:53,957
Comrade Le tells me

130
00:13:54,164 --> 00:13:56,396
you had a brush with the police.

131
00:13:58,849 --> 00:14:01,605
I was in the wrong myself.

132
00:14:02,372 --> 00:14:07,132
Not at all, we are the ones to apologise.

133
00:14:07,498 --> 00:14:11,335
I got on to the unit responsible
as soon as I heard.

134
00:14:11,542 --> 00:14:14,901
You have done a lot of us
in the world's press.

135
00:14:15,145 --> 00:14:17,183
Now you're our honoured guest.

136
00:14:18,068 --> 00:14:19,947
You'll have no more trouble.

137
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:22,222
Photograph whatever you like.

138
00:14:22,953 --> 00:14:25,629
If you find anything wrong, please tell us.

139
00:14:25,836 --> 00:14:28,272
We will do our best to improve!

140
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:30,757
That is true friendship!

141
00:14:31,201 --> 00:14:32,191
Thank you!

142
00:14:32,723 --> 00:14:35,843
Cheers, here's to success of your project.

143
00:14:36,567 --> 00:14:37,397
- Thanks. - Cheers.

144
00:14:37,608 --> 00:14:38,724
Cheers.

145
00:14:43,013 --> 00:14:44,242
Comrade Le, Mr. Akutagawa,

146
00:14:44,455 --> 00:14:46,208
I'm afraid we're short of staff.

147
00:14:46,416 --> 00:14:47,931
Come on inside,

148
00:14:50,941 --> 00:14:52,136
please!

149
00:14:54,905 --> 00:14:56,259
Let's clap our hands

150
00:14:56,467 --> 00:14:58,345
to welcome our griend from Japan.

151
00:15:06,517 --> 00:15:07,712
Uncle, hold me.

152
00:15:13,484 --> 00:15:14,600
Uncle, hold me too.

153
00:15:14,805 --> 00:15:17,447
And me!

154
00:15:17,648 --> 00:15:20,118
Little friends, sit down
and let Uncle take your photo.

155
00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:21,606
Don't be naughty. Sit down again.

156
00:15:21,812 --> 00:15:22,768
It's alright, let them.

157
00:15:22,973 --> 00:15:27,494
Let go, back to your seats.
What's going on?

158
00:15:27,858 --> 00:15:28,894
Go back to your seat. Don't be naughty.

159
00:15:29,099 --> 00:15:29,577
How come?

160
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:30,577
I don't know.

161
00:15:30,781 --> 00:15:32,261
Maybe they all like Mr. Akutagawa.

162
00:15:32,463 --> 00:15:33,100
Come with me!

163
00:15:33,544 --> 00:15:36,140
Hold me... hold me...

164
00:15:36,346 --> 00:15:38,179
Be good child, I'll hold you later.

165
00:15:43,393 --> 00:15:44,953
I just wanted them to sit quietly
and behave themselves...

166
00:15:45,155 --> 00:15:47,113
so he can see how well our orphans
are cared for.

167
00:15:47,317 --> 00:15:49,550
I didn't want anything like this.

168
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,880
I didn't arrange it.

169
00:15:52,082 --> 00:15:53,915
The children like being held.

170
00:15:54,244 --> 00:15:55,838
They don't often get the chance.

171
00:15:56,567 --> 00:15:58,639
Where are you staff? Washing underwear?

172
00:15:59,209 --> 00:16:00,849
We're below strength.

173
00:16:01,051 --> 00:16:02,645
We need three more staff.

174
00:16:02,853 --> 00:16:04,253
Alright. You can stop worrying.

175
00:16:04,455 --> 00:16:05,889
We'll send someone to replace you.

176
00:16:06,256 --> 00:16:08,374
Hold me, Uncle.

177
00:16:08,579 --> 00:16:09,329
Mr. Akutagawa!

178
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:13,503
Hold me, Uncle.

179
00:16:14,625 --> 00:16:16,298
I was born not far from here.

180
00:16:16,627 --> 00:16:20,305
This used to be the best place
for an evening stroll.

181
00:16:20,831 --> 00:16:23,632
There were hawkers selling seafood
from boats.

182
00:16:23,954 --> 00:16:26,471
Now they've all fled to Hong Kong
or Malaysia.

183
00:16:27,117 --> 00:16:30,032
You must have heard about
the Vietnamese who've left?

184
00:16:30,601 --> 00:16:34,074
I've read something. Nothing very explicit.

185
00:16:34,805 --> 00:16:37,606
There are always some who can't adjust.

186
00:16:38,809 --> 00:16:40,802
Mr. Nguyen, you studied in France?

187
00:16:41,011 --> 00:16:43,243
I entered the Sorbonne at 18,

188
00:16:43,454 --> 00:16:44,570
and came home at 22.

189
00:16:44,775 --> 00:16:46,733
That was 30 years ago.

190
00:16:47,137 --> 00:16:48,777
Were you always a Communist?

191
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:50,974
I spent 10 years in jail.

192
00:16:51,181 --> 00:16:53,459
Ngo Dinh Viem almost got me.

193
00:16:55,586 --> 00:16:59,138
Look, they did this with a bicycle chain.

194
00:17:01,271 --> 00:17:04,072
Women like to touch the scar.

195
00:17:05,716 --> 00:17:07,436
Do you mind if I photograph it?

196
00:17:08,278 --> 00:17:09,713
Not now.

197
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,153
Take one when I die. I won't mind then.

198
00:17:12,362 --> 00:17:13,239
Alright!

199
00:17:16,206 --> 00:17:18,244
Why did you want to talk to me?

200
00:17:18,849 --> 00:17:20,842
I want to take photos of the city alone.

201
00:17:22,172 --> 00:17:23,766
You mean... you don't want
Comrade Le with you?

202
00:17:23,974 --> 00:17:24,805
Right!

203
00:17:25,135 --> 00:17:26,012
Why not?

204
00:17:26,376 --> 00:17:28,209
I want to take natural photographs.

205
00:17:28,418 --> 00:17:30,217
I don't want things arranged for me.

206
00:17:30,981 --> 00:17:34,819
Alright, I'll have a word with Comrade Le.

207
00:17:35,706 --> 00:17:36,537
Thanks.

208
00:17:39,069 --> 00:17:40,663
They're too young.

209
00:17:41,472 --> 00:17:44,547
Comrade Le and Comrade Vu.

210
00:17:45,155 --> 00:17:47,911
They're too eager. They lose proportion.

211
00:17:48,879 --> 00:17:52,558
When I see how determined they are...

212
00:17:52,883 --> 00:17:54,921
I think I must have been weak

213
00:17:55,125 --> 00:17:56,799
when I was young.

214
00:17:59,169 --> 00:18:00,809
It makes me feel old.

215
00:18:01,572 --> 00:18:02,688
You aren't old.

216
00:18:03,614 --> 00:18:05,333
Recently I've been thinking

217
00:18:05,536 --> 00:18:07,574
a lot about my youth...

218
00:18:08,939 --> 00:18:11,740
here, Paris,

219
00:18:12,463 --> 00:18:16,506
drinking French wine, eating French food...

220
00:18:17,468 --> 00:18:24,631
even longing for a French woman.
I must be old!

221
00:18:26,316 --> 00:18:28,229
The Revolution claimed half my life.

222
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:30,357
And now I'm old.

223
00:18:30,561 --> 00:18:31,152
My mind still lives

224
00:18:31,361 --> 00:18:33,594
in the colonial past.

225
00:18:34,525 --> 00:18:36,882
Vietnam has won her Revolution.

226
00:18:39,129 --> 00:18:42,443
But I've lost mine

227
00:18:49,339 --> 00:18:51,218
I know where

228
00:18:51,502 --> 00:18:53,779
to get the best French food in Danang.

229
00:18:54,104 --> 00:18:55,778
I'll take you there sometime.

230
00:19:21,652 --> 00:19:22,688
Get on!

231
00:19:31,221 --> 00:19:32,052
Okay!

232
00:19:58,849 --> 00:20:00,124
What's going on?

233
00:20:15,546 --> 00:20:17,265
Be quiet and eat up. We have to go.

234
00:20:17,468 --> 00:20:18,982
I'm still hungry, I want another bowl.

235
00:20:19,189 --> 00:20:21,386
I don't have any more money.

236
00:20:21,592 --> 00:20:22,582
Order it!

237
00:20:23,313 --> 00:20:24,064
I want some...

238
00:20:24,274 --> 00:20:26,552
You such a bad boy.
I'll punish you when we get home.

239
00:20:27,718 --> 00:20:28,834
Take the pay.

240
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,880
What are you doing? My noodles!

241
00:20:32,082 --> 00:20:35,476
Where are you going? Who's paying?

242
00:20:35,646 --> 00:20:36,237
Forget it...

243
00:20:36,326 --> 00:20:38,763
Such bad luck...
what do you kids think you're doing?

244
00:20:38,969 --> 00:20:41,087
Put it down. That's mine.

245
00:20:41,812 --> 00:20:42,643
- Forget it. - What's the hell!

246
00:20:42,853 --> 00:20:44,367
- It's dirty. Let them eat.
- Little beggars!

247
00:20:44,575 --> 00:20:46,248
You are too kind. That's mine.

248
00:21:35,305 --> 00:21:35,897
Tastes good!

249
00:21:36,106 --> 00:21:37,301
None for you, I want it all.

250
00:21:37,508 --> 00:21:40,104
Greedy! If you drop it.
There won't be any.

251
00:22:11,822 --> 00:22:14,213
Don't be afraid. I'm a foreign friend.

252
00:22:14,424 --> 00:22:15,495
Your Cultural Bureau

253
00:22:15,706 --> 00:22:16,856
lets me take photos.

254
00:22:17,067 --> 00:22:20,107
Little boy, eat up!

255
00:22:22,152 --> 00:22:23,951
Go on eating!

256
00:22:27,237 --> 00:22:29,470
Can I take one of you holding him?

257
00:22:30,961 --> 00:22:32,840
Just ignore me...

258
00:22:35,446 --> 00:22:37,119
is that your father?

259
00:22:38,809 --> 00:22:41,166
Uncle, take a picture of my mother.

260
00:22:41,371 --> 00:22:45,254
Get up and take a picture, mommy.

261
00:22:47,458 --> 00:22:48,528
Who is it?

262
00:22:49,179 --> 00:22:49,692
Come and be in a picture, mommy.

263
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:50,377
What's the matter?

264
00:22:50,581 --> 00:22:51,981
Go back to sleep, mother. It's right.

265
00:22:52,222 --> 00:22:55,183
Go away and let mother sleep.

266
00:22:56,146 --> 00:22:56,977
Mommy.

267
00:22:59,470 --> 00:23:01,827
Who are you? What are you doing here?

268
00:23:02,473 --> 00:23:03,668
I'm a reporter from Japan.

269
00:23:03,954 --> 00:23:06,231
I'm here to see how you live.

270
00:23:06,597 --> 00:23:08,031
You're a foreigner?

271
00:23:12,843 --> 00:23:14,563
Mister, the government doesn't let us

272
00:23:14,765 --> 00:23:16,564
mix with foreigners.

273
00:23:16,767 --> 00:23:20,285
You'll get us into trouble
if you take photos here.

274
00:23:20,651 --> 00:23:22,769
Don't worry. I have
the Cultural Bureau's permission.

275
00:23:22,973 --> 00:23:25,444
You may have, but we don't.

276
00:23:27,498 --> 00:23:29,456
What's all this? Who are you?

277
00:23:31,462 --> 00:23:34,137
Nikon, you Japanese?

278
00:23:35,626 --> 00:23:37,060
I can sell it for you

279
00:23:37,267 --> 00:23:39,146
if you want.

280
00:23:43,554 --> 00:23:44,544
Ah Nhac, go away!

281
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:53,719
Please go, Mister.
You really can't do this.

282
00:23:54,004 --> 00:23:55,758
I'd really like to photograph them.

283
00:23:55,966 --> 00:23:57,799
I'll go to talk with the Cultural Bureau.

284
00:23:58,168 --> 00:24:04,774
No, don't! You'll get us all executed!

285
00:24:05,175 --> 00:24:06,165
Don't make things worse!

286
00:24:07,938 --> 00:24:09,133
...I can handle it.

287
00:24:09,339 --> 00:24:11,458
What'd you actually want, Mister?

288
00:24:11,662 --> 00:24:12,857
I just want to photograp you.

289
00:24:13,063 --> 00:24:14,464
I don't understand why tour mother
is so alarmed.

290
00:24:14,665 --> 00:24:15,701
There's no way

291
00:24:15,906 --> 00:24:18,342
the government would let us
be photographed.

292
00:24:18,589 --> 00:24:20,661
You may be okay, but we ain't.

293
00:24:20,871 --> 00:24:23,068
You can stroll away and get on
with yourjob...

294
00:24:23,273 --> 00:24:25,152
But we'll get jumped on.

295
00:24:25,996 --> 00:24:27,316
I had on idea...

296
00:24:27,638 --> 00:24:29,357
Look, I'll tell you what.

297
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:32,122
You don't have to snap us here.
Go out on the street.

298
00:24:32,322 --> 00:24:35,762
Pretend I'm just a guy on the street.
Okay?

299
00:24:35,966 --> 00:24:36,604
Okay!

300
00:24:36,807 --> 00:24:38,686
Yeah, but what do we get out of it?

301
00:24:39,009 --> 00:24:40,363
I can pay you!

302
00:24:41,772 --> 00:24:42,842
D'you hear that?

303
00:24:44,214 --> 00:24:45,729
I don't mind if there's no risk.

304
00:24:46,016 --> 00:24:47,416
Give whatever your like.

305
00:24:47,618 --> 00:24:48,768
They are still children.

306
00:24:48,979 --> 00:24:50,254
That's settled, then.
Tomorrow morning at 8.

307
00:24:50,461 --> 00:24:52,977
We'll meet you on the main street.

308
00:24:53,343 --> 00:24:53,981
On the corner of the alley.

309
00:24:54,184 --> 00:24:54,537
Fine!

310
00:24:54,745 --> 00:24:55,781
- It's a deal! - Okay!

311
00:24:56,106 --> 00:24:56,903
I must go.

312
00:25:00,190 --> 00:25:01,910
My name is Akutagawa.

313
00:25:02,272 --> 00:25:05,028
What's yours?

314
00:25:05,355 --> 00:25:06,949
I'm second brother.

315
00:25:07,598 --> 00:25:09,670
He's Van Lang, I'm Van Nhac

316
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:11,234
and she's Cam Nuong.

317
00:25:14,565 --> 00:25:15,315
...I must go

318
00:25:15,646 --> 00:25:17,205
I'm sorry to have worried you today.

319
00:25:21,932 --> 00:25:26,134
I played that right.
The Japs are good tippers.

320
00:25:26,336 --> 00:25:30,299
Better than the Yanks.
We'll score a packet.

321
00:25:31,381 --> 00:25:32,782
Where did this come from?

322
00:25:32,983 --> 00:25:34,053
It's mine... it's mine...

323
00:25:34,384 --> 00:25:36,183
It's just sait water. What good is that?

324
00:25:36,386 --> 00:25:37,741
I want some noodles.

325
00:25:39,590 --> 00:25:42,265
When I'm earning regularly,
I'll buy you fish.

326
00:25:42,593 --> 00:25:44,073
I like fish eyes!

327
00:26:00,771 --> 00:26:02,809
Oh, you're all here.

328
00:26:04,334 --> 00:26:05,211
Mrs. Pham!

329
00:26:08,939 --> 00:26:10,977
Have you thought about
our little talk yesterday?

330
00:26:15,946 --> 00:26:17,062
Hey, we're in business again.

331
00:26:25,836 --> 00:26:27,031
I'm sick.

332
00:26:27,237 --> 00:26:29,549
But who's to know that?

333
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:32,675
Wouldn't you like to earn
5 US dollars a time?

334
00:26:32,883 --> 00:26:35,240
This is no way for you to live.

335
00:26:35,446 --> 00:26:37,244
Let me take you there tonight.

336
00:26:37,808 --> 00:26:40,165
A few years ago, whan I was dasperate,

337
00:26:40,370 --> 00:26:43,285
I went with a Korean soldier,
and had Second Brother.

338
00:26:43,774 --> 00:26:46,006
Cam Nuong isn't young any more.

339
00:26:46,216 --> 00:26:49,496
What if she finds out?

340
00:26:51,462 --> 00:26:53,215
Hurry up!

341
00:27:02,573 --> 00:27:03,768
I'm sorry about this morning.

342
00:27:04,335 --> 00:27:06,805
It's alright, I telephoned Officer Nguyen...

343
00:27:07,018 --> 00:27:09,773
and he told me you preferred
to work alone.

344
00:27:10,021 --> 00:27:10,851
That's right.

345
00:27:11,582 --> 00:27:14,976
I arranged for you to visit a school today.

346
00:27:15,586 --> 00:27:16,861
I had no office work,

347
00:27:17,068 --> 00:27:18,582
so I've been waiting for you.

348
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:20,784
You've been here all day?

349
00:27:21,872 --> 00:27:23,546
Did you get any good pictures?

350
00:27:23,794 --> 00:27:24,864
Very good!

351
00:27:26,197 --> 00:27:28,588
Mr. Akutagawa, even though I'm not
accompanying you...

352
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:30,280
you're still my responsibility

353
00:27:30,481 --> 00:27:31,835
as long as you're here.

354
00:27:32,043 --> 00:27:33,079
If you need my help with anything,

355
00:27:33,284 --> 00:27:34,320
please contact me.

356
00:27:34,725 --> 00:27:35,442
I will.

357
00:27:35,646 --> 00:27:36,841
Then I won't keep you any longer.
Goodbye.

358
00:27:37,048 --> 00:27:37,959
Goodbye.

359
00:27:53,464 --> 00:27:56,857
Sister, mommy isn't back yet.

360
00:27:57,068 --> 00:27:59,459
I'm hungry. I want some noodles.

361
00:27:59,670 --> 00:28:00,228
Be patient.

362
00:28:00,431 --> 00:28:03,073
Look, Sister, mommy's cooked
some rice and vegetables!

363
00:28:05,836 --> 00:28:08,592
Strange... Where did she the money?

364
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:09,950
Borrowed it!

365
00:28:10,441 --> 00:28:11,636
I'll get some bowls.

366
00:28:19,650 --> 00:28:23,533
Don't forget Daddy.

367
00:28:23,734 --> 00:28:24,326
Come on, put me down.

368
00:28:24,535 --> 00:28:25,651
Remember Daddy.

369
00:28:25,856 --> 00:28:26,973
Daddy!

370
00:29:28,119 --> 00:29:29,633
How did you know I'd be here?

371
00:29:30,361 --> 00:29:31,715
Ah Nhac brought me here.

372
00:29:37,688 --> 00:29:38,724
What are those people doing?

373
00:29:40,331 --> 00:29:42,973
They're Chinese. The government
wants them to register.

374
00:29:55,186 --> 00:29:59,103
Hey, what are you doing? No photos!

375
00:30:03,714 --> 00:30:04,670
Who are you?

376
00:30:05,036 --> 00:30:05,752
A reporter from Japan.

377
00:30:05,957 --> 00:30:06,628
Show me your pass.

378
00:30:12,883 --> 00:30:14,364
In order? Believe me now?

379
00:30:15,126 --> 00:30:16,719
Got any ciggies? Give me one.

380
00:30:31,742 --> 00:30:32,459
That's okay.

381
00:30:33,945 --> 00:30:36,097
Hey, you haven't paid me yet...

382
00:30:36,307 --> 00:30:39,986
you haven't paid!

383
00:30:45,236 --> 00:30:45,793
Damn it!

384
00:30:45,997 --> 00:30:47,670
Park the bike without paying money.

385
00:30:48,399 --> 00:30:49,833
Damn it!

386
00:30:56,887 --> 00:30:58,607
My mother ran a stall

387
00:30:58,809 --> 00:31:00,608
until she fell ill.

388
00:31:00,972 --> 00:31:03,933
I want to run one myself,
when I've saved enough.

389
00:31:04,455 --> 00:31:05,252
But it's tough.

390
00:31:05,456 --> 00:31:07,892
Gotta get up at 5 to buy
the vegetables wholesale.

391
00:31:08,099 --> 00:31:09,738
What's wrong with your mother?

392
00:31:09,981 --> 00:31:12,497
I don't know.
I think she misses Dad too much.

393
00:31:12,703 --> 00:31:14,343
They loved each other very much.

394
00:31:15,586 --> 00:31:16,781
When did your father die?

395
00:31:16,988 --> 00:31:19,663
In the war, just a month
before Liberation.

396
00:31:22,593 --> 00:31:24,665
He was in the army.

397
00:31:26,677 --> 00:31:28,500
Mom had just Second Brother.

398
00:31:28,677 --> 00:31:29,970
Sir, buy some monkey brain.

399
00:31:30,201 --> 00:31:31,874
It's fresh, and the price is reasonable.

400
00:31:33,124 --> 00:31:34,957
Quick. The suger-cane stall
will be closed!

401
00:31:46,217 --> 00:31:47,173
How much?

402
00:31:47,378 --> 00:31:48,368
60 cents for a bundle.

403
00:31:48,579 --> 00:31:50,412
It was cheaper yesterday.

404
00:31:50,781 --> 00:31:52,819
It's not expensive. He's charging
more over there!

405
00:31:53,024 --> 00:31:54,504
Go and ask him if you don't believe.

406
00:31:56,627 --> 00:31:58,620
I have the sweetest cane.

407
00:32:02,553 --> 00:32:05,309
If you're not buying, I'll close.
It'll be 80 cents tomorrow.

408
00:32:07,238 --> 00:32:10,278
No, bargain with him!

409
00:32:10,481 --> 00:32:13,282
Bargain? We've bargained already.

410
00:32:14,005 --> 00:32:15,041
I'll sell these on the main road later.

411
00:32:15,246 --> 00:32:16,316
Wanna come?

412
00:32:17,168 --> 00:32:18,443
Yes, I'll keep an eye on you.

413
00:32:33,344 --> 00:32:34,778
Out of sight, quick.
They're taking strong men.

414
00:33:06,817 --> 00:33:08,047
Damn, I dropped my basket.

415
00:33:15,866 --> 00:33:17,939
If you want photos, go upstairs.
Come with me.

416
00:33:42,093 --> 00:33:44,563
Come on up!

417
00:34:07,078 --> 00:34:09,355
Why don't you photograph
the sea and clouds?

418
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:12,157
Why photograph people?
They're so ugly.

419
00:34:13,284 --> 00:34:14,274
Who's ugly?

420
00:34:15,126 --> 00:34:16,276
People don't look good.

421
00:34:17,368 --> 00:34:20,124
Sometimes they do. That's why
I photograph them.

422
00:34:24,895 --> 00:34:27,014
I need to piss. Don't watch.

423
00:34:41,552 --> 00:34:43,624
It feels real good to piss in the sea.

424
00:34:47,118 --> 00:34:48,188
Take you... you're quite good-looking.

425
00:34:51,202 --> 00:34:52,761
Is your mother rich?

426
00:34:53,244 --> 00:34:54,564
I have no mother.

427
00:34:55,606 --> 00:34:56,596
How about your father?

428
00:34:58,609 --> 00:35:00,363
The Americans killed my whole family

429
00:35:00,571 --> 00:35:01,925
in the war.

430
00:35:03,054 --> 00:35:04,090
I was only one year old.

431
00:35:04,615 --> 00:35:05,685
I was raised in an orphanage.

432
00:35:07,418 --> 00:35:08,454
So you were very poor.

433
00:35:11,222 --> 00:35:12,497
How come you're so well off now?

434
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:15,504
I left the orphanage at 15

435
00:35:16,067 --> 00:35:18,025
I studied and got a part-time job
at the newspaper.

436
00:35:18,789 --> 00:35:21,260
It's a good job. Lots of travel.

437
00:35:22,553 --> 00:35:24,034
But I'm not rich.

438
00:35:26,877 --> 00:35:28,471
I hope I'll grow up like you.

439
00:35:28,679 --> 00:35:30,911
Not taking pictures, but traveling all over.

440
00:35:31,322 --> 00:35:32,153
No reason why not.

441
00:35:32,803 --> 00:35:35,195
Be sure to look up when you come to Tokyo.

442
00:35:52,423 --> 00:35:54,336
Ah Nhac, Ah Nhac!

443
00:36:06,117 --> 00:36:08,110
They'll send you to the Economic Zones.

444
00:36:08,559 --> 00:36:10,756
You saw, the door was sealed up.
No-one lives there.

445
00:36:10,962 --> 00:36:11,792
Come on!

446
00:36:13,284 --> 00:36:14,161
What you got there?

447
00:36:15,286 --> 00:36:16,879
Waiter!

448
00:36:18,849 --> 00:36:19,168
What do you want?

449
00:36:19,370 --> 00:36:20,884
Two bowls of noodles, one to go.

450
00:36:21,092 --> 00:36:22,242
Ok, just a few minutes.

451
00:36:22,533 --> 00:36:23,808
Take one back for Second Brother.

452
00:36:45,156 --> 00:36:45,429
See you tomorrow!

453
00:36:45,636 --> 00:36:46,672
Bye!

454
00:36:50,321 --> 00:36:51,550
Are you coming to the chicken farm?

455
00:36:51,762 --> 00:36:52,673
What chicken farm?

456
00:36:52,883 --> 00:36:53,600
Come with me!

457
00:37:27,118 --> 00:37:29,999
This is still okay. The used-clothes place
would take it.

458
00:37:31,522 --> 00:37:34,119
They search the bodies
before they shoot them.

459
00:37:34,325 --> 00:37:36,124
Even the gold teeth are gone.

460
00:37:36,327 --> 00:37:37,967
Dad, you should check his arse

461
00:37:38,169 --> 00:37:39,398
for gold bars.

462
00:37:39,650 --> 00:37:41,802
To Minh! You're back!

463
00:37:46,657 --> 00:37:48,251
How did you get out?

464
00:37:48,739 --> 00:37:51,575
I hurt my leg. They let me out
to get it treated.

465
00:37:51,782 --> 00:37:52,579
This is To Minh.

466
00:37:52,863 --> 00:37:54,776
He's been in a New Economic Zones.

467
00:37:54,986 --> 00:37:55,862
Hi.

468
00:37:56,948 --> 00:37:57,778
Who's he?

469
00:37:58,069 --> 00:38:00,869
A Japanese reporter.
He's photographing my sister.

470
00:38:01,072 --> 00:38:02,472
Look, a Nikon,

471
00:38:02,673 --> 00:38:05,110
I could get 1,000 US for that.

472
00:38:05,316 --> 00:38:07,513
I could get 1,500 for it.

473
00:38:07,718 --> 00:38:09,312
You're my teacher!

474
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:11,274
I thought you wanted photos.

475
00:38:11,482 --> 00:38:13,554
Why not take some?

476
00:38:13,764 --> 00:38:19,163
Get clicking!

477
00:38:36,307 --> 00:38:39,063
This is Akutagawa.

478
00:38:44,875 --> 00:38:45,592
Do sit down.

479
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:49,796
Please!

480
00:38:51,842 --> 00:38:52,832
What will you have?

481
00:38:53,164 --> 00:38:53,961
A beer!

482
00:38:54,405 --> 00:38:57,366
No, no beer today.

483
00:38:58,249 --> 00:38:59,969
She has all kinds of spirits,

484
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:02,289
hidden away.

485
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:04,528
Today we'll have whiskey.

486
00:39:04,815 --> 00:39:05,612
Fine!

487
00:39:12,383 --> 00:39:13,863
Guess how old she is?

488
00:39:15,947 --> 00:39:16,777
Thirty?

489
00:39:17,949 --> 00:39:20,704
Past forty. You'd never guess.

490
00:39:21,112 --> 00:39:25,189
She's Chinese. Her mother was
in the same line.

491
00:39:25,716 --> 00:39:27,868
When the Japanese took Saigon,

492
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:30,117
she lived with a general.

493
00:39:30,921 --> 00:39:32,356
When she was only 14 herself...

494
00:39:32,563 --> 00:39:34,760
she was living with a French general.

495
00:39:35,806 --> 00:39:40,282
When the French pulled out,
she moved on to Americans.

496
00:39:42,373 --> 00:39:44,172
Can you imagine?

497
00:39:44,695 --> 00:39:48,374
She still has figure of a 14-year-old.

498
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:51,537
It's as if all those French
and Americans...

499
00:39:52,023 --> 00:39:55,223
never left a trace on her.

500
00:39:56,307 --> 00:39:59,108
But she did learn

501
00:39:59,310 --> 00:40:01,223
how to cook French good.

502
00:40:01,752 --> 00:40:04,223
Her mother taught her Japanese cooking...

503
00:40:04,915 --> 00:40:08,753
and how to make American hamburgers.

504
00:40:11,442 --> 00:40:12,876
Steak tonight. Is that alright.

505
00:40:13,965 --> 00:40:17,119
She gets steaks from the French Embassy.

506
00:40:17,648 --> 00:40:18,479
How do you like it done?

507
00:40:20,291 --> 00:40:21,441
Same as usual for you?

508
00:40:27,698 --> 00:40:30,659
Tell me, who did you give
your virginity to?

509
00:40:30,861 --> 00:40:31,817
A Chinese!

510
00:40:33,224 --> 00:40:35,786
She gave the Chinese her best.

511
00:40:44,956 --> 00:40:48,429
She can only do black-market business.

512
00:40:51,242 --> 00:40:52,722
She has many connections,

513
00:40:54,645 --> 00:40:57,640
but how long can she survive?

514
00:40:58,529 --> 00:41:02,128
Maybe someone more powerful than me...

515
00:41:02,773 --> 00:41:06,213
will share my taste for
her French cooking.

516
00:41:13,064 --> 00:41:14,817
Sorry, I am serving these all at once.

517
00:41:17,348 --> 00:41:19,341
Good vintage, 1968.

518
00:41:19,830 --> 00:41:21,151
- Please help yourselves.
- Thank you!

519
00:41:30,841 --> 00:41:32,879
Nice wine. Come on.

520
00:41:53,464 --> 00:41:54,295
Serve yourself.

521
00:41:57,348 --> 00:41:58,304
Enjoy the food.

522
00:42:11,762 --> 00:42:14,325
Excuse me, where's the toilet?

523
00:42:15,166 --> 00:42:16,236
Through the back.

524
00:42:38,349 --> 00:42:39,260
What's wrong?

525
00:42:39,630 --> 00:42:40,461
I'm sorry.

526
00:42:42,753 --> 00:42:44,791
Today I watched two kids

527
00:42:45,076 --> 00:42:47,467
help an old man carry corpses.

528
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:50,874
They had just been executed.

529
00:42:51,522 --> 00:42:53,276
What do you want me to do?

530
00:42:55,492 --> 00:42:56,146
Nevermind.

531
00:43:03,731 --> 00:43:07,329
Don't waste it. I can still
sell it tomorrow.

532
00:43:07,575 --> 00:43:09,214
I should pay you for

533
00:43:09,417 --> 00:43:10,692
the photo I'm taking, Cam Nuong.

534
00:43:10,938 --> 00:43:13,249
I'll give you enough to start
your market stall...

535
00:43:13,581 --> 00:43:15,460
but don't go to
the chicken farm any more.

536
00:43:15,663 --> 00:43:17,417
The old man at the chicken farm
is good to us.

537
00:43:17,625 --> 00:43:18,376
You should't hang around

538
00:43:18,586 --> 00:43:20,020
a place like that.

539
00:43:25,112 --> 00:43:28,745
We're later. Only a few small fish left.

540
00:43:29,517 --> 00:43:30,837
This one isn't bad!

541
00:43:31,118 --> 00:43:32,633
It's very expensive.

542
00:43:34,682 --> 00:43:35,559
How much?

543
00:43:35,843 --> 00:43:37,403
Two dollars per catty.

544
00:43:37,965 --> 00:43:39,319
So expensive!

545
00:43:42,890 --> 00:43:44,848
My Dad used to like fish.

546
00:43:45,212 --> 00:43:48,492
Me too. Weigh it!

547
00:43:48,896 --> 00:43:50,377
Won't let you pay.

548
00:43:50,578 --> 00:43:51,409
Alright.

549
00:43:54,942 --> 00:43:58,734
One catty, ten ounces. Call it 3 dollars.

550
00:43:59,507 --> 00:44:05,588
Two and a half... Leave it.

551
00:44:10,197 --> 00:44:13,033
Wait... I'm going to close, it's a deal.

552
00:44:13,481 --> 00:44:15,792
Ah Nhac will be pleased to see this.

553
00:44:23,731 --> 00:44:29,288
Ah Nhac! Ah Nhac!

554
00:44:30,498 --> 00:44:31,454
Sister!

555
00:44:31,939 --> 00:44:37,064
Ah Nhac, we got a fish!

556
00:44:37,264 --> 00:44:38,175
I'll be right there.

557
00:44:48,275 --> 00:44:53,878
Ah Nhac...

558
00:44:54,402 --> 00:44:59,321
Ah Nhac!

559
00:44:59,527 --> 00:45:00,677
Cam Nuong!

560
00:45:26,113 --> 00:45:27,229
Sister.

561
00:45:42,730 --> 00:45:44,688
What do you mean, I'm too young.

562
00:45:48,976 --> 00:45:50,126
I'm past 30.

563
00:45:51,339 --> 00:45:53,217
I've been a revolutionary for 20 years.

564
00:45:56,464 --> 00:45:57,454
Nothing to say?

565
00:46:01,909 --> 00:46:06,270
Still hung up on Nguyen? Bitch!

566
00:46:18,846 --> 00:46:19,597
I take this.

567
00:46:47,475 --> 00:46:48,352
There's 2,000 dollars.

568
00:46:49,477 --> 00:46:51,788
Enough for me, but not for Ah Thanh too.

569
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:54,757
I have more money coming,
if you can wait...

570
00:46:54,962 --> 00:46:57,399
If I don't go back tomorrow...

571
00:46:57,605 --> 00:46:58,880
they'll give me land-mine duty
as punishment.

572
00:46:59,086 --> 00:47:00,281
It wouldn't count for anything then.

573
00:47:01,449 --> 00:47:02,279
What, then?

574
00:47:02,770 --> 00:47:05,240
Raise what you can,

575
00:47:05,453 --> 00:47:06,728
I'll manage the rest somehow.

576
00:47:11,699 --> 00:47:13,931
Comrade Vu will wonder
where this same from.

577
00:47:27,995 --> 00:47:29,749
I want sausage and noodles.

578
00:47:29,957 --> 00:47:30,834
Want the lot?

579
00:47:35,683 --> 00:47:37,835
Three bowls of noodles,

580
00:47:38,045 --> 00:47:40,003
one dish of chicken, one of sausage.

581
00:47:40,207 --> 00:47:41,118
Right!

582
00:47:52,900 --> 00:47:59,540
Cam Nuong, have you thought about
your market-stall?

583
00:47:59,747 --> 00:48:01,580
When do you want to start it?

584
00:48:04,832 --> 00:48:06,984
Maybe you'd have to work too hard.

585
00:48:07,675 --> 00:48:09,668
Did you think of moving to
a New Economic Zone?

586
00:48:09,877 --> 00:48:11,197
That's not for us.

587
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:13,751
Why not?

588
00:48:13,961 --> 00:48:14,792
We're not bad elements.

589
00:48:15,002 --> 00:48:16,483
We can earn a living here.

590
00:48:17,284 --> 00:48:19,038
But things are tough for you here.

591
00:48:19,246 --> 00:48:19,918
And I've seen how happy

592
00:48:20,127 --> 00:48:22,165
the kids are in the N.E.Z.

593
00:48:22,490 --> 00:48:23,765
You might be better off there.

594
00:48:24,131 --> 00:48:25,851
And the change would be good
for your mother.

595
00:48:27,335 --> 00:48:29,327
Don't drag my mother into it!

596
00:48:30,177 --> 00:48:31,167
If the N.E.Z. Is so great,

597
00:48:31,379 --> 00:48:33,098
why do bad guys get sent there?

598
00:48:35,022 --> 00:48:35,853
Where are you going?

599
00:48:36,424 --> 00:48:37,380
To the chicken farm.

600
00:48:37,705 --> 00:48:40,267
More executions today.

601
00:48:41,268 --> 00:48:42,862
You're taking Second Brother there?

602
00:48:43,511 --> 00:48:45,947
Leave us alone, will you?

603
00:48:46,273 --> 00:48:47,754
He's been there many times before.

604
00:48:47,955 --> 00:48:49,150
Go away.

605
00:48:50,237 --> 00:48:52,070
Don't you want to take him
handling the bodies?

606
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:53,557
You bring us bad luck!

607
00:48:53,761 --> 00:48:56,072
That's why Ah Nhac died!

608
00:48:56,323 --> 00:48:59,524
Go away, I don't want to see you again.

609
00:49:54,982 --> 00:49:56,702
You're from a New Economic Zone?

610
00:49:58,986 --> 00:50:00,136
How is it?

611
00:50:02,750 --> 00:50:05,665
Not bad. Plenty of fresh air.

612
00:50:06,434 --> 00:50:11,114
I've been there. It's better than that.

613
00:50:12,039 --> 00:50:13,952
Which N.E.Z. Did you visit?

614
00:50:14,321 --> 00:50:15,311
No. 16!

615
00:50:21,889 --> 00:50:22,686
What's so funny?

616
00:50:24,051 --> 00:50:25,611
That's the model one.

617
00:50:26,374 --> 00:50:27,250
What do you mean?

618
00:50:28,295 --> 00:50:29,012
It's the one that

619
00:50:29,216 --> 00:50:30,890
foreign friends get to see.

620
00:50:31,258 --> 00:50:33,012
They've trained the children there.

621
00:50:33,220 --> 00:50:36,375
They all liked happy and healthy, right?

622
00:50:37,425 --> 00:50:38,255
How do you know?

623
00:50:39,066 --> 00:50:40,626
I was in No.15,

624
00:50:40,868 --> 00:50:42,986
just over the mountain.

625
00:50:44,352 --> 00:50:46,230
I thought that was an army camp.

626
00:50:46,434 --> 00:50:47,993
You thought wrong.

627
00:50:49,957 --> 00:50:51,232
What kind of work did you do there?

628
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:53,920
The lucky ones get farm work,

629
00:50:54,482 --> 00:50:56,235
the rest dig for land-mines.

630
00:50:57,164 --> 00:50:58,394
Why did they send you there?

631
00:50:59,927 --> 00:51:01,726
I was a translator for the US Army.

632
00:51:09,617 --> 00:51:13,773
Can you get this back to the bar for me?

633
00:51:14,662 --> 00:51:17,577
Tell her I won't need it

634
00:51:18,065 --> 00:51:19,260
on land-mine duty.

635
00:51:20,307 --> 00:51:21,458
Anyway, it's not enough!

636
00:51:23,230 --> 00:51:24,551
What was it for?

637
00:51:26,434 --> 00:51:27,310
Easy-exit money.

638
00:51:29,236 --> 00:51:30,591
You want to leave Vietnam?

639
00:51:30,878 --> 00:51:31,834
Yes!

640
00:51:35,082 --> 00:51:36,597
Now I see why

641
00:51:36,804 --> 00:51:38,922
you wanted my camera so much.

642
00:51:40,848 --> 00:51:44,845
You wanted it even more.
You fought for it...

643
00:51:45,693 --> 00:51:47,526
as if it was your life itself!

644
00:51:51,819 --> 00:51:55,611
If you can't get it back to her,
keep it yourself.

645
00:51:56,344 --> 00:51:58,063
It'll cover your medical bill.

646
00:52:04,071 --> 00:52:05,870
Akutagawa Shiomi, Japanese.

647
00:52:06,434 --> 00:52:07,184
Yes!

648
00:52:33,861 --> 00:52:36,378
I'm so sorry this has happened.

649
00:52:37,184 --> 00:52:40,224
The police only just informed us.

650
00:52:40,548 --> 00:52:41,982
How were you treated?

651
00:52:42,790 --> 00:52:44,304
Fine, like a VIP.

652
00:52:47,795 --> 00:52:50,790
They sat your head is hurt.

653
00:52:50,998 --> 00:52:52,273
- Do you need a doctor?
- Yes.

654
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:54,713
No, it's just a scratch.

655
00:52:55,202 --> 00:52:56,637
Actually, It's my responsibility.

656
00:52:56,844 --> 00:52:58,119
If I had been with you...

657
00:52:58,325 --> 00:53:00,079
it would never have happened.

658
00:53:00,287 --> 00:53:02,440
It wasn't his fault. I know him.

659
00:53:03,290 --> 00:53:04,486
He was broke.

660
00:53:05,653 --> 00:53:07,725
I hope he won't be punished too severelt.

661
00:53:08,255 --> 00:53:09,576
There'll be an open trial tomorrow.

662
00:53:13,501 --> 00:53:14,855
Your camera seems to have survived.

663
00:53:15,783 --> 00:53:17,263
Japanese products can take knocks.

664
00:53:19,667 --> 00:53:22,103
You must be hungry.

665
00:53:22,309 --> 00:53:24,462
Come, there's a good dinner waiting.

666
00:53:41,689 --> 00:53:42,964
Driver, stop the car.

667
00:53:44,612 --> 00:53:45,602
I'm sorry about the dinner,

668
00:53:45,813 --> 00:53:46,690
but I must see a friend.

669
00:53:46,894 --> 00:53:47,771
As you wish!

670
00:53:49,697 --> 00:53:52,419
Uncle, Sister says you like noodles.

671
00:53:59,907 --> 00:54:02,982
Her name is Cam Nuong. She's 14.

672
00:54:03,190 --> 00:54:05,548
Akutagawa has been with her
a lot this week.

673
00:54:06,594 --> 00:54:07,664
Three days ago, her brother

674
00:54:07,875 --> 00:54:09,868
blew himself up...

675
00:54:10,077 --> 00:54:11,910
He was foraging for scrap metal.

676
00:54:12,119 --> 00:54:15,319
The photos he's been taking
could be damaging to us.

677
00:54:16,203 --> 00:54:17,354
Any sexual relationship between them?

678
00:54:17,565 --> 00:54:19,523
No, but the girl's mother

679
00:54:19,727 --> 00:54:21,959
is a prostitute.

680
00:54:31,739 --> 00:54:32,456
Sit down!

681
00:54:58,686 --> 00:55:00,406
I've come from To Minh's trial.

682
00:55:04,732 --> 00:55:06,291
He got ten years hard labour.

683
00:55:07,174 --> 00:55:08,051
I know!

684
00:55:21,749 --> 00:55:22,785
He asked me to bring this to you.

685
00:55:25,433 --> 00:55:26,549
It was his fate.

686
00:55:28,436 --> 00:55:29,870
You think he should stay in Vietnam.

687
00:55:31,519 --> 00:55:32,635
I believe in fate.

688
00:55:35,603 --> 00:55:37,436
I didn't know how much he needed it.

689
00:55:38,806 --> 00:55:41,881
Don't feel quilty, it was for his friend.

690
00:55:42,089 --> 00:55:43,888
He had enough for himself.

691
00:55:45,893 --> 00:55:48,410
I want to see the N.E.Z.
Where they've sent him.

692
00:55:48,776 --> 00:55:50,973
Can you help me get a pass?

693
00:55:52,340 --> 00:55:53,490
Why not ask Officer Nguyen?

694
00:55:55,543 --> 00:55:57,023
I've trouble him a lot already.

695
00:56:00,348 --> 00:56:02,067
I can arrange it.

696
00:56:02,430 --> 00:56:05,026
You help me by taking the money back
to To Minh.

697
00:56:05,232 --> 00:56:07,270
Together with more for his friend.

698
00:56:07,675 --> 00:56:17,401
Good. So you think he can change his fate!

699
00:56:28,416 --> 00:56:29,850
He brought me a lot of trade.

700
00:56:31,499 --> 00:56:33,297
He used to bring all the Gls

701
00:56:33,501 --> 00:56:34,981
in town here.

702
00:56:35,623 --> 00:56:37,422
All the bra-girls here liked him.

703
00:56:38,466 --> 00:56:41,187
He dreams of opening his own bar
in New Orleans!

704
00:56:41,949 --> 00:56:43,748
He wants me to run it.

705
00:56:46,554 --> 00:56:48,193
He says I can work till I'm 70.

706
00:56:55,483 --> 00:56:55,801
Mr. Akutagawa!

707
00:56:56,003 --> 00:56:56,914
Comrade Vu!

708
00:57:02,610 --> 00:57:03,839
Sorry to interrupt you.

709
00:57:04,051 --> 00:57:06,204
We've finished our talk. I have to go.

710
00:57:06,454 --> 00:57:08,572
There should be more places
like this in Danang.

711
00:57:10,578 --> 00:57:12,218
Goodbye, Mr. Akutagawa.

712
00:57:15,943 --> 00:57:17,537
Clever man, that Japanese.

713
00:57:17,745 --> 00:57:19,305
How did he find way here?

714
00:57:19,547 --> 00:57:21,061
Did Nguyen bring him?

715
00:57:22,430 --> 00:57:23,386
Why was he here?

716
00:57:24,392 --> 00:57:25,621
He wants a pass

717
00:57:25,833 --> 00:57:27,314
to visit the N.E.Z.

718
00:57:27,515 --> 00:57:28,790
Hasn't he been once?

719
00:57:29,957 --> 00:57:31,597
He'll have to ask Nguyen.

720
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:34,474
He needs someone more powerful.

721
00:57:36,324 --> 00:57:38,999
What does he expect to see in the N.E. Z?

722
00:57:39,207 --> 00:57:41,119
This Japanese fancies himself
as a revolutionary.

723
00:57:41,329 --> 00:57:43,606
I think he's trying to stir shit.

724
00:58:02,310 --> 00:58:03,060
You can't take the camera.

725
00:58:03,631 --> 00:58:04,223
I have special permission.

726
00:58:04,432 --> 00:58:05,502
I don't care if you do.

727
00:58:15,843 --> 00:58:16,993
Look after it for me.

728
00:58:17,245 --> 00:58:18,201
Will you come back?

729
00:58:18,686 --> 00:58:21,328
Of course. We're going to
open a stall together.

730
00:58:25,973 --> 00:58:27,009
I'm sorry!

731
00:58:27,455 --> 00:58:28,605
None of your business.

732
00:58:29,016 --> 00:58:36,419
Get on... right, off you go!

733
00:59:18,786 --> 00:59:20,015
Leave me alone!

734
00:59:20,588 --> 00:59:22,740
Hey, he has a fever.

735
00:59:57,064 --> 01:00:01,107
1001, 1006,

736
01:00:01,309 --> 01:00:05,431
1009, 1010

737
01:00:05,793 --> 01:00:08,549
1012, 1016...

738
01:00:08,756 --> 01:00:10,794
Is there a doctor here?

739
01:00:10,998 --> 01:00:11,795
Yes!

740
01:00:13,481 --> 01:00:15,713
Where's the doctor?

741
01:00:15,923 --> 01:00:16,879
Report first.

742
01:00:32,580 --> 01:00:33,856
Right now!

743
01:00:34,662 --> 01:00:37,976
To Minh, what is it?

744
01:00:38,787 --> 01:00:39,743
What happened?

745
01:00:39,948 --> 01:00:41,428
He needs a doctor!

746
01:00:49,157 --> 01:00:50,034
What are you doing?

747
01:00:50,238 --> 01:00:53,199
Let him go.

748
01:01:06,054 --> 01:01:07,329
Who's that guy?

749
01:01:07,776 --> 01:01:11,169
A Japanese reporter. The Cultural Bureau
gave him a pass.

750
01:01:11,379 --> 01:01:14,260
You're kidding!
What's To Minh been doing?

751
01:01:14,462 --> 01:01:15,817
His leg is still bad.

752
01:01:16,024 --> 01:01:18,415
I gave him special convalescence leave.

753
01:01:18,626 --> 01:01:20,619
How come he's worse than before?

754
01:01:25,713 --> 01:01:27,832
It's all over for us, Ah Thanh.

755
01:01:28,196 --> 01:01:29,550
Don't be dumb!

756
01:01:57,185 --> 01:02:00,021
Doctor...

757
01:02:00,228 --> 01:02:03,303
You're flooding the place.

758
01:02:08,877 --> 01:02:10,630
He's in agony!

759
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:15,200
I'll do what I can. Where's the pain?

760
01:02:16,644 --> 01:02:18,477
His wound is inflamed.

761
01:02:57,966 --> 01:02:58,956
Hold him still.

762
01:03:02,210 --> 01:03:03,724
No anaesthetic?

763
01:03:04,212 --> 01:03:05,692
You go to town to buy it.

764
01:03:52,660 --> 01:03:53,936
He's alright now.

765
01:03:59,667 --> 01:04:01,625
Easy-exit money?

766
01:04:03,231 --> 01:04:08,185
What do you think your life is worth?

767
01:04:08,396 --> 01:04:14,272
Why did I let you go for treatment?
Back outside!

768
01:04:24,572 --> 01:04:26,610
I don't care who you are,
Japanese reporter.

769
01:04:26,815 --> 01:04:28,808
The Cultural Bureau has
nojurisdiction here.

770
01:04:29,017 --> 01:04:30,656
Leave now.

771
01:04:30,859 --> 01:04:32,213
I've seen all I want.

772
01:04:32,420 --> 01:04:35,734
Shit, I can have you charged
as an accomlice.

773
01:05:01,449 --> 01:05:03,009
She asked me to give this back to you.

774
01:05:04,893 --> 01:05:06,691
She says she has go to Miami,
to run your bar...

775
01:05:06,895 --> 01:05:08,375
until she's 70.

776
01:05:11,139 --> 01:05:13,371
She got the money for Ah thanh too.

777
01:05:14,302 --> 01:05:16,022
You must find a way to escape.

778
01:05:19,307 --> 01:05:20,867
It's New Orleans.

779
01:05:22,310 --> 01:05:24,907
Right!

780
01:06:55,683 --> 01:06:57,802
Mr. Akutagawa,
you should have warned me.

781
01:06:58,006 --> 01:06:59,122
Welcome.

782
01:07:00,168 --> 01:07:02,559
I'm just passing.

783
01:07:02,811 --> 01:07:04,086
On my way back from visiting No.15.

784
01:07:04,412 --> 01:07:06,609
Good, I'll go wake the children.

785
01:07:12,741 --> 01:07:14,300
The old man passed on.

786
01:07:14,502 --> 01:07:15,778
They're such good boots.

787
01:07:15,984 --> 01:07:17,543
Too good to be buried with him,

788
01:07:17,746 --> 01:07:18,462
don't you agree?

789
01:07:49,898 --> 01:07:50,614
You're back.

790
01:07:50,819 --> 01:07:52,048
Didn't expect to see you again.

791
01:07:54,943 --> 01:07:56,343
Mr. Akutagawa, why not

792
01:07:56,544 --> 01:07:57,694
sit down and have a coffee?

793
01:08:03,711 --> 01:08:05,305
You went to my home?

794
01:08:05,633 --> 01:08:07,831
Did Mom tell you I was here?

795
01:08:08,476 --> 01:08:09,671
Is Second Brother asleep yet?

796
01:08:13,562 --> 01:08:15,919
He messed with your camera all day.

797
01:08:16,284 --> 01:08:17,685
So I put it on

798
01:08:17,886 --> 01:08:19,240
Dad's memorial tablet.

799
01:08:23,692 --> 01:08:25,810
Mrs. Pham has just opened
this coffee stall.

800
01:08:26,014 --> 01:08:28,895
I'm selling sugar-cane by day,
and helping here at night.

801
01:08:29,137 --> 01:08:30,207
I'm saving,

802
01:08:30,418 --> 01:08:31,648
so that Mom can see a doctor.

803
01:08:33,501 --> 01:08:35,016
Don't worry yourself about
us and more.

804
01:08:36,905 --> 01:08:39,023
You don't want to send us to
the N.E.Z. any more?

805
01:08:42,310 --> 01:08:43,107
No.

806
01:08:46,995 --> 01:08:48,190
Where are we going?

807
01:08:48,597 --> 01:08:49,633
I'm taking you home.

808
01:08:51,239 --> 01:08:52,434
I want to come to your hotel.

809
01:08:53,321 --> 01:08:54,038
Why?

810
01:08:55,483 --> 01:08:56,918
I've never been to one.

811
01:09:22,991 --> 01:09:24,027
Pretty good here.

812
01:09:24,232 --> 01:09:26,111
So this is what hotels are like.

813
01:09:29,758 --> 01:09:32,594
Cam Nuong. I promised to help you
start a stall.

814
01:09:33,201 --> 01:09:34,396
Should be enough here for that,

815
01:09:34,603 --> 01:09:36,242
and for the doctor.

816
01:09:37,405 --> 01:09:39,558
But promise you won't go back
to the coffee-stall.

817
01:09:40,969 --> 01:09:44,932
Promise me. Not to the
chicken farm eother.

818
01:09:47,656 --> 01:09:50,126
I can earn a lot more at the coffee-stall.

819
01:09:56,184 --> 01:09:58,142
Alright, I know, I won't go there again.

820
01:10:00,629 --> 01:10:02,781
Is it true that Japanese men
beat their wives?

821
01:10:03,752 --> 01:10:04,583
Who told you that?

822
01:10:05,393 --> 01:10:07,147
Everyone says so.

823
01:10:07,556 --> 01:10:08,386
Not true!

824
01:10:10,959 --> 01:10:11,790
I want to use the toilet.

825
01:10:15,083 --> 01:10:17,474
Low water-pressure. Must flush twice.

826
01:10:17,766 --> 01:10:18,516
Okay!

827
01:10:43,511 --> 01:10:45,424
Why are there beer-cans in the tank?

828
01:10:45,634 --> 01:10:46,191
The waiter hid them there.

829
01:10:46,394 --> 01:10:48,865
There're black market.

830
01:10:49,077 --> 01:10:52,915
Do you want one now?

831
01:11:27,355 --> 01:11:28,027
What are you doing?

832
01:11:28,236 --> 01:11:29,511
I must wash my feet.

833
01:11:30,679 --> 01:11:31,429
Why?

834
01:11:31,840 --> 01:11:33,560
I'll get bed-clothes dirty.

835
01:11:33,962 --> 01:11:34,952
Are you crazy?

836
01:11:40,408 --> 01:11:41,239
I've married since 18.

837
01:11:41,449 --> 01:11:42,679
At your dad's age.

838
01:11:43,892 --> 01:11:44,723
I'm taking you home.

839
01:12:33,982 --> 01:12:34,972
What is it?

840
01:12:57,485 --> 01:13:00,845
Oh, it's you. The Commander took
your gold leaf.

841
01:13:01,129 --> 01:13:02,245
What do you want?

842
01:13:04,252 --> 01:13:05,892
If that shits, I'll make you eat it!

843
01:13:08,176 --> 01:13:13,380
This is for you, plus this.

844
01:13:18,827 --> 01:13:20,500
To cover me and Ah Thanh.

845
01:13:21,029 --> 01:13:24,104
The usual deal, half in advance.

846
01:13:27,676 --> 01:13:29,873
Heard any bangs recently?

847
01:13:30,559 --> 01:13:32,836
No refund if Ah Thanh

848
01:13:33,441 --> 01:13:34,511
blows himself up.

849
01:13:34,803 --> 01:13:37,160
Don't you worry, we'll make it.

850
01:13:37,686 --> 01:13:39,166
When's the next boat?

851
01:13:40,328 --> 01:13:43,482
You're lucky. Three days from now.

852
01:13:55,624 --> 01:13:59,256
1001, 1006,

853
01:13:59,868 --> 01:14:04,263
1009, 1010...

854
01:14:04,472 --> 01:14:08,755
1012, 1216,

855
01:14:09,077 --> 01:14:13,598
1021, 1024...

856
01:14:14,042 --> 01:14:18,563
1026, 1029

857
01:14:26,454 --> 01:14:28,891
Two dead, one seriously injured, sir.

858
01:14:30,539 --> 01:14:31,973
You six, move the bodies.

859
01:14:59,447 --> 01:15:11,451
You! You!

860
01:15:12,701 --> 01:15:13,497
Why me?

861
01:15:13,702 --> 01:15:15,341
You're later, that's why!

862
01:15:23,552 --> 01:15:24,747
You!

863
01:16:56,124 --> 01:16:58,082
Just three more days, Ah Thanh.

864
01:17:09,858 --> 01:17:11,133
Hey, Cam Nuong!

865
01:17:13,501 --> 01:17:14,936
I made two dollars more today.

866
01:17:15,744 --> 01:17:16,973
You're a good businesswoman!

867
01:17:22,150 --> 01:17:22,867
You smoke?

868
01:17:23,071 --> 01:17:24,505
Ah Nhac taught me to.

869
01:18:00,829 --> 01:18:04,542
Mr. Akutagawa!

870
01:18:04,753 --> 01:18:05,743
I was just looking for you!

871
01:18:05,954 --> 01:18:06,944
What is it?

872
01:18:08,677 --> 01:18:10,157
Only five days left on your visa.

873
01:18:10,358 --> 01:18:11,873
Shall I get it extended for you?

874
01:18:12,440 --> 01:18:13,032
No need,

875
01:18:13,241 --> 01:18:14,391
I've got what I want already.

876
01:18:14,603 --> 01:18:15,479
Thank you!

877
01:18:16,124 --> 01:18:19,643
Right, well, I won't keep you.

878
01:18:22,330 --> 01:18:22,922
Well?

879
01:18:23,732 --> 01:18:24,722
He's going to leave.

880
01:18:24,933 --> 01:18:26,732
What about his photos?

881
01:18:35,944 --> 01:18:36,855
You're leaving?

882
01:20:10,158 --> 01:20:12,310
Ah Thanh... Ah Thanh...

883
01:20:15,163 --> 01:20:16,074
You alright?

884
01:20:16,284 --> 01:20:17,161
You guys seen enough?

885
01:20:17,485 --> 01:20:20,720
Back to work.

886
01:20:22,571 --> 01:20:23,607
On to the truck.

887
01:20:40,148 --> 01:20:42,790
Nothing to see, back to work.

888
01:22:08,396 --> 01:22:16,835
Ah Thanh!

889
01:22:28,977 --> 01:22:30,731
What the hell is all this noise?

890
01:23:11,700 --> 01:23:12,690
The cash?

891
01:23:20,669 --> 01:23:22,821
And Ah Thanh's share?
I reserved him a place.

892
01:23:23,031 --> 01:23:24,067
It's all here!

893
01:23:28,877 --> 01:23:31,029
Tell the boat's captain I sent you.

894
01:23:31,239 --> 01:23:32,833
He'll let you on.

895
01:24:13,281 --> 01:24:16,721
Wait for me! I'm from No.15!

896
01:24:16,925 --> 01:24:17,995
Wait!

897
01:24:25,053 --> 01:24:32,695
Wait! Wait for me...

898
01:24:40,028 --> 01:24:40,984
Over here!

899
01:24:44,913 --> 01:24:45,949
Hold me.

900
01:26:02,951 --> 01:26:04,545
I want to have salted egg.

901
01:26:04,753 --> 01:26:06,632
Mr. Akutagawa has invited
for western food.

902
01:26:06,835 --> 01:26:08,394
I don't like western food.

903
01:26:08,597 --> 01:26:10,669
Don't be silly, you've
never tried it.

904
01:26:23,652 --> 01:26:26,043
Over here!

905
01:26:28,336 --> 01:26:29,406
Are we late?

906
01:26:29,738 --> 01:26:31,218
No, I just got here.

907
01:26:33,261 --> 01:26:34,138
Sit down!

908
01:26:36,064 --> 01:26:36,496
I want salted egg.

909
01:26:36,705 --> 01:26:38,982
Don't play with your knife. Be good.

910
01:26:40,669 --> 01:26:42,582
I've already ordered

911
01:26:42,831 --> 01:26:46,190
roast chicken, fried fish

912
01:26:46,675 --> 01:26:48,075
soup, and ice cream.

913
01:26:48,276 --> 01:26:50,918
How's that? Alright?

914
01:26:52,160 --> 01:26:55,713
Waiter, can we have the
three lunches now, please.

915
01:26:55,924 --> 01:26:56,755
Right away.

916
01:26:59,367 --> 01:27:01,804
Got enough money left
to pay for all that?

917
01:27:02,010 --> 01:27:03,490
You've given me most of
what you had.

918
01:27:03,692 --> 01:27:05,285
Don't worry, I have some savings!

919
01:27:06,414 --> 01:27:08,088
Good day!

920
01:27:08,336 --> 01:27:09,657
You startled me.

921
01:27:10,098 --> 01:27:13,138
I forgot there was a compatriot around!

922
01:27:13,501 --> 01:27:15,540
- Let have breakfast together.
- Can I?

923
01:27:15,744 --> 01:27:17,337
Please take a seat.

924
01:27:18,186 --> 01:27:25,828
These are your little
Vietnamese friends?

925
01:27:26,835 --> 01:27:32,677
Sister and bother. She's Cam Nuong,

926
01:27:33,321 --> 01:27:36,521
he's Van Lang.

927
01:27:37,886 --> 01:27:40,767
This is my Japanese friend, Inoue-san.

928
01:27:41,730 --> 01:27:43,130
Do sit down

929
01:27:43,331 --> 01:27:46,645
I'm very happy to meet you.

930
01:27:48,136 --> 01:27:48,694
Want a beer?

931
01:27:48,897 --> 01:27:50,617
No, I have work to do.

932
01:27:50,819 --> 01:27:54,371
You went to another N.E.Z.?

933
01:27:56,424 --> 01:28:00,467
How was it?

934
01:28:02,230 --> 01:28:05,191
I was tricked.

935
01:28:05,513 --> 01:28:08,394
How about your photo-project?

936
01:28:11,359 --> 01:28:13,511
They're the reality.

937
01:28:13,842 --> 01:28:18,237
I envy you, going home.

938
01:28:20,288 --> 01:28:22,851
Goodbye, little friends.

939
01:28:31,219 --> 01:28:33,531
- Is he from Tokyo too?
- Yes.

940
01:28:34,182 --> 01:28:35,457
Is that what you do in Tokyo?

941
01:28:41,229 --> 01:28:43,347
Yes, we do that in Tokyo all the time.

942
01:28:43,672 --> 01:28:45,630
The Japanese like bowing.

943
01:28:46,915 --> 01:28:47,826
But I can't

944
01:28:48,036 --> 01:28:49,106
describe Tokyo to you.

945
01:28:49,317 --> 01:28:51,435
You'll have to come to see for yourselves.

946
01:28:55,323 --> 01:28:57,245
Uncle, where is the roast chicken?

947
01:29:01,610 --> 01:29:02,885
Come home with us.

948
01:29:03,131 --> 01:29:04,167
Leave me alone.

949
01:29:04,452 --> 01:29:06,331
You're old enough to walk by yourself.

950
01:29:06,535 --> 01:29:07,651
Don't worry, I don't mind.

951
01:29:07,856 --> 01:29:09,415
He says he like it.

952
01:29:25,684 --> 01:29:26,561
Clear away!

953
01:29:33,612 --> 01:29:34,489
What's happening?

954
01:29:34,693 --> 01:29:35,570
Why are you taking my Mom?

955
01:29:36,054 --> 01:29:37,489
Ask your mother to tell you!

956
01:29:37,696 --> 01:29:38,766
Mom!

957
01:29:39,778 --> 01:29:42,534
Speak up, admit what you are.

958
01:29:42,741 --> 01:29:47,501
Confess to your daughter
and your neighbours.

959
01:29:49,508 --> 01:29:50,683
You were shameless to be a hooker.

960
01:29:50,789 --> 01:29:53,141
And broke our law and order.

961
01:29:53,352 --> 01:29:56,392
Why not just admit it openly?

962
01:30:05,444 --> 01:30:06,514
Mommy!

963
01:30:15,133 --> 01:30:16,614
Mom!

964
01:31:06,865 --> 01:31:07,776
Say goodbye to Mommy.

965
01:31:07,986 --> 01:31:09,262
Mommy, goodbye!

966
01:31:47,145 --> 01:31:48,785
Although your mother did act crime.

967
01:31:48,987 --> 01:31:51,345
But the country will
offer her a chance to reform.

968
01:31:51,550 --> 01:31:53,827
She shouldn't avoid
her responsibilities.

969
01:31:54,112 --> 01:31:56,424
You don't have to worry about your future.

970
01:31:56,635 --> 01:31:58,832
The country will put your brother
in an orphanage.

971
01:31:59,037 --> 01:32:01,634
And we will send you to N.E.Z. very quickly.

972
01:32:26,585 --> 01:32:28,144
It's alright, it's Officer Nguyen.

973
01:32:38,797 --> 01:32:39,753
He's drunk too much.

974
01:32:40,479 --> 01:32:42,072
Tonight is his last dinner here.

975
01:32:45,404 --> 01:32:48,000
Tomorrow he transfers to the N.E.Z.
At Mao Nam.

976
01:32:48,927 --> 01:32:49,963
To do what?

977
01:32:51,089 --> 01:32:52,683
Depends on Hanoi.

978
01:32:53,472 --> 01:32:55,544
If he's lucky, he'll be a Commander.

979
01:32:59,398 --> 01:33:00,195
How is Cam Nuong?

980
01:33:01,840 --> 01:33:03,321
They need to get out of Vietnam.

981
01:33:04,363 --> 01:33:05,922
Can you help them?

982
01:33:09,047 --> 01:33:10,562
There's a boat every day.

983
01:33:10,929 --> 01:33:12,250
I know one captain.

984
01:33:12,651 --> 01:33:13,971
But it'll be expensive.

985
01:33:16,895 --> 01:33:19,207
Take my camera and lens.

986
01:33:19,898 --> 01:33:21,253
Must be worth a few thousand.

987
01:33:22,741 --> 01:33:24,415
But it must be by the day after tomorrow.

988
01:33:24,703 --> 01:33:26,184
I'm leaving then.

989
01:33:26,745 --> 01:33:29,022
I hope I can see them off before I go.

990
01:33:31,069 --> 01:33:32,140
I'll do my best.

991
01:33:34,113 --> 01:33:35,513
I'll need some cash too.

992
01:33:36,074 --> 01:33:38,716
I have some. Come by tomorrow.

993
01:33:48,227 --> 01:33:49,707
You are not leaving yet?

994
01:33:49,908 --> 01:33:54,464
Three days later.
Thank you for all your hospitality.

995
01:33:55,774 --> 01:33:57,926
You're an artist.

996
01:33:58,217 --> 01:34:02,373
All artists are my friends.

997
01:34:03,502 --> 01:34:05,222
I have to leave myself.

998
01:34:10,029 --> 01:34:16,065
Remember that time you wanted
to take my photo?

999
01:34:16,996 --> 01:34:18,954
You can do it now.

1000
01:34:24,243 --> 01:34:25,597
I don't have my camera.

1001
01:34:30,049 --> 01:34:33,966
You wanted a photo of my scar.

1002
01:34:34,413 --> 01:34:36,770
I'm sure my photo

1003
01:34:36,976 --> 01:34:39,776
would make your collection more popular.

1004
01:34:50,149 --> 01:34:52,301
Comrade Nguyen, congratulations.

1005
01:34:53,112 --> 01:34:54,945
You've been appointed.

1006
01:34:55,154 --> 01:34:56,827
Commander of the N.E.Z. At Mao Nam.

1007
01:34:57,036 --> 01:34:59,711
The car is waiting. Let's go.

1008
01:35:01,480 --> 01:35:03,200
Let me get dressed.

1009
01:35:04,163 --> 01:35:06,964
Why bother, you look fine as you are.

1010
01:35:19,408 --> 01:35:22,961
There are scents as fresh as innocent children.

1011
01:35:23,582 --> 01:35:27,545
Mixed with rich, triumphant, corrupted scents.

1012
01:35:44,763 --> 01:35:46,562
We are true comrades, you and me.

1013
01:35:58,447 --> 01:36:01,487
Mr. Akutagawa, to be
a true revolutionary...

1014
01:36:01,690 --> 01:36:04,161
you must reject
petty-bourgeois emotions!

1015
01:36:08,898 --> 01:36:10,651
You have three more days here.

1016
01:36:12,381 --> 01:36:15,774
Right, I came here to say Goodbye.

1017
01:36:22,031 --> 01:36:23,226
Goodbye!

1018
01:36:23,792 --> 01:36:25,945
Goodbye, Akutagawa-san.

1019
01:36:27,276 --> 01:36:27,948
If you see To Minh,

1020
01:36:28,157 --> 01:36:30,354
tell him not to forget the bar
in New Orleans.

1021
01:36:30,960 --> 01:36:32,599
I'll be working till I'm 70.

1022
01:36:33,602 --> 01:36:34,752
I will.

1023
01:37:12,811 --> 01:37:15,281
I'm frightened, Sister. Hold me!

1024
01:37:52,370 --> 01:37:56,253
What's that, Uncle?

1025
01:37:56,454 --> 01:37:58,447
Diesel oil. Can you lift it?

1026
01:38:00,979 --> 01:38:02,254
I'm not strong enough.

1027
01:38:04,062 --> 01:38:06,499
You'll have to eat more then, won't you?

1028
01:38:12,030 --> 01:38:13,624
You'll need these papers for the boat.

1029
01:38:15,674 --> 01:38:19,431
And you'll need this US money.

1030
01:38:19,638 --> 01:38:20,913
Keep it safe.

1031
01:38:25,203 --> 01:38:27,241
The boat you're on is very reliable.

1032
01:38:27,726 --> 01:38:30,482
They asked you to bring
one can of diesel.

1033
01:38:30,689 --> 01:38:32,169
I'll take it for you.

1034
01:38:35,614 --> 01:38:44,291
Second Brother, do you like the way
your sister sings?

1035
01:38:44,503 --> 01:38:45,379
Yes!

1036
01:38:46,424 --> 01:38:48,144
Ask her to sing again.

1037
01:38:48,466 --> 01:38:50,299
Sing it again, Sister.

1038
01:40:44,142 --> 01:40:45,462
Stop! Who's there?

1039
01:40:45,664 --> 01:40:46,939
- Stop... - Don't go...

1040
01:40:47,185 --> 01:40:49,907
Run to the boat. Now!

1041
01:40:50,789 --> 01:40:52,189
Over there.

1042
01:41:03,361 --> 01:41:04,317
Who are you?

1043
01:41:09,207 --> 01:41:10,197
I'm Japanese.

1044
01:41:10,609 --> 01:41:12,522
What are you doing here? Your ID?

1045
01:41:20,859 --> 01:41:22,931
What are you doing out this late?

1046
01:41:23,582 --> 01:41:25,096
I couldn't sleep.

1047
01:41:28,507 --> 01:41:29,623
Comrade.

1048
01:41:30,509 --> 01:41:32,341
I've been here a month

1049
01:41:32,551 --> 01:41:34,383
but I can't find a woman?

1050
01:41:36,234 --> 01:41:38,956
Mr. Akutagawa, this is not
a safe district.

1051
01:41:39,157 --> 01:41:40,990
It's very late. You'd better
go back to your hotel.

1052
01:41:43,321 --> 01:41:49,483
Papers, Okay, where's your diesel oil?

1053
01:41:49,688 --> 01:41:50,599
It's coming, right behind us.

1054
01:41:50,809 --> 01:41:52,323
You can't go without it.
Don't block the way.

1055
01:41:55,213 --> 01:41:56,442
Papers!

1056
01:42:10,068 --> 01:42:12,265
Stop running!

1057
01:42:16,074 --> 01:42:17,030
Sail!

1058
01:42:19,157 --> 01:42:20,307
Get aboard!

1059
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:22,877
Cast off!
