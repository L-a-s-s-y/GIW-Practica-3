3
00:00:17,251 --> 00:00:18,786
Scene 1.

4
00:00:18,919 --> 00:00:23,624
<i>Estuary of a great river
in the gulf of Thessaloniki...</i>

5
00:00:23,858 --> 00:00:26,060
<i>around 1919.</i>

6
00:00:27,495 --> 00:00:31,832
<i>A light mist wafts slowly
over the muddy earth...</i>

7
00:00:32,199 --> 00:00:35,970
<i>that extends as far as the eye
can see, bare as a steppe...</i>

8
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:39,774
<i>A crowd of people appears,
walking slowly...</i>

9
00:00:39,874 --> 00:00:43,110
<i>holding bundles and suitcases.</i>

10
00:00:43,277 --> 00:00:47,515
<i>Their clothes, worn and dusty,
betray an old nobility.</i>

11
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:52,119
<i>A man of around 40
leads the way, with his wife...</i>

12
00:00:52,219 --> 00:00:56,757
a <i>sickly woman. ..
and between them, two small children...</i>

13
00:00:56,891 --> 00:01:00,294
<i>their son, a boy not more
than 5 years old...</i>

14
00:01:01,062 --> 00:01:04,298
<i>and a little girl,
barely more than a baby.</i>

15
00:01:05,866 --> 00:01:10,104
<i>Every so often the little girl
reaches out dazedly.</i> ..

16
00:01:10,337 --> 00:01:13,140
<i>For the boy's hand.</i>

17
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:17,211
<i>As they approach the river,
the mass of humanity stops abruptly</i>

18
00:01:17,678 --> 00:01:20,347
<i>as though someone
on the opposite bank...</i>

19
00:01:20,414 --> 00:01:21,982
<i>shouted to them.</i>

20
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:25,352
Hey! Who are you?

21
00:01:25,486 --> 00:01:27,721
Where are you from?

22
00:01:30,858 --> 00:01:33,060
We're Greeks.

23
00:01:34,361 --> 00:01:36,664
Refugees from Odessa...

24
00:01:38,699 --> 00:01:41,702
The boats brought us out
in Thessaloniki.

25
00:01:42,002 --> 00:01:44,505
We were quarantined
for one month in the port...

26
00:01:44,605 --> 00:01:46,807
eating out of cans...

27
00:01:47,374 --> 00:01:50,644
Then the authorities
separated us.

28
00:01:50,845 --> 00:01:53,948
They told us to go east.

29
00:01:55,182 --> 00:01:58,419
You'll come to an ancient
column and a river...

30
00:01:58,853 --> 00:02:02,189
From the column to the river
the land is yours.

31
00:02:09,263 --> 00:02:12,500
The Bolshevik revolution
was spreading everywhere...

32
00:02:12,933 --> 00:02:15,269
The Red Cavalry galloped...

33
00:02:15,636 --> 00:02:18,038
the foreigners were fleeing...

34
00:02:18,706 --> 00:02:20,774
The city's Greek community emptied.

35
00:02:20,875 --> 00:02:22,943
We were the last ones left.

36
00:02:23,043 --> 00:02:25,112
The Consul shouted:

37
00:02:25,246 --> 00:02:28,382
Don't you realise
you're in danger?

38
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:34,388
<i>And as though reliving a nightmare
the man begins to describe</i>

39
00:02:34,788 --> 00:02:37,024
<i>the flight of the Greeks
from Odessa...</i>

40
00:02:37,124 --> 00:02:41,262
<i>when on</i> Saint Stefan's Day,
the Red Army entered the city.

41
00:02:42,496 --> 00:02:47,434
<i>As they left on the last ship,
they could still hear...</i>

42
00:02:47,501 --> 00:02:51,472
<i>cries of desperation,
names in the wind, gunfire.</i>

43
00:02:52,506 --> 00:02:54,942
<i>Then the man said:</i>

44
00:02:56,143 --> 00:02:59,180
<i>"A cloud of smoke rose...</i>

45
00:03:00,414 --> 00:03:03,417
<i>and the beloved city
disappeared</i>

46
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:08,422
<i>The little girl still searched
for the boy's hand.</i>

47
00:03:09,423 --> 00:03:12,826
The little girl next to my son
isn't ours...

48
00:03:13,694 --> 00:03:17,064
We found her
crying in the turmoil...

49
00:03:17,865 --> 00:03:21,001
over her mother's body,
on Pushkin Avenue...

50
00:03:21,135 --> 00:03:23,404
if you've heard of it...

51
00:03:35,482 --> 00:03:37,651
What's your name?

52
00:03:37,718 --> 00:03:39,853
Eleni.

53
00:03:45,492 --> 00:03:50,264
TRILOGY
The Weeping Meadow

54
00:05:55,155 --> 00:05:58,926
a film by Theo Angelopoulos

55
00:07:09,029 --> 00:07:11,532
Eleni's back!

56
00:09:22,129 --> 00:09:25,432
- How do you feel, little one?
- Better, Auntie.

57
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:35,108
- Danae! Finally!
- I'll tell you everything.

58
00:09:55,062 --> 00:09:59,533
- Unbelievable! And the twins?
- Adoption. I'll tell you later.

59
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:05,672
Eleni...

60
00:10:06,006 --> 00:10:08,342
I brought your books.

61
00:10:13,347 --> 00:10:16,016
Are you feeling better?

62
00:10:27,928 --> 00:10:30,097
I'm thirsty.

63
00:10:33,734 --> 00:10:37,004
Most of our people,
those who were unable to endure life...

64
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:39,873
here on the river
and went back to Thessaloniki...

65
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:45,912
are now leaving again.
America, Australia, Athens...

66
00:10:46,747 --> 00:10:51,251
This land is killing us.
We should have left too in '22...

67
00:10:52,052 --> 00:10:54,855
when those peasants came
from the Orient...

68
00:10:54,921 --> 00:10:58,558
Your brother Spyros
wouldn't hear of it, Cassandra.

69
00:10:58,659 --> 00:11:01,928
Danae, the girl's delirious...

70
00:11:02,229 --> 00:11:04,531
If Spyros found out anything,
he'd kill her.

71
00:11:04,598 --> 00:11:08,035
It's pointless.
The girl's not of our blood.

72
00:11:08,101 --> 00:11:09,770
Have you spoken to your son?

73
00:11:09,836 --> 00:11:13,106
- He's in a daze.
- Of course! After what he did!

74
00:11:15,075 --> 00:11:18,245
Couldn't you have prevented it?

75
00:11:18,412 --> 00:11:21,615
By the time I found out,
it was too late.

76
00:11:23,483 --> 00:11:26,453
Good thing I came up with
that story about her being sick...

77
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:29,823
and took her to my sister
in Thessaloniki...

78
00:11:29,923 --> 00:11:32,159
for the last months...

79
00:11:35,262 --> 00:11:37,831
Then we found that good woman.

80
00:11:37,931 --> 00:11:40,934
You know her husband's
a merchant. Childless.

81
00:11:41,001 --> 00:11:44,204
No, no, the twins
are in good hands.

82
00:11:46,807 --> 00:11:48,842
Spyros!

83
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:03,990
And your son, behind his father
as though nothing happened.

84
00:12:54,741 --> 00:12:56,877
Hello, brother!

85
00:15:11,344 --> 00:15:13,079
Eleni!

86
00:15:36,169 --> 00:15:39,172
- Eleni!
- I was expecting you.

87
00:15:39,539 --> 00:15:42,809
I was in the cellar,
behind a door.

88
00:15:43,576 --> 00:15:46,913
I heard my mother
and the women whispering.

89
00:15:49,015 --> 00:15:51,084
My head buzzed.

90
00:15:52,852 --> 00:15:55,989
- Does it hurt?
- Not any more.

91
00:15:57,624 --> 00:16:00,727
I didn't know what to do
while you were gone...

92
00:16:01,027 --> 00:16:04,197
I'd go down to the river
and look at the water.

93
00:16:08,201 --> 00:16:11,738
Remember we used to say
we'd follow the river...

94
00:16:11,805 --> 00:16:14,007
to find the source?

95
00:16:14,808 --> 00:16:17,110
I wrote you a letter.

96
00:16:17,911 --> 00:16:19,946
Eleni...

97
00:16:20,981 --> 00:16:23,083
I want to say that...

98
00:16:23,616 --> 00:16:26,820
you know...
I care a lot about you.

99
00:17:03,623 --> 00:17:05,558
Eleni!

100
00:17:06,459 --> 00:17:08,395
Eleni!

101
00:17:24,711 --> 00:17:27,814
The bride has gone!

102
00:17:33,153 --> 00:17:35,955
Hallelujah!

103
00:17:39,159 --> 00:17:41,361
Eleni!

104
00:17:52,038 --> 00:17:53,640
Hallelujah!

105
00:17:53,807 --> 00:18:00,413
Oh Lord, save thy people
and bless thine inheritance...

106
00:18:00,513 --> 00:18:04,951
To our Rulers grant victories
over the barbarians...

107
00:18:05,018 --> 00:18:09,122
and by thy Cross
protect thine own Estate.

108
00:18:33,213 --> 00:18:35,682
The bride has gone!

109
00:18:58,538 --> 00:19:00,707
Spyros!

110
00:19:02,041 --> 00:19:04,277
Eleni wasn't for you!

111
00:19:04,544 --> 00:19:07,580
She was raised
like your daughter.

112
00:19:08,448 --> 00:19:11,651
This marriage was not
appropriate for you.

113
00:19:15,388 --> 00:19:21,628
Poor Spyros. Ever since Danae
died in the great epidemic...

114
00:19:21,728 --> 00:19:23,930
he's been eaten up
by loneliness.

115
00:19:24,063 --> 00:19:26,199
He yearned for the girl.

116
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,802
I stood behind her
in the church...

117
00:19:30,503 --> 00:19:33,773
The wedding ceremony ended.
The priest said "Amen"...

118
00:19:35,909 --> 00:19:38,244
and suddenly I saw her
turn around...

119
00:19:39,946 --> 00:19:43,249
Her face shone pale
like the Virgin.

120
00:19:45,585 --> 00:19:48,454
She said to Spyros:
"I've forgotten something"...

121
00:19:48,588 --> 00:19:50,623
And she ran out...

122
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:53,459
I ran after her.

123
00:19:57,096 --> 00:20:01,401
I managed to see her lift
the skirt of her wedding dress...

124
00:20:03,169 --> 00:20:07,173
and disappear down the road
leading to the river.

125
00:20:55,021 --> 00:20:56,923
A car!

126
00:21:21,714 --> 00:21:24,550
The whole village
is looking for you.

127
00:21:25,918 --> 00:21:29,055
Was it you
playing the accordion all night?

128
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:32,525
Where are you going?

129
00:22:12,265 --> 00:22:13,900
Spyros!

130
00:22:14,233 --> 00:22:15,935
Spyros!

131
00:22:17,937 --> 00:22:20,973
A boy has come from the river.

132
00:22:21,341 --> 00:22:25,111
Our brothers want you
to go there.

133
00:22:41,828 --> 00:22:43,396
Spyros!

134
00:22:44,697 --> 00:22:46,432
Spyros!

135
00:24:43,649 --> 00:24:45,852
Thanks! So long!

136
00:24:50,223 --> 00:24:51,958
Come along!

137
00:24:53,392 --> 00:24:56,596
Hell, you've got to spend
the night somewhere!

138
00:25:00,466 --> 00:25:02,602
Don't be scared!

139
00:25:02,735 --> 00:25:04,971
You're under the protection
of a fiddle...

140
00:25:05,104 --> 00:25:09,275
a guitar, a clarinet
and a noisy fourth instrument!

141
00:25:39,705 --> 00:25:41,574
- Good night.
- Good night.

142
00:25:41,641 --> 00:25:44,277
- I'm sorry it didn't happen.
- Good night, Nikos.

143
00:25:44,443 --> 00:25:45,978
Good night.

144
00:26:09,135 --> 00:26:12,305
"Thessaloniki,
city of refugees."

145
00:26:13,239 --> 00:26:16,042
Isn't that what they call it?

146
00:26:18,377 --> 00:26:21,314
A wound that will not heal.

147
00:26:26,252 --> 00:26:28,888
This theatre is my home.

148
00:26:39,932 --> 00:26:42,134
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

149
00:26:43,369 --> 00:26:46,539
This is where the authorities
brought us in early '22...

150
00:26:46,606 --> 00:26:49,041
after the destruction
of Smyrna.

151
00:26:49,175 --> 00:26:51,410
The courtyard of miracles.

152
00:26:51,911 --> 00:26:54,213
85 families.

153
00:26:56,182 --> 00:26:57,416
Good evening, Amy.

154
00:26:57,516 --> 00:27:00,019
I'm having no luck with
this game of solitaire.

155
00:27:00,086 --> 00:27:01,587
Courage !

156
00:27:01,787 --> 00:27:03,889
Our good girl.

157
00:27:05,391 --> 00:27:07,860
- Good evening, Irini.
- Good evening, Nikos.

158
00:27:08,027 --> 00:27:10,896
- I see you have company.
- Good evening.

159
00:27:12,098 --> 00:27:15,868
That prima donna
you can hear singing has a sister.

160
00:27:16,035 --> 00:27:18,170
She doesn't talk to me.

161
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:20,206
She prays.

162
00:27:21,974 --> 00:27:25,244
She lies with the Book
of Revelation in her hands...

163
00:27:25,945 --> 00:27:28,648
open at the same chapter...

164
00:27:29,048 --> 00:27:31,550
her finger pointing
to the same passage...

165
00:27:33,452 --> 00:27:37,056
and my mother asleep as always.

166
00:27:39,291 --> 00:27:41,360
Good night, Mum.

167
00:27:42,928 --> 00:27:48,367
My music will be in its place
and the lamp lit as always.

168
00:27:49,935 --> 00:27:53,539
"Nikos, the fiddler,"
as I'm known on the streets...

169
00:27:53,606 --> 00:27:57,777
is also a graduate
of the Smyrna Conservatory, but...

170
00:28:00,513 --> 00:28:02,715
You'll stay here...

171
00:28:04,083 --> 00:28:06,752
until you decide where you'll go,
what you'll do.

172
00:28:06,852 --> 00:28:08,454
Are you cold?

173
00:28:08,621 --> 00:28:11,791
The women will take care of you.

174
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:17,129
As I said, kid.
I heard you play.

175
00:28:17,263 --> 00:28:20,499
That's gold you have
in your hands. Don't bury it.

176
00:28:21,133 --> 00:28:22,435
Good night.

177
00:28:22,702 --> 00:28:24,904
- Good night.
- Good night.

178
00:28:28,541 --> 00:28:32,111
I still can't believe
we're in a theatre!

179
00:28:55,034 --> 00:28:56,836
<i>M'! boys!</i>

180
00:30:33,766 --> 00:30:36,435
How many times
have I said it?

181
00:30:36,502 --> 00:30:42,074
Watch your posture.
Body upright, back straight...

182
00:30:42,141 --> 00:30:44,109
feet in front.

183
00:30:44,243 --> 00:30:47,346
Keep your hands nicely
poised over the keyboard.

184
00:30:47,413 --> 00:30:49,648
Work together.
Listen to each other.

185
00:30:49,815 --> 00:30:54,286
You have the melody, Yorgos.
Louder, more outgoing!

186
00:30:57,456 --> 00:31:01,727
Always in secret...
like a thief!

187
00:31:16,175 --> 00:31:18,744
<i>"And I heard a great voice
out of the temple...</i>

188
00:31:18,811 --> 00:31:22,681
<i>saying to the seven angels,
'Go your ways and...“</i>

189
00:31:23,649 --> 00:31:26,285
Hey, where did you disappear to?

190
00:31:26,819 --> 00:31:29,622
We went for a walk downtown.

191
00:31:29,722 --> 00:31:31,557
Good night.

192
00:31:31,690 --> 00:31:35,027
Alright. We'll talk in the morning.
The offer stands, kid.

193
00:31:35,694 --> 00:31:38,097
- Good night.
- Good night.

194
00:31:48,974 --> 00:31:54,013
<i>"And the first went, and poured out
his vial upon the earth...</i>

195
00:31:54,179 --> 00:32:00,119
<i>and there fell a noisome
and grievous sore upon the men...</i>

196
00:32:01,921 --> 00:32:04,623
<i>which had the mark of
the beast...</i>

197
00:32:04,757 --> 00:32:07,326
<i>and upon them which
worshipped his image</i>

198
00:32:07,493 --> 00:32:09,461
Eleni!

199
00:32:12,097 --> 00:32:15,467
- What is it?
- Nothing, mother. Go to sleep.

200
00:32:15,534 --> 00:32:18,671
- What's going on, Nikos?
- Nothing.

201
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:27,179
Eleni!

202
00:32:32,918 --> 00:32:35,187
You can't stay here
any longer.

203
00:32:35,254 --> 00:32:37,156
Let's

204
00:32:43,729 --> 00:32:45,864
I know you're here!

205
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,342
Come on!

206
00:33:13,292 --> 00:33:16,362
Go to the neighbourhood
with the sheets!

207
00:33:17,429 --> 00:33:19,598
- The clothes we borrowed?
- Go! Go!

208
00:33:21,266 --> 00:33:23,235
Eleni!

209
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:37,216
I know you're here!

210
00:33:42,087 --> 00:33:45,257
That woman you're holding
in your arms, my son...

211
00:33:46,358 --> 00:33:48,460
that's my wife!

212
00:33:58,637 --> 00:34:00,773
You've shamed me.

213
00:34:03,308 --> 00:34:06,478
I no longer have
any pride or honour.

214
00:34:08,313 --> 00:34:10,649
Everyone pities me.

215
00:34:21,894 --> 00:34:26,432
I know you're here,
goddamn you!

216
00:34:57,529 --> 00:34:59,531
Eleni!

217
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:28,227
Eleni...

218
00:35:29,528 --> 00:35:31,396
Are you awake?

219
00:35:39,438 --> 00:35:41,073
Good morning, Costas.

220
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:43,208
Good morning, Mrs Coula.

221
00:35:59,091 --> 00:36:01,226
The house next door flooded.

222
00:36:01,326 --> 00:36:03,462
And I've got a leaky roof.

223
00:36:11,236 --> 00:36:14,406
- Good morning.
- Good morning. Just a minute.

224
00:36:18,477 --> 00:36:20,612
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

225
00:36:20,779 --> 00:36:24,082
- Did you sleep well last night?
- It was a little difficult.

226
00:36:24,449 --> 00:36:27,920
Christ, what a downpour that was...
all night long.

227
00:36:29,488 --> 00:36:31,390
We're late.

228
00:36:44,036 --> 00:36:45,637
Katerina!

229
00:36:47,439 --> 00:36:49,975
Katerina! I brought you
the recipe.

230
00:36:53,812 --> 00:36:56,081
- Good morning, Frosso.
- What good morning!

231
00:36:56,215 --> 00:36:59,651
I've been hanging clothes
since the crack of dawn.

232
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:03,488
- Good morning.
- 'Morning.

233
00:37:06,291 --> 00:37:08,527
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

234
00:37:43,729 --> 00:37:46,932
Welcome to the musicians' hangout.

235
00:37:47,099 --> 00:37:49,901
D'you mind waiting here
for a while?

236
00:37:58,877 --> 00:38:00,746
Come along, my girl.

237
00:43:03,214 --> 00:43:05,016
America!

238
00:43:20,198 --> 00:43:22,534
You didn't answer me.

239
00:43:23,501 --> 00:43:26,037
I sold a ring of my mother's.

240
00:43:26,204 --> 00:43:27,672
What?

241
00:43:28,873 --> 00:43:32,043
I couldn't see you
in other people's clothes any more.

242
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:39,150
- What's the matter?
- I don't know.

243
00:43:39,351 --> 00:43:43,755
I feel strange...
as though someone's watching us.

244
00:43:54,699 --> 00:43:56,701
Father!

245
00:45:36,401 --> 00:45:38,269
Zissis!

246
00:45:39,804 --> 00:45:41,539
We're leaving!

247
00:46:25,617 --> 00:46:27,519
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

248
00:46:27,585 --> 00:46:29,554
- An ouzo, boss!
- Regular? Double?

249
00:46:29,621 --> 00:46:33,091
- With this weather? Double!
- Coming right up!

250
00:46:54,712 --> 00:46:57,849
- Double. Dry.
- Come on in, guys.

251
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:03,688
- 'Evening.
- 'Evening.

252
00:47:03,755 --> 00:47:07,892
Nikos, the fiddler.
Nondas, the bouzouki player.

253
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:12,130
Achilles plays
the toumbeleki.

254
00:47:12,430 --> 00:47:15,133
It's not a great gig, guys...
something on the fly...

255
00:47:15,233 --> 00:47:18,369
but for want of anything better...
How about it?

256
00:47:18,570 --> 00:47:20,939
You need to ask?
When do we leave?

257
00:47:21,072 --> 00:47:24,108
Tonight. We'll just make
the night train.

258
00:47:24,442 --> 00:47:27,478
- So? What will it be?
- We're out of here!

259
00:47:34,252 --> 00:47:36,621
- An ouzo.
- Coming right up.

260
00:47:36,855 --> 00:47:38,756
Let's see now.
What have we got?

261
00:47:38,823 --> 00:47:41,593
Clarinet, toumbeleki,
bouzouki, violin...

262
00:47:41,659 --> 00:47:43,995
- and...
- Accordion?

263
00:47:45,263 --> 00:47:48,233
He's coming. If he agrees...

264
00:47:52,437 --> 00:47:55,607
- Good evening.
- Hello there, kid.

265
00:47:57,508 --> 00:47:59,677
You wanted to see me?

266
00:47:59,844 --> 00:48:01,846
<i>I</i> got us a gig-

267
00:48:01,980 --> 00:48:04,949
We're missing an accordion player.
How about it?

268
00:48:05,817 --> 00:48:07,852
It won't be for long.

269
00:48:07,986 --> 00:48:10,321
That way you can see
if you've got what it takes.

270
00:48:10,455 --> 00:48:13,124
I'm out of here.
I've got to get ready.

271
00:48:32,243 --> 00:48:34,445
I'd like it to be you.

272
00:48:40,752 --> 00:48:42,453
You!

273
00:48:45,223 --> 00:48:48,493
I can't forget that night
when I heard you play...

274
00:48:49,027 --> 00:48:51,029
for the first time.

275
00:49:08,346 --> 00:49:10,515
- Good evening.
- Hello there.

276
00:49:11,349 --> 00:49:14,319
Nikos has proposed
we go with him.

277
00:49:15,019 --> 00:49:17,355
We were leaving anyway.

278
00:49:20,959 --> 00:49:24,262
He came again last night
and prowled around.

279
00:49:25,697 --> 00:49:27,565
Goddammit!

280
00:49:29,133 --> 00:49:32,170
Then a train went by
and he disappeared.

281
00:49:32,437 --> 00:49:35,239
As though it took him with it.

282
00:50:30,495 --> 00:50:32,397
Nikos!

283
00:50:36,934 --> 00:50:38,569
Closed!

284
00:50:40,772 --> 00:50:42,673
- I've been had.
- I'll go ask next door.

285
00:50:43,007 --> 00:50:45,910
And now what do we do? What?

286
00:50:47,111 --> 00:50:48,746
What do we do indeed?

287
00:51:07,231 --> 00:51:13,371
Nikos, guys, the joint's closed.
That's what they said.

288
00:51:18,843 --> 00:51:24,816
Sorry, kid,
your first road tour backfired.

289
00:51:25,883 --> 00:51:30,721
I'm here because you said
I've got gold in my hands.

290
00:52:44,562 --> 00:52:46,264
We lost.

291
00:53:22,033 --> 00:53:24,135
He said we lost...

292
00:53:26,871 --> 00:53:30,675
but at least
let's go back in style.

293
00:53:35,012 --> 00:53:37,114
In style.

294
00:54:11,148 --> 00:54:12,683
My hat!

295
00:54:13,084 --> 00:54:15,119
I've lost my hat.

296
00:54:26,430 --> 00:54:29,133
My hat!
I've lost my hat!

297
00:56:18,876 --> 00:56:20,378
I'm leaving.

298
00:56:31,489 --> 00:56:33,491
I wouldn't want...

299
00:56:34,859 --> 00:56:38,129
I wouldn't want to play
in tavernas and at weddings.

300
00:56:40,965 --> 00:56:43,200
That's not music.

301
00:57:08,159 --> 00:57:11,462
We came from the Black Sea and
Asia Minor seeking a homeland...

302
00:57:11,562 --> 00:57:14,765
and they're carting us around
here and there like animals!

303
00:57:14,832 --> 00:57:16,700
They're turning this
into a camp.

304
00:57:16,767 --> 00:57:19,069
They're bringing army units
from the south.

305
00:57:19,170 --> 00:57:21,238
That's all we needed!
A war!

306
00:57:45,529 --> 00:57:46,897
Hello, guys.

307
00:57:47,031 --> 00:57:49,200
- Where's the kid?
- Upstairs.

308
00:58:21,398 --> 00:58:23,267
Hey, kid!

309
00:58:25,636 --> 00:58:27,905
Hello, guys.
How's it going?

310
00:58:30,508 --> 00:58:32,009
I'm listening.

311
00:58:33,344 --> 00:58:36,480
Markos is looking for you.
You know who he is.

312
00:58:36,580 --> 00:58:39,717
He's putting together a band
and wants an accordion player.

313
00:58:39,783 --> 00:58:41,519
He heard about you.

314
00:58:41,685 --> 00:58:43,988
- Markos? Me?
- Yes.

315
00:58:44,455 --> 00:58:47,825
I've been wanting to tell you for days
but because Nikos...

316
00:58:47,958 --> 00:58:51,161
you see, the fiddler
has a soft spot for you...

317
00:58:51,295 --> 00:58:53,664
I didn't want to and...

318
00:58:54,198 --> 00:58:56,500
Come this afternoon
so he can hear you play.

319
00:58:56,600 --> 00:58:58,669
- OK?
- OK.

320
00:59:01,205 --> 00:59:03,474
I just came for you.

321
00:59:11,181 --> 00:59:13,284
Markos...

322
00:59:31,201 --> 00:59:33,370
Sit there and get ready.

323
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:46,083
Markos! He's here.
What shall I tell him?

324
01:00:09,239 --> 01:00:11,075
He's listening.

325
01:01:36,260 --> 01:01:39,296
Markos asks
what's that you're playing?

326
01:01:42,533 --> 01:01:44,601
Something of mine.

327
01:01:58,048 --> 01:01:59,616
Kid!

328
01:01:59,683 --> 01:02:02,086
He asked me to tell you
it's been a long time...

329
01:02:02,186 --> 01:02:05,222
since he heard such a sound...

330
01:02:05,355 --> 01:02:07,758
He's getting ready to go
on tour in America...

331
01:02:07,858 --> 01:02:11,261
to play for the Greeks there.
What do you say? Interested?

332
01:02:18,235 --> 01:02:20,370
America!

333
01:02:21,572 --> 01:02:24,475
I think I'm dreaming!

334
01:02:24,808 --> 01:02:26,944
America!

335
01:02:29,980 --> 01:02:32,616
Don't get carried away.

336
01:02:32,716 --> 01:02:35,819
It's not for tomorrow.
It takes time.

337
01:02:41,525 --> 01:02:43,627
Eleni!

338
01:02:51,068 --> 01:02:52,336
Watch out!

339
01:02:52,402 --> 01:02:54,238
Thanassis! What happened?

340
01:02:54,338 --> 01:02:56,673
Long live the popular front!

341
01:03:20,097 --> 01:03:22,266
General strike!

342
01:04:59,062 --> 01:05:01,365
Would you like to dance?

343
01:05:02,799 --> 01:05:05,035
I'm waiting for the boat.

344
01:06:52,743 --> 01:06:54,644
Eleni!

345
01:07:14,531 --> 01:07:17,100
- You thought I betrayed you?
- Yes.

346
01:07:17,267 --> 01:07:19,469
You really thought
I betrayed you?

347
01:07:19,603 --> 01:07:20,971
Yes.

348
01:07:21,471 --> 01:07:23,573
How is that possible?

349
01:07:24,608 --> 01:07:26,476
How is that possible?

350
01:07:31,381 --> 01:07:33,450
How is that possible?

351
01:08:47,457 --> 01:08:49,326
America!

352
01:08:50,694 --> 01:08:52,429
Alexis!

353
01:08:52,762 --> 01:08:54,698
Paulina! Wait!

354
01:09:00,036 --> 01:09:01,872
Wait! Paulina!

355
01:09:08,979 --> 01:09:10,480
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

356
01:09:10,547 --> 01:09:11,781
Hello.

357
01:09:12,816 --> 01:09:14,551
<i>Boys!</i>

358
01:09:17,954 --> 01:09:20,056
Boys! Come here!

359
01:09:29,332 --> 01:09:32,802
Yannis... Yorgos...
won't you say hello?

360
01:09:58,128 --> 01:10:00,263
Won't you say hello?

361
01:10:01,698 --> 01:10:03,667
<i>He's angry“!-</i>

362
01:10:20,884 --> 01:10:23,353
They were hard times.

363
01:10:24,854 --> 01:10:27,724
I don't know if you can
understand that.

364
01:10:27,791 --> 01:10:29,693
Maybe we do.

365
01:10:31,361 --> 01:10:33,964
The other kids at school
have a name.

366
01:10:34,064 --> 01:10:36,333
What name do we have?

367
01:10:39,836 --> 01:10:44,140
Eleni... your mother...
and I thought...

368
01:10:44,674 --> 01:10:47,777
we'd take you for a stroll.

369
01:10:50,213 --> 01:10:52,382
I want to think about it.

370
01:10:53,850 --> 01:10:56,052
<i>He's angry“!-</i>

371
01:10:58,255 --> 01:11:00,557
Paulina! Wait!

372
01:11:20,944 --> 01:11:22,746
Good evening.

373
01:11:29,753 --> 01:11:31,921
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

374
01:11:32,922 --> 01:11:36,059
One coffee,
easy on the sugar, please.

375
01:12:14,931 --> 01:12:18,134
What a shame!
He isn't here.

376
01:12:18,468 --> 01:12:20,570
Is this the musicians' hangout?

377
01:12:20,670 --> 01:12:21,971
That's right.

378
01:12:22,272 --> 01:12:24,974
But no one's here now?

379
01:12:25,075 --> 01:12:27,243
And what do musicians do here?

380
01:12:27,310 --> 01:12:28,812
Musicians?

381
01:12:30,180 --> 01:12:31,848
Musicians...

382
01:12:39,489 --> 01:12:41,758
Musicians are spread out
all around here...

383
01:12:41,825 --> 01:12:43,460
and they wait.

384
01:12:43,760 --> 01:12:45,962
Then some people come...

385
01:12:46,096 --> 01:12:48,431
on the street
we call them customers...

386
01:12:48,531 --> 01:12:49,933
who own a taverna...

387
01:12:49,999 --> 01:12:53,370
or are looking for a musician
to play at some party...

388
01:12:53,470 --> 01:12:56,506
They walk in front of
each musician...

389
01:12:56,606 --> 01:12:58,775
and cup their hand
behind their ear...

390
01:12:58,842 --> 01:13:00,910
as though they're saying:
I'm listening. Play!

391
01:13:02,212 --> 01:13:04,314
And they take their pick.

392
01:13:04,447 --> 01:13:07,150
Someone picks a fiddler.

393
01:13:08,852 --> 01:13:11,621
Another a clarinet player.

394
01:13:12,889 --> 01:13:14,991
Another a guitarist...

395
01:13:16,292 --> 01:13:17,994
And what do you do?

396
01:13:18,795 --> 01:13:20,063
Me?

397
01:13:27,470 --> 01:13:28,938
And you, Mum?

398
01:13:37,414 --> 01:13:39,549
You called me "Mum," Yorgis?

399
01:13:46,489 --> 01:13:50,727
The party organizations and
trade unions who are fighting...

400
01:13:50,894 --> 01:13:56,866
to defend the interests of the people
have decided...

401
01:13:57,066 --> 01:14:00,203
to form a popular front.

402
01:14:03,206 --> 01:14:05,708
Comrades! Comrades!

403
01:14:06,576 --> 01:14:11,848
Only if workers rally
and fight under the flag...

404
01:14:12,115 --> 01:14:18,488
of the popular front
will the people's demands be met.

405
01:14:21,224 --> 01:14:26,262
The popular front calls on
all the antifascist...

406
01:14:27,864 --> 01:14:31,234
Nikos!
I had to tell you.

407
01:14:33,536 --> 01:14:36,573
- Markos asked for me.
- So I heard.

408
01:14:39,642 --> 01:14:41,244
Good morning.

409
01:14:42,545 --> 01:14:45,515
I knew you'd leave some day.
You're special.

410
01:14:45,615 --> 01:14:47,951
Guys! The gendarmes!

411
01:14:48,384 --> 01:14:50,253
Let's

412
01:14:50,386 --> 01:14:52,522
Guys! The gendarmes!

413
01:15:22,952 --> 01:15:24,521
This way!

414
01:16:17,540 --> 01:16:20,176
Everyone's afraid the General
will stage a coup...

415
01:16:20,310 --> 01:16:23,413
with the King's consent...
and no one's talking.

416
01:16:23,546 --> 01:16:27,050
Days of 36...
dark nights...

417
01:16:29,752 --> 01:16:31,988
I miss you, kid.

418
01:17:05,622 --> 01:17:08,825
I said cut it out.
I'm thinking.

419
01:17:10,226 --> 01:17:13,429
Nikos, the dance...
it looks like it can't happen.

420
01:17:13,529 --> 01:17:16,666
What do we do?
Shall we break it up?

421
01:17:24,140 --> 01:17:27,210
I'm bringing the drinks
and I'm not asking!

422
01:17:27,377 --> 01:17:31,280
What's going on, you guys?
People got tired of waiting.

423
01:17:31,914 --> 01:17:35,518
They all went home.
It's deserted out there.

424
01:17:35,752 --> 01:17:38,921
- Can't you see?
- What are we supposed to do?

425
01:17:39,322 --> 01:17:41,357
The old beer hall.

426
01:17:42,091 --> 01:17:44,394
That's where we'll hold
the dance!

427
01:17:44,494 --> 01:17:46,796
I just thought of it!
In the old beer hall!

428
01:17:46,896 --> 01:17:49,198
- In that old dump?
- So what?

429
01:17:49,298 --> 01:17:51,634
Wine we've got.
Music we've got.

430
01:17:51,768 --> 01:17:53,670
And there's that old piano there.

431
01:17:53,736 --> 01:17:55,938
You go out there
and tell them.

432
01:18:03,579 --> 01:18:04,781
OK.

433
01:18:05,782 --> 01:18:07,183
I will.

434
01:18:14,857 --> 01:18:16,392
Saxophone!

435
01:18:40,450 --> 01:18:45,321
I'm someone condemned
to creating in the mud!

436
01:18:47,790 --> 01:18:50,426
The tavernas don't want us.

437
01:18:51,728 --> 01:18:55,898
They're afraid of the police.

438
01:18:57,700 --> 01:19:01,471
So we decided to hold
the trade union dance...

439
01:19:01,537 --> 01:19:03,706
in the old beer hall!

440
01:19:04,974 --> 01:19:06,976
We'll have music!

441
01:19:08,244 --> 01:19:10,346
And we'll have wine!

442
01:19:12,148 --> 01:19:16,018
And we can sing without
the wind carrying off our voices.

443
01:19:23,092 --> 01:19:25,294
We're expecting you there!

444
01:20:02,098 --> 01:20:04,867
There's a lot of people coming!

445
01:20:04,967 --> 01:20:06,235
Music!

446
01:20:28,090 --> 01:20:29,425
Get chairs!

447
01:20:30,159 --> 01:20:32,228
Chairs, guys!

448
01:21:56,312 --> 01:21:58,047
It's nothing...

449
01:21:58,381 --> 01:22:00,316
a friend turned informer!

450
01:22:08,491 --> 01:22:10,693
The strike will take place!

451
01:22:10,760 --> 01:22:12,495
Music!

452
01:25:36,799 --> 01:25:38,534
I heard...

453
01:25:41,704 --> 01:25:45,040
that this kid can make
even the trees dance.

454
01:25:48,878 --> 01:25:51,080
I want him to play for me.

455
01:25:53,215 --> 01:25:55,284
He knows what.

456
01:27:22,137 --> 01:27:23,806
Music!

457
01:28:36,278 --> 01:28:38,280
I killed him.

458
01:33:21,029 --> 01:33:23,131
Father's sheep.

459
01:39:08,443 --> 01:39:11,479
- What is it?
- I hear voices.

460
01:39:26,695 --> 01:39:28,897
The basement's flooded.

461
01:40:23,618 --> 01:40:25,754
The village is drowning
in the river.

462
01:40:25,854 --> 01:40:28,123
There are boats floating
in the square.

463
01:40:28,456 --> 01:40:30,125
What shall we do?

464
01:40:40,535 --> 01:40:42,771
What shall we do?

465
01:40:51,546 --> 01:40:53,581
Hey!

466
01:40:54,783 --> 01:40:56,785
A boat!

467
01:40:59,821 --> 01:41:02,590
For the love of God.
I have children!

468
01:41:05,460 --> 01:41:07,328
A boat!

469
01:41:25,847 --> 01:41:28,716
There's a boat waiting downstairs,
under the balcony.

470
01:41:28,817 --> 01:41:30,285
I don't know who sent it.

471
01:41:30,351 --> 01:41:32,487
Wake the boys!

472
01:41:33,321 --> 01:41:35,523
Boys! Wake up! Let's go!

473
01:41:36,825 --> 01:41:39,761
- Where are we going?
- We're leaving, we're leaving.

474
01:42:41,623 --> 01:42:43,358
Eleni!

475
01:49:33,634 --> 01:49:39,674
Omnipotent, dark curse
that has yet to run its course...

476
01:55:06,734 --> 01:55:08,435
Nikos!

477
01:55:11,906 --> 01:55:15,142
What we were afraid of, kid,
it's happened.

478
01:55:15,976 --> 01:55:19,179
Our feeble democracy
committed suicide.

479
01:55:21,415 --> 01:55:24,652
Fascism is spreading
over the skies of Europe.

480
01:55:25,920 --> 01:55:29,156
They've arrested
all the guys from the union.

481
01:55:30,591 --> 01:55:32,726
I've nowhere to go.

482
01:56:39,460 --> 01:56:45,199
Onward for a new Greece!
Onward with a Greek heart!

483
01:56:46,734 --> 01:56:49,737
Onward proudly, bravely
with the boys of Greece!

484
01:56:49,803 --> 01:56:51,038
Falangists!

485
01:56:51,105 --> 01:56:56,643
Onward, for our past glory
in time will live again!

486
01:57:03,317 --> 01:57:06,687
When I woke up and didn't see you
beside me, I was afraid.

487
01:57:07,755 --> 01:57:10,057
I wanted to look at the sea.

488
01:57:11,525 --> 01:57:14,094
It's your first day outside.

489
01:57:15,329 --> 01:57:17,564
I longed for this day.

490
01:57:22,469 --> 01:57:25,939
All these months I went and
saw the children every day.

491
01:57:27,307 --> 01:57:30,144
All this time you were silent...

492
01:57:30,310 --> 01:57:32,513
I trembled at the thought
of losing you...

493
01:57:32,613 --> 01:57:34,248
So much happened.

494
01:57:36,350 --> 01:57:38,085
I was suffocating.

495
02:03:07,047 --> 02:03:08,815
Nikos!

496
02:03:10,784 --> 02:03:14,621
I hid him for as long
as I could!

497
02:04:55,889 --> 02:04:58,758
- You're here, kid?
- I'm here.

498
02:05:00,093 --> 02:05:05,031
I wanted to say goodbye
to you too.

499
02:06:00,554 --> 02:06:03,023
- Third whistle, Markos.
- We're leaving.

500
02:06:03,189 --> 02:06:07,460
Leave a boat for the kid.
He might still make it.

501
02:06:07,627 --> 02:06:09,829
We're leaving.

502
02:06:46,032 --> 02:06:48,201
Have a good journey!

503
02:06:48,435 --> 02:06:50,537
Write to us!

504
02:06:51,838 --> 02:06:55,141
Take care of yourselves!

505
02:06:56,176 --> 02:06:58,979
Have a good journey!

506
02:08:04,811 --> 02:08:06,713
They left!

507
02:08:16,790 --> 02:08:20,160
Markos and the others left.
There's a boat waiting for you.

508
02:08:38,945 --> 02:08:41,648
Don't be mad at me, Yorgis.

509
02:08:45,218 --> 02:08:47,320
Is America far away?

510
02:08:51,558 --> 02:08:53,660
Yannis, Yorgis...

511
02:08:54,794 --> 02:08:57,130
You take care of your mum.

512
02:09:36,035 --> 02:09:39,205
I didn't have time to finish it.

513
02:10:07,967 --> 02:10:11,171
<i>New York, 5 March 1937.</i>

514
02:10:11,971 --> 02:10:14,007
<i>My little Eleni...</i>

515
02:10:14,073 --> 02:10:17,377
<i>We arrived in America
with our hearts in our mouths...</i>

516
02:10:17,443 --> 02:10:20,847
<i>after facing danger
a thousand times on the ocean.</i>

517
02:10:20,914 --> 02:10:23,683
<i>At Ellis Island,
they put us through a fine sieve...</i>

518
02:10:23,750 --> 02:10:26,452
<i>Disinfections, humiliation...</i>

519
02:10:26,653 --> 02:10:30,690
<i>Slowly, tortuously,
everything was done in darkness.</i>

520
02:10:31,658 --> 02:10:34,694
<i>I woke up in a dirty room
that smelled of vomit.</i>

521
02:10:35,495 --> 02:10:40,867
<i>Markos was snoring next to me.
This is America?</i>

522
02:10:41,734 --> 02:10:44,370
<i>We began playing in some dive,</i>

523
02:10:44,437 --> 02:10:47,874
<i>but dissension soon set in
among the band.</i>

524
02:10:48,575 --> 02:10:51,945
<i>There is no progress on the papers
for you and the kids.</i>

525
02:10:52,178 --> 02:10:54,614
<i>My aunt won't even hear of it.</i>

526
02:10:55,682 --> 02:10:58,885
<i>I found an old Italian teacher
to give me piano lessons...</i>

527
02:10:59,018 --> 02:11:02,255
<i>to forget the ocean
that separates</i> us...

528
02:11:02,789 --> 02:11:05,058
Eleni!

529
02:11:27,113 --> 02:11:28,581
Who is it?

530
02:11:34,621 --> 02:11:36,656
Who's there?

531
02:11:53,206 --> 02:11:55,108
Who's there?

532
02:12:21,167 --> 02:12:22,802
My children!

533
02:12:29,709 --> 02:12:31,511
My children!

534
02:14:49,082 --> 02:14:54,053
Our soldiers march on
with a smile on their lips!

535
02:15:02,328 --> 02:15:06,799
You idiot, Mussolini,
you'll have no one left...

536
02:15:20,279 --> 02:15:25,318
When we march into Rome itself
we'll raise the Greek flag!

537
02:16:26,946 --> 02:16:31,184
<i>Astoria, New York.
30 October 1940.</i>

538
02:16:31,951 --> 02:16:34,921
<i>We heard the news here.
I cried.</i>

539
02:16:35,688 --> 02:16:38,758
<i>I had hoped the war
wouldn't spread to our land.</i>

540
02:16:39,825 --> 02:16:41,994
<i>Will our country hold out?</i>

541
02:16:42,295 --> 02:16:46,365
<i>The Nazi war machine
follows Mussolini with iron steps.</i>

542
02:16:48,868 --> 02:16:52,004
<i>I decided to enlist
in the American army.</i>

543
02:16:52,538 --> 02:16:55,975
<i>It's the only way I can become
a citizen and bring you here.</i>

544
02:16:57,610 --> 02:17:00,413
<i>But when? When?</i>

545
02:17:01,781 --> 02:17:05,284
<i>America still hasn't entered the war,
but it won't be long.</i>

546
02:17:06,185 --> 02:17:09,288
<i>I'm afraid of the dark days to come.</i>

547
02:17:09,388 --> 02:17:12,091
<i>Write to me.
Write to me.</i>

548
02:17:12,892 --> 02:17:15,094
<i>I am sickened at the thought...</i>

549
02:17:15,194 --> 02:17:18,464
<i>that this might be
the last letter to reach you.</i>

550
02:17:37,049 --> 02:17:39,318
Where are you taking me now?

551
02:17:39,518 --> 02:17:41,320
You're getting out.

552
02:17:42,488 --> 02:17:45,358
You've got a son who is
a soldier, right?

553
02:17:46,826 --> 02:17:49,328
I was notified
by the army command...

554
02:17:49,428 --> 02:17:52,365
you're to go by there,
today even, for news of him.

555
02:17:52,431 --> 02:17:54,367
What are you trying to say?

556
02:17:54,500 --> 02:17:56,702
I heard you're from
a border village...

557
02:17:56,769 --> 02:17:59,739
that was lost years ago
in a flood.

558
02:18:00,106 --> 02:18:02,241
What are you trying to say?

559
02:18:02,341 --> 02:18:05,144
There's also a letter
that came for you from America.

560
02:18:05,211 --> 02:18:07,179
It took 4 years to get here.

561
02:18:12,518 --> 02:18:15,688
It was found near the body
of a dead American soldier...

562
02:18:18,457 --> 02:18:21,494
after the last battle
in the Pacific.

563
02:22:01,947 --> 02:22:06,118
Ladies, the sad duty of greeting you
has fallen to me.

564
02:22:07,152 --> 02:22:11,257
Your husbands, brothers, sons,
lie behind you...

565
02:22:11,323 --> 02:22:13,626
on the field of honour.

566
02:22:14,927 --> 02:22:17,129
My boy!

567
02:22:19,665 --> 02:22:21,800
My Son!

568
02:22:33,879 --> 02:22:35,881
Yannis!

569
02:22:58,571 --> 02:23:00,606
MY Son!

570
02:23:08,747 --> 02:23:10,649
No!

571
02:23:19,525 --> 02:23:23,362
Don't sleep!
Wake up!

572
02:23:26,565 --> 02:23:29,301
Wake up, sweetheart!

573
02:23:37,843 --> 02:23:40,813
Wake up, my Yannis,
for your mother!

574
02:25:21,113 --> 02:25:23,449
I was cleaning
the commander's office...

575
02:25:23,549 --> 02:25:26,185
when the soldiers
brought her in.

576
02:25:26,652 --> 02:25:30,089
I never expected to see her again
after so many years.

577
02:25:30,155 --> 02:25:32,291
You treated her unjustly then.

578
02:25:32,357 --> 02:25:35,427
I know.
It's been weighing on me.

579
02:25:47,039 --> 02:25:49,108
I'll go get some water.

580
02:26:01,587 --> 02:26:03,155
Guard...

581
02:26:04,523 --> 02:26:06,558
I have no water...

582
02:26:09,695 --> 02:26:11,363
I have no soap...

583
02:26:14,900 --> 02:26:18,003
I have no paper
to write to my children...

584
02:26:20,839 --> 02:26:22,841
The uniforms change...

585
02:26:25,410 --> 02:26:27,546
You wear gray, guard...

586
02:26:31,216 --> 02:26:33,418
Guard, you wear black.

587
02:26:37,456 --> 02:26:39,658
My name is Eleni.

588
02:26:40,893 --> 02:26:43,762
I'm here for harbouring
an insurgent.

589
02:26:47,800 --> 02:26:50,002
Where are you taking me now?

590
02:26:52,638 --> 02:26:54,306
Guard...

591
02:26:57,376 --> 02:26:59,178
I have no water...

592
02:27:01,914 --> 02:27:03,649
I have no soap...

593
02:27:06,885 --> 02:27:10,022
I have no paper
to write to my children...

594
02:27:14,159 --> 02:27:16,261
The uniforms change...

595
02:27:18,330 --> 02:27:20,933
The Germans wear green...

596
02:27:21,967 --> 02:27:24,136
Are you German, guard?

597
02:27:27,339 --> 02:27:29,241
My name is Eleni.

598
02:27:31,443 --> 02:27:34,112
I'm here for harbouring
an insurgent.

599
02:27:36,181 --> 02:27:38,417
Where are you taking me now?

600
02:27:43,622 --> 02:27:46,825
I was there too, in December of '44,
in the square...

601
02:27:46,959 --> 02:27:50,162
where people were celebrating
the liberation.

602
02:27:52,264 --> 02:27:54,733
Where are you taking me now?

603
02:27:56,768 --> 02:27:58,937
The uniforms change.

604
02:28:00,939 --> 02:28:03,308
Are you English, guard?

605
02:28:07,179 --> 02:28:09,581
How much does a bullet cost?

606
02:28:12,017 --> 02:28:14,186
How much does blood?

607
02:28:18,523 --> 02:28:22,794
All uniforms are
the same, guard...

608
02:28:27,332 --> 02:28:29,268
Guard...

609
02:28:30,369 --> 02:28:32,604
I have no water...

610
02:28:34,239 --> 02:28:36,441
I have no soap...

611
02:28:40,412 --> 02:28:43,782
I have no paper
to write to my children...

612
02:28:50,589 --> 02:28:52,991
Where are you taking me now?

613
02:28:54,893 --> 02:28:56,995
My name is Eleni.

614
02:28:58,931 --> 02:29:01,833
I'm here for hiding
a wounded guerrilla...

615
02:29:06,705 --> 02:29:08,640
Guard...

616
02:29:11,243 --> 02:29:13,512
I'm in exile...

617
02:29:18,383 --> 02:29:21,653
I'm a refugee and
exiled from everywhere.

618
02:29:25,424 --> 02:29:29,594
A three-year-old girl
crying on the quay...

619
02:29:32,698 --> 02:29:34,766
I have no water...

620
02:29:36,868 --> 02:29:39,004
I have no soap...

621
02:29:42,574 --> 02:29:46,244
I have no paper
to write to my children...

622
02:30:10,669 --> 02:30:14,439
She's fallen asleep.
You go. I'll stay.

623
02:31:58,677 --> 02:32:00,745
Damn civil war.

624
02:32:38,817 --> 02:32:41,620
You had two sons, my girl.

625
02:32:47,058 --> 02:32:48,593
What did you say?

626
02:32:50,428 --> 02:32:52,364
You had two sons.

627
02:32:56,668 --> 02:32:58,069
What are you saying?

628
02:32:58,136 --> 02:32:59,571
Yes, ma'am.

629
02:33:08,079 --> 02:33:09,614
What are you saying?

630
02:33:14,319 --> 02:33:17,822
What are you saying?
What are you saying?

631
02:33:46,151 --> 02:33:49,287
Keep your head down.
This is a forbidden zone.

632
02:34:38,603 --> 02:34:40,639
Keep your head down!

633
02:34:43,375 --> 02:34:45,744
This is where the battle
took place.

634
02:34:45,944 --> 02:34:48,046
The army on this side...

635
02:34:48,713 --> 02:34:52,250
and the guerrillas
on the other side of the embankment.

636
02:35:02,627 --> 02:35:05,030
I'm looking for Yorgis!

637
02:35:53,778 --> 02:35:56,881
I'm looking for
Captain Yorgis!

638
02:36:00,985 --> 02:36:03,054
Who wants me?

639
02:36:05,857 --> 02:36:07,926
Don't you recognise me?

640
02:36:08,460 --> 02:36:11,463
I'm Yannis, your brother.

641
02:36:38,456 --> 02:36:40,358
The war, Yannis.

642
02:36:42,494 --> 02:36:44,629
The war's changed us.

643
02:37:04,916 --> 02:37:09,154
It's Mum, Yorgis.
We've lost our mum.

644
02:37:10,054 --> 02:37:13,124
They found her
huddled up in the cell.

645
02:38:28,800 --> 02:38:30,635
Ah, Yorgis!

646
02:38:31,836 --> 02:38:33,438
Ah, Yannis!

647
02:39:50,081 --> 02:39:53,384
<i>They parted
and the battle continued.</i>

648
02:39:55,019 --> 02:39:58,856
<i>AH the guerrillas that escaped
disappeared across the border.</i>

649
02:40:00,358 --> 02:40:04,329
Your other son, ma'am,
lies over there...

650
02:40:04,662 --> 02:40:07,799
in the ruins of that big house.

651
02:40:09,667 --> 02:40:12,804
Where are you going?
There are patrols!

652
02:41:15,066 --> 02:41:19,103
<i>March 1945,
Kerama islands.</i>

653
02:41:19,570 --> 02:41:24,242
<i>American base in the Pacific,
25 miles west of Okinawa.</i>

654
02:41:25,576 --> 02:41:27,145
<i>My Eleni,</i>

655
02:41:27,412 --> 02:41:31,582
<i>I've had your letter of 1 December 1944
in my pocket since yesterday...</i>

656
02:41:31,983 --> 02:41:34,218
<i>It's a miracle it even got here...</i>

657
02:41:34,285 --> 02:41:37,555
<i>after so many months of
going around the world.</i>

658
02:41:38,189 --> 02:41:40,425
<i>I laugh and cry.</i>

659
02:41:40,625 --> 02:41:43,895
<i>Thank God you are well
and our country is now free.</i>

660
02:41:44,429 --> 02:41:47,999
<i>I celebrated by getting drunk
alone in my tent.</i>

661
02:41:49,534 --> 02:41:53,171
<i>You complain I've forgotten you.
How could that be?</i>

662
02:41:53,504 --> 02:41:55,807
<i>AH these years
not a moment has gone</i> by...

663
02:41:55,873 --> 02:41:58,242
<i>when I haven't thought of you.</i>

664
02:41:58,309 --> 02:42:01,512
We're here
in these strange islands,

665
02:42:01,646 --> 02:42:03,981
<i>in the mud of a yellow river,</i>

666
02:42:04,048 --> 02:42:07,652
<i>rotting with our guns in our hands,
day in and day out...</i>

667
02:42:07,719 --> 02:42:11,522
<i>60,000 commandos,
60,000 men about to die...</i>

668
02:42:12,056 --> 02:42:15,259
<i>waiting to ship out
for the hell named Okinawa.</i>

669
02:42:19,130 --> 02:42:22,233
<i>Last night I dreamed that
we set off together...</i>

670
02:42:22,300 --> 02:42:24,602
<i>to find the source
of the river.</i>

671
02:42:24,702 --> 02:42:27,038
<i>An old man led the way.</i>

672
02:42:27,171 --> 02:42:30,441
<i>As we walked on,
the river became smaller...</i>

673
02:42:30,541 --> 02:42:33,778
<i>and broke up into
a thousand small streams...</i>

674
02:42:33,845 --> 02:42:37,448
<i>Suddenly, high above
under the snow-capped peaks...</i>

675
02:42:37,648 --> 02:42:40,918
<i>the old man showed us
a piece of land with wild grass...</i>

676
02:42:41,018 --> 02:42:43,721
<i>in a shady and damp place.</i>

677
02:42:43,855 --> 02:42:47,024
<i>Every blade of grass held
little drops of dew...</i>

678
02:42:47,158 --> 02:42:50,361
<i>that fell every so often
on the soft earth.</i>

679
02:42:50,595 --> 02:42:55,133
<i>"This meadow," said the old man,
"is the source of the river."</i>

680
02:42:57,268 --> 02:43:00,705
<i>You reached out and touched
the wet grass...</i>

681
02:43:01,239 --> 02:43:05,176
<i>and when you raised your hand
a few drops rolled down...</i>

682
02:43:05,376 --> 02:43:08,479
<i>and fell on the earth
like tears...</i>

683
02:43:13,518 --> 02:43:15,653
My Yorgis!

684
02:43:58,930 --> 02:44:00,898
My Yorgis!

685
02:44:05,970 --> 02:44:07,939
My boy!

686
02:44:11,676 --> 02:44:14,278
My sweet boy!

687
02:44:22,453 --> 02:44:24,722
Get up, my Yorgis!

688
02:44:31,095 --> 02:44:33,464
Get up, my Yorgis!

689
02:44:45,943 --> 02:44:48,946
I don't have anybody any more.

690
02:44:55,720 --> 02:44:58,623
Nobody to think of.

691
02:45:05,162 --> 02:45:08,199
Nobody to wait for at night.

692
02:45:21,712 --> 02:45:23,948
Nobody to love.

693
02:45:30,755 --> 02:45:32,957
You were him...

694
02:45:36,394 --> 02:45:38,496
and you were you.

695
02:45:56,414 --> 02:45:58,582
You were him...

696
02:46:08,259 --> 02:46:10,027
and you were you.
