o-wa-i-ya-re

4
00:00:24,483 --> 00:00:30,447
where, 0/7 where
has the Y—sitter gone?

5
00:00:30,989 --> 00:00:36,787
She went to town to buya dog

6
00:00:38,413 --> 00:00:44,670
she'll be back soon

7
00:00:49,091 --> 00:00:55,138
if you don't sleep,
the mice wi/I scamper over you

8
00:00:56,098 --> 00:01:02,896
if you stay awake,
the n/ghtjars will fly off with you

9
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:31,750
The insect woman

10
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:14,384
Be strong!

11
00:02:22,601 --> 00:02:26,688
- Oh, it hurts!
- Be strong, en. She's coming.

12
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:29,483
She'll be here any minute.

13
00:02:30,901 --> 00:02:32,944
Drink this birthing potion.

14
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:37,157
Chuji, hurry up
and heat some water.

15
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:40,786
- Is the baby coming out?
- Any minute now.

16
00:02:40,911 --> 00:02:44,915
- It's mine, isn't it?
- It's yours, all right.

17
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:52,130
It's my baby.

18
00:02:53,382 --> 00:02:54,758
Mine.

19
00:03:24,663 --> 00:03:28,625
Well, chuji, how's en doing?

20
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:35,882
Winter 1918

21
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:43,390
I'm not asking the name, you idiot.
The date of birth.

22
00:03:43,515 --> 00:03:46,309
- Day before yesterday.
- What's that?

23
00:03:46,435 --> 00:03:48,019
Day before yesterday.

24
00:03:48,145 --> 00:03:50,564
You two were married
on October 3rd,

25
00:03:50,689 --> 00:03:53,400
and the baby's born
two months later?

26
00:03:53,525 --> 00:03:55,068
That's right.

27
00:03:55,193 --> 00:03:56,945
Just like a little piglet!

28
00:03:58,113 --> 00:04:00,824
It's my baby.

29
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:03,410
Sure, on paper.

30
00:04:04,619 --> 00:04:07,539
Who's the real father? Onogawa?

31
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:09,082
Who knows?

32
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:13,462
Even en wouldn't know.
She'll sleep with anyone.

33
00:04:16,715 --> 00:04:18,842
I said after we see
the soldiers off.

34
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:22,429
- I just have to talk to you.
- No, mr onogawa.

35
00:04:22,554 --> 00:04:24,181
It's all right.

36
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:27,601
Not in here.

37
00:04:27,726 --> 00:04:30,979
- What's it matter?
- Someone might come in.

38
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:33,190
Nobody knows we're here.

39
00:05:04,596 --> 00:05:06,598
Where did you go?

40
00:05:24,115 --> 00:05:30,330
May 1924

41
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:34,543
- papa?
- What is it, Tome?

42
00:05:36,294 --> 00:05:38,547
Are you and mama married?

43
00:05:39,798 --> 00:05:41,633
No, we're not.

44
00:05:42,843 --> 00:05:47,055
You sleep with me,
so that means we're married, right?

45
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,641
That's right, we're married.

46
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:58,400
O-wa-i-ya-re

47
00:06:03,864 --> 00:06:11,864
If you don't sleep,
the mice wi/I scamper over you

48
00:06:13,832 --> 00:06:16,376
papa, what are you making?

49
00:06:17,752 --> 00:06:20,297
A doll for the god of the mountain.

50
00:06:20,422 --> 00:06:22,090
I want to put it up!

51
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:25,051
- You can't.
- Why not?

52
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:30,140
The god of the mountain
is a woman.

53
00:06:30,265 --> 00:06:33,852
Look over there.

54
00:06:40,609 --> 00:06:48,074
Spring 1942

55
00:06:53,288 --> 00:06:55,332
Hey, Tome!

56
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:59,294
Your dad's very ill.

57
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:01,755
Your father's dying.

58
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,882
You'd better get home quick.

59
00:07:08,219 --> 00:07:09,721
How's papa?

60
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:12,098
He's dead.

61
00:07:12,223 --> 00:07:13,934
Really?

62
00:07:14,059 --> 00:07:15,685
Just kidding you.

63
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:20,357
We called you back
to help on mr Honda's farm.

64
00:07:20,482 --> 00:07:23,318
They're coming for you tonight,
so get ready.

65
00:07:24,361 --> 00:07:28,782
What are you talking about?
I'm serving our country.

66
00:07:28,907 --> 00:07:31,117
Mr Honda owns our land.

67
00:07:31,242 --> 00:07:36,539
Serving him is the same
as serving your country.

68
00:07:36,665 --> 00:07:40,251
And you know
we still owe him money.

69
00:07:40,377 --> 00:07:42,128
Rui.

70
00:07:42,253 --> 00:07:47,550
I can't go to the hondas'
while isamu's off fighting.

71
00:07:47,676 --> 00:07:50,595
He could be killed any day.
You can't wait.

72
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,555
You're already 20.

73
00:07:52,681 --> 00:07:57,394
Rui married into this family
to help her own.

74
00:07:57,519 --> 00:08:02,190
Having an unmarried sister-in-law
isn't fair to her.

75
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:08,405
Where's papa?

76
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:11,491
He won't be back from work
until tomorrow night.

77
00:08:15,704 --> 00:08:20,166
I have to talk to him.

78
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:23,503
He'll go crazy again
when he gets back.

79
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:27,507
Look at these scars
from the last beating he gave me.

80
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:34,097
We're not selling her as a geisha,
so it won't be as bad this time.

81
00:08:34,222 --> 00:08:38,101
Anything about Tome
sends that idiot crazy.

82
00:08:38,226 --> 00:08:40,020
No telling what he might do.

83
00:08:40,145 --> 00:08:43,565
But if we don't say something,

84
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:46,234
that fool will sleep with Tome forever.

85
00:08:48,695 --> 00:08:51,823
I don't really like shunzo.

86
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:56,202
I'll talk to papa.

87
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:59,998
Papa, always papa!
You're not a little girl anymore.

88
00:09:00,123 --> 00:09:04,335
Are you going to sleep with him forever
and never get married?

89
00:09:04,461 --> 00:09:07,505
Tome, you're just going there
to help out.

90
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:10,717
You don't have
to sleep with shunzo.

91
00:09:10,842 --> 00:09:12,927
Honda just wants help.

92
00:09:15,346 --> 00:09:19,142
It's a great day.
Singapore has fallen.

93
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:21,561
And Tome will fall tonight!

94
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:24,606
Here, have some.

95
00:09:24,731 --> 00:09:26,149
Thanks.

96
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:33,656
Tome, shunzo's ready and willing.

97
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:36,951
That's right. Time to go, Tome.

98
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:40,163
My feet hurt.

99
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:42,415
Never mind her, just take her.

100
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:47,462
Come on, there's no need to be shy.

101
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:49,464
Tome, let's go.

102
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:52,509
My feet hurt.

103
00:10:02,393 --> 00:10:03,812
Papa!

104
00:10:04,646 --> 00:10:08,983
You're backjust in time.

105
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:12,278
Tome's going to help out
at the hondas'.

106
00:10:12,403 --> 00:10:14,614
Congratulations, old man.

107
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:18,743
Tome's a lucky one,
marrying the landlord.

108
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:22,914
It's shunzo who's lucky,
getting such a beauty.

109
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:26,584
Watch out! Run!

110
00:10:27,418 --> 00:10:29,504
Old man, don't!

111
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:31,422
Papa!

112
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:48,481
Father, stop! Stop!

113
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:00,577
Stop it!

114
00:11:02,954 --> 00:11:07,458
Chuji, you can beat en
all you want,

115
00:11:07,584 --> 00:11:10,336
but you can't fight
the will of the gods.

116
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:12,213
Papa!

117
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:14,424
Stop it!

118
00:11:14,549 --> 00:11:17,385
Isaid I would go!

119
00:11:19,971 --> 00:11:22,599
It's the only choice.
I'll do it for the family.

120
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:25,852
Tonight?

121
00:11:25,977 --> 00:11:29,063
No, I'll make them wait
until tomorrow.

122
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:32,400
All right, kura?

123
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:39,032
Chujl; No matter
what you do, it's fate.

124
00:11:39,157 --> 00:11:44,370
The god of marriage has tied the knot.
You can't fight the will of the gods.

125
00:11:45,997 --> 00:11:47,999
Where does it hurt?

126
00:11:49,167 --> 00:11:50,710
Here.

127
00:11:56,299 --> 00:11:59,219
It looks bad. It's full of pus.

128
00:12:00,762 --> 00:12:02,555
That hurts!

129
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:20,990
What's wrong?

130
00:12:21,115 --> 00:12:22,700
Rui's watching.

131
00:12:28,206 --> 00:12:32,418
If you sleep with shunzo...

132
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:34,545
I won't.

133
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:38,758
Mr Honda says I just need
to help with the work.

134
00:12:55,066 --> 00:12:56,776
It's freezing.

135
00:12:58,945 --> 00:13:01,656
My brotherjust sits
by the fire and drinks.

136
00:13:07,245 --> 00:13:08,830
Damn it.

137
00:13:12,417 --> 00:13:14,502
It'll be hard on you,

138
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:17,839
being the wife
of a poor landowner's third son.

139
00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:28,182
- Tome...
- No, don't!

140
00:13:28,308 --> 00:13:30,143
Why not? You refused last night too!

141
00:13:30,268 --> 00:13:32,979
- Didn't kura tell you?
- What?

142
00:13:33,104 --> 00:13:35,732
I'm just helping out,

143
00:13:35,857 --> 00:13:37,817
and you aren't to touch me.

144
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:41,112
- That's ridiculous.
- Stop it!

145
00:13:44,282 --> 00:13:46,034
What's the big deal?

146
00:13:50,413 --> 00:13:53,750
I'll be drafted soon
to die for our country.

147
00:13:56,294 --> 00:13:58,129
Do your part.

148
00:14:15,355 --> 00:14:17,023
Papa!

149
00:14:18,483 --> 00:14:20,068
Papa!

150
00:14:25,448 --> 00:14:32,872
How many months is it
since / left my home/and?

151
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:41,339
Hey, you little troublemaker!

152
00:14:44,509 --> 00:14:48,054
I'll give you some sweets later.
Now go and play at your mother's.

153
00:14:48,179 --> 00:14:49,597
You're it!

154
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:52,100
What? I'll get you!

155
00:14:55,353 --> 00:14:57,605
I'm going to catch you!

156
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:14,705
Demon! Demon!

157
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:32,723
I don't like it there.

158
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:36,561
Why not?

159
00:15:41,524 --> 00:15:44,944
- Shunzo has a mistress.
- You mean Kane?

160
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:48,656
They even have a kid.

161
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:50,450
You fool!

162
00:15:50,575 --> 00:15:53,619
If you work hard,
you can become his lawful wife.

163
00:15:53,744 --> 00:15:57,331
When his father dies,
shunzo will get this mill.

164
00:15:57,457 --> 00:16:01,752
Then you'll be in charge.
Kane'sjust a maid.

165
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:07,550
Don't get distracted by things like that.

166
00:16:07,675 --> 00:16:09,677
It's all for the family.

167
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:11,762
You understand, Tome?

168
00:16:20,938 --> 00:16:22,940
Tome's dying.

169
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:27,612
Idiot! Women don't die every time
they have a baby. Now clear out.

170
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:31,866
Get out of here, you fool!
Boil some water.

171
00:16:34,619 --> 00:16:38,498
The son of a bitch is always
ruining our plans.

172
00:16:39,582 --> 00:16:44,045
Fancy beating up shunzo
just for sleeping with Tome.

173
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:47,632
Is he badly hurt?

174
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:51,177
Chuji beat him
with all his brute strength,

175
00:16:51,302 --> 00:16:53,137
so he's in a bad way.

176
00:16:54,305 --> 00:16:58,684
Kura, couldn't we just apologise

177
00:16:58,809 --> 00:17:01,938
and get the hondas
to take her back?

178
00:17:02,063 --> 00:17:06,734
They'd have sent her home
in any case for getting pregnant.

179
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:11,030
After that incident,
they'll never take her back.

180
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:13,282
I know, but...

181
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:17,453
Your mother and you both
had bastard children.

182
00:17:18,663 --> 00:17:21,832
Don't go acting as if Tome's
the only bad one.

183
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:25,044
What a racket!

184
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:28,673
Will you stop that?

185
00:17:47,692 --> 00:17:51,362
It's a girl.
Let it live or get rid of it?

186
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:55,825
Let's get rid of it.

187
00:17:55,950 --> 00:18:00,413
We can't feed any more mouths.
Get rid of it.

188
00:18:00,538 --> 00:18:03,833
Let it live. It's my child.

189
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:06,544
Don't be so selfish, you fool!

190
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:10,756
Let it live.

191
00:18:10,881 --> 00:18:12,967
It's my baby.

192
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:14,594
Let it live.

193
00:18:18,389 --> 00:18:22,393
New year's day 1943

194
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:30,568
Nobuko.

195
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:34,030
She won't feed.

196
00:18:36,699 --> 00:18:38,200
Pa?

197
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:41,329
I need your help again.

198
00:18:42,913 --> 00:18:47,376
Nobuko won't suck enough.
They hurt from too much milk.

199
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:02,433
Pa, I'm going to find work again.

200
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:07,063
Things can't go on like this forever.

201
00:19:07,772 --> 00:19:10,399
I have to pay the hondas back.

202
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:13,986
It's 10 yen. I'll save it up.

203
00:19:15,363 --> 00:19:17,198
That's all right.

204
00:19:17,323 --> 00:19:20,701
It's wartime.
I can work for the country.

205
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:22,328
Don't worry.

206
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:25,373
I'll save up the 10 yen.

207
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:40,513
August 1945

208
00:19:40,638 --> 00:19:42,306
air raid!

209
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:44,350
Air raid! Air raid!

210
00:19:44,975 --> 00:19:46,644
Hurry!

211
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:48,813
Hurry up!

212
00:19:50,356 --> 00:19:52,066
Hurry!

213
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:56,028
Tome, we've got to take cover!

214
00:20:05,246 --> 00:20:06,997
How are you?

215
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:14,922
His majesty's about
to address the nation.

216
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:17,049
Shall we go to the dining hall?

217
00:20:19,677 --> 00:20:22,054
You're in bad shape, huh?

218
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:24,974
Did you send all your ration biscuits
to your kid?

219
00:20:25,099 --> 00:20:27,643
No wonder you're weak. Here.

220
00:20:31,397 --> 00:20:33,232
Thank you.

221
00:20:36,694 --> 00:20:38,529
You've got a fever.

222
00:20:40,698 --> 00:20:42,199
Come on.

223
00:20:45,035 --> 00:20:47,079
His majesty the emperor

224
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:51,292
will now address the nation.

225
00:20:51,417 --> 00:20:54,086
Listen with due reverence.

226
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:02,052
Yesterday...

227
00:21:03,888 --> 00:21:06,265
A soldier told me...

228
00:21:08,726 --> 00:21:11,729
That Japan has lost the war.

229
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:17,860
It's a lie.

230
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:24,408
It can't be true.

231
00:21:31,457 --> 00:21:35,085
Daikoku, god of wealth,

232
00:21:35,211 --> 00:21:38,339
I'm listening
and I ask you with respect

233
00:21:38,464 --> 00:21:43,677
to hear my prayers
and bring me glad news.

234
00:21:55,606 --> 00:21:58,317
- Go away!
- No, you!

235
00:21:58,442 --> 00:22:01,111
Stop making so much noise!

236
00:22:01,237 --> 00:22:04,865
"Daikoku, god of wealth,
I'm listening..."

237
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:08,035
Masashige, go to your mother.

238
00:22:12,414 --> 00:22:13,582
You brat!

239
00:22:14,792 --> 00:22:17,294
Nobuko, come and warm your feet.

240
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:19,672
What's Tome doing?

241
00:22:19,797 --> 00:22:22,383
Writing in her diary.

242
00:22:22,508 --> 00:22:25,135
How's goichi's grandmother doing?

243
00:22:26,136 --> 00:22:29,056
I just visited her.
She's sick in bed.

244
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:33,018
She's depressed.
Her only son died in battle.

245
00:22:33,143 --> 00:22:38,315
Still, that's no reason to start
screaming in the village office.

246
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:42,945
One bundle of firewood.
That's one sen.

247
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:44,530
Thanks.

248
00:22:44,655 --> 00:22:47,449
Make one more.
Then you'll have two sen.

249
00:22:47,575 --> 00:22:50,035
- Is chuji saving money?
- Aye.

250
00:22:50,995 --> 00:22:55,082
He says he'll repay the hondas
and keep Tome here.

251
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:57,835
Fools have foolish ideas.

252
00:23:00,754 --> 00:23:02,715
A bear! I caught a bear!

253
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:05,050
Go away, masashige!

254
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:09,555
- Leave me alone!
- Go away!

255
00:23:13,851 --> 00:23:15,561
Go away!

256
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:19,523
You go away!

257
00:23:28,866 --> 00:23:30,326
Grandpa?

258
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:33,913
We're married, aren't we?

259
00:23:34,997 --> 00:23:36,457
Right.

260
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:39,460
"Married"!

261
00:23:44,298 --> 00:23:46,926
Tome, I need to clean in here.

262
00:23:55,893 --> 00:24:01,065
I worked for my country
and family

263
00:24:02,733 --> 00:24:08,948
but now / keep my diary alone

264
00:24:13,911 --> 00:24:15,371
rui!

265
00:24:21,085 --> 00:24:23,504
- Put this away.
- All right.

266
00:24:23,629 --> 00:24:26,924
Wives are so reliable these days.

267
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:30,636
You can let them
do all the work.

268
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:34,431
Sawakichi, did you check
at the hondas' place?

269
00:24:34,556 --> 00:24:37,309
Yes, it seems it's true.

270
00:24:37,434 --> 00:24:40,396
All the landowners
are kicking up a right fuss.

271
00:24:40,521 --> 00:24:44,608
The Americans have ordered
"agrarian reform" or some such thing.

272
00:24:44,733 --> 00:24:47,820
Thank you. I'll be back again.

273
00:24:47,945 --> 00:24:49,446
Thank you.

274
00:24:49,571 --> 00:24:54,535
So tenant farmers like us
will become independent?

275
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:57,121
Whose name
will the farm be under?

276
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:00,499
No-one knows yet.

277
00:25:07,006 --> 00:25:08,549
Excuse me.

278
00:25:13,095 --> 00:25:17,808
Is Tome here? I'm matsunami,
chief clerk at the mill.

279
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:26,692
- Nobuko.
- What, mummy?

280
00:25:26,817 --> 00:25:30,029
Here you go, some fish.

281
00:25:30,154 --> 00:25:32,489
No, I'll have grandpa's.

282
00:25:33,657 --> 00:25:36,201
What will you do, Tome?

283
00:25:36,326 --> 00:25:39,663
The clerk came for you.
You'd better go.

284
00:25:41,749 --> 00:25:44,251
That clerk's a good-looking fellow.

285
00:25:45,753 --> 00:25:48,922
Don't say such things.
You talkjust to talk.

286
00:25:49,048 --> 00:25:53,010
Tome, kasukawa ume
told me all about it.

287
00:25:53,135 --> 00:25:54,678
Told you what?

288
00:25:54,803 --> 00:25:58,724
When the war ended,
you didn't come home for a week.

289
00:25:58,849 --> 00:26:01,685
You stayed on at the mill,
just you and the clerk.

290
00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:05,939
I was sick. What else could I do?

291
00:26:06,065 --> 00:26:09,359
The clerk had to settle
all the mill's assets.

292
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:13,113
You weren't feeding nobuko enough,

293
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:16,658
so I sent my rations home
and ended up sick.

294
00:26:16,784 --> 00:26:18,660
That's rubbish!

295
00:26:18,786 --> 00:26:22,623
Idiot! You should be ashamed,
talking like that.

296
00:26:24,958 --> 00:26:29,505
And what about you two,
moaning all night long?

297
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:33,300
Tome, they're a young married couple.
What do you expect?

298
00:26:34,218 --> 00:26:37,471
Besides, you never even
sent us money from the mill.

299
00:26:38,889 --> 00:26:41,517
So it was money you wanted, ma?

300
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:44,895
All right, then.

301
00:26:45,646 --> 00:26:48,607
I'll go back to the mill.

302
00:26:48,732 --> 00:26:51,151
Tome, don't go.

303
00:26:51,276 --> 00:26:54,238
I'm just a burden to you here.

304
00:26:55,697 --> 00:26:59,743
- I'll go back to the mill.
- You're not a burden. Don't go.

305
00:27:01,787 --> 00:27:04,123
What's so funny, you stupid cow?

306
00:27:04,248 --> 00:27:07,376
You're so high and mighty
with your 10-yen dowry!

307
00:27:07,501 --> 00:27:09,419
Stop it, stop it.

308
00:27:27,813 --> 00:27:30,440
Tome, don't go.

309
00:27:32,151 --> 00:27:35,070
I'm saving up the 10 yen.

310
00:27:36,613 --> 00:27:41,368
Pa, 10 yen won't even buy
a kimono now.

311
00:27:48,959 --> 00:27:53,422
I get harassed by men
all the time on the train to work.

312
00:27:53,547 --> 00:27:56,800
The other day, a man grabbed
my hand at the movies.

313
00:27:56,925 --> 00:27:58,927
A hand? That's nothing!

314
00:27:59,052 --> 00:28:02,514
Before I knew it,
I was getting felt up all over!

315
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:14,651
"It's clear they control
and oppress us. Therefore..."

316
00:28:14,776 --> 00:28:18,030
- Turn the switch back on.
- It's fine, carry on.

317
00:28:18,155 --> 00:28:21,408
- Hurry or there'll be trouble.
- They won't listen otherwise.

318
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:26,830
"Therefore we must mount
a unanimous and vigorous opposition..."

319
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:33,712
Please listen carefully,
all of you,

320
00:28:33,837 --> 00:28:39,509
to what mr matsunami
from the committee has to say...

321
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:50,979
I wouldn't mind,
but I'm afraid of getting pregnant.

322
00:28:51,104 --> 00:28:54,858
- Then fix it so you don't.
- I'll show you how later.

323
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:01,865
Why didn't you come over
last night?

324
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:06,954
Doing it out here,
you can't fool me.

325
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:10,832
You only think of yourself.

326
00:29:15,545 --> 00:29:17,547
Let's break up, then, Tome.

327
00:29:18,548 --> 00:29:21,218
- So you like ishizuka more?
- Don't be stupid.

328
00:29:21,343 --> 00:29:23,637
I know all about it.
Everybody's talking.

329
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:25,430
It's not that.

330
00:29:25,555 --> 00:29:28,684
- I can't keep up with you anymore.
- What?

331
00:29:28,809 --> 00:29:32,062
You're too intense.
I don't mind the union, but...

332
00:29:32,187 --> 00:29:35,107
Who told me
to work for the union?

333
00:29:35,232 --> 00:29:37,234
I did it all for you.

334
00:29:41,238 --> 00:29:45,284
Tome, don't take this
the wrong way,

335
00:29:45,409 --> 00:29:48,161
but I got promoted
to assistant manager.

336
00:29:51,373 --> 00:29:52,874
I see.

337
00:29:53,709 --> 00:29:56,670
You tell me now,
after we've had sex.

338
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:00,632
I like you, Tome.

339
00:30:03,719 --> 00:30:09,099
That's why I'm trying to get
the company to go easy on you.

340
00:30:09,224 --> 00:30:12,894
- Go easy on me?
- They want to fire you.

341
00:30:17,733 --> 00:30:19,735
I have to get back.

342
00:30:21,695 --> 00:30:23,238
See you.

343
00:30:50,223 --> 00:30:52,517
My man is gone

344
00:30:54,019 --> 00:30:59,858
I'm all alone,
gazing at the river

345
00:31:01,026 --> 00:31:06,865
summer 1949

346
00:31:08,325 --> 00:31:13,205
pa, we fought hard for this 5,000
in severance pay.

347
00:31:13,330 --> 00:31:17,000
I'll give you 2,000.
Give half to ma, okay?

348
00:31:18,251 --> 00:31:20,212
Tome, don't go.

349
00:31:20,337 --> 00:31:22,172
I saved up the 10 yen.

350
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:25,258
I saved up the 10 yen.

351
00:31:25,384 --> 00:31:27,469
Thank you.

352
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:33,809
But you can't use these coins now,
so you just hold on to them.

353
00:31:35,811 --> 00:31:37,604
Why are you leaving?

354
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,570
When I save up some money,

355
00:31:46,822 --> 00:31:49,950
you and nobuko and I
will live together.

356
00:31:50,075 --> 00:31:53,036
Just wait until then. Okay?

357
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:57,165
Don't go, Tome.

358
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:00,919
Don't go!

359
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,514
Where are we?

360
00:32:12,639 --> 00:32:15,434
Between the matsukawa
and kanayagawa stations.

361
00:32:15,559 --> 00:32:17,436
What are we supposed to do now?

362
00:32:17,561 --> 00:32:21,940
You can go back
the way you came, or...

363
00:32:22,065 --> 00:32:24,943
I can't go home!

364
00:32:26,653 --> 00:32:33,869
September 1950

365
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:36,663
I love you, midori.

366
00:33:02,856 --> 00:33:04,649
- I can't stand it!
- What?

367
00:33:04,774 --> 00:33:07,110
That maid's always eavesdropping.

368
00:33:07,235 --> 00:33:08,737
I hate it!

369
00:33:08,862 --> 00:33:11,239
Poor thing.

370
00:33:11,364 --> 00:33:16,369
I feel sorry for all jap girls.

371
00:33:16,495 --> 00:33:18,121
Well, don't.

372
00:33:18,246 --> 00:33:20,499
Just feel sorry for me.

373
00:33:20,624 --> 00:33:22,459
Hold me.

374
00:33:22,584 --> 00:33:25,086
I feel most sorry for you.

375
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:30,050
Tome.

376
00:33:30,175 --> 00:33:32,677
George is away,
so let's cook country style.

377
00:33:32,802 --> 00:33:37,182
- How about stewed vegetables?
- Great. Make it spicy.

378
00:33:37,307 --> 00:33:39,559
How about dried bonito
in the stock?

379
00:33:39,684 --> 00:33:42,187
Dried sardines are cheaper.

380
00:33:42,312 --> 00:33:44,898
I guess you're right.

381
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:48,276
But you don't really need a stock,

382
00:33:48,401 --> 00:33:50,820
if you're boiling bracken
and bamboo shoots.

383
00:33:50,946 --> 00:33:54,032
Our backyard was full of bamboo.

384
00:33:54,157 --> 00:33:58,620
My father would cut some,
and I'd boil it with some miso.

385
00:33:58,745 --> 00:34:01,206
It was so good!

386
00:34:01,331 --> 00:34:04,125
We always used fish
instead of dried sardines

387
00:34:04,251 --> 00:34:06,795
since we lived near a fishery.

388
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:10,006
George's family are fishermen too.

389
00:34:10,131 --> 00:34:13,635
Do they dry sardines in america too?

390
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:16,846
I don't think so.

391
00:34:16,972 --> 00:34:18,598
Cathy!

392
00:34:18,723 --> 00:34:23,270
Cathy, go and play inside.
I'll play with you later.

393
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:29,317
Tome, what do you think of George?

394
00:34:31,695 --> 00:34:34,531
I don't know anything
about Americans.

395
00:34:34,656 --> 00:34:37,826
- But he's nice, right?
- Yes, he is.

396
00:34:37,951 --> 00:34:40,787
But he's so huge.

397
00:34:44,374 --> 00:34:47,085
Big body, big heart.

398
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:49,879
Big Japanese men are kinder too.

399
00:34:50,005 --> 00:34:51,631
I guess you're right.

400
00:34:51,756 --> 00:34:53,967
Remember when he went to Korea?

401
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:58,013
He was promoted to sergeant
for distinguished service.

402
00:34:58,138 --> 00:35:01,600
He was the youngest sergeant,
just 23.

403
00:35:01,725 --> 00:35:04,019
Really? That's great.

404
00:35:04,144 --> 00:35:07,689
Yeah, but it means
he'll have to go back to Korea.

405
00:35:07,814 --> 00:35:09,107
Really?

406
00:35:09,232 --> 00:35:12,402
A lot of men are dying there.

407
00:35:12,527 --> 00:35:14,529
You must be worried.

408
00:35:15,363 --> 00:35:20,368
It'd be awful if he died
and left me with this kid.

409
00:35:37,052 --> 00:35:40,972
What are you doing, Tome?

410
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:48,521
I was crying because I'm lonely.

411
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:52,567
Cathy...

412
00:35:53,735 --> 00:35:55,153
What?

413
00:35:57,072 --> 00:36:00,075
You must be lonely
with your mum always gone.

414
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:01,785
Yes, I am.

415
00:36:03,203 --> 00:36:05,497
Poor little Cathy.

416
00:36:05,622 --> 00:36:08,208
Poor little Cathy.

417
00:36:12,879 --> 00:36:15,215
What will you do if your daddy dies?

418
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:16,841
I don't care.

419
00:36:19,302 --> 00:36:22,806
O-wa-i-ya-re

420
00:36:24,224 --> 00:36:28,853
o-wa-i-ya-re

421
00:36:28,978 --> 00:36:33,441
if you don't sleep

422
00:36:33,566 --> 00:36:37,487
the mice will scamper over you

423
00:36:38,488 --> 00:36:42,867
if you stay a wake

424
00:36:42,992 --> 00:36:46,705
the n/ghtjars will fly off with you

425
00:38:03,156 --> 00:38:04,699
Next person.

426
00:38:09,078 --> 00:38:11,289
You there,
come sit in the middle.

427
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,011
Go ahead.

428
00:38:25,136 --> 00:38:29,933
Confess all your sins
and share all your troubles.

429
00:38:33,353 --> 00:38:36,773
My marriage failed.

430
00:38:36,898 --> 00:38:38,733
I have one child.

431
00:38:39,692 --> 00:38:43,404
I was working in a silk mill...

432
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:47,158
And me and a man...

433
00:38:47,283 --> 00:38:49,953
Speak more clearly.

434
00:38:51,496 --> 00:38:54,332
I had an affair with a man there.

435
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:57,836
He had...

436
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:02,131
A wife.

437
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:06,052
But he was so nice...

438
00:39:08,304 --> 00:39:10,431
So we had relations.

439
00:39:14,978 --> 00:39:19,107
Talking about my life
makes me cry.

440
00:39:19,232 --> 00:39:21,609
- Then what?
- Then...

441
00:39:24,153 --> 00:39:26,447
The unemployment office...

442
00:39:28,157 --> 00:39:30,994
Found me a job
in a Chinese restaurant.

443
00:39:32,453 --> 00:39:35,832
Then the owner got fresh with me
and I ran away.

444
00:39:37,083 --> 00:39:38,626
After that...

445
00:39:40,003 --> 00:39:43,548
I became a maid,
and one day I eavesdropped...

446
00:39:43,673 --> 00:39:45,216
On whom?

447
00:39:47,343 --> 00:39:51,347
The American's mistress.

448
00:39:52,181 --> 00:39:54,183
Their mixed-blood child...

449
00:39:55,643 --> 00:40:00,189
Was scalded to death
when a pot of stew fell on her.

450
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:04,110
What are you doing
for her departed spirit?

451
00:40:08,865 --> 00:40:12,076
All I'm doing is selling cosmetics.

452
00:40:12,201 --> 00:40:15,246
- Not good enough!
- It's like doing nothing!

453
00:40:15,371 --> 00:40:20,251
- Your sin is lust! It has deep roots!
- She must be shown the path.

454
00:40:20,376 --> 00:40:22,712
It's lust!

455
00:40:22,837 --> 00:40:25,548
Rain that falls on the parent
also falls on the child.

456
00:40:28,384 --> 00:40:32,013
You sinned in a previous life.
The sin of lust!

457
00:40:36,935 --> 00:40:39,812
Pray fervently for the little girl.

458
00:40:39,938 --> 00:40:42,148
Next person!

459
00:40:57,705 --> 00:41:01,793
I'm 28 years old,
and I drive a cab.

460
00:41:01,918 --> 00:41:05,254
Everyone preaches peace,

461
00:41:06,047 --> 00:41:10,635
yet we still harbour
meanness and hatred,

462
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:16,349
because we don't make religion
the foundation of our lives.

463
00:41:17,642 --> 00:41:24,565
December 1951

464
00:41:29,278 --> 00:41:32,407
hey, come here a minute.

465
00:41:32,532 --> 00:41:35,493
- Come here a minute.
- What is it?

466
00:41:38,204 --> 00:41:40,748
- You want some beer?
- No.

467
00:41:40,873 --> 00:41:43,376
Is she really a sales assistant?

468
00:41:45,753 --> 00:41:48,339
Or is she a prostitute?

469
00:41:49,007 --> 00:41:51,592
You mean she isn't your wife?

470
00:41:51,718 --> 00:41:53,928
Don't play dumb.

471
00:41:54,971 --> 00:41:56,973
Call the madam.

472
00:41:57,098 --> 00:41:59,976
You're really good at that!

473
00:42:00,101 --> 00:42:04,397
So what'll it be? Ban the red-light
district and men will suffer.

474
00:42:04,522 --> 00:42:08,484
It's not my doing,
it's all those women in the diet.

475
00:42:11,154 --> 00:42:13,614
I don't run that kind
of business anyway.

476
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:16,993
My clients are management types
or old regulars.

477
00:42:17,118 --> 00:42:18,828
That's true.

478
00:42:18,953 --> 00:42:20,580
Excuse me, ma'am.

479
00:42:20,705 --> 00:42:25,877
The guest in room 8 had a fight
with the salesgirl and said to call you.

480
00:42:26,002 --> 00:42:28,421
What a pain! Play my hand.

481
00:42:28,546 --> 00:42:30,548
Wait a minute.

482
00:42:33,676 --> 00:42:38,264
Put this on and then take
some sake to room 8.

483
00:42:39,766 --> 00:42:41,601
Nice move.

484
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,062
Hurry up.

485
00:42:49,859 --> 00:42:51,694
Does she work here?

486
00:42:52,779 --> 00:42:54,489
She just started.

487
00:42:54,614 --> 00:42:56,908
Madam met her at god's place.

488
00:42:57,033 --> 00:42:58,701
God's place?

489
00:42:58,826 --> 00:43:00,912
The pure land buddhism sect.

490
00:43:01,037 --> 00:43:03,206
Not bad-looking, considering.

491
00:43:04,957 --> 00:43:07,668
There it is!

492
00:43:23,893 --> 00:43:27,772
- Someone's asking for a virgin?
- Yeah, the drunk in room 6.

493
00:43:27,897 --> 00:43:30,942
Okay. Where are the "virgins"?

494
00:43:31,067 --> 00:43:33,736
- In the fridge.
- Oh, yeah?

495
00:43:39,242 --> 00:43:41,536
Wow! It's frozen.

496
00:43:41,661 --> 00:43:43,663
I'd better warm it up.

497
00:43:49,252 --> 00:43:51,921
Watch out or it'll boil.

498
00:43:52,046 --> 00:43:53,673
Boiling virgins!

499
00:43:56,092 --> 00:43:59,512
Just shave the dried bonito, you idiot!

500
00:43:59,637 --> 00:44:03,141
- Oh, no!
- I told you.

501
00:44:04,267 --> 00:44:07,687
- Why not just use red ink?
- He won't fall for that.

502
00:44:07,812 --> 00:44:10,398
It's okay.
I'll use my own blood.

503
00:44:10,523 --> 00:44:13,025
Help me, take. Hanako, tie this.

504
00:44:13,151 --> 00:44:15,153
You sure?
You just had a customer.

505
00:44:15,278 --> 00:44:19,282
For 40% of 30,000 yen, you bet.
Go ahead.

506
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:28,708
Where is it?

507
00:44:30,918 --> 00:44:33,129
O merciful Buddha...

508
00:44:41,304 --> 00:44:44,140
Men are such fools.

509
00:44:45,141 --> 00:44:48,186
What's so great about virgins?

510
00:44:48,311 --> 00:44:51,439
Look! You're turning pale!

511
00:44:51,564 --> 00:44:54,442
Keep going, that's not enough.

512
00:44:54,567 --> 00:44:56,444
Can you handle it?

513
00:44:56,569 --> 00:45:00,948
- What about the cat's blood?
- Good idea.

514
00:45:01,908 --> 00:45:04,785
Come back, you little beast!

515
00:45:08,164 --> 00:45:11,334
- Here's a real virgin.
- Lay it down.

516
00:45:13,169 --> 00:45:14,754
Keep still, you.

517
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:17,173
- Hold it tight.
- Ready!

518
00:45:18,341 --> 00:45:20,176
Here we go...

519
00:45:24,347 --> 00:45:26,641
Absolutely not.

520
00:45:26,766 --> 00:45:29,894
Then why did you get
all dressed up?

521
00:45:30,019 --> 00:45:33,022
Because you told me to change.

522
00:45:34,023 --> 00:45:37,193
Did I tell you to put on make-up?

523
00:45:37,318 --> 00:45:40,696
You can always get out of having sex.

524
00:45:40,821 --> 00:45:43,824
There's no need to scream like that.

525
00:45:44,450 --> 00:45:49,872
But you violated my rights
by locking me in.

526
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:54,752
You took money from him,
didn't you?

527
00:45:54,877 --> 00:45:57,463
I did. Why?

528
00:45:58,464 --> 00:46:00,883
That's prostitution.

529
00:46:02,009 --> 00:46:05,179
You never told me
this was a brothel.

530
00:46:06,055 --> 00:46:07,932
This is outrageous.

531
00:46:12,603 --> 00:46:15,022
Prostitution is evil.

532
00:46:15,856 --> 00:46:19,068
I met you at church.
I thought I'd be safe here.

533
00:46:19,193 --> 00:46:20,820
You idiot!

534
00:46:20,945 --> 00:46:23,531
All this talk about prostitution.

535
00:46:23,656 --> 00:46:25,908
People sell sex
because there are buyers.

536
00:46:26,033 --> 00:46:30,746
We don't take people's money
like at the racetrack or the casino.

537
00:46:30,871 --> 00:46:33,249
Our customers go away happy.

538
00:46:37,253 --> 00:46:40,089
This is supposed
to be a democracy,

539
00:46:40,214 --> 00:46:44,135
but you're turning
hungry women into slaves.

540
00:46:44,260 --> 00:46:47,680
Hungry?
What are you talking about?

541
00:46:47,805 --> 00:46:51,058
I feed you three full meals a day.

542
00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:56,105
And when did I turn you into a slave?

543
00:46:56,230 --> 00:46:58,482
You can leave anytime you want.

544
00:46:58,607 --> 00:47:00,901
This isn't the red-light district.

545
00:47:02,236 --> 00:47:07,408
I'm doing my part
by helping men forget their worries.

546
00:47:07,533 --> 00:47:10,703
Here. If you don't like it,
get out now.

547
00:47:10,828 --> 00:47:12,997
But a woman over 30

548
00:47:13,122 --> 00:47:17,418
won't find the food and shelter
you get here.

549
00:47:18,544 --> 00:47:22,214
Here, you get 12,000 a month
just for working ten jobs.

550
00:47:27,136 --> 00:47:29,430
Don't want it?

551
00:47:29,555 --> 00:47:31,515
Then I'll keep it.

552
00:47:32,892 --> 00:47:34,727
Take it and go.

553
00:47:35,936 --> 00:47:39,148
I'll deduct the cost
of the kimono over six months.

554
00:48:07,134 --> 00:48:09,261
For the sake of m y child

555
00:48:09,387 --> 00:48:12,556
I spur my weak body on to tail

556
00:48:15,559 --> 00:48:20,356
I count my money
through hitter tears

557
00:48:23,317 --> 00:48:25,820
a money order
for 3,000 yen, please.

558
00:48:25,945 --> 00:48:27,780
3,000 yen?

559
00:48:34,703 --> 00:48:42,703
May 1, 1952

560
00:48:46,382 --> 00:48:48,968
- what about mizuno?
- He gave me 8,000.

561
00:48:49,093 --> 00:48:50,553
What?

562
00:48:51,554 --> 00:48:53,889
He'll pay the other 5,000
next month.

563
00:48:54,014 --> 00:48:58,394
Always get the full amount
from public officials.

564
00:48:58,519 --> 00:49:01,397
If they pay in full,
they keep coming back,

565
00:49:01,522 --> 00:49:04,316
otherwise they brush you off
and never return.

566
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:07,445
Let's have some tea with this.

567
00:49:07,570 --> 00:49:09,196
Yes, let's.

568
00:49:09,321 --> 00:49:12,408
- What a mess.
- It's awful.

569
00:49:12,533 --> 00:49:15,703
The radio said the Americans
are at war in Korea.

570
00:49:15,828 --> 00:49:18,456
They're supposed to be
a peaceful country.

571
00:49:20,875 --> 00:49:28,875
September 1955

572
00:50:11,509 --> 00:50:13,636
Oh, it hurts!

573
00:50:14,678 --> 00:50:16,972
Are you okay?

574
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:20,184
It hurts!

575
00:50:20,309 --> 00:50:22,102
It hurts!

576
00:50:22,228 --> 00:50:24,522
Hold her down.

577
00:50:24,647 --> 00:50:26,315
Help me!

578
00:50:27,650 --> 00:50:31,695
This is bad. An ectopic pregnancy.
I have to operate right away.

579
00:50:42,331 --> 00:50:44,416
"Ma, how are you?

580
00:50:44,542 --> 00:50:48,045
"I'm fine.
I'm living in the granary.

581
00:50:48,170 --> 00:50:51,173
"I'm here with grandpa,

582
00:50:51,298 --> 00:50:55,844
"because the family treats us
so badly.

583
00:50:56,929 --> 00:51:01,141
"Please send money directly
to my school from now on,

584
00:51:01,267 --> 00:51:06,313
"because uncle takes
whatever you send to the house.

585
00:51:07,565 --> 00:51:10,150
"In order to save money,

586
00:51:10,276 --> 00:51:13,195
"we 're growing our own food.

587
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:15,864
"But we still need 4,000 yen a month.

588
00:51:16,532 --> 00:51:19,785
"I'm sorry to have to ask you, ma.

589
00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:24,999
"I'm sending you a mountain god
thatgrandpa got from the shrine.

590
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:29,712
"He says to he sure
you put it up."

591
00:51:36,385 --> 00:51:38,554
How are you feeling?

592
00:51:41,181 --> 00:51:44,560
They say I can leave
when the bleeding stops.

593
00:51:46,228 --> 00:51:48,897
I was in the neighbourhood
on a job for take.

594
00:51:49,023 --> 00:51:51,233
I come here often for injections.

595
00:51:51,358 --> 00:51:53,736
You mean our take?

596
00:51:55,154 --> 00:51:59,199
She gets me jobs on the side
sometimes.

597
00:51:59,325 --> 00:52:02,786
She takes 40%,
so it's good for her too.

598
00:52:04,830 --> 00:52:07,249
What if the madam finds out?

599
00:52:07,374 --> 00:52:09,168
She won't.

600
00:52:09,293 --> 00:52:11,920
She just sits back
and rakes in the money,

601
00:52:12,838 --> 00:52:16,508
while we abuse our bodies
and get sick.

602
00:52:28,145 --> 00:52:30,439
Don't bother.
You're fine as you are.

603
00:52:30,564 --> 00:52:33,442
No, I'm hardly presentable like this.

604
00:52:33,567 --> 00:52:35,235
What's this?

605
00:52:35,361 --> 00:52:37,821
A mountain god from my village.

606
00:52:38,614 --> 00:52:41,116
You believe in this nonsense?

607
00:52:41,241 --> 00:52:45,329
No, but it's still a god.
It's the same principle.

608
00:52:45,454 --> 00:52:48,165
You belong to the pure land sect,
don't you?

609
00:52:48,290 --> 00:52:51,293
- Well, yes.
- Then throw it away.

610
00:52:57,341 --> 00:53:00,678
Listen, when you get
out of the hospital,

611
00:53:00,803 --> 00:53:03,639
will you give me a hand
with the business?

612
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:08,852
I've become an official
in the pure land buddhism sect,

613
00:53:08,977 --> 00:53:11,480
so I'll be away a lot,

614
00:53:11,605 --> 00:53:15,442
and you're the only one
I can trust.

615
00:53:19,488 --> 00:53:22,908
After all,
you're a sect member too.

616
00:53:23,033 --> 00:53:24,576
Ma'am...

617
00:53:25,619 --> 00:53:28,163
Have you heard about take?

618
00:53:28,288 --> 00:53:29,998
What about her?

619
00:53:31,291 --> 00:53:33,377
No, it's not important.

620
00:53:33,502 --> 00:53:36,255
What is it? Tell me.

621
00:53:36,380 --> 00:53:40,676
It's just I heard a rumour
that she's got some...

622
00:53:40,801 --> 00:53:43,220
I don't know for sure, but...

623
00:53:43,345 --> 00:53:45,848
Eh? Jobs on the side?

624
00:53:47,141 --> 00:53:50,853
Yes. They say
she's doingjobs on the side.

625
00:53:52,396 --> 00:53:55,315
That's right,
so I couldn't possibly.

626
00:53:58,318 --> 00:54:02,531
Did you pay your hospital bill?
That was them calling.

627
00:54:05,033 --> 00:54:08,912
I meant to ask you later.
You see, I have no money...

628
00:54:09,037 --> 00:54:11,623
I can't pay it. It's the rules.

629
00:54:12,666 --> 00:54:15,210
-But" - don't get carried away.

630
00:54:15,335 --> 00:54:19,590
I made you head maid,
but you can't walk all over me.

631
00:54:19,715 --> 00:54:24,720
I'm feeding you,
and don't you forget it.

632
00:54:31,727 --> 00:54:35,355
Police, go home!
We want you to go home!

633
00:54:35,481 --> 00:54:40,402
You're the ones breaking the la w!

634
00:55:02,549 --> 00:55:05,052
Ma, what shall I make for dinner?

635
00:55:05,177 --> 00:55:06,970
Anything's fine.

636
00:55:10,265 --> 00:55:13,894
How about giblet soup?

637
00:55:16,396 --> 00:55:19,107
Come straight home, won't you?

638
00:55:20,275 --> 00:55:22,611
Don't do anything naughty at work.

639
00:55:34,164 --> 00:55:35,707
Midori!

640
00:55:38,794 --> 00:55:40,170
Midori!

641
00:55:40,963 --> 00:55:42,422
Tome!

642
00:55:49,179 --> 00:55:52,850
He doesn't drink,
smoke or fool around,

643
00:55:52,975 --> 00:55:55,352
but he refuses to get a job.

644
00:55:56,270 --> 00:55:59,857
But at least
he's honest and decent.

645
00:55:59,982 --> 00:56:03,026
Ma, this is to wash your hands.

646
00:56:06,196 --> 00:56:08,031
You should wash too.

647
00:56:08,156 --> 00:56:09,867
Thank you.

648
00:56:16,540 --> 00:56:18,083
I'll wipe you.

649
00:56:18,208 --> 00:56:20,919
Stop, behave yourself.

650
00:56:21,044 --> 00:56:22,963
Go and change the water.

651
00:56:23,088 --> 00:56:26,174
All right.
We'll go and change the water.

652
00:56:27,384 --> 00:56:30,637
He's not Japanese, is he?

653
00:56:30,762 --> 00:56:34,933
That's right. He's Korean.
His family all died in the war.

654
00:56:35,058 --> 00:56:37,102
A respectable family, it seems.

655
00:56:37,227 --> 00:56:39,479
I'm jealous.
You really seem to get along.

656
00:56:39,605 --> 00:56:41,690
He's no direction in life.

657
00:56:49,281 --> 00:56:52,284
These are for Cathy's grave.

658
00:56:52,409 --> 00:56:54,536
- You shouldn't have.
- Not at all.

659
00:56:58,540 --> 00:57:02,753
I'm not sure she'd be happy
if she were alive now.

660
00:57:02,878 --> 00:57:07,591
- Don't say that.
- I mean it. Living like this.

661
00:57:07,716 --> 00:57:11,345
- Are you that badly off?
- Can't you tell?

662
00:57:13,138 --> 00:57:15,724
But you really do love him, don't you?

663
00:57:15,849 --> 00:57:17,768
I guess.

664
00:57:17,893 --> 00:57:20,270
But he loves me more.

665
00:57:23,732 --> 00:57:27,152
He's really...
You know... amazing.

666
00:57:28,904 --> 00:57:31,448
- Better than George?
- Well...

667
00:57:31,573 --> 00:57:33,742
George was just a kid
by comparison.

668
00:57:35,494 --> 00:57:37,537
You're sinful too.

669
00:57:37,663 --> 00:57:39,498
I guess I am.

670
00:57:39,623 --> 00:57:43,126
It's the sin of carnal desire
from a previous life. Really!

671
00:57:43,251 --> 00:57:45,545
Madam'll be angry
if we don't get back.

672
00:57:45,671 --> 00:57:47,339
I know.

673
00:58:04,898 --> 00:58:08,527
Sorry. We don't need it anymore.
Take it back.

674
00:58:14,074 --> 00:58:15,701
Listen, midori...

675
00:58:17,786 --> 00:58:20,497
I have some work for you.

676
00:58:28,005 --> 00:58:29,631
Good afternoon.

677
00:58:33,301 --> 00:58:36,847
- Why did you bring him?
- He insisted.

678
00:58:36,972 --> 00:58:39,016
This is no time to drag him along.

679
00:58:39,141 --> 00:58:41,518
Give the money to him.

680
00:58:41,643 --> 00:58:46,356
How can you be such an idiot?
Here comes the client. Let's walk.

681
00:58:49,234 --> 00:58:53,155
Tome, here's what we agreed to
on the phone.

682
00:58:53,947 --> 00:58:56,116
Thank you very much.

683
00:59:02,205 --> 00:59:05,333
Mr sanada, I'll be going now.

684
00:59:05,459 --> 00:59:07,335
See you soon.

685
00:59:17,345 --> 00:59:19,431
Are they going to an inn?

686
00:59:20,932 --> 00:59:25,353
What's it matter?
You got your money, now go home.

687
00:59:28,982 --> 00:59:30,442
Grandpa!

688
00:59:32,569 --> 00:59:34,696
Ma just sent us a load of money.

689
00:59:34,821 --> 00:59:36,823
It's a lot this time.

690
00:59:39,201 --> 00:59:42,496
I'll buy you some chemical fertiliser,
grandpa.

691
00:59:42,621 --> 00:59:45,999
No need, nobuko.
Just buy things for school.

692
00:59:49,086 --> 00:59:51,880
You bought such expensive stuff.

693
00:59:52,005 --> 00:59:54,841
I told you to buy things for school.

694
00:59:55,842 --> 00:59:57,969
It's okay,
I don't like school anyway.

695
00:59:58,095 --> 01:00:01,014
Grandpa, come and get in.
I'll wash you.

696
01:00:01,973 --> 01:00:03,767
I'm coming.

697
01:00:08,647 --> 01:00:11,525
- You know mr karasawa?
- Yes.

698
01:00:11,650 --> 01:00:14,402
He wants to take care of you.

699
01:00:16,029 --> 01:00:20,450
I did cajole him quite a bit,
but now he's keen on the idea.

700
01:00:20,575 --> 01:00:22,661
He hasn't said anything?

701
01:00:24,121 --> 01:00:26,331
Now that you mention it, yes...

702
01:00:26,456 --> 01:00:29,209
But I thought he was joking.

703
01:00:29,793 --> 01:00:31,920
Leave me to arrange it.

704
01:00:32,045 --> 01:00:35,590
But you have to promise,
no more work on the side.

705
01:00:36,925 --> 01:00:41,471
Mr sanada told me you've been
setting up jobs in shibuya.

706
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:48,436
You're lucky to get
a big wholesaler for a patron.

707
01:00:48,562 --> 01:00:52,232
And all because you work for me.
You do realise that?

708
01:01:03,702 --> 01:01:06,121
I've always wanted
this kind of security.

709
01:01:06,246 --> 01:01:09,332
Security?
You feel secure with me?

710
01:01:09,457 --> 01:01:14,254
- Well, you have money.
- Money doesn't bring security.

711
01:01:14,379 --> 01:01:18,008
If a sumo champion loses
three tournaments, his ranking drops.

712
01:01:18,133 --> 01:01:21,636
And if a sumo grand champion loses,
he has to retire.

713
01:01:22,137 --> 01:01:24,139
This is like a dream.

714
01:01:25,724 --> 01:01:28,435
- Can I call you "daddy"?
- Why?

715
01:01:28,560 --> 01:01:33,440
I don't have a real father.
I like the sound of it.

716
01:01:33,565 --> 01:01:36,610
"Daddy" — it has a nice ring to it!

717
01:01:40,739 --> 01:01:43,909
I'd like to live with nobuko soon.

718
01:01:52,375 --> 01:01:54,211
I see you like it.

719
01:01:54,336 --> 01:01:56,922
I do. More, more!

720
01:02:07,515 --> 01:02:09,142
I'm getting cooked!

721
01:02:15,690 --> 01:02:18,860
The police society fellas came in.

722
01:02:18,985 --> 01:02:21,488
I'm skint this month,
we've just had a baby.

723
01:02:21,613 --> 01:02:23,615
Come on, you're a rising star.

724
01:02:23,740 --> 01:02:26,326
You guys never let up
on the pressure!

725
01:02:56,189 --> 01:02:58,275
You're a stubborn one.

726
01:02:58,400 --> 01:03:02,487
Who are you trying to protect?
Your madam suma?

727
01:03:02,612 --> 01:03:05,740
She already told us everything.

728
01:03:05,865 --> 01:03:09,995
We just need you to corroborate it.

729
01:03:11,579 --> 01:03:14,833
Surely you get more than just tips.

730
01:03:14,958 --> 01:03:18,420
Prostitution is common at inns
these days.

731
01:03:20,046 --> 01:03:22,590
Her place is rife with it, isn't it?

732
01:03:22,716 --> 01:03:24,884
/sn't it, Tome?

733
01:03:29,848 --> 01:03:32,475
I'll tell you everything, officer,

734
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:34,978
but keep your voice down.

735
01:03:35,103 --> 01:03:37,314
No-one can hear us.

736
01:03:38,523 --> 01:03:40,984
Yes, it's rife with it.

737
01:03:41,109 --> 01:03:45,071
And the terms are awful,
the girls only get 40%.

738
01:03:45,196 --> 01:03:48,658
Meanwhile, she charges 10 yen
for vegetables and miso soup.

739
01:03:48,783 --> 01:03:52,454
And she wouldn't give me a penny
when I got sick.

740
01:03:54,456 --> 01:03:57,083
Seems madam got two months.

741
01:03:58,126 --> 01:04:00,545
And not just a fine.

742
01:04:00,670 --> 01:04:03,173
It wasn't you who talked, was it?

743
01:04:03,298 --> 01:04:07,927
What are you saying?
The police already knew everything.

744
01:04:12,891 --> 01:04:16,311
No, we don't do
that sort of thing here.

745
01:04:17,854 --> 01:04:21,441
I don't know.
The madam's not here.

746
01:04:23,234 --> 01:04:24,903
What a bother!

747
01:04:29,240 --> 01:04:31,618
What a waste, turning them down.

748
01:04:31,743 --> 01:04:35,372
We have no choice.
You never know who's listening in.

749
01:04:35,497 --> 01:04:38,792
I'm in a bind.
I'm having a coat made.

750
01:04:40,168 --> 01:04:42,712
Weren't you going
back to the country?

751
01:04:42,837 --> 01:04:45,507
I can't leave at a time like this.

752
01:04:46,341 --> 01:04:49,135
Though I did tell them
I was coming home.

753
01:04:51,388 --> 01:04:53,056
Excuse me!

754
01:04:54,182 --> 01:04:57,352
- Excuse me!
- Quiet!

755
01:04:59,896 --> 01:05:01,523
It's a couple.

756
01:05:02,357 --> 01:05:04,859
Masako, you go.

757
01:05:07,278 --> 01:05:09,823
Masako, go on!

758
01:05:15,954 --> 01:05:18,206
- Go around!
- I couldn't.

759
01:05:21,835 --> 01:05:23,795
Will you be staying the night?

760
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:26,381
- No.
- This way, please.

761
01:05:27,549 --> 01:05:29,551
Listen to me, all of you.

762
01:05:30,885 --> 01:05:33,888
- If you want out, now's your chance.
- Want out?

763
01:05:35,723 --> 01:05:40,311
There's no future here for me.

764
01:05:40,437 --> 01:05:43,106
I've rented an apartment
in ikebukuro.

765
01:05:43,231 --> 01:05:49,028
You'll live in fear here now,
it's too risky to do any work.

766
01:05:49,154 --> 01:05:51,448
So we'll all live separately.

767
01:05:51,573 --> 01:05:55,743
When I call,
you go and meet a client.

768
01:05:55,869 --> 01:05:59,539
You'll meet at an inn
and look like a couple.

769
01:05:59,664 --> 01:06:01,833
- Like call girls?
- That's right.

770
01:06:03,168 --> 01:06:05,628
I'm the only one
with the client list,

771
01:06:05,753 --> 01:06:07,630
so you can rest easy.

772
01:06:07,755 --> 01:06:09,424
What's your cut?

773
01:06:09,549 --> 01:06:12,218
I'll takejust 30%.

774
01:06:12,343 --> 01:06:14,596
That's better than working here.

775
01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:19,809
But you have to think differently.

776
01:06:19,934 --> 01:06:23,730
You can't just sit around doing nothing.
You'll have to getjobs.

777
01:06:23,855 --> 01:06:26,232
Office girl, shop clerk, anything.

778
01:06:27,609 --> 01:06:29,569
So we only meet clients at night?

779
01:06:29,694 --> 01:06:32,322
Exactly.
That way, no-one gets caught.

780
01:06:32,447 --> 01:06:36,784
- Plus you'll be earning a salary.
- Will it be that easy?

781
01:06:36,910 --> 01:06:39,245
What happens
when madam comes back?

782
01:06:41,581 --> 01:06:43,124
Don't worry.

783
01:06:43,917 --> 01:06:48,379
You know, I was once
head of a labour union.

784
01:06:50,089 --> 01:06:53,885
I gave orders to 3,000
female factory workers.

785
01:07:00,308 --> 01:07:05,480
Besides, if there's trouble,
we've got mr karasawa behind us.

786
01:07:07,482 --> 01:07:10,610
Tome, I'll go with you.

787
01:07:12,654 --> 01:07:14,531
April 1959

788
01:07:14,656 --> 01:07:16,824
what kind of girl today?

789
01:07:16,950 --> 01:07:19,035
Let me watch it, too.

790
01:07:19,160 --> 01:07:22,830
You shouldn't all be here.
It's too risky.

791
01:07:26,417 --> 01:07:28,545
Sorry about that.

792
01:07:28,670 --> 01:07:31,339
What kind of girl
did you want today?

793
01:07:32,340 --> 01:07:34,884
Ah, the girl you had last time?

794
01:07:35,009 --> 01:07:38,721
Is that so? I'm sorry.

795
01:07:41,015 --> 01:07:43,851
Today you'll get top quality.

796
01:07:44,978 --> 01:07:47,355
It's 3,000 yen.

797
01:07:50,358 --> 01:07:53,695
Thank you very much.

798
01:08:01,202 --> 01:08:04,872
Miyako, you mustn't argue
with the clients.

799
01:08:06,874 --> 01:08:08,751
Listen, everyone.

800
01:08:08,876 --> 01:08:13,923
Men only like quiet,
gentle, obedient girls.

801
01:08:14,882 --> 01:08:16,259
We know.

802
01:08:16,384 --> 01:08:18,386
Look, she's so pretty!

803
01:08:19,387 --> 01:08:21,931
She's good at tennis, too.

804
01:08:22,056 --> 01:08:26,185
The crown Princess really is
different from the rest of us.

805
01:08:33,526 --> 01:08:35,445
What's this?

806
01:08:35,570 --> 01:08:38,406
Your cucumbers.
Thank you for your order!

807
01:08:39,407 --> 01:08:43,786
Make some tea.
And then serve this.

808
01:08:43,911 --> 01:08:46,581
And wash your hands, they're dirty!

809
01:08:49,417 --> 01:08:51,419
Can you afford this?

810
01:08:51,544 --> 01:08:54,505
It's fine. I need it for the business.

811
01:08:55,757 --> 01:08:58,885
Hello. Midori?

812
01:08:59,010 --> 01:09:02,055
5:30. You're a doctor's wife, okay?

813
01:09:02,180 --> 01:09:04,932
East exit, outside the Niko restaurant.

814
01:09:05,767 --> 01:09:09,646
He's 50-ish, with a moustache.
He'll be carrying a magazine.

815
01:09:09,771 --> 01:09:12,231
I'll be there, too.

816
01:09:17,070 --> 01:09:19,947
Oh, that feels so good.

817
01:09:23,576 --> 01:09:26,120
I'm so happy.

818
01:09:28,247 --> 01:09:31,000
So happy...

819
01:09:34,212 --> 01:09:39,842
Father, everything's
working out so well.

820
01:09:42,136 --> 01:09:45,014
Shall I make you even happier?

821
01:09:47,642 --> 01:09:49,060
How about it?

822
01:09:49,185 --> 01:09:50,687
Youlech!

823
01:09:53,064 --> 01:09:55,316
I didn't mean that.

824
01:09:56,359 --> 01:09:59,821
Your madam suma's inn
is up for sale.

825
01:10:02,073 --> 01:10:04,242
- Really?
- Yes, really.

826
01:10:13,167 --> 01:10:17,505
Can't work anymore.

827
01:10:21,217 --> 01:10:23,219
What a shame for her.

828
01:10:23,344 --> 01:10:25,304
5.2 million yen.

829
01:10:26,180 --> 01:10:28,683
20% below market price.

830
01:10:30,685 --> 01:10:32,395
I see.

831
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:37,233
Now's the time to buy.
What do you say?

832
01:10:39,819 --> 01:10:42,280
- I should buy it?
- Of course.

833
01:10:44,532 --> 01:10:46,033
Yes, but...

834
01:10:50,037 --> 01:10:52,039
You won.

835
01:10:52,957 --> 01:10:55,209
You're the sumo grand champion.

836
01:10:58,171 --> 01:10:59,714
Daddy!

837
01:11:01,174 --> 01:11:03,551
This is karasawa. What's that?

838
01:11:04,886 --> 01:11:06,929
That won't do.

839
01:11:08,306 --> 01:11:09,932
At hakusan?

840
01:11:10,057 --> 01:11:12,226
Bring mr Yamada along.

841
01:11:13,895 --> 01:11:18,858
That's right. If we don't get him on
our side, he'll make trouble later on.

842
01:11:21,068 --> 01:11:22,862
What's wrong?

843
01:11:22,987 --> 01:11:25,823
I need a good girl for tonight.

844
01:11:25,948 --> 01:11:28,868
This guy is with fuji steel.

845
01:11:28,993 --> 01:11:30,536
What time?

846
01:11:30,661 --> 01:11:33,956
It's already 4:00.
Have her get ready now.

847
01:11:35,541 --> 01:11:38,961
- How about miyako?
- Too young.

848
01:11:39,086 --> 01:11:41,589
Bribing this guy is a major task.

849
01:11:41,714 --> 01:11:44,217
She's no better than hanako.

850
01:11:50,765 --> 01:11:52,934
He's a handsome man.

851
01:11:55,144 --> 01:11:57,480
Are you suggesting that I should go?

852
01:11:57,605 --> 01:12:00,274
That way,
I wouldn't have to worry.

853
01:12:05,822 --> 01:12:09,283
If tonight doesn't go well,
my future prospects will suffer.

854
01:12:10,576 --> 01:12:12,620
It's make or break.

855
01:12:18,918 --> 01:12:24,757
If you'd bought the inn back then,
it'd really come in useful now.

856
01:12:29,178 --> 01:12:33,933
I didn't have
that kind of money back then.

857
01:12:34,058 --> 01:12:35,935
Do you have it now?

858
01:12:36,769 --> 01:12:38,646
Are you kidding?

859
01:12:39,438 --> 01:12:41,524
Never mind.

860
01:12:41,649 --> 01:12:44,277
If there's no girl, it's all over.

861
01:12:47,488 --> 01:12:51,701
If you agree to it, then I'll go.

862
01:12:51,826 --> 01:12:54,078
But aren't you busy?

863
01:12:54,996 --> 01:12:57,623
It's fine,
as long as you don't mind.

864
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:07,216
Darling...

865
01:13:11,888 --> 01:13:14,181
You really don't care if I go?

866
01:13:15,516 --> 01:13:17,518
Of course I do.

867
01:13:22,481 --> 01:13:26,110
50,000 yen will do.
Can you give it to him?

868
01:13:26,235 --> 01:13:28,195
I'll pay you back.

869
01:13:33,034 --> 01:13:34,452
Very well.

870
01:14:44,146 --> 01:14:45,940
Welcome back.

871
01:14:47,692 --> 01:14:50,277
- Would you like dinner?
- Yes.

872
01:14:50,403 --> 01:14:52,405
Oh, it's a blackout.

873
01:14:58,786 --> 01:15:02,498
- Where's mr karasawa?
- He left soon after you.

874
01:15:15,136 --> 01:15:16,887
Ow, that's hot!

875
01:15:32,987 --> 01:15:36,198
It's not hot! You call that hot?

876
01:15:36,323 --> 01:15:39,160
I can take a lot worse than that!

877
01:15:40,369 --> 01:15:43,205
Put your hand in it. Do it!

878
01:15:47,543 --> 01:15:50,087
Fooling around
with the grocery boy!

879
01:15:50,212 --> 01:15:51,630
It isn't hot!

880
01:15:59,013 --> 01:16:01,223
Could you make a fold here,

881
01:16:01,348 --> 01:16:03,434
scrape the cheek bone,

882
01:16:03,559 --> 01:16:05,561
and use that to build up the nose?

883
01:16:05,686 --> 01:16:07,313
Impossible.

884
01:16:07,438 --> 01:16:10,066
You have to use
other material for a nose,

885
01:16:10,191 --> 01:16:12,526
like ivory or plastic.

886
01:16:12,651 --> 01:16:15,362
Vinyl will do. It's cheaper.

887
01:16:18,032 --> 01:16:20,618
It doesn't matter
what the client told you,

888
01:16:20,743 --> 01:16:23,579
I paid you 60%.

889
01:16:23,704 --> 01:16:27,875
Stop trying to cheat me.
If he paid 5,000, I should get 3,000.

890
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,086
You only gave me 2,000.

891
01:16:30,211 --> 01:16:33,756
- And this isn't the first time.
- Now, listen...

892
01:16:33,881 --> 01:16:37,093
Besides, you give all the others 70%.

893
01:16:37,218 --> 01:16:40,429
Why do I only get 60%?
Enough of your tricks.

894
01:16:40,554 --> 01:16:44,600
That's enough, mama,
let's go home.

895
01:16:46,060 --> 01:16:48,437
Honey, wait outside.

896
01:16:50,064 --> 01:16:53,234
Take this sweetie.

897
01:16:53,901 --> 01:16:56,070
Go and wait outside.

898
01:16:57,988 --> 01:17:00,616
I'm not leaving
until I get a 70% deal.

899
01:17:00,741 --> 01:17:02,409
That's enough!

900
01:17:03,911 --> 01:17:05,621
You certainly complain a lot,

901
01:17:05,746 --> 01:17:08,082
but you know
what clients say about you?

902
01:17:08,207 --> 01:17:10,793
- I don't care...
- You should!

903
01:17:10,918 --> 01:17:15,589
I'll tell you
all the complaints I hear:

904
01:17:15,714 --> 01:17:18,300
"No sex appeal." "Poor service."

905
01:17:19,593 --> 01:17:22,680
And you drag that weirdo
everywhere with you.

906
01:17:22,805 --> 01:17:24,682
It's bad for business.

907
01:17:24,807 --> 01:17:27,309
He wants to come along.
What can I do?

908
01:17:27,434 --> 01:17:30,146
- You have to be firm with him.
- I can't.

909
01:17:30,271 --> 01:17:32,940
I love him.
There's nothing I can do.

910
01:17:37,570 --> 01:17:41,323
- Is that Korean that good?
- What if he is?

911
01:17:43,701 --> 01:17:47,872
He says he loves you,

912
01:17:48,956 --> 01:17:51,917
but he doesn't care
if you sell your body?

913
01:17:52,042 --> 01:17:54,837
He does care,
that's why he comes along.

914
01:17:54,962 --> 01:17:59,133
- But he won't get a job?
- I don't want him to work.

915
01:18:22,865 --> 01:18:26,202
I sell my body because I love him.
Got that?

916
01:18:26,327 --> 01:18:27,620
I see.

917
01:18:27,745 --> 01:18:31,457
You're so in love that you can't give
the clients decent service.

918
01:18:31,582 --> 01:18:34,877
You just keep churning out
little brats.

919
01:18:35,002 --> 01:18:36,921
Here's 20,000.

920
01:18:38,214 --> 01:18:40,216
It's not because I owe you anything.

921
01:18:40,341 --> 01:18:43,093
It's so you'll work harder.

922
01:18:44,094 --> 01:18:47,223
All this talk about love
is nonsense.

923
01:18:47,348 --> 01:18:50,643
- You just want money.
- What?

924
01:18:50,768 --> 01:18:55,397
- You've forgotten what I did for you.
- What you did for me?

925
01:18:55,522 --> 01:18:59,068
You became that yankee's
mistress for the money.

926
01:18:59,193 --> 01:19:02,112
Just work a little harder.

927
01:19:04,198 --> 01:19:06,033
Quit, by all means.

928
01:19:07,159 --> 01:19:11,872
But at your age, you won't make
this much anywhere else.

929
01:19:13,207 --> 01:19:17,127
Don't you want it? I'll keep it, then.

930
01:19:17,253 --> 01:19:19,129
I want it!

931
01:19:31,850 --> 01:19:33,394
Midori...

932
01:19:34,895 --> 01:19:38,565
You can afford to be in love
because I take care of you.

933
01:19:41,568 --> 01:19:45,614
Okay, it's over.
Let's go home quick.

934
01:20:02,715 --> 01:20:06,260
Hanako!
They took your bandages off!

935
01:20:13,434 --> 01:20:16,020
You look beautiful now.

936
01:20:17,521 --> 01:20:19,940
Hello? Hello?

937
01:20:20,941 --> 01:20:22,568
Miyako?

938
01:20:22,693 --> 01:20:26,196
Why didn't you show up?

939
01:20:27,031 --> 01:20:30,826
It was for 3:00.
The client got fed up and left.

940
01:20:35,789 --> 01:20:39,001
I can't hear you over the phone.
I'll come over.

941
01:20:39,877 --> 01:20:42,087
He only paid 4,000.

942
01:20:42,212 --> 01:20:45,132
I get 30%, or 1,200.

943
01:20:45,257 --> 01:20:49,178
That still leaves 2,800 for you.
What's wrong with that?

944
01:20:49,303 --> 01:20:53,349
You're wrong! I only got 2,500.

945
01:20:53,474 --> 01:20:56,352
- Where's the other 300?
- Taxi fare.

946
01:20:56,477 --> 01:20:58,312
Taxi fare? You're kidding.

947
01:20:58,437 --> 01:21:02,566
A roundtrip between ueno
and asakusa wouldn't even be 200.

948
01:21:04,068 --> 01:21:06,945
Telephone and food expenses.

949
01:21:07,071 --> 01:21:11,367
Don't be ridiculous.
I've seen your place. It's super-deluxe.

950
01:21:11,492 --> 01:21:14,828
Look at me,
I'm living on rice and pickles!

951
01:21:19,500 --> 01:21:20,959
What's this, then?

952
01:21:21,085 --> 01:21:23,587
Can't I even eat salmon?

953
01:21:32,513 --> 01:21:35,682
No, not ton/ght. I'm busy.

954
01:21:35,808 --> 01:21:37,559
You're stingy!

955
01:21:40,687 --> 01:21:43,816
Okay, then, 3,000 yen. Same place.

956
01:21:44,858 --> 01:21:46,693
See you later.

957
01:21:52,533 --> 01:21:53,992
What's that for?

958
01:21:54,118 --> 01:21:57,788
Turning tricks on the side?
Who made you this beautiful?

959
01:21:57,913 --> 01:22:00,833
Monster!
Everyone calls you a monster!

960
01:22:00,958 --> 01:22:03,919
- Stupid bitch!
- Leave me alone!

961
01:22:07,506 --> 01:22:09,383
You little brat!

962
01:22:10,426 --> 01:22:14,513
You just exploit us
and give all the money to karasawa!

963
01:22:14,638 --> 01:22:16,432
What's that?

964
01:22:29,069 --> 01:22:32,281
You're all fake, aren't you?

965
01:22:32,406 --> 01:22:36,243
- You're hurting me!
- It's all fake, you idiot!

966
01:22:39,872 --> 01:22:44,751
I paid for your face,
and I'll tearit apart!

967
01:22:56,346 --> 01:22:57,806
Nobuko?

968
01:22:57,931 --> 01:22:59,766
Who was that?

969
01:23:01,101 --> 01:23:03,228
She works for me.

970
01:23:03,353 --> 01:23:06,565
Go on in. Hurry, go inside.

971
01:23:10,068 --> 01:23:13,238
You could've telegrammed
that you were coming.

972
01:23:13,363 --> 01:23:15,616
Pa should've let me know.

973
01:23:19,703 --> 01:23:22,289
That girl disobeyed me.

974
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:34,176
But never mind about her.

975
01:23:37,596 --> 01:23:40,891
She wouldn't listen to me,
so I had no choice.

976
01:23:48,106 --> 01:23:49,608
Mama.

977
01:23:50,234 --> 01:23:51,735
What?

978
01:23:53,654 --> 01:23:56,323
Could you lend me 200,000 yen?

979
01:23:58,200 --> 01:23:59,660
What for?

980
01:24:00,536 --> 01:24:02,371
To start a farm.

981
01:24:02,496 --> 01:24:05,749
A farm? Where?

982
01:24:05,874 --> 01:24:09,378
- The kurumi plains.
- Kurumi plains?

983
01:24:09,503 --> 01:24:11,547
It's close to town.

984
01:24:11,672 --> 01:24:15,133
Perfect for a collective dairy farm.

985
01:24:16,009 --> 01:24:19,388
We've already started
repairing the roads,

986
01:24:19,513 --> 01:24:21,515
and we're all putting in money.

987
01:24:21,640 --> 01:24:23,350
Who s we"?

988
01:24:23,475 --> 01:24:26,520
Kanbayashi
and the other trainees.

989
01:24:27,521 --> 01:24:29,690
What about high school?

990
01:24:30,857 --> 01:24:33,527
I'm sorry, ma,
but I quit in march.

991
01:24:33,652 --> 01:24:35,654
I've been working
on the training farm.

992
01:24:35,779 --> 01:24:37,281
You quit?

993
01:24:38,532 --> 01:24:41,868
I don't like studying.

994
01:24:41,994 --> 01:24:46,290
I've been sending you money,
and you lied to me!

995
01:24:47,541 --> 01:24:49,167
I'm sorry.

996
01:24:50,502 --> 01:24:52,421
What about grandpa?

997
01:24:52,546 --> 01:24:55,591
His legs are bad,
he says it's rheumatism.

998
01:24:55,716 --> 01:24:57,926
Not that, you idiot.

999
01:24:58,051 --> 01:25:01,972
I mean what did he say
about you quitting school?

1000
01:25:02,097 --> 01:25:04,182
He just said, "oh, well."

1001
01:25:05,309 --> 01:25:06,935
"Oh, well"?

1002
01:25:08,562 --> 01:25:10,897
Ma, lend me 200,000.

1003
01:25:12,190 --> 01:25:13,734
No way!

1004
01:25:16,570 --> 01:25:19,156
Forget these crazy ideas of yours.

1005
01:25:19,281 --> 01:25:25,370
You must move to Tokyo
and find a good husband.

1006
01:25:25,495 --> 01:25:27,831
I have a boyfriend.

1007
01:25:29,291 --> 01:25:30,626
You what?

1008
01:25:30,751 --> 01:25:32,502
He's helping with the farm.

1009
01:25:32,628 --> 01:25:34,838
It's jintaro from next door.

1010
01:25:46,141 --> 01:25:48,352
What do you do for a living?

1011
01:25:55,275 --> 01:25:56,943
One day...

1012
01:25:58,236 --> 01:26:00,656
I was going to tell you.

1013
01:26:02,949 --> 01:26:07,746
That's why I don't have
that kind of money.

1014
01:26:07,871 --> 01:26:11,500
You shouldn't be doing
such hard work anyway.

1015
01:26:11,625 --> 01:26:14,961
I was born a farmer,
I'm used to the hardship.

1016
01:26:16,546 --> 01:26:18,507
He's taking advantage of you.

1017
01:26:18,632 --> 01:26:21,134
He'd never do such a thing.

1018
01:26:22,344 --> 01:26:24,846
You never know with men.

1019
01:26:24,971 --> 01:26:26,848
He's all right.

1020
01:26:26,973 --> 01:26:30,644
He studies a lot,
but he's a little absentminded.

1021
01:26:34,648 --> 01:26:36,858
Was it fun, sightseeing in Tokyo?

1022
01:26:36,983 --> 01:26:39,236
Didn't see any sights.

1023
01:26:40,195 --> 01:26:42,322
She's a character, this one.

1024
01:26:42,447 --> 01:26:45,575
- She's just a country girl.
- That's okay.

1025
01:26:45,701 --> 01:26:48,537
- Wasn't there some dried roe?
- It's all gone.

1026
01:26:48,662 --> 01:26:50,163
Gone?

1027
01:26:51,081 --> 01:26:52,499
Soy sauce.

1028
01:26:57,796 --> 01:26:59,548
Where's hanako?

1029
01:26:59,673 --> 01:27:01,800
She left for work.

1030
01:27:05,303 --> 01:27:07,139
I'm 5 o r r v: M a! A m

1031
01:27:07,264 --> 01:27:10,600
I won't do jobs on the side anymore.

1032
01:27:10,726 --> 01:27:14,563
It's all right.
Don't just stand there, come in.

1033
01:27:14,688 --> 01:27:17,274
- What happened to her nose?
- Oh, that...

1034
01:27:18,525 --> 01:27:20,277
What happened?

1035
01:27:21,695 --> 01:27:23,280
It's nothing.

1036
01:27:23,864 --> 01:27:26,158
Nobuko brought this for us.

1037
01:27:27,117 --> 01:27:29,244
It'll give you strength.

1038
01:27:33,331 --> 01:27:35,125
I'm leaving tonight.

1039
01:27:36,460 --> 01:27:39,254
You haven't even stayed one night.

1040
01:27:39,379 --> 01:27:42,883
Grandpa's bedridden with bad legs.
I have to go.

1041
01:27:45,051 --> 01:27:47,053
Mrs matsuki?

1042
01:27:48,930 --> 01:27:50,849
Mrs matsuki!

1043
01:27:50,974 --> 01:27:52,768
- Yes?
- Telegram.

1044
01:28:07,073 --> 01:28:10,327
Wait, nobuko! Wait a minute.

1045
01:28:12,078 --> 01:28:15,290
You have to pee?
I'm going on ahead.

1046
01:28:35,185 --> 01:28:37,813
Don't die, pa.

1047
01:28:44,611 --> 01:28:46,571
It's all over.

1048
01:28:48,240 --> 01:28:50,283
How old was chuji?

1049
01:28:51,409 --> 01:28:53,620
About 65.

1050
01:28:56,373 --> 01:29:00,418
He was so hale and hearty.
Strong as an ox.

1051
01:29:01,628 --> 01:29:03,505
Grandma, how old are you?

1052
01:29:06,132 --> 01:29:09,761
I'm still...

1053
01:29:10,387 --> 01:29:13,515
91 years old.

1054
01:29:13,640 --> 01:29:16,184
Talk about hale and hearty!

1055
01:29:18,353 --> 01:29:22,107
Grandma should hurry up
and go too

1056
01:29:22,232 --> 01:29:24,985
and stop being such a nuisance!

1057
01:29:36,997 --> 01:29:38,665
What?

1058
01:29:42,544 --> 01:29:45,005
Ma, grandpa said something.

1059
01:29:46,381 --> 01:29:48,425
Pa, what is it?

1060
01:29:48,550 --> 01:29:50,427
Tell me.

1061
01:29:54,681 --> 01:29:56,391
"Breast"?

1062
01:29:57,893 --> 01:29:59,895
What's he mean, "breast"?

1063
01:30:02,856 --> 01:30:06,443
Grandpa? What do you mean?

1064
01:30:10,864 --> 01:30:12,324
Breast?

1065
01:30:21,541 --> 01:30:23,627
What are you doing, ma?

1066
01:30:32,093 --> 01:30:34,429
Pa, here's my breast.

1067
01:30:39,434 --> 01:30:42,062
Pa, it's my milk.

1068
01:30:43,146 --> 01:30:45,941
It's Tome's milk. Drink.

1069
01:30:46,858 --> 01:30:48,068
Drink.

1070
01:30:48,902 --> 01:30:50,737
Go on, drink.

1071
01:30:58,578 --> 01:31:00,246
I've really...

1072
01:31:02,248 --> 01:31:04,668
Done well for myself in Tokyo.

1073
01:31:06,044 --> 01:31:08,755
I'll be sending for you soon,

1074
01:31:09,923 --> 01:31:12,092
so hurry and get better.

1075
01:31:14,761 --> 01:31:18,306
Pa, I can't stand to see you die.

1076
01:31:21,101 --> 01:31:23,103
I couldn't bear it.

1077
01:31:26,356 --> 01:31:28,984
What's the idea,
taking all the condolence money?

1078
01:31:29,109 --> 01:31:31,319
You're so greedy.

1079
01:31:32,112 --> 01:31:34,990
I paid 10,000 for the expenses.

1080
01:31:35,115 --> 01:31:36,992
There was 12,000.

1081
01:31:37,117 --> 01:31:40,161
So? I'll be sending
all the thank-you gifts too.

1082
01:31:40,286 --> 01:31:44,666
So this is why you offered
to pay for the funeral.

1083
01:31:44,791 --> 01:31:48,420
None of you did your part.

1084
01:31:48,545 --> 01:31:50,964
And you paid with your money?

1085
01:31:51,798 --> 01:31:53,049
What?

1086
01:31:53,174 --> 01:31:56,886
Who put nobuko and pa
out in the barn?

1087
01:32:00,140 --> 01:32:03,351
- Mukaiyama's wife is so greedy.
- That's right!

1088
01:32:03,476 --> 01:32:08,565
She brought her seven brats.
They'll eat us out of house and home.

1089
01:32:08,690 --> 01:32:11,776
She's well known for that.

1090
01:32:11,901 --> 01:32:17,532
If there's a wake,
she starves her kids all day,

1091
01:32:17,657 --> 01:32:20,076
then brings them along to eat.

1092
01:32:20,201 --> 01:32:23,079
Well, it's a wake, after all,
even if it's just for chuji.

1093
01:32:23,204 --> 01:32:25,373
They'll be back again tomorrow.

1094
01:32:25,498 --> 01:32:30,170
You can't exactly turn them away.

1095
01:32:31,921 --> 01:32:33,423
Where's nobuko?

1096
01:32:34,340 --> 01:32:35,467
I don't know.

1097
01:32:35,592 --> 01:32:38,720
No-one's seen her
since we put pa in the coffin.

1098
01:32:38,845 --> 01:32:41,765
Thanks for coming all this way.

1099
01:32:42,766 --> 01:32:44,684
Good evening.

1100
01:32:46,811 --> 01:32:48,730
Where have you been?

1101
01:32:48,855 --> 01:32:52,067
Nobuko came to my place
but wouldn't say a word,

1102
01:32:52,192 --> 01:32:53,735
so I brought her back.

1103
01:32:53,860 --> 01:32:56,738
- Who are you?
- Kanbayashi yoshiji.

1104
01:32:58,198 --> 01:33:03,203
The son of yoshizo in kamigawa.
Nobuko's lover!

1105
01:33:05,038 --> 01:33:09,042
And quite a fancy fella,
after living in Tokyo.

1106
01:33:09,876 --> 01:33:15,757
How can he work in construction
with that scrawny body?

1107
01:33:15,882 --> 01:33:19,177
He couldn't.
That's why he returned here.

1108
01:33:19,302 --> 01:33:23,306
At least he's got virgin land
to plough!

1109
01:33:25,183 --> 01:33:28,394
Quiet! No-one asked any of you.

1110
01:33:31,064 --> 01:33:34,275
So you're the one
leading nobuko on?

1111
01:33:34,400 --> 01:33:36,402
I'm not leading her on.

1112
01:33:36,528 --> 01:33:41,074
What? Luring my daughter
away without a word.

1113
01:33:43,201 --> 01:33:45,662
Nobuko, I want an apology.

1114
01:33:49,415 --> 01:33:51,835
You're not coming in
unless you apologise.

1115
01:33:53,837 --> 01:33:58,550
I hope thatgir/ doesn't have
a bastard child too.

1116
01:34:00,468 --> 01:34:02,804
June 1960

1117
01:34:02,929 --> 01:34:06,307
no new us-Japan treaty!

1118
01:34:15,483 --> 01:34:18,236
We'll have to take a different route.

1119
01:34:18,361 --> 01:34:21,823
- Then the meter will go up.
- Nothing I can do.

1120
01:34:21,948 --> 01:34:23,741
What do you mean?

1121
01:34:23,867 --> 01:34:27,370
They're starving,
so they're demonstrating.

1122
01:34:27,495 --> 01:34:30,498
That's not my concern!

1123
01:34:30,623 --> 01:34:32,709
Nothing I can do.

1124
01:34:32,834 --> 01:34:34,961
I don't know, really!

1125
01:34:42,760 --> 01:34:46,431
Have you seen hanako?
She's not home.

1126
01:34:46,556 --> 01:34:49,684
I haven't seen her
in four or five days.

1127
01:34:49,809 --> 01:34:52,604
I gave her the rent money.
Did she pay it?

1128
01:34:55,607 --> 01:34:58,776
Hello? Sakura apartments?

1129
01:34:58,902 --> 01:35:02,488
Could you please call miss yokoi
to the phone?

1130
01:35:04,365 --> 01:35:06,784
She moved? Where?

1131
01:35:07,785 --> 01:35:10,580
What do you mean, you don't know?
Hello? Hello?

1132
01:35:10,705 --> 01:35:13,958
Sorry. Could you get miss seki
from next door?

1133
01:35:15,376 --> 01:35:19,464
She moved too? When?
Both of them together?

1134
01:35:19,589 --> 01:35:21,007
Together?

1135
01:35:26,012 --> 01:35:28,598
Damn them. They've run away!

1136
01:35:41,861 --> 01:35:45,240
Hello, is that karasawa enterprises?
The president, please.

1137
01:35:45,365 --> 01:35:47,242
This is mrs matsuki.

1138
01:35:47,367 --> 01:35:49,244
He's out?

1139
01:35:49,369 --> 01:35:52,413
This is mrs matsuki!

1140
01:35:52,872 --> 01:35:55,917
Am I sure I'm calling
the right place?

1141
01:35:56,042 --> 01:35:57,919
You're just an employee.

1142
01:35:58,044 --> 01:36:00,755
What the hell
are you talking about?

1143
01:36:02,382 --> 01:36:04,717
You're matsuki Tome?

1144
01:36:12,225 --> 01:36:17,021
- Where were you yesterday?
- At home with an upset stomach.

1145
01:36:51,431 --> 01:36:58,521
Spring 1961

1146
01:37:39,270 --> 01:37:40,813
You surprised me.

1147
01:37:40,938 --> 01:37:44,567
I'm the one who's surprised.
I told you not to come here.

1148
01:37:44,692 --> 01:37:45,985
Yes, but...

1149
01:37:46,110 --> 01:37:48,363
What happened?
Did you just get out today?

1150
01:37:50,990 --> 01:37:52,825
It was awful.

1151
01:37:56,662 --> 01:37:59,332
You never came to see me!

1152
01:38:00,375 --> 01:38:03,503
Think about it,
how could I visit you in prison?

1153
01:38:04,504 --> 01:38:06,130
I know, but...

1154
01:38:06,881 --> 01:38:09,884
Take this for now.

1155
01:38:11,552 --> 01:38:12,720
Thank you.

1156
01:38:12,845 --> 01:38:16,641
- Did you go to your apartment?
- Yes, but some stranger's living there.

1157
01:38:16,766 --> 01:38:20,436
There's a fujiwara real estate office
at otsuka station.

1158
01:38:20,561 --> 01:38:23,564
Go and see them.
They'll show you your new place.

1159
01:38:23,689 --> 01:38:27,402
Go and get some rest.
Your things are there.

1160
01:38:27,527 --> 01:38:29,695
I'll come by tonight.

1161
01:38:29,821 --> 01:38:33,825
Did you say... Fujita?

1162
01:38:33,950 --> 01:38:35,284
Fujiwara.

1163
01:38:35,410 --> 01:38:36,911
Idiot!

1164
01:38:52,051 --> 01:38:53,594
Mrs matsuki?

1165
01:38:56,222 --> 01:38:57,849
That's odd.

1166
01:38:59,767 --> 01:39:02,019
I think she's home.

1167
01:39:07,567 --> 01:39:10,361
Mrs matsuki, you have a visitor.

1168
01:39:20,746 --> 01:39:22,248
Nobuko?

1169
01:39:27,920 --> 01:39:29,922
I'll open the door.

1170
01:39:36,596 --> 01:39:40,433
Nobuko, what are you doing here?

1171
01:39:40,558 --> 01:39:44,061
Mr karasawa called me,
so I hurried over.

1172
01:39:44,187 --> 01:39:45,646
Why?

1173
01:39:46,272 --> 01:39:48,858
Haven't you heard?

1174
01:39:48,983 --> 01:39:50,985
I haven't heard anything.

1175
01:39:52,361 --> 01:39:54,113
Come in.

1176
01:39:58,367 --> 01:40:01,329
Have you been in Tokyo all this time?

1177
01:40:01,454 --> 01:40:03,748
When did you get here?

1178
01:40:03,873 --> 01:40:07,168
I ran away from home a month ago,

1179
01:40:07,293 --> 01:40:09,837
but you were in jail.

1180
01:40:10,880 --> 01:40:13,299
I had nowhere to go,
so I called mr karasawa.

1181
01:40:14,717 --> 01:40:18,304
200,000 yen?
Your mother hasn't got that much.

1182
01:40:19,555 --> 01:40:21,432
That's why I'm asking you.

1183
01:40:21,557 --> 01:40:24,894
I can't give you that much money
just like that.

1184
01:40:25,811 --> 01:40:27,355
But...

1185
01:40:30,358 --> 01:40:32,360
That doesn't mean...

1186
01:40:33,694 --> 01:40:35,905
That I don't have it.

1187
01:40:37,740 --> 01:40:39,534
Great!

1188
01:40:39,659 --> 01:40:43,955
I promised the others I'd get it,
no matter what.

1189
01:40:44,080 --> 01:40:45,748
I admire your zeal.

1190
01:40:45,873 --> 01:40:47,959
Yoshiji put in 50,000,

1191
01:40:48,084 --> 01:40:52,129
and ma gave me the same,
so just 200,000 more...

1192
01:40:52,255 --> 01:40:55,466
- Will the new farm make money?
- Lots of it!

1193
01:40:55,591 --> 01:40:59,303
We'll clear a million yen
by the second year.

1194
01:40:59,428 --> 01:41:02,473
In 15 years,
it'll more than double.

1195
01:41:02,598 --> 01:41:05,560
In 20 years,
when everyone's kids are grown,

1196
01:41:05,685 --> 01:41:07,311
we'll be even richer than...

1197
01:41:07,436 --> 01:41:08,980
Than me?

1198
01:41:10,398 --> 01:41:12,316
That's great.

1199
01:41:12,441 --> 01:41:17,196
But I won't give you
that kind of money for nothing.

1200
01:41:18,489 --> 01:41:21,492
And I do sewing for the neighbours.

1201
01:41:24,453 --> 01:41:27,915
And mr karasawa comes to see you?

1202
01:41:29,667 --> 01:41:31,877
Yes, about twice a week.

1203
01:41:33,629 --> 01:41:36,132
I'd like you to come and live with me,

1204
01:41:36,257 --> 01:41:39,760
but there's a phone, and you might
go back to your old ways.

1205
01:41:42,638 --> 01:41:46,225
Ma, go ahead and slap me.
I don't mind.

1206
01:42:02,074 --> 01:42:05,703
Ma, what other way is there?

1207
01:42:07,121 --> 01:42:09,957
We're poor, we have nothing.

1208
01:42:10,082 --> 01:42:15,046
Just wait four months,
until the crops are in.

1209
01:42:15,171 --> 01:42:17,381
Then come to kurumi plains.

1210
01:42:20,760 --> 01:42:24,722
Don't you understand why
I struggled so hard to raise you?

1211
01:42:26,849 --> 01:42:28,768
Don't you understand?

1212
01:42:34,398 --> 01:42:37,443
I'm sorry I was such a burden.

1213
01:42:37,568 --> 01:42:40,905
I'll pay it all back when I've saved up.

1214
01:42:54,919 --> 01:42:58,214
We'll all live together soon, ma.

1215
01:42:59,590 --> 01:43:01,175
Forget it!

1216
01:43:03,594 --> 01:43:06,430
I can't live
out in the mountains anymore.

1217
01:43:12,561 --> 01:43:17,566
You say to wait four months.

1218
01:43:19,235 --> 01:43:22,613
But it doesn't work that way
between men and women.

1219
01:43:22,738 --> 01:43:25,324
Things will change
in a couple of months,

1220
01:43:25,449 --> 01:43:27,451
and you'll be trapped!

1221
01:43:27,576 --> 01:43:30,454
- That won't happen.
- You fool!

1222
01:43:32,123 --> 01:43:34,667
You know nothing about these things!

1223
01:43:34,792 --> 01:43:36,627
That won't happen.

1224
01:43:44,760 --> 01:43:49,348
Is that it?
Is that how human beings are?

1225
01:43:49,473 --> 01:43:52,893
Yes. That's how life is.

1226
01:43:53,894 --> 01:43:56,313
- What about the money?
- The money?

1227
01:43:56,439 --> 01:43:58,774
You promised nobuko 200,000 yen.

1228
01:43:58,899 --> 01:44:02,153
Isn't that how much I gave you
over the years?

1229
01:44:02,278 --> 01:44:04,655
Running a small business isn't easy.

1230
01:44:04,780 --> 01:44:07,116
I'm grateful for the help
now and then.

1231
01:44:07,950 --> 01:44:12,621
I'm sorry, but nobuko is
a different matter.

1232
01:44:13,414 --> 01:44:16,375
This is too much.

1233
01:44:16,500 --> 01:44:18,294
You're too cruel.

1234
01:44:18,419 --> 01:44:20,171
There's nothing I can do.

1235
01:44:20,296 --> 01:44:22,673
Besides, you've had your good times.

1236
01:44:23,883 --> 01:44:25,926
What are you talking about?

1237
01:44:26,051 --> 01:44:28,095
Coward! You dirty coward!

1238
01:44:30,139 --> 01:44:33,184
You're the one who had a good time!
I'm a human being too!

1239
01:44:33,309 --> 01:44:37,229
- Quieten down. You're disgraceful.
- You call me disgraceful?

1240
01:44:38,397 --> 01:44:39,982
Fine, then.

1241
01:44:40,107 --> 01:44:44,069
I'll make sure your wife and workers
hear all about you!

1242
01:44:44,195 --> 01:44:47,364
Go ahead and tell them.

1243
01:44:47,490 --> 01:44:49,950
But you and I are finished!

1244
01:44:50,493 --> 01:44:54,330
I will! I'll tell them everything!

1245
01:45:55,558 --> 01:46:01,689
Betrayed by everyone that I've loved

1246
01:46:03,232 --> 01:46:09,321
I wander through this bitter life alone

1247
01:46:13,158 --> 01:46:15,035
I'm back already.

1248
01:46:15,160 --> 01:46:17,246
Oh, this again?

1249
01:46:18,289 --> 01:46:21,667
- I learned how to reverse today.
- That's great.

1250
01:46:21,792 --> 01:46:25,004
The instructor says I can get
my licence in two weeks.

1251
01:46:25,129 --> 01:46:27,006
You're certainly keen.

1252
01:46:28,757 --> 01:46:32,177
Did you tell that kanbayashi
you were learning to drive?

1253
01:46:33,596 --> 01:46:36,432
Isn't that your boyfriend?

1254
01:46:36,557 --> 01:46:37,975
Yeah!

1255
01:46:38,934 --> 01:46:41,145
So he knows this address?

1256
01:46:44,148 --> 01:46:45,858
What did you tell him?

1257
01:46:45,983 --> 01:46:48,819
I said I was helping my ma out
for four months.

1258
01:46:48,944 --> 01:46:50,404
I see.

1259
01:46:52,948 --> 01:46:56,869
What would he do
if he found out about us?

1260
01:46:56,994 --> 01:47:00,164
He'd be furious.
But he won't find out.

1261
01:47:00,289 --> 01:47:01,749
That's right.

1262
01:47:01,874 --> 01:47:05,127
All he talks about in his letter
is fertiliser.

1263
01:47:05,252 --> 01:47:09,882
He's trying really hard
to teach me all about the work.

1264
01:47:11,383 --> 01:47:13,802
I'll teach you a thing or two myself.

1265
01:47:22,227 --> 01:47:24,271
There are two ways we can go.

1266
01:47:24,396 --> 01:47:29,068
You're free to choose whichever.
I'm a great believer in freedom.

1267
01:47:30,819 --> 01:47:33,280
One is what we already agreed to.

1268
01:47:33,405 --> 01:47:37,493
The other is to stay in Tokyo
and run a shop here.

1269
01:47:38,452 --> 01:47:42,623
The shop is that boutique you saw
yesterday in dogenzaka.

1270
01:47:43,791 --> 01:47:48,045
It's up for sale.
If you want, I'll buy it.

1271
01:47:48,170 --> 01:47:51,006
It's small,
so you couldn't live there.

1272
01:47:51,882 --> 01:47:54,301
You could stay here
in the apartment,

1273
01:47:54,426 --> 01:47:58,806
or / could get a house in the suburbs
for you and your mother.

1274
01:47:58,931 --> 01:48:03,143
You 7! Pay your own expenses
from your share of the business.

1275
01:48:03,268 --> 01:48:06,188
I 7! Take 30%.

1276
01:48:07,523 --> 01:48:12,152
You 7! Make 100, 000 a month easy,
so that's 70,000 for you.

1277
01:48:14,446 --> 01:48:17,032
So will it be that...

1278
01:48:18,033 --> 01:48:20,411
Or the farm?

1279
01:48:23,247 --> 01:48:26,083
I won't interfere with your love life.

1280
01:48:26,208 --> 01:48:29,253
You can sleep with anyone you want...

1281
01:48:31,505 --> 01:48:34,425
Except for twice a week.

1282
01:48:37,177 --> 01:48:40,055
You're wonderful.

1283
01:48:42,057 --> 01:48:45,519
I won't let you go, even if it kills me.

1284
01:48:48,397 --> 01:48:50,441
Stay with me,

1285
01:48:50,566 --> 01:48:53,902
and I'll make you happy
as long as you want.

1286
01:48:58,949 --> 01:49:04,913
You've only seen
the surface of happiness.

1287
01:49:05,748 --> 01:49:11,795
I'll show you the real depths.

1288
01:49:11,920 --> 01:49:16,091
I'll buy anything for you,
do anything for you.

1289
01:49:17,384 --> 01:49:20,179
Nobuko, which will it be?

1290
01:49:40,407 --> 01:49:41,950
The boutique.

1291
01:49:44,411 --> 01:49:47,372
I'll give up the farm
and take the shop.

1292
01:49:47,498 --> 01:49:49,792
- Really?
- Yes, really.

1293
01:49:50,834 --> 01:49:54,713
But I have to go back
and see yoshiji once more.

1294
01:49:54,838 --> 01:49:58,842
I have to give him the money I promised
and explain things.

1295
01:49:58,967 --> 01:50:02,346
That's fine, but can't you just
write to him?

1296
01:50:02,471 --> 01:50:05,849
No way.
I have to talk to him face-to-face.

1297
01:50:07,601 --> 01:50:09,228
Let's do this...

1298
01:50:10,354 --> 01:50:14,108
I'll give you half now, 100,000 yen.

1299
01:50:14,233 --> 01:50:18,237
Then we'll send him the other half
when you get back to Tokyo.

1300
01:50:18,362 --> 01:50:20,280
You're so stingy, papa!

1301
01:50:20,405 --> 01:50:22,866
I'm not, I'm just worried.

1302
01:50:24,368 --> 01:50:27,830
It's only because I love you so much.

1303
01:50:37,881 --> 01:50:40,592
All right. We'll do that.

1304
01:50:42,010 --> 01:50:43,428
Nobuko!

1305
01:50:46,181 --> 01:50:49,893
You'll be a happy woman at last.

1306
01:50:50,018 --> 01:50:52,020
I love you, papa.

1307
01:51:13,041 --> 01:51:14,835
I'm sorry, papa!

1308
01:51:18,881 --> 01:51:22,092
You sure you got through to her?

1309
01:51:22,217 --> 01:51:26,471
Yes. We had a long talk that night.

1310
01:51:26,597 --> 01:51:32,936
And you told her to let you handle it
after I hand the money over to you?

1311
01:51:33,061 --> 01:51:36,231
Sorry, sometimes I'm just
a country bumpkin.

1312
01:51:37,232 --> 01:51:39,568
I hate getting old.

1313
01:51:39,693 --> 01:51:43,155
Used and hung out to dry
by a young girl.

1314
01:51:45,240 --> 01:51:46,867
On top of that,

1315
01:51:48,243 --> 01:51:50,120
when I went to pay the rent,

1316
01:51:50,245 --> 01:51:53,332
her landlord asked me
where the deposit was.

1317
01:51:53,457 --> 01:51:57,753
That means she ran off
with the 100,000 yen.

1318
01:51:58,921 --> 01:52:01,173
I don't know how she managed
to wangle that.

1319
01:52:01,298 --> 01:52:03,467
That girl's really something.

1320
01:52:05,344 --> 01:52:09,264
While I was still reeling from that,
this arrived.

1321
01:52:12,100 --> 01:52:15,062
"Papa, I couldn't tell you
because I felt so bad,

1322
01:52:15,187 --> 01:52:18,106
"but this is just a loan.
I'll pay it all back."

1323
01:52:19,983 --> 01:52:21,818
I hate getting old.

1324
01:52:21,944 --> 01:52:25,072
I'm lost for words.

1325
01:52:25,197 --> 01:52:27,199
You're no better.

1326
01:52:27,324 --> 01:52:30,786
You should try to talk
some sense into her.

1327
01:52:30,911 --> 01:52:37,876
Sorry, but I did plead with her
to come back in two or three days.

1328
01:52:38,001 --> 01:52:40,003
But it's been two months!

1329
01:52:41,004 --> 01:52:43,131
I'm really sorry.

1330
01:52:44,299 --> 01:52:49,388
Now that I'm working as a cleaning lady,
I'm always tired.

1331
01:52:49,513 --> 01:52:54,101
When I get back home,
I'm just exhausted.

1332
01:52:54,226 --> 01:52:56,228
I'm in love with that girl.

1333
01:52:58,522 --> 01:53:01,066
An old man's delusion.

1334
01:53:01,191 --> 01:53:03,986
An old man's perverted escapade.

1335
01:53:08,991 --> 01:53:11,451
I couldn't care less what people say.

1336
01:53:14,830 --> 01:53:18,875
By the way, I put a deposit
on the dogenzaka shop too.

1337
01:53:19,001 --> 01:53:22,337
I'm a businessman,
I'd hate to lose that money.

1338
01:53:24,756 --> 01:53:27,926
That kanbayashi fellow
knew nothing about me, right?

1339
01:53:29,678 --> 01:53:31,513
Supposing he found out?

1340
01:53:31,638 --> 01:53:35,726
What would he do, if he found out
about me and nobuko?

1341
01:53:35,851 --> 01:53:37,561
I guess he'd...

1342
01:53:37,686 --> 01:53:40,522
I'll pay yourfare.
Will you go right away?

1343
01:53:40,647 --> 01:53:42,232
All right.

1344
01:53:42,357 --> 01:53:44,234
Right away.

1345
01:53:44,359 --> 01:53:47,946
With every passing day,
she becomes more of a hillbilly,

1346
01:53:48,071 --> 01:53:50,032
and I get older.

1347
01:53:51,033 --> 01:53:54,202
I'll bring her back for you, daddy.

1348
01:53:55,203 --> 01:53:57,080
I'll think of a way.

1349
01:53:59,166 --> 01:54:01,460
You should join,
it's a good thing.

1350
01:54:02,711 --> 01:54:04,338
How much is it?

1351
01:54:04,463 --> 01:54:07,883
Don't be daft, the pure land sect
doesn't take money.

1352
01:54:09,551 --> 01:54:12,387
You just buy these when you join,

1353
01:54:12,512 --> 01:54:14,765
and their newspaper once a week.

1354
01:54:14,890 --> 01:54:17,893
- How much is all that?
- Not much at all.

1355
01:54:19,061 --> 01:54:20,604
Think I should?

1356
01:54:20,729 --> 01:54:23,273
Absolutely. It really works.

1357
01:54:23,398 --> 01:54:27,527
You go and tell them everything,
and you feel great afterwards. Really!

1358
01:54:29,613 --> 01:54:32,574
Because life's such a bitch!

1359
01:54:35,869 --> 01:54:38,288
- Time for a bath.
- Go on.

1360
01:54:39,873 --> 01:54:42,501
- Don't bother with that.
- It's all right.

1361
01:54:43,251 --> 01:54:47,214
- How about it, then?
- I'll think about it.

1362
01:54:47,339 --> 01:54:50,300
Thanks for the delicious rice cakes.

1363
01:54:50,425 --> 01:54:52,552
- Take some home.
- That's okay.

1364
01:54:54,429 --> 01:54:56,098
Hey, come here.

1365
01:54:57,557 --> 01:55:01,353
- I know a good job.
- What kind ofjob? Cleaning?

1366
01:55:03,230 --> 01:55:04,815
No, no!

1367
01:55:04,940 --> 01:55:08,026
Much easier and much better money.

1368
01:55:08,151 --> 01:55:10,987
Sounds good. What is it?

1369
01:55:11,113 --> 01:55:13,365
I'll tell you later. After your bath.

1370
01:55:13,490 --> 01:55:16,535
- I can't wait to hear. Call me later.
- I will.

1371
01:55:39,266 --> 01:55:42,269
I've settled down since you died.

1372
01:55:43,687 --> 01:55:46,398
But now nobuko's left me too.

1373
01:55:47,524 --> 01:55:50,485
I still have a lot of suffering to do.

1374
01:55:52,779 --> 01:55:55,490
Please lend me your strength.

1375
01:55:58,285 --> 01:56:01,371
I'll bring nobuko back
into the fold somehow.

1376
01:56:03,206 --> 01:56:07,002
Then life will be a little easier.

1377
01:56:08,336 --> 01:56:11,131
And the three of us will be together.

1378
01:56:17,012 --> 01:56:19,181
Well, I'm off for a bath.

1379
01:56:22,309 --> 01:56:25,187
O-wa-i-ya-re

1380
01:56:27,814 --> 01:56:30,859
I need some small change.

1381
01:56:45,415 --> 01:56:49,336
I hate the bath house
being so far away.

1382
01:57:13,276 --> 01:57:14,819
Nobuko!

1383
01:57:18,365 --> 01:57:20,367
Where's yoshiji?

1384
01:57:21,660 --> 01:57:25,497
- Isn't he at the house?
- No. Where could he be?

1385
01:57:25,622 --> 01:57:29,626
He said he might go into town.
Nothing to worry about.

1386
01:57:29,751 --> 01:57:34,798
But the calcium arrived,
and I don't know how much to use.

1387
01:57:35,590 --> 01:57:38,885
Ah, there he is.
I'll head back to the barn.

1388
01:57:39,010 --> 01:57:40,971
Okay, I'll wait.

1389
01:58:04,911 --> 01:58:07,747
- Where did you go?
- Nowhere.

1390
01:58:08,707 --> 01:58:10,667
Asao's looking for you.

1391
01:58:12,836 --> 01:58:14,296
Listen...

1392
01:58:15,880 --> 01:58:17,507
I was wrong.

1393
01:58:17,632 --> 01:58:21,177
Yeah, you were, wondering
who the baby's father was.

1394
01:58:21,303 --> 01:58:24,014
- Will you stop it now?
- Yeah.

1395
01:58:27,726 --> 01:58:29,436
Let me drive.

1396
01:58:40,905 --> 01:58:45,535
Nobuko, take good care of the baby.
We can't lose it.

1397
01:58:46,911 --> 01:58:49,956
You don't know whose it is.
What's it matter?

1398
01:58:50,081 --> 01:58:53,793
But it might be mine, right?

1399
01:58:53,918 --> 01:58:58,673
You're such an idiot!
Still saying "it might be"?

1400
01:58:59,924 --> 01:59:02,135
Well, I don't know
what I don't know.

1401
01:59:02,260 --> 01:59:05,930
You may not know, but I do.

1402
01:59:09,142 --> 01:59:11,353
I said I know!

1403
01:59:52,977 --> 01:59:54,854
Takasaki station has the best chicken.

1404
01:59:54,979 --> 01:59:59,609
Yeah, but utsunomiya's
isn't bad either.

1405
01:59:59,734 --> 02:00:01,986
It's always been that way.

1406
02:00:02,112 --> 02:00:05,448
Takasaki's was the best
even before the war.

1407
02:00:05,573 --> 02:00:08,785
All the stations have
better lunch boxes these days.

1408
02:00:08,910 --> 02:00:12,622
- It's the rice.
- Yeah, the harvests are good.

1409
02:00:12,747 --> 02:00:15,959
- It's true.
- I'm not very experienced.

1410
02:00:16,084 --> 02:00:19,337
No, / can see that you are.

1411
02:00:45,155 --> 02:00:47,157
Damn it.

1412
02:00:48,783 --> 02:00:50,952
Godforsaken place!

1413
02:00:53,288 --> 02:00:54,789
That idiot!

1414
02:01:04,090 --> 02:01:05,842
What the...?

1415
02:01:29,032 --> 02:01:32,410
Just my luck,
on top of everything else!

1416
02:01:35,705 --> 02:01:41,544
Where, oh where
has the bab y-sitter gone?

1417
02:01:42,337 --> 02:01:48,843
She went to town to buya dog...
