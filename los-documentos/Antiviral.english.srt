29

- S-558?
- Yes.

47
00:05:15,691 --> 00:05:18,729
A form of the herpes simplex virus.

48
00:05:18,903 --> 00:05:23,696
After infection, the virus lives on
in the cells of its host

for the rest of their life.

122
00:13:32,271 --> 00:13:36,899
The human face is a powerful messenger.

123
00:13:37,068 --> 00:13:40,901
Our brains are tuned
to its every nuance.

124
00:13:41,072 --> 00:13:43,196
The smallest shift in its musculature

125
00:13:43,366 --> 00:13:47,495
can translate itself
into complex nonverbal information,

126
00:13:47,662 --> 00:13:51,032
so subtle and communicated so quickly

127
00:13:51,207 --> 00:13:54,410
that we often don't even register it,
not consciously.

128
00:13:55,628 --> 00:13:57,669
One could say that for human beings,

129
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:03,214
the face is a structure
with a high-information resolution.

130
00:14:03,386 --> 00:14:05,344
The ready face console is designed

131
00:14:05,513 --> 00:14:08,965
to engage the user's
unconscious mental resources

132
00:14:09,141 --> 00:14:14,350
by exploiting the brain's sensitivity
to facial patterns.

133
00:14:14,522 --> 00:14:17,477
Our technician
loads a virus sample into the port,

134
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:23,985
where it's analysed by readyface
and is translated into a face graphic.

135
00:14:24,157 --> 00:14:27,242
This image represents
the structure of the disease.

136
00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:32,951
It is in a sense the face of the virus,
dense with information.

137
00:14:33,124 --> 00:14:35,995
As mr march manipulates the graphic,

138
00:14:36,169 --> 00:14:39,206
the machine manipulates the virus
in the sample container,

139
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:42,880
eventually rendering it noncontagious.

140
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:45,803
This advanced form of copy protection

141
00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:49,257
affords us control
over the distribution of our products,

142
00:14:49,432 --> 00:14:52,968
as the virus cannot spread
beyond the infected client.

143
00:14:55,021 --> 00:14:56,765
Readyface fluidly incorporates

144
00:14:56,939 --> 00:15:00,392
our technician's
unconscious mental resources

145
00:15:00,568 --> 00:15:04,104
so that copy protecting
a sample like this one

146
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:07,152
will take hours rather than days.

No, she has to have special underwear

00:15:41,359 --> 00:15:46,187
Factual? Yesterday her birth defect
was a unique, nonfunctional organ

160
00:15:46,364 --> 00:15:47,907
connected to her urinary system.

161
00:15:48,074 --> 00:15:50,114
It's worth millions
on the celebrity meat market.

162
00:15:50,284 --> 00:15:51,448
Yeah, also true.

163
00:15:51,619 --> 00:15:53,914
I'm sure the kid could shed some light
on the situation.

164
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:57,117
Didn't you take a genital wart sample
from Hannah geist once?

165
00:15:57,291 --> 00:16:00,911
- That was Derek.
- Did he mention if she had a vulva?

166
00:16:03,965 --> 00:16:06,504
We're doing lunch at dainty Davis.
You coming?

167
00:16:06,676 --> 00:16:08,669
[March] I already ate.

168
00:16:12,390 --> 00:16:14,383
You look like shit.

169
00:16:19,272 --> 00:16:22,108
- Hi, Michelle.
- Hey, Syd. What can I get for you?

170
00:16:22,275 --> 00:16:25,193
183, 644 and 915.

171
00:16:25,361 --> 00:16:28,030
- 915?
- The new Aria noble flu.

172
00:16:28,197 --> 00:16:30,191
We got it this morning.

173
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,153
So we did.

174
00:16:49,802 --> 00:16:51,796
Thank you.

175
00:16:53,848 --> 00:16:55,842
Derek.

176
00:17:04,901 --> 00:17:07,653
[March] I understand
your fascination with her.

177
00:17:08,988 --> 00:17:11,397
I understand completely. She's...

178
00:17:11,574 --> 00:17:13,568
[Sighs]

179
00:17:13,743 --> 00:17:17,576
Perfect somehow, isn't she?

180
00:17:18,831 --> 00:17:20,741
More than perfect.

181
00:17:20,917 --> 00:17:23,456
An ideal.

182
00:17:23,628 --> 00:17:25,502
Overwhelming.

183
00:17:26,172 --> 00:17:30,799
With a whisper, she could have
anything she wanted.

184
00:17:32,637 --> 00:17:34,630
Anyone she wanted.

185
00:17:39,519 --> 00:17:44,478
I'm happy to inform you that we have
something special available today.

186
00:17:46,526 --> 00:17:48,519
It just came in this morning.

187
00:17:51,155 --> 00:17:53,149
S-915.

188
00:17:54,450 --> 00:17:56,444
You would be the first.

189
00:17:57,286 --> 00:18:01,996
A biological communion
between you and Aria.

190
00:18:02,166 --> 00:18:04,789
From her body to your body.

191
00:18:05,753 --> 00:18:08,791
From her cells to your cells.

192
00:18:09,966 --> 00:18:11,959
In my humble opinion...

193
00:18:14,136 --> 00:18:16,130
it's not even a question.

194
00:18:25,606 --> 00:18:27,600
Just a little pinch.

195
00:18:37,076 --> 00:18:40,411
The fever should come on
just in time for the long weekend.

196
00:18:50,131 --> 00:18:52,124
Enjoy.

197
00:19:31,923 --> 00:19:33,963
Are you carrying
any infectious material with you

198
00:19:34,133 --> 00:19:38,179
or items belonging to the Lucas clinic
incorporated or its suppliers?

199
00:19:38,346 --> 00:19:40,802
No.

200
00:20:14,924 --> 00:20:17,463
Next. Who's ne... ok.

201
00:20:17,635 --> 00:20:19,961
Geist, ok, yeah.

202
00:20:22,265 --> 00:20:25,635
Ok, what are we... like we're talking
like a roast for two people?

203
00:20:26,853 --> 00:20:27,885
This is good.

204
00:20:33,442 --> 00:20:35,436
Hello, sir. What can I get you?

205
00:20:44,787 --> 00:20:46,781
I've been trying to reach you.

206
00:20:48,791 --> 00:20:50,785
I was sick.

207
00:20:55,173 --> 00:20:58,708
I think my body's
starting to turn on me, arvid.

208
00:20:58,885 --> 00:21:01,127
I don't know how much longer
I can do this.

209
00:21:01,304 --> 00:21:02,585
You'll be fine.

210
00:21:02,763 --> 00:21:05,801
There's an ebb and flow
to this kind of work.

211
00:21:07,268 --> 00:21:11,267
Give it a month and you'll feel like
a completely different person.

212
00:21:11,439 --> 00:21:15,272
I already feel like a different person.
I'm developing a cripple identity.

213
00:21:16,944 --> 00:21:19,946
- [Arvid] I think you look great.
- Thanks.

214
00:21:22,492 --> 00:21:25,410
I don't understand
how this isn't considered cannibalism.

215
00:21:25,578 --> 00:21:27,702
Well, these are just muscle cells.

216
00:21:27,872 --> 00:21:31,621
It all depends on whether the human
being is found in its materials.

217
00:21:31,792 --> 00:21:36,870
Right now the law tends towards
something more religious,

218
00:21:37,048 --> 00:21:41,177
but we'll see what happens when we go
from growing celebrity cell steaks

219
00:21:41,344 --> 00:21:44,346
to growing complete celebrity bodies.

220
00:21:45,598 --> 00:21:47,342
I'm looking forward to it.

221
00:21:47,517 --> 00:21:51,515
And with the proper funding,
I could probably make that happen.

222
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:56,897
- Have you seen my cell garden?
- No.

223
00:22:05,243 --> 00:22:07,699
[Arvid] Something new
I've been cooking up.

224
00:22:15,211 --> 00:22:17,205
So do we have business?

225
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:21,334
Yeah.

226
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:24,134
Yeah. I, uh...

227
00:22:25,972 --> 00:22:28,298
I cracked the new Aria noble flu.

228
00:22:28,474 --> 00:22:31,761
- It's already public.
- What?

229
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:35,804
Since Saturday. You're behind the times.

230
00:22:35,982 --> 00:22:39,233
- The clinic just got it last week.
- Well, somebody beat you to the punch.

231
00:22:39,402 --> 00:22:42,273
- Who?
- One of my other guys.

232
00:22:42,446 --> 00:22:44,025
Arvid.

233
00:22:44,198 --> 00:22:47,615
Look, I'm not
some bug-collecting hobbyist.

234
00:22:47,785 --> 00:22:50,075
You wanna get paid for your work,

235
00:22:50,246 --> 00:22:52,703
talk to me
when you stop getting scooped.

236
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:13,094
[Low voices]

237
00:23:25,198 --> 00:23:27,606
What's going on?

238
00:23:27,783 --> 00:23:29,409
They arrested Derek.

239
00:23:29,577 --> 00:23:33,492
Villainy in our own house, Syd. I simply
cannot work under these conditions.

240
00:23:33,664 --> 00:23:35,623
Like anyone would take you.

241
00:23:35,791 --> 00:23:37,915
I hear vole & tesser are hiring.

242
00:23:38,085 --> 00:23:40,923
Topp didn't even know about Sara
holden's skin flap until I told him.

243
00:23:41,005 --> 00:23:44,126
I'm sure the kid doesn't know about
Sara holden's skin flap right now.

244
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:46,874
You're too good for skin flaps,
aren't you, Syd?

245
00:23:47,053 --> 00:23:49,260
Skin flaps are beneath you.

246
00:23:51,974 --> 00:23:56,103
Is there anything else you need? No?

247
00:23:58,272 --> 00:24:02,769
[Lucas] Did you know that healthy tulips
have solid-coloured petals?

248
00:24:02,944 --> 00:24:07,903
The stripes on this flower
are caused by a viral infection.

249
00:24:08,074 --> 00:24:10,743
[March] I had heard that, yes.

250
00:24:13,621 --> 00:24:15,745
Mm.

251
00:24:15,915 --> 00:24:17,909
Ok.

252
00:24:21,754 --> 00:24:23,748
It's a weird business, Syd.

253
00:24:26,843 --> 00:24:28,421
Do you know Derek Lessing?

254
00:24:30,012 --> 00:24:32,006
Not well.

255
00:24:33,391 --> 00:24:37,436
Well, the police found
an unlicensed readyface console

256
00:24:37,603 --> 00:24:40,012
in his apartment today.

257
00:24:40,189 --> 00:24:43,061
An older model, a 35-50.

258
00:24:43,234 --> 00:24:48,858
They think he was undoing the copy
protection on some of our samples

259
00:24:49,031 --> 00:24:53,279
and then selling the contagious viruses
to a piracy group.

260
00:24:53,452 --> 00:24:57,665
- Jesus.
- That machine is registered to us.

261
00:24:58,666 --> 00:25:02,083
I guess he must have smuggled it
out of the store room or something.

262
00:25:02,253 --> 00:25:04,045
So I had Michelle run an inventory

263
00:25:04,213 --> 00:25:08,544
and she discovered that there was
a second machine that's gone missing.

264
00:25:09,802 --> 00:25:13,468
Will you let me know
if you hear anything at all?

265
00:25:13,639 --> 00:25:15,099
Of course.

266
00:25:17,476 --> 00:25:19,933
I'm gonna send you
on a house call today.

267
00:25:20,104 --> 00:25:22,181
You're going to see Hannah geist.

268
00:25:22,356 --> 00:25:25,560
She's sick, she's at the mayerson
and she's eager to sell.

269
00:25:25,735 --> 00:25:29,520
Now, normally
I'd be sending Derek on this,

270
00:25:29,697 --> 00:25:33,197
so be tactful if the subject comes up.

271
00:25:34,285 --> 00:25:36,279
Yes, sir.

272

273
00:25:51,636 --> 00:25:54,673
Wait inside.
They'll call you when they're ready.

274
00:26:21,749 --> 00:26:24,039
I didn't know vole & tesser was here.

275
00:26:28,005 --> 00:26:32,752
You do know the Hannah geist line
is exclusive to Lucas?

276
00:26:32,927 --> 00:26:36,546
Sure. She's all you have going for you.

277
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:42,602
I hear she's worth more
than your entire catalogue.

278
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:45,973
I've never really cared for her.

279
00:26:47,859 --> 00:26:49,852
Why are you here?

280
00:26:50,027 --> 00:26:52,519
Gregory vern.

281
00:26:52,697 --> 00:26:54,904
Terminal illness?

282
00:26:55,074 --> 00:26:58,361
It's for mr vole's personal collection.

283
00:26:58,536 --> 00:27:00,530
He has a license.

Where's Derek?

286
00:27:21,809 --> 00:27:24,811
He called in sick. My name is Syd march.

287
00:27:27,857 --> 00:27:29,851
Shh.

288
00:29:59,217 --> 00:30:01,294
Tell Dorian we'll be in touch.

289
00:31:36,898 --> 00:31:40,896
[March] She's perfect somehow,
isn't she?

290
00:31:43,529 --> 00:31:45,523
More than perfect.

291
00:31:48,326 --> 00:31:50,319
More than human.

00:31:53,498 --> 00:31:55,954

00:31:58,002 --> 00:31:59,663

294
00:32:03,549 --> 00:32:07,085
Sorry. Excuse me for a moment.

295
00:32:13,184 --> 00:32:16,020
Whoa, hey.
Whoa. What is wrong with you?

296
00:32:16,187 --> 00:32:18,679
I need to go.

297
00:32:18,856 --> 00:32:21,099
Can you finish? Please?

I didn't get the other guy's name.

And now they're saying it's a virus
that she picked up in China.

319
00:38:54,001 --> 00:38:57,003
But her family
will not let them autopsy the body

320
00:38:57,171 --> 00:39:00,541
until they fly over a specialist
from Munich.

321
00:39:01,843 --> 00:39:03,717
Autopsy?

322
00:39:03,886 --> 00:39:07,256
Well, they want their own doctor.
They're German.

323
00:39:14,897 --> 00:39:17,187
Hey!

324
00:39:17,358 --> 00:39:19,527
- You get in line.
- [Man] Everyone listen carefully!

325
00:39:19,652 --> 00:39:22,488
We're cutting our last tray
of Hannah geist for the day.

326
00:39:22,655 --> 00:39:24,908
If you get a ticket,
you can buy one three-ounce steak.

327
00:39:25,074 --> 00:39:27,613
If you don't get a ticket,
you have to come back tomorrow.

328
00:39:27,785 --> 00:39:30,194
- Is arvid around?
- Yeah, he's in the back.

329
00:39:36,085 --> 00:39:39,954
[Arvid] Are you aware
they're still growing the cancer cells

330
00:39:40,131 --> 00:39:43,168
of a woman who died in the 1950s,
henrietta lacks?

331
00:39:43,342 --> 00:39:47,009
Yeah, they use them for research.

332
00:39:47,180 --> 00:39:52,056
So these cells of hers are alive

333
00:39:52,226 --> 00:39:55,098
and multiplying all over the world.

334
00:39:56,772 --> 00:40:00,059
The afterlife is getting
extremely perverse.

335
00:40:00,234 --> 00:40:02,857
What happened to Hannah geist?

336
00:40:03,029 --> 00:40:05,318
You don't know?

337
00:40:05,490 --> 00:40:08,195
I think I was asleep.

338
00:40:08,367 --> 00:40:13,873
She was sick for about a week.
Nothing serious.

339
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:16,746
Then this morning
one of her aides found her dead.

340
00:40:18,711 --> 00:40:22,792
She was in China looking at orphans,

341
00:40:22,965 --> 00:40:25,837
but none of her entourage
are having any problems,

342
00:40:26,010 --> 00:40:29,878
so they don't know what it is she had
or how it was communicated.

343
00:40:30,056 --> 00:40:33,805
It's quite an ordeal for the family.

344
00:40:33,976 --> 00:40:38,770
This all must feel
a bit personal to you.

345
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:40,020
How so?

346
00:40:40,191 --> 00:40:44,486
Well, you were one of the last people
to see her alive.

347
00:40:46,072 --> 00:40:49,074
- Where'd you hear that?
- I have big ears.

348
00:40:52,453 --> 00:40:55,076
I was hoping
that's why you came to see me.

349
00:40:56,332 --> 00:40:58,326
Sorry to disappoint.

350
00:40:59,210 --> 00:41:01,038
That's too bad,

351
00:41:01,212 --> 00:41:05,626
because that virus would be
the holy grail while this heat lasts.

352
00:41:07,134 --> 00:41:10,302
Is there any chance
you can get me a taste?

353
00:41:10,471 --> 00:41:15,181
I wish. We can't hold deadly pathogens.

354
00:41:15,351 --> 00:41:17,510
I'm sure the health board
already took everything.

355
00:41:17,687 --> 00:41:22,480
Yeah? What about you? You look sick.

356
00:41:22,650 --> 00:41:24,774
I am sick.

357
00:41:26,279 --> 00:41:30,906
Listen, my console's down.
You know anybody with parts to spare?

358
00:41:31,075 --> 00:41:33,365
Maybe.

359
00:41:33,536 --> 00:41:39,243
The antipiracy lobby is fairly insane
right now, so everyone's paranoid.

360
00:41:41,002 --> 00:41:43,754
- I need a new 80-box.
- I'll see what I can do.

361
00:41:44,964 --> 00:41:47,041
Hey. Hey, hey.

362
00:41:47,216 --> 00:41:49,424
Is it true they arrested Derek Lessing?

363
00:41:49,594 --> 00:41:51,801
Yeah.

364
00:41:51,971 --> 00:41:55,507
That's too bad.
He did some really good work for me.

365
00:41:56,392 --> 00:41:59,976
Here, have some Hannah.
On the house.

366
00:42:28,216 --> 00:42:30,968
<i>[Lucas] There is less light</i>
<i>in the world now.</i>

367
00:42:31,135 --> 00:42:33,627
<i>That much is certain.</i>

368
00:42:33,804 --> 00:42:37,056
<i>A ray of light has been lost.</i>

369
00:42:38,309 --> 00:42:41,015
<i>Hannah was a friend of this clinic,</i>

370
00:42:41,187 --> 00:42:44,723
<i>and I'm proud to say</i>
<i>I knew her personally.</i>

371
00:42:44,899 --> 00:42:49,895
<i>She was truly a sweet and a humble soul.</i>

372
00:42:50,071 --> 00:42:54,319
<i>Our prayers here at Lucas</i>
<i>are with her family and loved ones.</i>

373
00:42:57,662 --> 00:43:00,617
- So what's your professional opinion?
- What?

374
00:43:00,790 --> 00:43:02,542
Well, you must have had
a good look at her.

375
00:43:02,667 --> 00:43:05,953
We've got a pre-autopsy pool
going with the guys in accounting.

376
00:43:06,128 --> 00:43:09,214
Mercer's playing it safe
and going with flu virus.

377
00:43:09,382 --> 00:43:12,467
I'm thinking of taking a flyer
and going with food poisoning.

378
00:43:12,635 --> 00:43:15,209
Do you think
it might have been food poisoning?

379
00:43:15,388 --> 00:43:17,547
I don't know.

380
00:43:17,723 --> 00:43:20,975
Of course, no one's saying drugs.
They'll never admit it if it is drugs.

381
00:43:21,143 --> 00:43:24,181
- She didn't do drugs.
- Oh, you knew her well?

382
00:43:24,355 --> 00:43:25,684
She was a Buddhist from birth.

383
00:43:25,857 --> 00:43:28,526
She couldn't even take painkillers
or she would have been beaten.

384
00:43:28,693 --> 00:43:32,905
I hear we'll be selling ringworm
from her dog brom to fans with dogs.

385
00:43:33,072 --> 00:43:35,564
Brom's getting a following.

386
00:43:35,741 --> 00:43:39,443
Hey, Dorian turned your sample over
to the board this morning.

387
00:43:39,620 --> 00:43:44,663
That's a bit exciting, our little shop
on the fringes of a media frenzy.

388
00:43:47,503 --> 00:43:50,256
Can I have a 900 pack?

389
00:43:50,423 --> 00:43:52,381
What's a 900 pack?

390
00:43:52,550 --> 00:43:54,709
Hannah geist variety pack.

391
00:43:54,886 --> 00:43:57,259
Everybody's guzzling geist today.

392
00:43:58,931 --> 00:44:00,640
<i>[Woman] Everyone's talking about her...</i>

393
00:44:00,808 --> 00:44:02,728
<i>Oh, my gosh.</i>
<i>I don't even know if I can say it.</i>

394
00:44:02,768 --> 00:44:04,727
<i>Her anus. You heard that right.</i>

395
00:44:04,896 --> 00:44:09,060
<i>Rumours of the young star's situation</i>
<i>have been spreading like a rash,</i>

396
00:44:09,233 --> 00:44:12,686
<i>with news outlets as far as Japan,</i>
<i>Australia and even the middle east</i>

403
00:44:30,379 --> 00:44:32,539
<i>[Man] Well, that settles it.</i>
<i>I'm getting a camera.</i>

404

<i>- [Woman] You would do that.</i>
<i>- The hunt is on.</i>

405

00:44:45,394 --> 00:44:47,768
<i>and caused quite a stir earlier today</i>

409

412
00:44:58,241 --> 00:44:59,950
[March groans]

413
00:45:06,999 --> 00:45:11,330
- What's with the cane?
- I've been having a little trouble.

414
00:45:11,504 --> 00:45:14,340
I've gotta make a quick stop
before we get your part.

415
00:45:32,942 --> 00:45:36,394
[Man] It must have happened overnight.
We found them like this in the morning.

416
00:45:36,571 --> 00:45:38,648
[Arvid] I've never seen anything
like this before.

417
00:45:38,823 --> 00:45:40,616
I mean, they were fine
when we shipped them.

418
00:45:40,783 --> 00:45:45,576
Obviously they weren't fine.
You sold me bad meat.

419
00:45:45,746 --> 00:45:47,705
Well, are your trays clean?

420
00:45:47,874 --> 00:45:50,662
Don't fuck with me, arvid.
Don't you even fuck with me.

421
00:45:50,835 --> 00:45:54,335
- [Arvid] Ok. I'm sorry, Luc.
- [Luc] I can't serve this.

422
00:45:54,505 --> 00:45:57,626
They think they're getting Hannah geist
and I'm feeding them Ron deggy.

423
00:45:57,800 --> 00:46:02,178
[Arvid] Ok. I'm gonna find out
what happened and I'm gonna fix it.

424
00:46:03,890 --> 00:46:06,298
So do I get to know what's killing you?

425
00:46:08,227 --> 00:46:11,146
An antique Michael Felix bug
I sold the other day.

426
00:46:13,399 --> 00:46:14,894
It was a mistake.

427
00:46:15,067 --> 00:46:18,322
Apparently the copy protection on some
of those old samples got a little weird,

428
00:46:18,404 --> 00:46:21,073
but I didn't think
I'd get another chance.

429
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:23,281
Sounds reckless.

430
00:46:23,451 --> 00:46:26,488
I'm just trying to keep things
interesting for myself.

431
00:46:46,933 --> 00:46:48,973
- For two?
- Is levine around?

432
00:46:49,143 --> 00:46:52,181
Sure, he's in the back.
I'll let him know you're coming.

433
00:47:25,847 --> 00:47:28,599
You'll like levine.
He's one of my best guys.

434
00:47:47,451 --> 00:47:50,786
I just wanna make sure
he's comfortable with all this.

435
00:47:50,955 --> 00:47:52,949
Hang out here.

<i>Do you...</i>
<i>Do you want me to hurt myself?</i>

<i>I can't say no to you.</i>

<i>Please repeat yourself</i>

<i>Please.</i>

00:49:48,614 --> 00:49:52,115
<i>- Are you still there?</i>
- All right, let's go.

453
00:49:52,285 --> 00:49:54,741
- What is this thing?
<i>- I can't take it any more!</i>

454
00:49:54,912 --> 00:49:57,666
It's part of a new franchise.
Levine has the only location in town.

455
00:49:57,748 --> 00:50:01,996
<i>- Tell me what to do. I'll do anything.</i>
- It's catching on, though.

456
00:50:02,170 --> 00:50:05,421
- Come on.
<i>- I'll do anything.</i>

457
00:50:06,757 --> 00:50:08,466
<i>Please.</i>

[Sighs]

463
00:50:51,511 --> 00:50:54,133
It's always strange
to meet the competition.

464
00:50:58,309 --> 00:51:02,723
So arvid here tells me that
you actually work at the Lucas clinic.

465
00:51:02,897 --> 00:51:04,476
Yeah.

466
00:51:06,651 --> 00:51:09,937
I think one of your friends

Really? Yeah,
vera brings me bugs sometimes.

468
00:51:12,782 --> 00:51:16,448
So that's kind of cool, huh?
You're like an inside man.

469
00:51:16,619 --> 00:51:18,945
I think I'd be too contemptuous
to play that game.

470
00:51:19,121 --> 00:51:22,492
Oh, yeah. Levine's too classy
to profit from such trash.

471
00:51:22,667 --> 00:51:24,210
[Levine] I'm talking about politics.

472
00:51:24,377 --> 00:51:27,414
I get that we're all rat men here,
arvid, scavenging the bin.

473
00:51:29,590 --> 00:51:32,841
But I like to think that my work
is purposefully gross at least.

00:51:33,010 --> 00:51:35,253
Allows me to hoard
a little dignity somewhere.

475
00:51:35,429 --> 00:51:40,306
No of fence. I don't even think
dignity's still valid currency.

476
00:51:41,644 --> 00:51:43,721
I appreciate you
helping me out like this.

Where'd you get this?

480
00:51:56,826 --> 00:52:00,575
I built it using old parts I co-opted
from a contact at vole & tesser.

481
00:52:00,746 --> 00:52:02,824
I've been modifying it for years.

482
00:52:02,999 --> 00:52:06,416
The resolution is somewhere between
one of the new readyfaces and a 7-86.

483
00:52:06,586 --> 00:52:10,834
You, uh... wanna run your blood
through it right here?

484
00:52:14,802 --> 00:52:16,760
No, thank you.

00:52:20,558 --> 00:52:23,132
Yeah, that's fine.

486
00:52:23,311 --> 00:52:26,348
So I don't have your 80-box,
but I can get one within the week.

487
00:52:26,522 --> 00:52:28,812
- Arvid said you had one.
- I thought I did.

488
00:52:28,983 --> 00:52:32,068
Turns out none of my stuff
is compatible.

489
00:52:32,236 --> 00:52:34,563
Levine's all right.

Hey, I'm completely trustworthy,
all right?

491
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:39,692
I already know the guy
who can dig one up for me.

492
00:52:39,869 --> 00:52:41,204
As a sign of good faith, though,

493
00:52:41,370 --> 00:52:44,538
I would like to get your payment
out of the way while you're here.

00:52:47,084 --> 00:52:49,078
The sample.

00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:51,877
What sample?

497
00:52:54,133 --> 00:52:57,135
The sample. What the hell, arvid?

498
00:52:57,303 --> 00:53:00,139
I told levine you'd give us
a bit of that Hannah geist bug

499

[Arvid] Hey, you. You gonna faint?

00:53:59,991 --> 00:54:02,565
I hope you're not taking this
too personally.

506
00:54:03,703 --> 00:54:07,536
Well, I'll admit I was a little insulted

507
00:54:07,707 --> 00:54:10,115
when I found out
you weren't gonna share with me.

508
00:54:10,293 --> 00:54:12,867
Were you gonna shop it around?

509
00:54:13,045 --> 00:54:15,834
Did you just want this one
all to yourself?

510
00:54:18,134 --> 00:54:20,507
Ok.

511
00:54:20,678 --> 00:54:25,922
Listen, I understand
these are special circumstances.

512
00:54:26,100 --> 00:54:28,308
You and I both recognise that.

513
00:54:29,187 --> 00:54:30,516
When we're done here,

514
00:54:30,688 --> 00:54:35,896
I'll find you a doctor who will keep
your situation low profile.

515
00:54:37,111 --> 00:54:43,067
And then we'll get you fixed up...
And you can still work for me.

All right?

Your clock is counting down
at a maniac pace. You need a friend.

- [Levine] All done?
- Almost.

519
00:54:58,883 --> 00:55:02,419
I wouldn't mind grabbing
a bit of that rash for good measure.

520
00:55:06,933 --> 00:55:13,601
Now, I would love to do this properly
if you would just stop freaking out.

Hm.

526
00:56:35,938 --> 00:56:40,067
Did you hear she died in her sleep while
her boyfriend was in the other room?

527
00:56:40,234 --> 00:56:41,480
Then he got into bed

528
00:56:41,652 --> 00:56:44,903
and slept beside her body
the whole night without knowing.

529
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:50,700
Can you imagine what an ordeal
it must have been when he found out?

530
00:56:50,870 --> 00:56:53,113
I have no idea.

531
00:56:53,289 --> 00:56:54,582
Every night since I heard that,

532
00:56:54,707 --> 00:56:56,627
I've been touching my wife
before I go to sleep

533
00:56:56,709 --> 00:56:58,999
just to make sure she's still warm.

534
00:57:07,929 --> 00:57:09,922
Excuse me.

535
00:57:13,059 --> 00:57:15,052
Right.

- I'll have the calamari.

00:57:22,902 --> 00:57:26,153
- How about you?
- I'll have the calamari.

539
00:57:26,322 --> 00:57:28,316
Two calamaris.

540
00:57:30,743 --> 00:57:33,412
You're looking pretty sick.

My name's Portland and this is west,
and we're taking you to meet someone.

I'd rather not.

Are you planning
on being difficult about it?

No, I guess not.

548
00:58:00,606 --> 00:58:02,600
That would be for the best.

Don't look so worried.
You're a commodity.

Yes.

555

Ringing in your ears
or auditory hallucinations?

556

No.

No delusions of grandeur?

558
01:00:17,451 --> 01:00:20,074
You know, towards the end
of my grandmother's life,

559
01:00:20,246 --> 01:00:25,953
she imagined the entire world was
operating exclusively with her in mind.

560
01:00:26,127 --> 01:00:30,956
I was only a child at the time,
but I remember once I got off the toilet

561
01:00:31,132 --> 01:00:35,546
and she asked me what I had intended
to communicate to her.

562
01:00:35,720 --> 01:00:39,505
It was later discovered
she had a brain tumour.

563
01:00:42,894 --> 01:00:46,180
I've been told that Hannah's illness

564
01:00:46,355 --> 01:00:49,274
can produce florid hallucinations.

Ah, there he is.

566
01:01:10,421 --> 01:01:13,542
I think that virus destroyed my console.

567
01:01:13,716 --> 01:01:18,296
The virus was designed with
a security measure to prevent analysis.

568
01:01:18,471 --> 01:01:23,217
It took a little effort,
but I was eventually able to bypass it.

569
01:01:23,392 --> 01:01:26,727
- Designed?
- Yes.

570
01:01:26,896 --> 01:01:30,147

in something sinister.

[Woman] The death is a cover story,

01:03:47,995 --> 01:03:50,665
and we still don't have a cure.

591
01:03:50,832 --> 01:03:54,747
We have reason to believe that her
infection was an assassination attempt,

592
01:03:54,919 --> 01:03:58,336
and we felt this was the best way
to prevent a second attack.

This is all very unlucky for you,

The disease wasn't built from scratch.

It's a modification of something
we sold to your clinic three years ago.

596

We assume someone at Lucas created this,
and if you can find out who,

597
01:04:18,109 --> 01:04:21,775
it might be the first step
towards finding a cure for Hannah,

She needs your help.

Last night...
Hannah had a mild psychotic episode.

608
01:05:06,032 --> 01:05:11,454
For one hour she insisted that I was
her late publicist, maynard welsh.

609
01:05:12,872 --> 01:05:17,369
This has been in some ways
an uncomfortable experience for me.

610
01:05:17,543 --> 01:05:22,005
My interest in her, of course,
is more than professional.

611
01:05:24,592 --> 01:05:29,006
Here. There's a company in Munich
where they make these.

They're skin grafts,
grown from celebrity skin-cell samples.

This one here, this one is Hannah.

You know, I'm not a spiritual man.

615
01:05:48,825 --> 01:05:55,113
A belief in God, it's always struck me
as a sign of dangerous infantilism.

616
01:05:56,499 --> 01:05:59,869
But you will forgive me if I tell you

617

that with each of these patches,

618
01:06:04,674 --> 01:06:08,293
my world has become more charged,

619
01:06:10,054 --> 01:06:12,890
that there is a power,

620
01:06:13,057 --> 01:06:17,056
something in the thrall
of the collective eye

621
01:06:17,228 --> 01:06:20,645
that can be consumed and appropriated.

622
01:06:23,734 --> 01:06:26,820
You play the sceptic,
but I don't believe it.

623

Surely you could have stolen Hannah's

- Last two months.

She's a Professor

Now, she discovered that vole & tesser

had recently patented
a genetically modified virus.

736

It's quite likely the source
of Hannah's and your infection.

- A patent?
- Mm. What it means, it's unclear to me.

01:31:07,051 --> 01:31:11,548
Anyway, I just wanted to say I'm sorry
for the way you're being treated here.

780
01:31:12,932 --> 01:31:16,384
If it had been up to me,
we would have taken better care of you.

781

[Levine sighs]

782
01:31:18,479 --> 01:31:21,733
But we gotta get this thing finished and
on the market while people still care,

783
01:31:21,858 --> 01:31:24,563
otherwise there's no point.

784
01:31:25,444 --> 01:31:29,490
Besides, you owe me
for what you did to my rig.

<i>[Tesser] Please, call me mira.</i>

<i>[March]I understand completely.</i>

797
01:34:40,431 --> 01:34:43,219
<i>Such a brilliant little man, isn't he?</i>

798
01:34:43,392 --> 01:34:47,771
<i>Is there any way I can convince you</i>

799
01:34:47,939 --> 01:34:49,932
<i>[March]I'm afraid not.</i>

800
01:34:50,983 --> 01:34:53,226
<i>[Tesser] That's a shame.</i>

801
01:34:53,402 --> 01:34:56,321
<i>We could make you excitingly famous.</i>

802
01:34:59,992 --> 01:35:03,493
[March] I'd like to tell you something
about your virus.

803
01:35:03,663 --> 01:35:06,700
<i>Oh? And what would that be?</i>

804
01:35:07,542 --> 01:35:11,790
The contract Hannah geist
signed with Lucas

805
01:35:11,963 --> 01:35:13,624
prevents you from selling her diseases,

806
01:35:13,798 --> 01:35:19,136
but a... but a virus
you built and patented yourself

807
01:35:19,303 --> 01:35:24,050
would remain your property
even if it passed through her body.

808
01:35:25,601 --> 01:35:29,303
You could infect her, recover the sample

809
01:35:29,480 --> 01:35:31,937
and then sell it
as a vole & tesser exclusive.

810
01:35:33,025 --> 01:35:35,482
<i>Ls that true?</i>

811
01:35:35,653 --> 01:35:39,237
It's why you commissioned the virus
from Derek Lessing

812
01:35:39,407 --> 01:35:42,658
and why he infected her
during a house call.

813
01:35:44,829 --> 01:35:47,368
<i>It's a great loophole, isn't it?</i>

814
01:35:47,540 --> 01:35:51,325
<i>My idea, of course.</i>
<i>We stood to make a lot of money.</i>

815
01:35:52,753 --> 01:35:55,874
<i>Unfortunately there was a problem</i>
<i>with your friend Derek's build.</i>

816
01:35:56,048 --> 01:35:59,169
I wanna know if it can be cured.

817
01:35:59,343 --> 01:36:00,969
<i>I think so.</i>

818
01:36:01,137 --> 01:36:03,676
<i>However, producing a cure</i>
<i>would be costly,</i>

819
01:36:03,848 --> 01:36:05,558
<i>and as you acquired the virus</i>
<i>on your own,</i>

820
01:36:05,683 --> 01:36:08,886
<i>we feel no responsibility</i>
<i>for your condition.</i>

821
01:36:11,314 --> 01:36:13,557
I have something to barter.

822
01:36:21,324 --> 01:36:23,317
She'll be here in the morning.

823
01:36:36,380 --> 01:36:40,165
We're not sure, but, you know... no?

824
01:36:42,720 --> 01:36:48,261
Well, this is certainly
a heartbreaking turn of events.

825
01:36:48,434 --> 01:36:52,896
I mean, this really puts things
in perspective, doesn't it, you know?

826
01:36:53,064 --> 01:36:55,437
Now, I would happily
do something if I could,

827
01:36:55,608 --> 01:36:59,773
and the thought of a collaboration
between miss geist and our company

828
01:36:59,946 --> 01:37:01,322
is very appealing.

829
01:37:01,489 --> 01:37:05,108
Unfortunately,
my specialist here has advised me

830
01:37:05,284 --> 01:37:08,286
that she's too far gone to be saved.

831
01:37:08,454 --> 01:37:11,242
[Woman]
You'll be hearing from our lawyers.

832
01:37:11,415 --> 01:37:15,284
[Tesser] I think you'll find
we've taken the necessary precautions.

833
01:37:15,461 --> 01:37:17,455
Now, if you'll excuse me...

834
01:37:18,965 --> 01:37:25,253
You know,
while I was a guest at your clinic...

835
01:37:27,014 --> 01:37:30,847
I... I had some time
to think things over.

836
01:37:34,063 --> 01:37:38,311
I've been seeing
a little more clearly since then.

837
01:37:42,613 --> 01:37:48,486
For example, I can see
that this is an important moment.

838
01:37:50,329 --> 01:37:55,206
I can see an opportunity here...

839
01:37:59,213 --> 01:38:02,464
even in the face
of such a devastating tragedy.

840
01:38:05,136 --> 01:38:10,178
We... have a chance to innovate,

841
01:38:10,349 --> 01:38:16,804
and to do it in a way
that will benefit you both.

842
01:38:20,193 --> 01:38:23,064
The technology already exists...

843
01:38:24,864 --> 01:38:26,858
and I know where to find it.

844
01:38:31,412 --> 01:38:33,987
Allow me to take a moment of your time.

845
01:38:36,959 --> 01:38:40,210
<i>When I was a little girl,</i>
<i>my mother used to ask me,</i>

846
01:38:40,379 --> 01:38:42,539
<i>"what do you wanna be</i>
<i>when you grow up?"</i>

847
01:38:42,715 --> 01:38:46,548
<i>And I would tell her,</i>
<i>"I don't wanna grow up."</i>

848
01:38:46,719 --> 01:38:50,255
<i>"I wanna stay young and beautiful."</i>

849
01:38:50,431 --> 01:38:53,766
<i>So I guess in a way</i>
<i>this is my childhood dream realised.</i>

850
01:38:55,353 --> 01:38:58,271
<i>And I couldn't be more excited</i>
<i>to share it with you.</i>

851
01:38:59,982 --> 01:39:03,518
<i>Welcome, everyone, to my afterlife,</i>

852
01:39:03,694 --> 01:39:06,566
<i>exclusively from vole & tesser.</i>

853
01:39:13,704 --> 01:39:16,493
[Tesser]
From the perspective of the virus,

854
01:39:16,666 --> 01:39:19,372
the human being is irrelevant.

855
01:39:19,544 --> 01:39:25,049
What matters is the system
that allows it to function.

856
01:39:26,092 --> 01:39:30,719
Skin cells, nerve cells,
the right home for the right disease.

857
01:39:31,806 --> 01:39:34,761
Within our afterlife capsule,

858
01:39:34,934 --> 01:39:40,273
the system that is Hannah geist's body
has been perpetuated,

859
01:39:40,439 --> 01:39:44,059
even expanded
beyond what existed during her lifetime.

860
01:39:44,235 --> 01:39:46,809
Make no mistake, however,

861
01:39:46,988 --> 01:39:50,274
this is not some glorified cell steak.

862
01:39:50,449 --> 01:39:52,194
Everything inside this housing

863
01:39:52,368 --> 01:39:55,074
is either part of the original body

864
01:39:55,246 --> 01:39:57,370
or has been grown directly from it

865
01:39:57,540 --> 01:40:01,586
as a result of our patented
cellgarden technology.

866
01:40:01,752 --> 01:40:04,589
Our chief technician, Syd march,

867
01:40:04,755 --> 01:40:08,837
is about to load the latest virus
into the system,

868
01:40:09,010 --> 01:40:13,139
where it will infect Hannah's body

869
01:40:13,306 --> 01:40:18,977
before being sold as part of our
vole & tesser afterlife product line.

870
01:40:21,439 --> 01:40:24,607
Now, this is just a sneak peek.

871
01:40:24,775 --> 01:40:27,612
If you wanna know
the nature of the infection,

872
01:40:27,778 --> 01:40:31,528
you'll have to wait
until it's announced officially

873
01:40:31,699 --> 01:40:35,780
at our product conference
at the end of this month.

874
01:40:36,579 --> 01:40:39,664
Thanks for coming by. Thank you.
Thanks so much for your time.

875
01:40:39,832 --> 01:40:41,292
Thanks for coming by.

876
01:40:41,459 --> 01:40:43,702
- We'll see you at the end of the month.
- Thank you.

[Gas hisses]

878

She's perfect somehow, isn't she?
