<i>What do you mean?</i>

38

Calling me out of the blue

39
00:05:31,582 --> 00:05:34,143
and barraging me with these things.

00:05:34,793 --> 00:05:35,937
Isn't it too much?

41
00:05:37,047 --> 00:05:39,940
Could you tell me
the name of your company?

42
00:05:40,425 --> 00:05:41,650
What's your name?

43
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:56,457
Ouch!

44
00:05:58,483 --> 00:05:59,918
Hubby and his tools!

45
00:06:11,205 --> 00:06:12,307
Coming.

<i>Hello, this is Murano Life.</i>

<i>Are you and your family covered</i>

49
00:06:23,592 --> 00:06:25,695
Sorry, but we're already covered.

50
00:06:25,803 --> 00:06:29,240
<i>Oh really?</i>
<i>From which company?</i>

51
00:06:29,557 --> 00:06:31,450
<i>Could you tell me please?</i>

52
00:06:32,185 --> 00:06:34,162
<i>Ours is much better than any other.</i>

53
00:06:34,312 --> 00:06:38,082
<i>If you'd just hear me out</i>
<i>I think you'll also agree.</i>

54
00:06:38,232 --> 00:06:40,208
It's already been two years.

55
00:06:40,485 --> 00:06:43,963
<i>We'll take that into</i>
<i>consideration as well.</i>

56
00:06:44,988 --> 00:06:47,048
I don't really think
that's necessary.

57
00:06:47,783 --> 00:06:49,593
And I'm a bit busy. Sorry.

58
00:06:49,785 --> 00:06:50,887
<i>Oh, really?</i>

59
00:06:51,328 --> 00:06:54,432
<i>Then, sorry for interrupting you.</i>

60
00:06:55,165 --> 00:06:57,935
<i>We have various other</i>
<i>forms of insurance too.</i>

61
00:06:58,252 --> 00:07:01,230
<i>So I'll come and present those</i>
<i>at another time.</i>

62
00:07:01,713 --> 00:07:03,815
<i>Thank you for your time today.</i>

63
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:06,152
Thanks.

64
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:21,310
Coming.

65
00:08:22,337 --> 00:08:23,520
Just a second.

66
00:08:26,798 --> 00:08:27,942
Coming.

67
00:08:31,512 --> 00:08:33,113
Overly cautious, aren't you?

68
00:08:33,555 --> 00:08:34,657
Open up

69
00:08:35,725 --> 00:08:36,992
Darling.

70
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:39,912
You scared me.

71
00:08:40,855 --> 00:08:42,163
Scared me half to death.

72
00:08:44,317 --> 00:08:45,376
Welcome home.

73
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,753
I was ringing for ages.

74
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:49,713
Sorry, I was on the balcony.

75
00:08:49,738 --> 00:08:52,218
It stinks. Throw the trash out.

76
00:08:52,242 --> 00:08:53,633
Stop, darling.

77
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:55,720
I threw it out this morning

78
00:08:55,953 --> 00:08:58,430
but found it on the doorstep
when I returned.

79
00:08:58,747 --> 00:09:00,223
Today's not the trash day I guess.

80
00:09:03,752 --> 00:09:04,937
It's OK here.

81
00:09:09,258 --> 00:09:11,277
Even so, isn't that a bit much?

82
00:09:11,635 --> 00:09:13,778
Must really be a clean freak.

83
00:09:14,847 --> 00:09:16,157
Almost a disease.

84
00:09:19,977 --> 00:09:21,162
But...

85
00:09:21,187 --> 00:09:23,122
How did they know it was our trash?

86
00:09:23,438 --> 00:09:25,082
A bit creepy, isn't it?

87
00:09:25,775 --> 00:09:27,627
Maybe they saw you?

88
00:09:28,277 --> 00:09:29,837
Next time put it out
on the right day.

89
00:09:31,155 --> 00:09:32,297
Yes.

90
00:09:34,908 --> 00:09:37,595
Talking about creepy, so is this.

91
00:09:38,662 --> 00:09:40,765
How do they know people's
names and addresses?

92
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:45,394
They're wasting their time
making this crap.

93
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:46,479
Exactly.

94
00:09:46,503 --> 00:09:48,563
They even knew our son's name.

95
00:09:49,048 --> 00:09:50,108
What's that?

96
00:09:50,132 --> 00:09:51,900
- Insurance.
- Really.

97
00:09:52,468 --> 00:09:55,070
Maybe the "ID Number System"
has started.

98
00:09:55,805 --> 00:09:57,657
What's all these, too?

99
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:00,117
This isn't a bachelor's place.

100
00:10:00,142 --> 00:10:02,285
Why not leave those?

101
00:10:03,645 --> 00:10:04,747
Idiot.

102
00:10:05,522 --> 00:10:06,623
Hungry?

103
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:07,917
Tired?

104
00:10:08,233 --> 00:10:11,128
I'll take a nap.
I had no break today.

105
00:10:11,445 --> 00:10:13,297
- A morning shift tomorrow?
- Yeah.

106
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:17,593
Also, Aoki took time off, so I'll
be away for 3 days.

107
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:20,095
Oh, really.

108
00:10:34,927 --> 00:10:38,030
Daddy, wake up!

109
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:40,950
I told you not to wake him!

110
00:10:41,267 --> 00:10:42,827
He's been awake all this time.

111
00:10:43,435 --> 00:10:45,955
He'll be up for dinner, so play
by yourself til then.

112
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:47,413
Okay!

113
00:10:56,073 --> 00:10:57,173
Takuto!

114
00:11:12,798 --> 00:11:14,776
Sir, do you happen to have
any itchy places?

115
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,610
- None!
- OK.

116
00:11:18,887 --> 00:11:21,282
Dad is washing you, how nice.

117
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:23,159
Maybe I'll join too.

118
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:24,535
Please do.

119
00:11:24,852 --> 00:11:26,537
Slowly shampoo then.

120
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:29,707
- Mom, it's cold!
- Sorry.

121
00:12:59,738 --> 00:13:00,838
Darling.

122
00:13:03,075 --> 00:13:04,217
Darling.

123
00:13:07,037 --> 00:13:08,138
Come on.

124
00:13:09,457 --> 00:13:10,557
Hey.

125
00:13:13,043 --> 00:13:14,270
Hey!

126
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:15,645
Mommy.

127
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:18,773
Don't wake up daddy.

128
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,192
Go to...

129
00:13:20,508 --> 00:13:21,610
sleep!

130
00:13:25,097 --> 00:13:27,617
Daddy will take you today, how nice!

131
00:13:27,767 --> 00:13:28,867
Yes!

132
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:30,660
Hey...

133
00:13:30,895 --> 00:13:32,037
Not cute!

134
00:13:35,942 --> 00:13:37,710
Take the trash out, please.

135
00:13:37,902 --> 00:13:39,002
OK.

136
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,382
See you later.

137
00:13:44,533 --> 00:13:45,969
- You too
- See you later.

138
00:13:45,993 --> 00:13:47,762
See you, oh your hat.

139
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:51,890
See you soon!

140
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:54,017
Sarcastic.

141
00:13:55,752 --> 00:13:56,895
Have a good one.

142
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,063
Takuto, your hat.

143
00:14:25,032 --> 00:14:26,133
Mommy!

144
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:30,303
Mommy!
Mommy, open the door!

145
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,140
What is it?

146
00:14:34,207 --> 00:14:36,227
I forgot to take my picture.

147
00:14:36,752 --> 00:14:37,937
My dear.

148
00:14:40,547 --> 00:14:42,190
Silly boy.
Where's dad?

149
00:14:42,592 --> 00:14:43,733
Waiting downstairs.

150
00:14:44,008 --> 00:14:45,152
See you.

151
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:56,955
Hello?

152
00:14:58,273 --> 00:15:01,293
Oh, Miyuki, it's been ages.

153
00:15:01,943 --> 00:15:04,880
I hadn't heard from you,
so I'd been thinking of calling.

154
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:09,510
I see.

155
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:13,347
<i>Even something you can't see</i>

<i>And that's culture.</i>

157
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:20,187
<i>We consider culture</i>
<i>as a living thing.</i>

158

<i>your first language, fluently</i>

166
00:15:51,868 --> 00:15:53,762
<i>is not easy thing to achieve.</i>

167
00:15:54,497 --> 00:15:58,392
<i>So we have concocted a system which</i>
<i>allows you to carry on learning smoothly</i>

168
00:15:58,417 --> 00:16:00,560
<i>and I want to share</i>
<i>it with everyone.</i>

169
00:16:01,295 --> 00:16:03,313
<i>Thinking of your children's future,</i>

170
00:16:03,672 --> 00:16:06,065
<i>thinking internationally is</i>
<i>absolutely necessary.</i>

171
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:12,113
Somebody's at the door.

172
00:16:12,597 --> 00:16:13,948
Speak soon, okay?

173
00:16:15,392 --> 00:16:16,493
Coming.

174
00:16:18,603 --> 00:16:19,913
Who may I ask is there?

175
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:21,998
<i>Hello, Mrs. Honda?</i>

176
00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:24,752
<i>Sorry to trouble you at this time,</i>

177
00:16:25,402 --> 00:16:28,255
<i>But I brought you something</i>
<i>exciting today.</i>

178
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:32,717
If this is sales talk, no thank you.

179
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:36,095
Yes, but if you'd just spare
me 5 minutes of your time?

180
00:16:36,413 --> 00:16:38,348
I'm quite busy right now.

181
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:42,018
Then, please allow me to just
give you a pamphlet.

182
00:16:42,585 --> 00:16:44,312
Please put it in the letter box.

183
00:16:47,257 --> 00:16:48,358
Stop, please!

184
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:51,403
Just this.

185
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:07,127
How mean!

186
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:08,795
So cruel.

187
00:17:33,345 --> 00:17:35,238
My hand is all swollen.

188
00:17:37,223 --> 00:17:40,410
This is assault, isn't it?

189
00:17:40,852 --> 00:17:42,955
Though, no need to worry.

190
00:17:43,688 --> 00:17:45,082
I'll let it slide.

191
00:17:45,982 --> 00:17:47,083
But...

192
00:17:47,692 --> 00:17:49,502
We have a quota to fill.

193
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:53,507
So, won't you just give
me a few minutes of your time?

194
00:17:54,533 --> 00:17:55,675
I beg of you.

195
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:00,763
With my hand like this,

196
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:03,058
I won't be able to work.

197
00:18:04,292 --> 00:18:06,478
Go to the police if you want.

198
00:18:09,715 --> 00:18:10,898
Besides,

199
00:18:11,758 --> 00:18:15,112
you guys only need
your smooth-talk to work!

200
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:21,200
So mean.

201
00:18:43,957 --> 00:18:45,100
Sorry.

202
00:22:02,113 --> 00:22:03,632
<i>You've reached JCS.</i>

203
00:22:04,282 --> 00:22:05,592
<i>Is Mr. Honda in?</i>

204
00:22:06,033 --> 00:22:07,260
<i>It's his wife.</i>

205
00:22:07,285 --> 00:22:08,428
<i>Oh, hello.</i>

206
00:22:08,787 --> 00:22:09,930
<i>He's...</i>

207
00:22:10,747 --> 00:22:14,100
<i>busy in the machine room.</i>
<i>If it's important, shall I call him?</i>

208
00:22:14,125 --> 00:22:17,895
<i>Oh, in that case it's OK.</i>
<i>Sorry for bothering you.</i>

209
00:22:53,832 --> 00:22:54,933
Jesus!

210
00:25:36,243 --> 00:25:40,723
<i>"I am..."</i>

211
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:46,813
<i>"sexually frustrated,"</i>

212
00:25:47,838 --> 00:25:55,847
<i>"Can someone please..."</i>

213
00:25:56,263 --> 00:26:02,453
<i>"do it with me"</i>

214
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:31,440
Mrs. Honda.

215
00:26:33,133 --> 00:26:34,235
Package for you.

216
00:26:38,473 --> 00:26:41,408
What was written on the door?

217
00:26:43,395 --> 00:26:44,495
Something indecent.

218
00:26:45,063 --> 00:26:46,705
A general idea?

219
00:26:49,233 --> 00:26:50,335
I can't say.

220
00:26:50,902 --> 00:26:54,005
Tell me about
the "strange thing" then.

221
00:26:55,948 --> 00:26:57,050
A tissue.

222
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:58,802
A tissue?

223
00:27:00,412 --> 00:27:02,055
Um, a tissue paper?

224
00:27:04,748 --> 00:27:05,850
With sperm.

225
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:07,602
I see.

226
00:27:08,545 --> 00:27:10,897
That's a bit perverse, isn't it?

227
00:27:11,798 --> 00:27:14,108
- Just a bit?
- No, I mean...

228
00:27:14,758 --> 00:27:18,237
that's very, very
perverse, I think.

229
00:27:19,388 --> 00:27:22,492
And, that salesman you mentioned,

230
00:27:22,933 --> 00:27:24,535
what was he selling?

231
00:27:26,062 --> 00:27:27,372
I don't know.

232
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:29,665
Do you remember his face?

233
00:27:30,317 --> 00:27:32,627
No, I couldn't see it.

234
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:36,672
So you don't know what
company he was from,

235
00:27:36,907 --> 00:27:38,717
and don't know his face.

236
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:43,847
You don't even know who was
kicking your door for sure.

237
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:48,143
Well, I'll let the patrol unit know

238
00:27:48,167 --> 00:27:50,520
to be on the lookout for
anything suspicious.

239
00:27:52,422 --> 00:27:53,732
Thank you very much.

240
00:28:05,852 --> 00:28:08,412
Mrs. Honda.
I've your cleaning here.

241
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:10,207
Oh, thank you.

242
00:28:19,032 --> 00:28:20,175
This, right?

243
00:28:21,158 --> 00:28:23,343
- Yes.
- Please sign here.

244
00:28:31,753 --> 00:28:33,020
Thank you very much.

245
00:28:38,968 --> 00:28:40,068
Sorry.

246
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,302
<i>It's me.</i>

247
00:31:09,785 --> 00:31:11,387
<i>Are you free today?</i>

248
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:17,143
There have been lots of strange
things happening since yesterday

249
00:31:17,210 --> 00:31:19,103
and my husband is away for 2 days.

250
00:31:19,753 --> 00:31:23,858
So I thought that if you're free,
why not come and stay the night here?

251
00:31:28,095 --> 00:31:30,280
I see. Well that can't be helped.

252
00:31:32,725 --> 00:31:34,493
It's okay. Speak later.

253
00:32:00,753 --> 00:32:02,730
Takuto, can you get the
paper please?

254
00:32:10,472 --> 00:32:11,947
- Takuto?
- Yes?

255
00:32:24,527 --> 00:32:25,628
Takuto!

256
00:32:25,737 --> 00:32:27,130
When it's finished.

257
00:32:44,422 --> 00:32:45,523
It's finished.

258
00:33:29,008 --> 00:33:30,652
Mommy, I can't pull it.

259
00:33:31,802 --> 00:33:33,487
Of course you can.

260
00:33:33,888 --> 00:33:35,155
I really can't.

261
00:33:38,935 --> 00:33:40,495
Maybe it got stuck.

262
00:34:40,663 --> 00:34:41,431
Somebody.

263
00:34:41,455 --> 00:34:44,433
Somebody, help me!

264
00:34:44,792 --> 00:34:46,602
Somebody help me!

265
00:35:06,022 --> 00:35:07,163
It's nothing.

266
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:09,583
Nothing at all.

267
00:35:11,818 --> 00:35:13,922
Mommy is OK.

268
00:35:15,322 --> 00:35:16,507
Everything is OK.

269
00:35:29,712 --> 00:35:31,355
Let's count to 50 today.

270
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:32,649
OK!

271
00:35:32,673 --> 00:35:35,902
1...2...3...

272
00:35:36,010 --> 00:35:39,238
4...5...6...

273
00:35:39,347 --> 00:35:42,492
7...8...9...

274
00:35:42,517 --> 00:35:45,368
10...11...12...

275
00:35:45,393 --> 00:35:48,247
13...14...15...

276
00:35:56,405 --> 00:35:57,507
Hello?

277
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:00,885
<i>Wrapped up in a towel?</i>

278
00:36:05,247 --> 00:36:06,432
<i>Or possibly...</i>

279
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,392
Who is this?

280
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:12,522
<i>Sorry for disturbing you,</i>
<i>go back to your bath.</i>

281
00:36:56,715 --> 00:36:57,817
Hello?

282
00:36:59,093 --> 00:37:00,402
<i>Sorry about earlier.</i>

283
00:37:00,803 --> 00:37:02,738
- <i>It's me</i>
- Stop messing around!

284
00:37:03,763 --> 00:37:05,992
After freshening up after a bath,

285
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:09,078
a cold beer is nice, right?

286
00:37:10,062 --> 00:37:11,247
<i>You...</i>

287
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:13,998
<i>like a drink, right?</i>

288
00:37:15,693 --> 00:37:16,793
Who?

289
00:37:17,362 --> 00:37:18,462
Who are you?

290
00:37:19,447 --> 00:37:20,757
<i>Your husband...</i>

291
00:37:21,782 --> 00:37:23,008
<i>is not home yet?</i>

292
00:37:23,825 --> 00:37:26,513
Or maybe, he's not
coming home tonight?

293
00:37:26,537 --> 00:37:27,638
<i>Stop it!</i>

294
00:37:28,247 --> 00:37:29,598
No, I won't.

295
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:31,600
I'll go to the police.

296
00:37:31,917 --> 00:37:33,018
<i>Go ahead.</i>

297
00:37:33,918 --> 00:37:35,020
<i>But...</i>

298
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:38,398
<i>you don't know who or where I am.</i>

299
00:37:40,885 --> 00:37:42,027
It's you.

300
00:37:42,637 --> 00:37:44,238
You wrote that on my door.

301
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:46,282
Did I?

302
00:37:47,558 --> 00:37:48,783
<i>Did something happen?</i>

303
00:37:49,268 --> 00:37:50,368
<i>What's "that"?</i>

304
00:37:51,853 --> 00:37:52,955
Pervert.

305
00:37:55,023 --> 00:37:56,708
<i>Those sort of people are around.</i>

306
00:37:58,068 --> 00:37:59,170
Why?

307
00:37:59,778 --> 00:38:02,882
Because I hurt your hand
or I didn't listen to you?

308
00:38:04,492 --> 00:38:05,927
What are you talking about?

309
00:38:05,952 --> 00:38:07,052
<i>Stop it!</i>

310
00:38:07,787 --> 00:38:09,513
<i>Why do you need to call me?</i>

311
00:38:10,790 --> 00:38:11,890
<i>Why?</i>

312
00:38:15,502 --> 00:38:16,603
Because...

313
00:38:19,048 --> 00:38:20,148
you're beautiful.

314
00:38:23,927 --> 00:38:25,112
<i>Hello?</i>

315
00:38:38,442 --> 00:38:39,835
Prank calls?

316
00:38:40,485 --> 00:38:43,214
Don't bother with it.
Just hang up.

317
00:38:43,238 --> 00:38:44,548
It's not just that.

318
00:38:45,198 --> 00:38:47,051
So many strange things
happened today.

319
00:38:47,075 --> 00:38:48,177
<i>Strange things?</i>

320
00:38:49,787 --> 00:38:52,723
Things I can't say on the phone.
I want to explain in person.

321
00:38:53,707 --> 00:38:55,017
Can't you come home?

322
00:38:55,542 --> 00:38:57,060
It's just 30 minutes by car.

323
00:38:57,503 --> 00:38:58,895
It's impossible.

324
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:02,858
It's chaos here as the
machine ran into a bug.

325
00:39:03,175 --> 00:39:06,112
Stop purposely using
such technical terms.

326
00:39:06,178 --> 00:39:07,572
The program has stalled.

327
00:39:07,638 --> 00:39:08,738
Yeah, yeah,

328
00:39:09,057 --> 00:39:11,158
You just don't care
what happens to us!

329
00:39:16,105 --> 00:39:17,205
Yes?

330
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:22,418
<i>Who were you speaking to?</i>

331
00:39:23,778 --> 00:39:24,880
<i>Your husband?</i>

332
00:39:26,157 --> 00:39:28,383
<i>Or maybe... the police?</i>

333
00:39:29,827 --> 00:39:31,678
Why not stop these foolish things.

334
00:39:33,038 --> 00:39:34,557
If you want something, say it.

335
00:39:35,750 --> 00:39:36,850
<i>I don't...</i>

336
00:39:37,585 --> 00:39:39,437
<i>want anything really.</i>

337
00:39:50,430 --> 00:39:53,075
<i>I just want to talk with you.</i>

338
00:39:55,435 --> 00:39:57,830
<i>Because you're beautiful.</i>

339
00:39:59,063 --> 00:40:00,207
It's not fair.

340
00:40:01,275 --> 00:40:03,252
What's so fun about this?

341
00:40:04,153 --> 00:40:05,295
I...

342
00:40:06,322 --> 00:40:07,422
think you're...

343
00:40:07,823 --> 00:40:09,132
a piece of shit!

344
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:57,277
<i>Hey, it's me.</i>

345
00:44:00,597 --> 00:44:01,698
Darling.

346
00:44:01,932 --> 00:44:03,200
<i>Sorry about yesterday.</i>

347
00:44:04,058 --> 00:44:05,577
<i>You better now?</i>

348
00:44:07,270 --> 00:44:09,623
Yes, sorry.
I got a bit worked up.

349
00:44:10,690 --> 00:44:12,750
Things are fine here.
Don't worry.

350
00:44:13,027 --> 00:44:14,127
<i>I see.</i>

351
00:44:14,695 --> 00:44:17,672
<i>I'm gonna take a nap,</i>
<i>but call if you need me.</i>

352
00:44:19,617 --> 00:44:20,800
Thanks for calling.

353
00:44:21,743 --> 00:44:23,262
<i>Be back for dinner tomorrow.</i>

354
00:44:23,662 --> 00:44:24,681
Okay.

355
00:44:24,705 --> 00:44:25,847
<i>Later.</i>

356
00:44:25,997 --> 00:44:27,098
Good luck.

357
00:45:07,455 --> 00:45:09,892
Takuto, that's dangerous.
Stop it.

358
00:45:12,127 --> 00:45:13,228
Takuto!

359
00:45:13,670 --> 00:45:15,313
Mommy, you're beautiful.

360
00:45:16,215 --> 00:45:17,315
Silly.

361
00:45:34,442 --> 00:45:35,625
<i>You're...</i>

362
00:45:38,445 --> 00:45:39,588
<i>beautiful.</i>

363
00:46:16,065 --> 00:46:17,167
<i>You're...</i>

364
00:46:18,693 --> 00:46:19,795
<i>beautiful.</i>

365
00:46:52,602 --> 00:46:54,287
<i>Mrs. Honda, right?</i>

366
00:46:56,315 --> 00:46:57,707
<i>Sorry to keep you, it's me.</i>

367
00:47:00,777 --> 00:47:02,587
<i>It's boring being alone, isn't it?</i>

368
00:47:03,322 --> 00:47:04,505
<i>Can I head over?</i>

369
00:47:05,032 --> 00:47:06,300
<i>I really want to see you.</i>

370
00:47:23,467 --> 00:47:26,528
<i>Hello, you've reached</i>
<i>the Honda residence.</i>

371
00:47:27,095 --> 00:47:29,948
<i>We're away now, so please leave</i>
<i>your name and number...</i>

372
00:47:35,853 --> 00:47:37,830
<i>No need to pretend you're out.</i>

373
00:47:39,398 --> 00:47:41,377
<i>It's totally fine, though.</i>

374
00:47:43,028 --> 00:47:46,172
<i>As I know you're</i>
<i>listening to my voice.</i>

375
00:47:49,283 --> 00:47:50,385
<i>I've become...</i>

376
00:47:51,662 --> 00:47:53,263
<i>even more in love with you.</i>

377
00:47:55,832 --> 00:47:57,642
<i>You look great in a swimsuit.</i>

378
00:47:59,418 --> 00:48:02,147
<i>Even though you had a kid,</i>
<i>your body is in perfect shape.</i>

379
00:48:03,340 --> 00:48:04,482
<i>Dazzlingly so.</i>

380
00:48:05,342 --> 00:48:06,610
<i>Thank you.</i>

381
00:48:12,098 --> 00:48:13,575
<i>I'd love to speak more.</i>

382
00:48:17,145 --> 00:48:18,247
<i>Oh yeah.</i>

383
00:48:19,648 --> 00:48:20,832
<i>I'll sing a song.</i>

384
00:48:22,442 --> 00:48:23,543
<i>Please listen.</i>

385
00:48:26,322 --> 00:48:31,927
<i>Bubbles, oh bubbles,</i>
<i>you floated up in the air</i>

386
00:48:33,495 --> 00:48:39,100
<i>Reaching the roof so high,</i>

387
00:48:40,585 --> 00:48:46,190
<i>Reaching the roof so high,</i>

388
00:48:48,093 --> 00:48:53,907
<i>Only to pop and die.</i>

389
00:48:55,267 --> 00:49:01,038
<i>Bubbles, oh bubbles,</i>

390
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:08,255
<i>You vanished before you could fly,</i>

391
00:49:10,115 --> 00:49:15,595
<i>Before seeing the sky so high,</i>

392
00:49:17,288 --> 00:49:23,103
<i>Only to pop and die.</i>

393
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:31,528
<i>Wind, wind, don't you blow,</i>

394
00:49:33,972 --> 00:49:39,828
<i>Bubbles, bubbles, again I blow.</i>

395
00:49:45,775 --> 00:49:47,543
<i>It's a sad song, isn't it?</i>

396
00:49:50,572 --> 00:49:53,090
<i>Still won't you pick up?</i>

397
00:49:55,452 --> 00:49:56,553
<i>I see.</i>

398
00:49:58,955 --> 00:50:01,390
<i>Then, I'll talk a little more.</i>

399
00:50:04,293 --> 00:50:07,272
<i>Your husband drives a Gemini, right?</i>

400
00:50:09,215 --> 00:50:12,193
<i>It's not in the parking lot,</i>
<i>so I guess he didn't return last night?</i>

401
00:50:13,387 --> 00:50:15,613
<i>His work is quite tough, isn't it?</i>

402
00:50:16,432 --> 00:50:18,658
<i>Irregular hours, long nights too.</i>

403
00:50:19,727 --> 00:50:20,868
How do you know?

404
00:50:23,938 --> 00:50:25,248
- <i>You picked up.</i>
- How?

405
00:50:25,732 --> 00:50:28,168
You know nothing about me,

406
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:31,462
but I know everything about you.

407
00:50:32,988 --> 00:50:35,008
<i>Takuto</i>

408
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:38,262
<i>goes to Sumire Kindergarten, right?</i>

409
00:50:39,578 --> 00:50:40,680
<i>Is he OK?</i>

410
00:50:41,372 --> 00:50:43,140
<i>I wonder, is he doing well?</i>

411
00:51:53,862 --> 00:51:55,047
Mommy!

412
00:52:04,122 --> 00:52:08,100
<i>Sumire Kindergarten</i>

413
00:52:14,842 --> 00:52:18,528
Back there, Fumio said he
was waiting for you. What was that?

414
00:52:18,678 --> 00:52:21,740
Fumio and I are going
roller skating later.

415
00:52:22,182 --> 00:52:23,533
You can't go today.

416
00:52:23,642 --> 00:52:24,742
Why?

417
00:52:25,102 --> 00:52:26,202
No!

418
00:52:29,898 --> 00:52:31,833
- Come on.
- No!

419
00:52:31,942 --> 00:52:33,335
I promised!

420
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:34,877
I said you can't.

421
00:52:34,903 --> 00:52:37,381
But I promised him I'd go!

422
00:52:37,405 --> 00:52:39,548
How many times do I need to say so?

423
00:52:41,033 --> 00:52:42,135
Go inside!

424
00:52:45,580 --> 00:52:48,559
Takuto, just for today,
please listen to what I say.

425
00:52:48,583 --> 00:52:49,683
Your juice.

426
00:52:52,087 --> 00:52:53,187
Takuto!

427
00:53:00,678 --> 00:53:02,072
Just be like that then!

428
00:54:17,713 --> 00:54:20,650
Takuto, get up and answer the phone!

429
00:54:30,893 --> 00:54:31,995
Takuto?

430
00:54:39,485 --> 00:54:40,587
Takuto?

431
00:54:49,412 --> 00:54:50,513
Takuto!

432
00:56:10,077 --> 00:56:11,177
Takuto!

433
00:56:39,105 --> 00:56:40,290
Takuto...

434
00:56:40,690 --> 00:56:41,790
you idiot!

435
00:57:05,632 --> 00:57:06,732
Damn.

436
00:57:42,835 --> 00:57:45,480
Hello, Mrs. Kato?
This is Mrs. Honda.

437
00:57:45,963 --> 00:57:48,482
Is my Takuto over there now?

438
00:57:50,510 --> 00:57:51,652
Oh, I see.

439
00:57:52,387 --> 00:57:54,363
When he leaves please call me.

440
00:57:55,557 --> 00:57:57,283
Sorry for the trouble.

441
00:58:10,153 --> 00:58:11,797
We finally could meet.

442
00:58:14,450 --> 00:58:16,802
You shouldn't leave
without locking up.

443
00:58:17,370 --> 00:58:18,512
It's dangerous.

444
00:58:20,790 --> 00:58:22,308
Please look at me.

445
00:58:25,837 --> 00:58:26,937
Please.

446
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:46,832
Let's head back in.

447
01:00:40,513 --> 01:00:41,613
Sorry.

448
01:00:42,598 --> 01:00:44,158
I'm sorry it came to this.

449
01:00:46,643 --> 01:00:48,328
But if I don't do it like this,

450
01:00:49,647 --> 01:00:51,832
you won't listen to
what I have to say.

451
01:01:13,922 --> 01:01:15,230
Don't really use them?

452
01:01:25,725 --> 01:01:28,452
Even though you're so beautiful.

453
01:01:29,437 --> 01:01:30,538
Stop it.

454
01:01:38,653 --> 01:01:39,797
Please.

455
01:01:40,740 --> 01:01:42,048
Please calm down.

456
01:01:42,783 --> 01:01:44,343
- Please.
- Get off!

457
01:02:48,348 --> 01:02:49,533
Hello?

458
01:02:49,808 --> 01:02:52,287
<i>I'm doing something</i>
<i>so pleasurable now.</i>

459
01:02:53,020 --> 01:02:54,955
<i>I'm so hard and ready to go.</i>

460
01:02:55,438 --> 01:02:56,665
<i>Suck it.</i>

461
01:02:56,857 --> 01:02:58,960
<i>You make me so horny.</i>

462
01:03:01,445 --> 01:03:04,132
<i>Go deep.</i>
<i>Use your tongue.</i>

463
01:03:05,282 --> 01:03:06,925
<i>You're wet too, right?</i>

464
01:03:09,870 --> 01:03:11,097
<i>I'm gonna cum.</i>

465
01:03:11,997 --> 01:03:13,598
<i>Open your mouth.</i>

466
01:03:15,585 --> 01:03:16,852
Shame on you.

467
01:03:17,337 --> 01:03:18,520
<i>Who are you?</i>

468
01:03:19,172 --> 01:03:20,815
<i>You lonely soul.</i>

469
01:03:21,298 --> 01:03:22,400
<i>Asshole.</i>

470
01:03:22,800 --> 01:03:23,900
Asshole?

471
01:03:38,440 --> 01:03:40,250
Don't look at me like that.

472
01:03:45,155 --> 01:03:46,465
Shall we continue?

473
01:03:59,545 --> 01:04:01,563
Please stop fighting back.

474
01:04:37,082 --> 01:04:39,310
Mommy! Open the door!

475
01:04:39,543 --> 01:04:41,645
- Mommy!
- Takuto, run!

476
01:04:44,090 --> 01:04:45,607
Shouldn't you let him in?

477
01:04:46,300 --> 01:04:47,777
If he runs I'll get him.

478
01:04:58,312 --> 01:04:59,497
What do you want?

479
01:05:00,230 --> 01:05:01,332
I wonder.

480
01:05:03,108 --> 01:05:05,585
Mommy, mommy, quickly!

481
01:05:06,862 --> 01:05:08,338
Don't hurt my kid.

482
01:05:09,448 --> 01:05:10,548
Please!

483
01:05:13,953 --> 01:05:15,053
Mommy!

484
01:05:15,705 --> 01:05:17,807
Coming. Wait a second.

485
01:05:21,668 --> 01:05:23,020
Promise me, please.

486
01:05:27,383 --> 01:05:28,567
Understood.

487
01:05:31,637 --> 01:05:32,780
Really?

488
01:05:33,597 --> 01:05:34,698
Yes.

489
01:05:39,228 --> 01:05:41,331
Mommy, open it.

490
01:05:41,355 --> 01:05:43,998
OK. I'm coming!

491
01:05:56,120 --> 01:05:57,763
Pretend to be a guest.

492
01:06:00,498 --> 01:06:01,600
Let's do it.

493
01:06:22,438 --> 01:06:23,538
Welcome home.

494
01:06:25,817 --> 01:06:26,958
A guest.

495
01:06:27,402 --> 01:06:29,295
- Say hello.
- Hello!

496
01:06:30,988 --> 01:06:32,255
Nice to meet you.

497
01:06:32,948 --> 01:06:34,048
You're back early.

498
01:06:34,117 --> 01:06:37,803
Fumio and Takashi,
everyone went home.

499
01:06:38,203 --> 01:06:39,805
Because you didn't come.

500
01:06:40,330 --> 01:06:41,432
Takuto!

501
01:06:41,582 --> 01:06:42,767
I'm hungry!

502
01:06:44,252 --> 01:06:45,352
Be right up.

503
01:06:46,128 --> 01:06:47,353
Shall we play together?

504
01:06:47,755 --> 01:06:50,190
- Let's play pool!
- Great!

505
01:07:51,068 --> 01:07:52,168
Nice!

506
01:07:53,445 --> 01:07:55,088
Aim for the red next.

507
01:07:58,075 --> 01:07:59,260
Close!

508
01:07:59,452 --> 01:08:00,593
Let me try.

509
01:08:30,023 --> 01:08:31,125
I'm gonna...

510
01:08:31,733 --> 01:08:32,835
use the toilet.

511
01:08:34,695 --> 01:08:35,795
Go ahead.

512
01:08:38,282 --> 01:08:39,383
Actually...

513
01:08:40,033 --> 01:08:41,927
my husband may be coming home.

514
01:08:46,082 --> 01:08:47,725
Well, if that happens...

515
01:08:51,795 --> 01:08:53,397
that's fine with me.

516
01:08:55,173 --> 01:08:56,275
Huh?

517
01:09:03,807 --> 01:09:05,200
I don't care what happens...

518
01:09:06,477 --> 01:09:07,577
to me.

519
01:09:36,090 --> 01:09:37,190
Takuto!

520
01:09:38,425 --> 01:09:39,403
Takuto!

521
01:09:39,427 --> 01:09:41,237
What?

522
01:09:46,100 --> 01:09:47,660
Dinner's nearly ready.

523
01:09:47,685 --> 01:09:48,785
OK!

524
01:09:58,612 --> 01:10:00,213
When do you normally go to sleep?

525
01:10:00,863 --> 01:10:02,590
Around 8 pm, right?

526
01:10:04,158 --> 01:10:05,260
Yeah, around then.

527
01:10:07,537 --> 01:10:08,638
That's early.

528
01:10:12,585 --> 01:10:14,143
Your dad's missing dinner.

529
01:10:14,628 --> 01:10:16,313
Dad's not coming home tonight.

530
01:10:26,515 --> 01:10:27,992
Isn't he?

531
01:10:44,867 --> 01:10:46,135
Can I have another beer?

532
01:10:49,705 --> 01:10:50,805
Yes.

533
01:10:51,373 --> 01:10:52,473
Of course.

534
01:10:56,170 --> 01:10:58,772
Takuto, you need to eat a lot
to become a big boy.

535
01:11:01,508 --> 01:11:02,608
Takuto!

536
01:11:02,885 --> 01:11:03,985
Takuto.

537
01:11:11,518 --> 01:11:12,618
Mommy!

538
01:11:15,022 --> 01:11:16,540
Takuto, run!

539
01:11:21,695 --> 01:11:22,963
No! No!

540
01:11:39,003 --> 01:11:40,188
<i>Hey.</i>

541
01:11:40,297 --> 01:11:41,440
<i>Are you OK?</i>

542
01:11:44,385 --> 01:11:48,488
<i>I guess you're out.</i>
<i>Oh well, never mind then.</i>

543
01:11:51,850 --> 01:11:54,327
<i>Takuto, be a good boy.</i>

544
01:12:27,218 --> 01:12:28,320
Takuto?

545
01:12:30,138 --> 01:12:31,240
Takuto!

546
01:12:35,935 --> 01:12:37,037
Mommy!

547
01:12:53,120 --> 01:12:54,220
Mommy!

548
01:12:54,413 --> 01:12:55,513
Takuto!

549
01:13:06,967 --> 01:13:08,152
It's okay.

550
01:13:11,180 --> 01:13:12,280
It'll be OK.

551
01:14:06,985 --> 01:14:08,753
Takuto, pull yourself together!

552
01:14:09,278 --> 01:14:10,463
You're a man, right?

553
01:14:13,200 --> 01:14:14,300
Help me.

554
01:14:16,035 --> 01:14:17,220
You want to die?

555
01:14:22,333 --> 01:14:23,893
We need to fight back.

556
01:14:44,857 --> 01:14:45,957
Takuto.

557
01:15:22,102 --> 01:15:23,537
- Mommy!
- I'm OK!

558
01:17:29,520 --> 01:17:30,622
Takuto.

559
01:17:32,398 --> 01:17:33,542
It's all over.

560
01:17:35,568 --> 01:17:36,920
You did so well.

561
01:17:37,653 --> 01:17:39,005
It's all over.

562
01:22:03,252 --> 01:22:04,520
Do you know

563
01:22:06,923 --> 01:22:08,148
in America,

564
01:22:09,842 --> 01:22:11,235
there's a rapist who

565
01:22:13,680 --> 01:22:15,240
cuts out his victim's tongue.

566
01:22:20,437 --> 01:22:22,413
Do you know why?

567
01:22:24,148 --> 01:22:25,583
So she can't say...

568
01:22:26,608 --> 01:22:28,043
who raped her.

569
01:22:34,742 --> 01:22:36,845
Don't you think he's an idiot?

570
01:22:39,872 --> 01:22:41,348
I really can't see

571
01:22:44,377 --> 01:22:45,853
his point, you know?

572
01:22:49,840 --> 01:22:51,275
If you do it...

573
01:22:53,345 --> 01:22:55,363
you must crush her eyes too.

574
01:22:59,142 --> 01:23:00,452
If it was me...

575
01:23:05,107 --> 01:23:06,540
that's how I'd do it.

576
01:25:15,068 --> 01:25:17,297
<i>Bubbles, oh bubbles,</i>

577
01:25:18,322 --> 01:25:21,133
<i>You floated up in the air,</i>

578
01:25:23,243 --> 01:25:26,680
<i>Reaching the roof</i>

579
01:25:28,542 --> 01:25:30,477
<i>so high</i>

580
01:25:32,878 --> 01:25:35,315
<i>Reaching the roof</i>

581
01:25:36,382 --> 01:25:37,817
<i>so high</i>

582
01:25:40,595 --> 01:25:43,657
<i>Only to pop</i>

583
01:25:44,765 --> 01:25:46,533
<i>and die</i>

584
01:25:49,020 --> 01:25:51,205
<i>Bubbles, oh bubbles,</i>

585
01:25:52,440 --> 01:25:53,958
<i>You vanished</i>

586
01:25:55,818 --> 01:26:00,213
<i>before you could fly,</i>

587
01:26:02,533 --> 01:26:07,222
<i>Before seeing the sky so high,</i>

588
01:26:09,498 --> 01:26:14,687
<i>Only to pop and die.</i>

589
01:26:16,923 --> 01:26:22,278
<i>Wind, wind, don't you blow,</i>

590
01:26:24,847 --> 01:26:30,870
<i>Bubbles, bubbles, again I blow.</i>

591
01:27:14,563 --> 01:27:15,665
Mommy.

592
01:27:20,445 --> 01:27:21,545
Mommy!

593
01:28:07,992 --> 01:28:09,635
You bastard!

594
01:28:25,050 --> 01:28:26,152
Mommy!

595
01:29:48,592 --> 01:29:50,152
It's bedtime.

596
01:30:48,443 --> 01:30:49,545
<i>Mrs. Honda?</i>

597
01:30:50,320 --> 01:30:51,422
<i>Mrs. Honda?</i>

598
01:30:52,532 --> 01:30:54,133
<i>I'm from the House of God.</i>

599
01:30:54,867 --> 01:30:57,093
<i>Could you spare</i>
<i>a few minutes to talk?</i>
