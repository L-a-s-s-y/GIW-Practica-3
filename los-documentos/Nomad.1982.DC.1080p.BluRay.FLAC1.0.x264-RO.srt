1
00:02:16,286 --> 00:02:19,663
Tell Pong to respect
me and stop teasing me.

2
00:02:19,831 --> 00:02:22,374
I know, I owe him money.

3
00:02:22,709 --> 00:02:24,960
He said I was a crybaby,

4
00:02:25,128 --> 00:02:27,588
that men don't cry.

5
00:02:28,131 --> 00:02:32,009
He insulted me, said I
washed my wife's underwear.

6
00:02:32,218 --> 00:02:33,969
He shoved me and said:

7
00:02:34,387 --> 00:02:37,056
"Stop crying,
or I'll beat your wife."

8
00:02:37,682 --> 00:02:39,683
In front of my children!

9
00:02:40,143 --> 00:02:43,437
Uncle Luk,
I've lost my authority as a father.

10
00:02:44,481 --> 00:02:47,441
Since then, my kids have been rude to me.

11
00:02:47,776 --> 00:02:51,528
Sheng, you're more focused
on making babies

12
00:02:51,905 --> 00:02:53,655
than earning money.

13
00:02:54,115 --> 00:02:58,368
My wife asked for
a few more days.

14
00:02:58,536 --> 00:03:01,121
Can't she deliver later?

15
00:03:01,331 --> 00:03:04,541
Just a few more days.

16
00:03:05,085 --> 00:03:08,295
Of course,
you can pay me back later,

17
00:03:08,463 --> 00:03:10,798
but I won't reduce my interest rate!

18
00:03:10,965 --> 00:03:13,842
If everyone were like you,
I'd starve to death.

19
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:15,511
No way!

20
00:03:17,931 --> 00:03:20,724
12% every day, not a penny less.

21
00:03:20,892 --> 00:03:25,604
I can smell my salted fish!

22
00:03:27,148 --> 00:03:30,109
You have a good nose!
Are you sure it's yours?

23
00:03:30,276 --> 00:03:32,611
Speak louder!

24
00:03:32,946 --> 00:03:33,946
Here!

25
00:03:34,114 --> 00:03:37,116
I told you to go easy
when there are kids around.

26
00:03:37,283 --> 00:03:39,827
I said I'm your adoptive relative,

27
00:03:39,994 --> 00:03:42,121
give me one more month.

28
00:03:42,288 --> 00:03:46,333
He said, "If you were my dad,
I'd still beat you up."

29
00:03:46,501 --> 00:03:49,503
Why did my salted herring
end up at your place?

30
00:03:49,838 --> 00:03:51,213
Because it's expensive!

31
00:03:51,756 --> 00:03:53,924
Should I pay for the fish you lost

32
00:03:54,092 --> 00:03:56,593
and pamper a son to give to you

33
00:03:56,761 --> 00:03:57,970
in case yours dies?

34
00:03:58,138 --> 00:04:01,265
You good-for-nothing,
you have no manners.

35
00:04:01,432 --> 00:04:03,517
He's one of us.

36
00:04:04,894 --> 00:04:07,437
We're all Chinese!

37
00:04:11,901 --> 00:04:13,152
Chinese bowl!

38
00:04:14,404 --> 00:04:15,988
Chinese abacus!

39
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:20,325
Chinese orchid!

40
00:04:20,869 --> 00:04:22,536
Chinese goose leg!

41
00:04:22,704 --> 00:04:24,163
Chinese old man!

42
00:04:24,372 --> 00:04:26,248
And you, are you Chinese?

43
00:04:29,669 --> 00:04:31,128
Only my mother knows.

44
00:04:35,049 --> 00:04:37,759
Chi got beaten up!
Chi got beaten up!

45
00:04:39,137 --> 00:04:42,556
What? Chi got beaten up?
Where is he?

46
00:04:42,765 --> 00:04:44,141
Where is he?

47
00:04:44,309 --> 00:04:45,517
Downstairs.

48
00:04:48,188 --> 00:04:49,897
It's none of your business.

49
00:04:50,064 --> 00:04:51,690
Don't get involved!

50
00:04:57,864 --> 00:04:59,740
Those brats!

51
00:04:59,908 --> 00:05:01,617
They beat up my son.

52
00:05:01,784 --> 00:05:03,619
Why did you fight?

53
00:05:03,786 --> 00:05:05,746
Do you owe them money?

54
00:05:05,914 --> 00:05:08,081
Chi, you need to stop!

55
00:05:08,833 --> 00:05:10,000
Go tell them.

56
00:05:10,168 --> 00:05:12,169
If you do,
we won't be friends anymore.

57
00:05:15,256 --> 00:05:17,049
Instant Noodles...

58
00:05:17,425 --> 00:05:18,759
Are you eating noodles?

59
00:05:19,135 --> 00:05:22,763
That's her name,
her dad owns the Yung Café.

60
00:05:23,306 --> 00:05:25,057
She's 20 years old, too old!

61
00:05:25,225 --> 00:05:26,934
No, that's Pea Pudding.

62
00:05:27,101 --> 00:05:29,895
Instant Noodles is 14,
and he got her pregnant.

63
00:05:52,724 --> 00:05:53,498
He's here,

64
00:05:53,558 --> 00:05:54,662
so whatever's on your mind,
please speak up.

65
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:57,301
Of course he's wrong
taking advantage my daughter.

66
00:05:57,763 --> 00:05:58,935
Stop moaning.

67
00:05:59,197 --> 00:06:01,905
Important thing is what he wants.

68
00:06:02,267 --> 00:06:03,467
Marriage, as soon as possible.

69
00:06:03,502 --> 00:06:05,942
The groom is responsible for the banquet
and the wedding cake.

70
00:06:22,587 --> 00:06:23,587
It's then who beat me up.

71
00:06:26,024 --> 00:06:29,335
Next time check how many brothers
this girl has.

72
00:06:34,633 --> 00:06:35,407
Well, then?

73
00:06:38,003 --> 00:06:39,883
I'll guarantee my brother will marry
your sister

74
00:06:39,971 --> 00:06:41,609
but not the banquet or the wedding cake.

75
00:06:41,807 --> 00:06:42,649
What are you saying?

76
00:06:43,041 --> 00:06:45,146
My dad is on the verge of renouncing
my brother.

77
00:06:46,178 --> 00:06:47,378
What? What are we going to do?

78
00:06:48,246 --> 00:06:49,966
No banquet, no cakes?
You call it a wedding?

79
00:06:50,015 --> 00:06:51,455
So you're going to leave it at that.

80
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:52,760
Of course not.

81
00:06:53,552 --> 00:06:55,327
We Leongs are responsible people.

82
00:06:55,554 --> 00:06:57,074
Even though my brother is only twelve.

83
00:06:57,322 --> 00:06:58,842
When he says he's a man, he means man.

84
00:06:59,057 --> 00:07:00,764
Dating at his age.

85
00:07:01,827 --> 00:07:04,364
You claim he cheated your sister,
any evidence?

86
00:07:05,364 --> 00:07:07,605
As things go. I don't see an end to end.

87
00:07:12,204 --> 00:07:14,445
You cheated my sister
and you're shrill it.

88
00:07:14,973 --> 00:07:16,680
I am not a man if I let my brother run.

89
00:07:17,008 --> 00:07:18,928
You think we'd be sitting here
if we want to run.

90
00:07:20,645 --> 00:07:21,966
You know the law as well as I do.

91
00:07:22,748 --> 00:07:24,853
You get ready

92
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:28,861
to go to jail for intercourse with a minor?

93
00:07:31,523 --> 00:07:34,527
Where's the minor? Who's a minor?

94
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:35,870
I am a minor.

95
00:07:36,294 --> 00:07:37,170
Why didn't you say so before?

96
00:07:37,229 --> 00:07:38,230
Stop squabbling with him.

97
00:07:38,296 --> 00:07:40,276
Get the police, send him to jail.

98
00:07:40,499 --> 00:07:41,637
Right, send him to prison.

99
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:46,305
Wrong. The publicity isn't going to do
any good.

100
00:07:46,738 --> 00:07:48,458
Family matters should be kept
in the family.

101
00:07:48,707 --> 00:07:50,147
Well, whatever. Hurry up and decide.

102
00:07:52,411 --> 00:07:54,413
Shut up, you bitch, Really.

103
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:58,291
Why did you hit her?

104
00:07:58,417 --> 00:08:00,294
If you have guts, you'd punch him only.

105
00:08:00,352 --> 00:08:01,792
You want to play rough,
you maniacal?

106
00:08:58,677 --> 00:08:59,655
Dear friends,

107
00:09:00,011 --> 00:09:03,254
I had been in this program for 10 years.

108
00:09:03,782 --> 00:09:06,262
Now, because of bad heath

109
00:09:06,351 --> 00:09:07,625
I have been leave you.

110
00:09:08,153 --> 00:09:10,929
I thank you for being with me

111
00:09:11,223 --> 00:09:12,725
and love this program.

112
00:09:13,358 --> 00:09:14,166
You know

113
00:09:14,226 --> 00:09:16,331
I love Beethoven's 5th symphony.

114
00:09:16,895 --> 00:09:18,238
I'll play it again for you,

115
00:09:18,697 --> 00:09:20,734
the Beethoven's 5th symphony.

116
00:09:21,466 --> 00:09:25,710
I say good-bye to my friends,
my husband and my son.

117
00:09:26,338 --> 00:09:30,445
I hope that when they hear this music

118
00:09:30,675 --> 00:09:32,951
they'll keep up their spirit and live.

119
00:10:43,915 --> 00:10:46,088
Did you drop this?

120
00:10:46,318 --> 00:10:47,422
I'm returning it to you.

121
00:10:58,597 --> 00:11:03,597
This… This is… this…

122
00:11:09,774 --> 00:11:10,912
What is he saying?

123
00:11:11,309 --> 00:11:12,310
What's is this "this"?

124
00:11:12,477 --> 00:11:15,083
What is he talking about?

125
00:11:15,547 --> 00:11:18,221
This is a public pool.
Please observe the rule.

126
00:11:18,483 --> 00:11:21,623
No misbehaviors.
Everyone with long hair,

127
00:11:21,686 --> 00:11:23,791
boy or girl, should wear bathing cap.

128
00:11:24,689 --> 00:11:27,795
Any boards or inflatable
objects are not allowed.

129
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,335
Obey instructions from the lifeguards.

130
00:11:30,795 --> 00:11:33,036
Violators will be ejected.

131
00:11:36,368 --> 00:11:38,405
Walk, don't run.

132
00:12:17,676 --> 00:12:18,842
What's this? An insurrection?

133
00:12:18,843 --> 00:12:21,084
This is a public pool.

134
00:12:21,346 --> 00:12:23,690
Playing around like that is a misdemeanor

135
00:12:24,082 --> 00:12:25,083
I must ask you to leave.

136
00:12:25,517 --> 00:12:27,690
Pack up your balls and mattresses
and leave.

137
00:12:27,886 --> 00:12:29,695
No pleadings, no fuss.

138
00:12:29,921 --> 00:12:31,400
Just pack up and go.

139
00:12:34,225 --> 00:12:36,330
Hey, what are you doing up there?
Get down.

140
00:12:46,004 --> 00:12:48,006
You can't stay here, get down.

141
00:12:53,011 --> 00:12:54,854
Why are you so hostile?

142
00:12:55,447 --> 00:12:57,688
Miss, don't you know this platform

143
00:12:57,949 --> 00:12:59,656
is reserved for lifeguards only.

144
00:12:59,951 --> 00:13:01,123
It's for observation of the whole pool.

145
00:13:01,419 --> 00:13:03,558
You can't stay here, please get down

146
00:13:07,659 --> 00:13:10,902
I just climbed all the way up
my feet is tired out

147
00:13:11,229 --> 00:13:14,369
I can't move.

148
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:17,279
Why don't you carry me down.

149
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:21,049
Well? Do you have to think about this?

150
00:13:24,445 --> 00:13:25,287
Where are you from?

151
00:13:25,713 --> 00:13:27,488
Me? I'm from here.

152
00:13:29,217 --> 00:13:31,060
Are you going to carry me or not?

153
00:13:32,386 --> 00:13:33,346
You're out of your mind.

154
00:13:33,955 --> 00:13:34,899
Are you shy?

155
00:13:38,259 --> 00:13:39,329
All right, come on.

156
00:13:39,694 --> 00:13:40,399
Thank you.

157
00:13:44,232 --> 00:13:45,176
You nymphomaniac.

158
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:16,834
I got it.

159
00:14:19,166 --> 00:14:20,509
Hey, give it back.

160
00:14:27,041 --> 00:14:28,042
Give me my pants.

161
00:14:46,227 --> 00:14:47,035
Got you.

162
00:14:47,928 --> 00:14:50,048
Why do you like to spy on my aunt
and your stepmother?

163
00:14:50,865 --> 00:14:52,867
Let me go.

164
00:14:54,935 --> 00:14:57,211
Look at you, hiding behind a mask
all day.

165
00:14:57,405 --> 00:14:59,165
How are you going to survive if you're
timid?

166
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:05,090
Kathy you have something against
David Bowie?

167
00:15:05,146 --> 00:15:06,586
You pick on him every time I see you

168
00:15:18,092 --> 00:15:18,661
Louis.

169
00:15:20,394 --> 00:15:21,099
Pretty, isn't it?

170
00:15:46,454 --> 00:15:47,558
Is Kabuki still in fashion?

171
00:15:49,724 --> 00:15:51,863
Good thing never go out of style.

172
00:16:02,837 --> 00:16:04,517
Is your Japanese boyfriend teaching you?

173
00:16:20,855 --> 00:16:21,526
I give up.

174
00:16:44,678 --> 00:16:45,850
Did you try this?

175
00:16:49,417 --> 00:16:51,693
Ask Auntie to buy for me next time

176
00:16:52,086 --> 00:16:53,224
if she goes to Japan.

177
00:16:54,889 --> 00:16:57,062
The kids there go crazy over stuff
like mad.

178
00:17:00,428 --> 00:17:01,202
Want to try?

179
00:17:10,037 --> 00:17:15,487
Kathy, what are you doing?

180
00:17:16,076 --> 00:17:18,022
Do you still want to sniff your
Japan gasoline?

181
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:19,716
There's a 17 year old boy in Nagoya

182
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,826
who sniffed 83 cans of this.

183
00:17:21,949 --> 00:17:23,587
His shin started to rot, most dread,

184
00:17:23,717 --> 00:17:25,162
his mind deteriorated

185
00:17:25,219 --> 00:17:26,357
and became vegetable.

186
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:30,147
The Japs' invasion, there's truth.

187
00:18:59,134 --> 00:18:59,976
Where's the pants?

188
00:19:01,103 --> 00:19:02,104
My pants.

189
00:19:02,838 --> 00:19:03,816
What pants?

190
00:19:03,939 --> 00:19:05,179
My lifeguard pants.

191
00:19:12,081 --> 00:19:14,322
Your pants isn't here.

192
00:19:14,416 --> 00:19:15,588
It is because you're pretty doesn't matter
you funny.

193
00:19:16,151 --> 00:19:18,097
Hey, this place is too small.

194
00:19:20,089 --> 00:19:21,227
Is this your boyfriend?

195
00:19:22,324 --> 00:19:22,927
What do you think?

196
00:19:22,992 --> 00:19:23,936
Hey, I'm not.

197
00:19:24,593 --> 00:19:25,401
Who cares about you.

198
00:19:25,961 --> 00:19:26,962
Hey... Hey...

199
00:19:30,666 --> 00:19:32,227
Come watch! There's going to be a show?

200
00:19:45,514 --> 00:19:46,788
What's going on?

201
00:19:50,486 --> 00:19:52,124
You're real cute.

202
00:19:59,895 --> 00:20:02,000
You're crazy to fool with me.

203
00:20:02,331 --> 00:20:03,435
Give me my pants back.

204
00:20:03,632 --> 00:20:05,111
If not, I'll strip your skirt off.

205
00:20:05,267 --> 00:20:08,805
Oh no! Quick! Save her?

206
00:20:10,272 --> 00:20:11,979
Louis, come save her, quick.

207
00:20:12,942 --> 00:20:15,752
Worst comes to worst, you get heat to
him, go, hurry.

208
00:20:17,746 --> 00:20:19,726
You are a man, be a hero
and save the damsel.

209
00:20:19,882 --> 00:20:21,520
Give it back quickly.

210
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:26,331
Go on, get over there.

211
00:20:27,289 --> 00:20:28,927
You're such a coward.

212
00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:42,074
My pants.

213
00:20:42,838 --> 00:20:43,919
This doesn't look too good.

214
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:45,783
Not at all attractive.

215
00:20:48,243 --> 00:20:50,189
So, you're her boyfriend?

216
00:20:51,146 --> 00:20:52,318
No.

217
00:20:52,548 --> 00:20:54,186
Of course.

218
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:57,663
You don't look like it, you're more like
a pansy.

219
00:20:57,786 --> 00:21:00,596
Yeah, a real pansy.

220
00:21:01,523 --> 00:21:02,593
What pansy?

221
00:21:04,426 --> 00:21:06,838
Is he one of your good sisters?

222
00:21:06,996 --> 00:21:08,703
Of course.

223
00:21:08,764 --> 00:21:09,674
What good sisters?

224
00:21:16,105 --> 00:21:18,210
This is what you call good sisters.

225
00:21:28,651 --> 00:21:31,257
Hold it.

226
00:21:31,487 --> 00:21:34,832
Don't, don't.

227
00:21:54,977 --> 00:21:57,082
Do you have to use your teeth?

228
00:21:57,312 --> 00:21:58,256
It's you who's a sissy.

229
00:22:01,706 --> 00:22:04,213
What do you know? This is called street
fighting.

230
00:22:12,428 --> 00:22:13,338
No more.

231
00:22:16,498 --> 00:22:17,306
Sister.

232
00:22:27,242 --> 00:22:28,414
Get inside first.

233
00:22:44,834 --> 00:22:45,539
Are you afraid?

234
00:22:45,835 --> 00:22:48,008
Afraid? I'm just scared you're going to
catch cold.

235
00:22:50,306 --> 00:22:51,216
Put it on quickly.

236
00:22:53,743 --> 00:22:55,086
See how filthy your pants are.

237
00:22:55,144 --> 00:22:55,918
Does it hurt?

238
00:22:56,379 --> 00:22:57,756
Here, have a drink.

239
00:23:06,122 --> 00:23:07,362
Bye!

240
00:23:27,877 --> 00:23:28,548
John.

241
00:23:33,382 --> 00:23:34,224
Beer.

242
00:23:34,517 --> 00:23:35,495
Very well.

243
00:23:46,329 --> 00:23:48,366
That person stepped on my foot.

244
00:23:48,998 --> 00:23:50,807
What are going to do about it?

245
00:23:51,701 --> 00:23:53,203
Hey, who you're looking for?

246
00:23:57,173 --> 00:23:58,151
Tomato?

247
00:24:00,376 --> 00:24:03,289
What's the matter? Why don't you just
hang up?

248
00:24:03,813 --> 00:24:04,934
What do you care where I go?

249
00:24:05,181 --> 00:24:07,320
I'm going to sleep in the streets,
come look for me.

250
00:24:14,190 --> 00:24:15,828
Can I come over to your place tonight?

251
00:24:16,058 --> 00:24:17,059
No way.

252
00:24:17,727 --> 00:24:19,968
Well, where can I go then?
I have nowhere to go

253
00:24:20,029 --> 00:24:21,469
I have all my clothes at your place.

254
00:24:21,697 --> 00:24:23,176
You can't come and that's final.

255
00:24:24,834 --> 00:24:26,871
What can I do? I want to see you

256
00:24:27,603 --> 00:24:28,513
I don't care.

257
00:24:29,438 --> 00:24:30,781
I have to come pick up my stuff?

258
00:24:31,207 --> 00:24:33,153
Pick up what? I already said we're
splitting up.

259
00:24:33,709 --> 00:24:35,655
Well, you weren't clear about how?

260
00:24:35,845 --> 00:24:37,565
Thought I made my self clear the last time.

261
00:24:38,114 --> 00:24:39,286
You weren't clear.

262
00:24:39,615 --> 00:24:41,754
I don't understand.

263
00:24:49,959 --> 00:24:55,272
Andy, what do you want me to do?
Tell me.

264
00:24:55,731 --> 00:24:57,711
Whatever you say I do, I'll do it.

265
00:24:59,502 --> 00:25:02,312
Somebody here? Is it Lily? Lulu?

266
00:25:02,905 --> 00:25:06,148
Don't open the door, don't open the door.

267
00:25:08,644 --> 00:25:12,251
Hey, What are you doing?
Get off the line. Idiot.

268
00:25:12,415 --> 00:25:13,792
This is a public phone.

269
00:25:13,983 --> 00:25:15,824
Look, there's someone waiting
to use this phone

270
00:25:18,221 --> 00:25:19,928
I don't like to say anything more.

271
00:25:23,326 --> 00:25:24,999
You're going to die? Good.

272
00:25:25,127 --> 00:25:26,231
I'm still not impressed.

273
00:25:26,963 --> 00:25:29,500
You think it's "Love story"? Is it cancer?

274
00:25:34,971 --> 00:25:36,143
I'm going to die tonight.

275
00:25:46,282 --> 00:25:47,386
Still on the line?

276
00:25:48,284 --> 00:25:49,150
Yes

277
00:25:49,151 --> 00:25:49,856
I'm done soon.

278
00:25:51,454 --> 00:25:53,559
Andy! Andy!

279
00:26:02,365 --> 00:26:03,469
You can use the phone.

280
00:26:44,707 --> 00:26:46,880
Can you pay for my drink?

281
00:27:08,998 --> 00:27:10,102
Pay it yourself.

282
00:27:10,833 --> 00:27:11,777
Thanks.

283
00:27:19,742 --> 00:27:20,743
Bill!

284
00:27:24,246 --> 00:27:25,190
$9.5, thank you.

285
00:27:30,252 --> 00:27:35,565
Still here, bye.

286
00:28:27,576 --> 00:28:30,853
Hey, still out this late?

287
00:28:31,647 --> 00:28:32,807
I have no money for cab fare.

288
00:28:49,799 --> 00:28:50,777
Wait a minute.

289
00:28:52,802 --> 00:28:54,722
Where do you live? I'll ask him to take
you home.

290
00:28:55,337 --> 00:28:58,147
No thanks, I want to sit here for a while.

291
00:29:02,111 --> 00:29:09,962
The air here is so
refreshing, tell him leave.

292
00:29:17,793 --> 00:29:18,863
I'm sorry, you can go.

293
00:29:19,328 --> 00:29:20,398
Bastard.

294
00:29:28,504 --> 00:29:30,381
Did you afraid of running
into a nasty type?

295
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:35,517
There's nobody more nasty than me.

296
00:29:38,848 --> 00:29:39,758
Bye.

297
00:29:40,749 --> 00:29:41,591
Bye.

298
00:30:02,071 --> 00:30:03,550
Hey, I'll take you home, Tomato.

299
00:30:18,187 --> 00:30:25,332
Go on up, Andy's waiting for you.

300
00:30:34,036 --> 00:30:35,310
Want me to go with you?

301
00:30:36,372 --> 00:30:37,749
Can I give you a kiss?

302
00:30:42,244 --> 00:30:43,086
Bye.

303
00:31:08,103 --> 00:31:09,411
Can I give you a kiss?

304
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:12,617
Of course.

305
00:31:39,702 --> 00:31:40,510
What's wrong?

306
00:33:34,917 --> 00:33:35,918
I'm leaving.

307
00:33:36,385 --> 00:33:37,489
So soon?

308
00:33:39,588 --> 00:33:45,436
Why can't you spend a night here?

309
00:33:47,730 --> 00:33:48,731
I don't think so.

310
00:33:55,604 --> 00:33:56,582
Thank you.

311
00:34:07,516 --> 00:34:11,623
What are you afraid of?
I love you so much.

312
00:34:21,296 --> 00:34:22,604
Buddy, do you have a room?

313
00:34:25,501 --> 00:34:26,775
What a coincidence.

314
00:34:26,835 --> 00:34:28,314
Fancy meeting your servant here.

315
00:34:29,004 --> 00:34:30,176
Sit down then.

316
00:34:38,413 --> 00:34:39,391
I'm going to sleep.

317
00:35:05,207 --> 00:35:06,709
Come talk to me.

318
00:35:15,918 --> 00:35:16,919
Take off your shoes.

319
00:35:17,986 --> 00:35:18,987
My shoes?

320
00:35:24,526 --> 00:35:25,596
It's more comfortable.

321
00:35:35,938 --> 00:35:37,212
Where did you get this book?

322
00:35:37,573 --> 00:35:38,711
Ah B gave it to me.

323
00:35:39,141 --> 00:35:41,747
He thinks I like him
just because I kept it.

324
00:35:43,412 --> 00:35:44,892
Actually I haven't even glance at it.

325
00:35:45,347 --> 00:35:46,155
Ah B.

326
00:35:46,215 --> 00:35:48,354
The one that I screamed at on the phone
just now?

327
00:35:52,254 --> 00:35:53,392
Then Andy is Ah A?

328
00:35:55,824 --> 00:35:57,104
Is he always this brutal to you?

329
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:08,506
Yeah, it's not the first time.

330
00:36:11,073 --> 00:36:14,611
It can't be helped, nobody forced me
to love him.

331
00:36:21,450 --> 00:36:23,020
I'm not going back again, though.

332
00:36:24,453 --> 00:36:25,557
Why don't you go home?

333
00:36:28,123 --> 00:36:29,227
Where's your parents?

334
00:36:31,927 --> 00:36:33,634
You' re so sweet.

335
00:36:35,898 --> 00:36:37,377
Nobody's ever said that of me.

336
00:36:39,234 --> 00:36:41,475
Don't you know you're a good person?

337
00:36:50,279 --> 00:36:53,522
It's late, I think they're all asleep.

338
00:36:53,749 --> 00:36:55,922
Yeah, that was what I said.

339
00:39:09,488 --> 00:39:10,592
Clear everything.

340
00:39:10,956 --> 00:39:12,094
OK, let me do it.

341
00:39:16,495 --> 00:39:18,065
Rinse it if you can't wash it

342
00:39:18,130 --> 00:39:19,302
I can't accept vermin.

343
00:39:22,234 --> 00:39:23,304
Come and help me.

344
00:39:23,936 --> 00:39:26,075
Kitty, Kitty, Miao, Miao.

345
00:39:26,872 --> 00:39:27,816
You still haven't gone.

346
00:39:27,873 --> 00:39:29,375
Let me wash my face, ok?

347
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:37,826
What show are we seeing anyway?

348
00:39:38,083 --> 00:39:40,256
A foreign film, in English.

349
00:39:41,987 --> 00:39:43,707
Even if it were good I wouldn't understand.

350
00:39:43,956 --> 00:39:45,333
So many good films and you have to
pick a foreign one.

351
00:39:45,891 --> 00:39:46,991
Name one thing that's good about the film.

352
00:39:46,992 --> 00:39:48,432
What's good is that its long enough.

353
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:51,766
Even if it's bad you have a place
to go 3 hours.

354
00:39:53,098 --> 00:39:54,771
Could you treat me to some fish porridge?

355
00:39:55,367 --> 00:39:57,608
Have I even seen the girl who's coming?

356
00:39:58,937 --> 00:39:59,881
Let's go.

357
00:40:03,375 --> 00:40:05,514
After the show, should I phone before
I coming back?

358
00:40:05,877 --> 00:40:06,821
That would be best.

359
00:40:10,449 --> 00:40:12,690
Whatever you do, don't do it on my bed.

360
00:40:36,275 --> 00:40:38,414
Hey, what are you up to?

361
00:40:38,644 --> 00:40:39,748
Is there a power shortage?

362
00:40:43,782 --> 00:40:44,624
Oh, it's you.

363
00:40:46,985 --> 00:40:49,022
My, but you're thrifty.

364
00:40:50,055 --> 00:40:51,159
What are you doing here?

365
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:56,837
No one invited me to the show?

366
00:40:57,329 --> 00:40:58,450
Do you want to see the show?

367
00:40:58,630 --> 00:41:00,507
No, it's too long.

368
00:41:01,166 --> 00:41:02,076
Go see something else.

369
00:41:02,701 --> 00:41:06,774
No, there's enough to see at home
Don't need to go out.

370
00:41:12,144 --> 00:41:13,248
Go to instant noodle's

371
00:41:13,679 --> 00:41:15,056
I won't go.

372
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:16,481
Then go to Auntie's

373
00:41:16,848 --> 00:41:17,849
I'm broke.

374
00:41:27,993 --> 00:41:31,270
$30, that's not enough for 2 hours.

375
00:41:39,204 --> 00:41:41,377
Wow, this girl is really precious.

376
00:41:44,209 --> 00:41:45,552
Go before I kick you downstairs.

377
00:41:46,011 --> 00:41:47,319
OK, I'm going.

378
00:41:52,184 --> 00:41:53,629
It's enough for 3 hours.

379
00:41:53,685 --> 00:41:54,390
Bastard.

380
00:41:54,853 --> 00:41:56,454
You're my brother, I'll give you advice.

381
00:41:56,888 --> 00:41:58,888
There's a nice, quiet place
where the food is good.

382
00:41:58,890 --> 00:41:59,698
Go to hell.

383
00:42:08,367 --> 00:42:09,675
Bye bye.

384
00:42:11,603 --> 00:42:13,771
Mother says to at least rinse it
if you can't wash it.

385
00:42:13,772 --> 00:42:15,012
She hates rats and cockroaches.

386
00:42:22,647 --> 00:42:23,717
Bean Cake.

387
00:42:29,955 --> 00:42:33,767
You're the only one left in the store.

388
00:42:35,394 --> 00:42:37,931
My brother wants nine glasses of
egg nogs.

389
00:42:39,264 --> 00:42:44,577
Make it up to him and make it snappy
he is in a hurry.

390
00:42:45,771 --> 00:42:46,909
Nine glasses?

391
00:42:47,406 --> 00:42:50,580
9 glasses and not one less, I'm going.

392
00:43:41,693 --> 00:43:42,671
Who are you looking for?

393
00:43:43,195 --> 00:43:44,435
Is Mr. Leong here?

394
00:43:45,297 --> 00:43:46,002
Not here.

395
00:43:46,331 --> 00:43:49,039
My name's Fong, I have things to
discuses with him.

396
00:43:50,869 --> 00:43:52,246
My friend ask me to come here.

397
00:43:52,671 --> 00:43:54,742
He said Leong is generous in help
the needy!

398
00:43:54,806 --> 00:43:55,766
Leave your phone number?

399
00:44:01,012 --> 00:44:02,116
Here it is.

400
00:45:07,212 --> 00:45:08,282
What's up?

401
00:45:09,614 --> 00:45:12,288
Delivering the egg nogs.

402
00:45:12,817 --> 00:45:13,761
Who ordered them?

403
00:45:16,721 --> 00:45:17,722
OK, put them here.

404
00:45:40,011 --> 00:45:41,183
Is there anything else?

405
00:45:42,581 --> 00:45:43,651
No, let's go.

406
00:45:51,823 --> 00:45:52,824
Collecting bottles.

407
00:45:52,958 --> 00:45:53,902
No bottles to collect.

408
00:46:13,845 --> 00:46:16,689
My god, look who's making a call?

409
00:46:16,881 --> 00:46:19,862
I wanted to phone you from the store.

410
00:46:19,951 --> 00:46:21,512
I phoned and phoned but never got line.

411
00:46:22,354 --> 00:46:24,391
It's going bad before it even started.

412
00:46:35,667 --> 00:46:36,372
Mother?

413
00:46:37,402 --> 00:46:38,472
She went to the show.

414
00:46:40,505 --> 00:46:43,952
Work it over any loose change,
small notes or big notes.

415
00:46:50,415 --> 00:46:51,189
Fine.

416
00:46:54,352 --> 00:46:55,330
What's up?

417
00:46:55,787 --> 00:46:57,867
They want to come over to
your place, instead of mine.

418
00:46:57,889 --> 00:46:58,649
That's even better.

419
00:46:59,858 --> 00:47:00,962
Sixth uncle.

420
00:47:01,026 --> 00:47:06,203
You come too, please sit wherever.

421
00:47:06,564 --> 00:47:07,685
Help us get the game set up.

422
00:47:09,734 --> 00:47:10,838
Bring out the mahjong set.

423
00:47:12,704 --> 00:47:16,618
Change the set, this one brings me bad
luck.

424
00:47:16,708 --> 00:47:18,551
Don't change it, there's no need to change

425
00:47:19,110 --> 00:47:22,091
I'm a just man and I say there's no need.

426
00:47:22,213 --> 00:47:24,819
No, I still think we should change the set.

427
00:47:24,883 --> 00:47:26,260
Let me make a bet.

428
00:47:26,317 --> 00:47:28,820
This set will do, don't waste time.

429
00:47:28,887 --> 00:47:34,200
Game 1 1,6, game 2 1,6, game 3 1,6.

430
00:47:34,726 --> 00:47:37,866
Missy, this is no laughing matter.

431
00:47:37,929 --> 00:47:39,567
This is the number I want.

432
00:48:14,532 --> 00:48:15,875
Let's go home.

433
00:48:36,955 --> 00:48:37,865
Your auntie hasn't gone to sleep yet?

434
00:48:38,323 --> 00:48:41,031
I won't know until I go home and see.

435
00:54:06,049 --> 00:54:08,723
Kathy, Shinsuke is here.

436
00:54:29,005 --> 00:54:30,678
When did you arrive in Hong Kong?

437
00:54:31,107 --> 00:54:32,245
Just now?

438
00:54:37,380 --> 00:54:38,620
What's happening?

439
00:54:39,315 --> 00:54:42,023
I've left the Red Army.

440
00:54:44,854 --> 00:54:48,563
I should have left a long time ago
like you told me to.

441
00:54:56,265 --> 00:54:59,109
Now I'm a deserter.

442
00:55:06,576 --> 00:55:08,556
Any Red Army member can kill me.

443
00:55:10,179 --> 00:55:11,283
Take this opportunity.

444
00:55:11,781 --> 00:55:13,954
I'll play it again for you
the Beethoven's 5th symphony

445
00:55:14,350 --> 00:55:18,526
I say good-bye to my friends,
my husband and my son.

446
00:55:19,155 --> 00:55:23,399
I hope that when they hear this music

447
00:55:23,593 --> 00:55:25,732
they'll keep up their spirit and live.

448
00:55:30,566 --> 00:55:32,011
Is that really your mother's voice?

449
00:55:32,635 --> 00:55:34,273
How come it sounds so young?

450
00:55:35,271 --> 00:55:36,579
She was already 45 years old.

451
00:55:36,973 --> 00:55:38,975
She presented classical music on radio.

452
00:55:39,308 --> 00:55:40,309
There's loads of them.

453
00:56:03,666 --> 00:56:06,840
Before she died, that was the year before.

454
00:56:07,803 --> 00:56:09,305
She said to me, Louis

455
00:56:09,505 --> 00:56:10,950
when you think of me,

456
00:56:11,240 --> 00:56:12,412
you listen to these tapes.

457
00:56:16,546 --> 00:56:17,923
Do you still miss her?

458
00:56:25,154 --> 00:56:26,154
Did Kathy come?

459
00:56:26,155 --> 00:56:27,259
No, the master is upstairs.

460
00:56:40,002 --> 00:56:41,174
Continue, don't mind me

461
00:56:47,877 --> 00:56:49,447
I'm Pong, are you Tomato?

462
00:56:50,446 --> 00:56:52,119
Tomato is inside.

463
00:56:57,153 --> 00:56:58,393
How is it? Good sister.

464
00:56:59,088 --> 00:57:02,626
Kathy is late, this is
Tomato, this is Pong.

465
00:57:07,230 --> 00:57:08,470
We went rowing the other day
so much fun.

466
00:57:08,531 --> 00:57:09,531
How come you're with him?

467
00:57:09,899 --> 00:57:11,071
Me with him?

468
00:57:11,300 --> 00:57:12,404
You mean he's with me.

469
00:57:12,802 --> 00:57:13,746
When I entered

470
00:57:13,803 --> 00:57:15,563
I thought the girl playing the piano
was you.

471
00:57:25,214 --> 00:57:26,659
She's his step-mother.

472
00:57:28,017 --> 00:57:31,988
Your step-mother? She's got class.

473
00:57:34,824 --> 00:57:36,098
Where did you get this?

474
00:57:36,626 --> 00:57:38,071
That Jap was such a jerk.

475
00:57:38,494 --> 00:57:40,599
I'm his assistant chef
but he gets on my nerves.

476
00:57:40,930 --> 00:57:42,739
Couldn't take it so I sneaked out

477
00:57:42,798 --> 00:57:43,742
to play pinball.

478
00:57:43,899 --> 00:57:46,903
He found out and gave me a piece of shit

479
00:57:46,969 --> 00:57:48,209
he threatens to fire me.

480
00:57:48,337 --> 00:57:50,442
You know I have very little patience.

481
00:57:50,940 --> 00:57:53,284
So I took this back.

482
00:57:57,213 --> 00:58:00,353
Believe it or not, I can cut a 1001 piece
sashimi out of this.

483
00:58:01,450 --> 00:58:02,970
Didn't you say you were a taxi driver?

484
00:58:04,854 --> 00:58:06,026
That was before.

485
00:58:06,856 --> 00:58:07,800
What now?

486
00:58:08,491 --> 00:58:11,836
I'm taking it easy, careful I don't steal
your job.

487
00:58:14,430 --> 00:58:15,272
What are you doing?

488
00:58:17,099 --> 00:58:18,442
Where's the kitchen?
Keep this in the fridge.

489
00:58:18,501 --> 00:58:19,275
Outside.

490
00:58:24,073 --> 00:58:24,778
Kathy.

491
00:58:25,241 --> 00:58:26,015
Pong.

492
00:58:27,743 --> 00:58:30,087
He is my friend from Japan, Takedashi.

493
00:58:30,846 --> 00:58:34,794
This is Pong, have a seat first

494
00:58:36,118 --> 00:58:37,461
I have to look for Louis.

495
00:58:59,141 --> 00:58:59,915
See you later.

496
00:59:06,916 --> 00:59:07,553
Good evening.

497
00:59:09,418 --> 00:59:17,418
I like the freedom young people
in Harajuku have.

498
00:59:20,196 --> 00:59:21,573
Kathy wants me to guest him.

499
00:59:37,213 --> 00:59:42,595
As long as you're open minded

500
00:59:42,985 --> 00:59:44,760
you can feel free anywhere.

501
00:59:45,154 --> 00:59:50,126
Not in Hong Kong, it's too crowded.

502
00:59:51,394 --> 00:59:56,036
Tokyo has 3 million more people than
Hong Kong.

503
00:59:56,399 --> 00:59:59,608
A more dense population.

504
00:59:59,668 --> 01:00:01,670
Not the same

505
01:00:01,871 --> 01:00:06,013
the Japanese are being dressed.

506
01:00:06,075 --> 01:00:08,248
Daddy? Is Nomad in Hong Kong?

507
01:00:10,045 --> 01:00:10,853
Where is it berth?

508
01:00:13,115 --> 01:00:15,391
Nothing, a friend of mine wants to stay
a few days.

509
01:00:17,119 --> 01:00:18,894
Good, we'll get in touch.

510
01:00:19,989 --> 01:00:20,763
What did he said?

511
01:00:21,590 --> 01:00:22,728
He said it's a shame

512
01:00:22,992 --> 01:00:25,495
Japan has a lot Chinese don't appreciate.

513
01:00:26,529 --> 01:00:28,509
Unbelievable, what does
Japan have to offer.

514
01:00:28,898 --> 01:00:30,900
Tea ceremony, flower arrangement,
karate...

515
01:00:31,033 --> 01:00:33,570
Everything borrowed from China.

516
01:00:34,403 --> 01:00:36,906
Chinese can't preserve what's good
in their culture.

517
01:00:37,506 --> 01:00:40,112
They should thank the Japanese
are doing it well for them.

518
01:00:40,709 --> 01:00:41,983
So, you speak Chinese.

519
01:00:42,711 --> 01:00:45,487
My dad was stationed at Nanking during
the war.

520
01:00:45,881 --> 01:00:48,157
He taught me, but I'm not good at it.

521
01:00:49,552 --> 01:00:50,360
Nanking.

522
01:00:50,753 --> 01:00:52,790
Ask him how many Chinese his dad
slaughtered.

523
01:00:53,956 --> 01:00:57,096
Ask him if he had a taste of Chinese
Kung-fu.

524
01:01:24,687 --> 01:01:26,496
A real kung-fu expert

525
01:01:27,156 --> 01:01:29,261
will inhale and exhale silently.

526
01:01:58,821 --> 01:01:59,942
A real Sino-Japanese battle.

527
01:01:59,955 --> 01:02:00,595
What's going on?

528
01:02:01,323 --> 01:02:02,825
Stop it, we're all friends.

529
01:02:12,301 --> 01:02:13,211
What friend?

530
01:02:13,636 --> 01:02:15,138
We may be friends but he's Japanese.

531
01:02:20,509 --> 01:02:23,046
Tell him not to worry, we'll take him
to go on early tomorrow.

532
01:02:25,848 --> 01:02:28,692
Don't worry, Louis will take care of you.

533
01:03:04,353 --> 01:03:06,390
Do you like Oki Masao?

534
01:03:09,091 --> 01:03:12,868
This was his most acclaimed piece

535
01:03:13,963 --> 01:03:15,909
at Milan fashion show recently.

536
01:03:17,967 --> 01:03:20,004
Oki Masao? Yes, I know

537
01:03:20,069 --> 01:03:21,548
I'm a great admirer of his fashion design.

538
01:03:21,604 --> 01:03:22,965
Sorry, I don't understand Japanese.

539
01:03:22,972 --> 01:03:23,916
Louis.

540
01:03:25,107 --> 01:03:25,812
Stella.

541
01:03:27,876 --> 01:03:29,048
Kathy didn't come?

542
01:03:29,878 --> 01:03:30,652
No.

543
01:03:31,747 --> 01:03:34,159
Let me introduce you, this is Louis.

544
01:03:34,383 --> 01:03:36,451
He is my niece Kathy's friend.

545
01:03:36,452 --> 01:03:38,693
He studies fashion design, likes the
Japanese best.

546
01:03:38,754 --> 01:03:39,562
Mr. Louis.

547
01:03:40,889 --> 01:03:42,334
This is Miss Chiyoko.

548
01:03:42,625 --> 01:03:44,662
She's Oki Masao assistant.

549
01:03:46,095 --> 01:03:47,768
She came here especially from Tokyo.

550
01:03:47,930 --> 01:03:49,850
She helps the preparation
for this fashion show?

551
01:03:50,633 --> 01:03:53,910
Have you met Kathy's boyfriend?

552
01:03:54,336 --> 01:03:55,697
I want to ask him to be our model.

553
01:03:55,771 --> 01:03:56,681
You mean Pong?

554
01:03:57,940 --> 01:04:00,250
No, the Japanese guy, Shinsuke.

555
01:04:06,248 --> 01:04:07,226
Shinsuke?

556
01:04:08,784 --> 01:04:12,129
Kathy's boyfriend, just arrived form Japan.

557
01:04:13,288 --> 01:04:17,202
Kathy has quite a few boyfriends.

558
01:04:18,260 --> 01:04:19,300
Are these two swords real?

559
01:04:19,862 --> 01:04:22,968
He wants to know if these swords are real.

560
01:04:23,032 --> 01:04:26,206
They're real but not authentic.

561
01:04:27,569 --> 01:04:30,573
It's based on the old sword of Yagyu.

562
01:04:32,975 --> 01:04:33,953
She said it is real.

563
01:04:34,009 --> 01:04:37,183
It's based on the old sword of Yagyu.

564
01:04:38,681 --> 01:04:40,627
Not bad, style quite good.

565
01:04:41,016 --> 01:04:43,360
I know, it's shogun's samurai.

566
01:04:44,386 --> 01:04:46,024
He knows Shogun's Samurai.

567
01:04:50,292 --> 01:04:51,293
T.V.

568
01:04:52,661 --> 01:04:54,231
Conspiracy of Yagyu.

569
01:04:56,832 --> 01:04:58,153
But the moment I saw these swords

570
01:04:58,167 --> 01:05:00,841
it reminded me of Samurais
committing suicide.

571
01:05:01,904 --> 01:05:05,681
Yes, excellent progress.

572
01:05:14,049 --> 01:05:18,930
He is in Hong Kong now,

573
01:05:19,655 --> 01:05:22,966
but we still don't know where he's
hiding.

574
01:05:24,159 --> 01:05:27,140
All concerned parties have been found.

575
01:05:27,796 --> 01:05:32,108
None have the power to block our plan.
There's no danger.

576
01:05:32,701 --> 01:05:37,810
All we lack now is the last assault
No problem at all.

577
01:05:38,640 --> 01:05:46,640
Thanks, we'll complete our mission soon.

578
01:05:55,390 --> 01:05:58,428
Let me declare again that I don't love you.

579
01:06:01,196 --> 01:06:04,734
Our love and spiritual lives have nothing
in common.

580
01:06:05,768 --> 01:06:07,213
What about the sex lives?

581
01:06:07,903 --> 01:06:09,041
Were there sex life?

582
01:06:09,938 --> 01:06:11,713
He wishes there were.

583
01:06:12,374 --> 01:06:13,478
Be more serious.

584
01:06:18,413 --> 01:06:21,326
Our lives have nothing in common...

585
01:06:23,452 --> 01:06:24,624
and no future.

586
01:06:27,956 --> 01:06:29,264
Please stop pestering me.

587
01:06:31,760 --> 01:06:32,830
Just a moment.

588
01:06:50,078 --> 01:06:50,852
It's finished.

589
01:06:52,014 --> 01:06:55,154
If things go on like this,
I'll turn into psychopath.

590
01:07:00,789 --> 01:07:02,564
We both suffer.

591
01:07:03,492 --> 01:07:04,835
I never want to see you again.

592
01:07:06,195 --> 01:07:08,368
Why don't you split and get lost.

593
01:07:09,331 --> 01:07:10,731
This will do, it's ruthless enough.

594
01:07:11,967 --> 01:07:12,638
Enough.

595
01:07:15,737 --> 01:07:17,774
You have to deliver this for me in a while.

596
01:07:19,174 --> 01:07:19,982
Louis.

597
01:07:20,776 --> 01:07:22,221
Buy me something to drink?

598
01:07:26,982 --> 01:07:27,926
What do you want to drink?

599
01:07:27,983 --> 01:07:28,893
Anything will do.

600
01:07:59,681 --> 01:08:01,354
I have a letter for Tomato.

601
01:08:13,362 --> 01:08:14,466
I can leave it with you.

602
01:08:16,031 --> 01:08:17,135
Come on in.

603
01:08:29,378 --> 01:08:31,016
Would you mind pouring us some tea.

604
01:08:31,079 --> 01:08:31,880
Please don't bother?

605
01:08:36,585 --> 01:08:37,345
Please have a seat.

606
01:08:42,391 --> 01:08:43,096
Sit.

607
01:09:26,768 --> 01:09:28,408
There's no tea, will a soft drink do?

608
01:09:28,470 --> 01:09:29,244
Fine.

609
01:09:30,906 --> 01:09:33,045
We're out of soft drinks, how about water?

610
01:09:33,141 --> 01:09:34,484
Anything will do.

611
01:09:39,081 --> 01:09:40,253
Ice water.

612
01:10:13,448 --> 01:10:16,122
Somebody here with a letter for me.

613
01:10:16,852 --> 01:10:19,162
<i>Let me declare again that I don't love you.</i>

614
01:10:19,354 --> 01:10:23,598
<i>Our love and spiritual lives have nothing
in common</i>

615
01:10:23,725 --> 01:10:26,865
<i>and no future, please stop pestering me.</i>

616
01:10:27,329 --> 01:10:30,936
<i>If things go on like this,
I'll turn into psychopath.</i>

617
01:10:31,133 --> 01:10:33,238
<i>We bother suffer.</i>

618
01:10:33,702 --> 01:10:35,545
<i>I never want to see you again.</i>

619
01:10:35,670 --> 01:10:37,843
<i>Why don't you split and get lost.</i>

620
01:10:38,040 --> 01:10:40,919
<i>The bearer of this letter is my true love</i>

621
01:10:40,976 --> 01:10:42,319
<i>forever.</i>

622
01:10:42,644 --> 01:10:46,182
<i>You're good, it's just that he's better
than you much more.</i>

623
01:10:46,681 --> 01:10:49,025
<i>See for yourself, no fight.</i>

624
01:10:52,254 --> 01:10:53,774
No fight, what do you mean "no fight".

625
01:10:53,822 --> 01:10:55,130
It means no comparison.

626
01:10:58,326 --> 01:10:59,498
No fight.

627
01:11:00,429 --> 01:11:02,102
No fight, what do you mean "no fight".

628
01:11:03,532 --> 01:11:04,806
No fight... No fight.

629
01:11:06,001 --> 01:11:07,071
Auntie, I'm not...

630
01:11:08,537 --> 01:11:09,379
Auntie...

631
01:11:14,042 --> 01:11:15,487
OK, I'll show you a real fight.

632
01:11:20,382 --> 01:11:21,520
He really fell.

633
01:11:23,251 --> 01:11:27,199
You must go to shopping very often?

634
01:11:28,223 --> 01:11:34,697
Yes, about three times a week.

635
01:11:36,431 --> 01:11:40,743
Have any hobby?

636
01:11:43,605 --> 01:11:47,712
How many times you play mahjong
in one week.

637
01:11:47,976 --> 01:11:49,216
Where is Kathy?

638
01:11:49,644 --> 01:11:52,625
She said she'll wait here no reason
she shouldn't.

639
01:11:53,448 --> 01:11:54,518
How would I know?

640
01:11:55,484 --> 01:11:58,761
Hey! Did you know I made it with Kathy
last night?

641
01:11:59,154 --> 01:11:59,928
Really?

642
01:12:00,222 --> 01:12:01,166
Do you know where?

643
01:12:01,823 --> 01:12:02,961
At Disco Disco?

644
01:12:03,024 --> 01:12:03,627
No.

645
01:12:03,992 --> 01:12:04,629
City Hall?

646
01:12:04,926 --> 01:12:05,426
No.

647
01:12:05,794 --> 01:12:06,431
Space Centre?

648
01:12:07,162 --> 01:12:07,936
Wrong again

649
01:12:08,663 --> 01:12:09,437
I can't guess.

650
01:12:10,165 --> 01:12:13,305
Next time, maybe the subway.

651
01:12:19,341 --> 01:12:23,619
Water proof.

652
01:12:24,813 --> 01:12:26,884
You must go to shopping very often?

653
01:12:26,948 --> 01:12:33,263
Yes, about three times a week.

654
01:12:39,261 --> 01:12:46,543
Louis... Louis...

655
01:12:47,369 --> 01:12:48,507
He didn't fell down?

656
01:12:54,242 --> 01:12:55,585
What are you doing up there?

657
01:12:58,914 --> 01:13:01,690
Yearly at this time he goes by the route
to Arabia.

658
01:13:09,024 --> 01:13:10,291
Next month

659
01:13:10,292 --> 01:13:11,430
it will be our turn to sail past there.

660
01:13:11,560 --> 01:13:12,800
And then go straight to Arabia.

661
01:13:13,662 --> 01:13:15,903
I've thought it over, and I still
want to go Japan first.

662
01:13:16,298 --> 01:13:18,403
Otherwise, I'd die unfulfilled.

663
01:13:20,135 --> 01:13:21,307
Does Kathy approve?

664
01:13:21,536 --> 01:13:22,708
What you're afraid of?

665
01:13:23,939 --> 01:13:26,419
No, but Arabia is too far.

666
01:13:26,608 --> 01:13:28,248
Besides, next month is still a long time.

667
01:13:28,310 --> 01:13:29,871
Who knows what it will be like the day.

668
01:13:35,050 --> 01:13:37,291
And then I might have moved to Outer
Space.

669
01:13:44,926 --> 01:13:46,872
Good morning.

670
01:13:52,968 --> 01:13:55,107
Louis, where's Kathy?

671
01:13:55,303 --> 01:13:57,180
Miss Chiyoko wants to find her.

672
01:13:57,239 --> 01:13:59,319
Yeah, I don't know where those two guys
hide my wife.

673
01:14:02,777 --> 01:14:04,552
I'm so embarrassed to disturb you.

674
01:14:04,813 --> 01:14:09,421
Has Kathy gone looking for her new
boyfriend?

675
01:14:10,819 --> 01:14:12,140
What has he said that's so funny?

676
01:14:14,623 --> 01:14:17,365
This idiot is also looking
for his girlfriend.

677
01:14:17,425 --> 01:14:19,593
You mustn't tell him.

678
01:14:19,594 --> 01:14:25,977
Kathy's with her boyfriend on the Nomad.

679
01:14:39,948 --> 01:14:42,149
What's Nomad? I thought it was agreed to
keep it secret.

680
01:14:42,183 --> 01:14:43,184
Nobody's allowed to reveal where's Nomad.

681
01:14:43,518 --> 01:14:45,293
What is Nomad?

682
01:14:46,955 --> 01:14:49,629
It's Louis' father's boat,

683
01:14:49,791 --> 01:14:54,103
all black and very special.

684
01:14:55,997 --> 01:14:57,318
What Nomad are you taking about?

685
01:14:58,333 --> 01:14:59,277
Nothing.

686
01:14:59,968 --> 01:15:02,949
These kids plan to go to Arabia
on Nomad.

687
01:15:03,338 --> 01:15:04,339
Isn't it ridiculous?

688
01:15:04,639 --> 01:15:05,743
She said Nomad again.

689
01:15:06,875 --> 01:15:08,513
What are they talking about?

690
01:15:11,179 --> 01:15:12,522
Speak up, where's Kathy?

691
01:15:16,685 --> 01:15:18,631
Come with us to Arabia,

692
01:15:19,988 --> 01:15:21,695
the Nomad is very safe.

693
01:15:24,626 --> 01:15:28,472
Where to? Brazil?

694
01:15:29,664 --> 01:15:32,702
South Africa or Switzerland?

695
01:15:46,748 --> 01:15:48,591
Kathy, did you remember

696
01:15:49,184 --> 01:15:50,891
where I've been to this year?

697
01:16:01,596 --> 01:16:04,008
Even I can't remember all the place.

698
01:16:06,065 --> 01:16:07,169
But Arabia is not the same.

699
01:16:08,034 --> 01:16:09,809
It's not one's native land.

700
01:16:11,170 --> 01:16:13,013
I want to return to Japan.

701
01:16:15,074 --> 01:16:17,384
I want to go back to Japan.

702
01:16:18,745 --> 01:16:24,320
Remember how deserters are treated
by Red Army.

703
01:16:24,951 --> 01:16:27,625
They'll force you to commit hara-kiri.

704
01:16:31,858 --> 01:16:36,102
You can't avoid death, why run away?

705
01:16:38,399 --> 01:16:42,870
Come with us, I guarantee nobody
can find you

706
01:16:48,876 --> 01:16:52,119
I'd rather die in Japan.

707
01:17:29,984 --> 01:17:31,622
You've changed.

708
01:17:32,086 --> 01:17:35,329
Yes, I've not been able to sleep well
in past months.

709
01:17:35,623 --> 01:17:38,536
Because whenever I close my eyes

710
01:17:39,160 --> 01:17:41,401
I dream of being executed.

711
01:17:42,463 --> 01:17:43,965
You're not that weak.

712
01:17:45,933 --> 01:17:52,441
Yes I am, I've seen too much blood in fact.

713
01:17:54,475 --> 01:17:57,718
I cannot be a cold-blooded "Red Army"
anymore.

714
01:18:05,953 --> 01:18:13,953
We're going with Pong and Louis to Lantau
Island in a few days.

715
01:18:14,962 --> 01:18:18,068
Come with us.

716
01:18:20,168 --> 01:18:23,206
Do you like Pong?

717
01:18:23,504 --> 01:18:24,107
Yes.

718
01:18:26,374 --> 01:18:30,186
Because he's both coarse and tender?

719
01:18:32,480 --> 01:18:34,426
Yeah, when I'm with him

720
01:18:34,482 --> 01:18:36,985
I don't have to waste so much energy
to think.

721
01:18:37,051 --> 01:18:41,193
Only the physical, purely physical.

722
01:23:36,917 --> 01:23:39,261
No direct contact,

723
01:23:39,720 --> 01:23:42,257
but I know he's on a yacht.

724
01:23:43,023 --> 01:23:44,743
We've already found out where it's located.

725
01:23:44,825 --> 01:23:46,202
We'll make our move immediately.

726
01:23:47,027 --> 01:23:49,473
Good, our orders are, at whatever
sacrifice

727
01:23:49,530 --> 01:23:50,975
the renegade must be executed in HK.

728
01:23:51,065 --> 01:23:52,442
He must commit hara-kiri.

729
01:23:53,300 --> 01:23:54,472
Yes.

730
01:23:55,169 --> 01:23:56,530
Strictly confidential, top secret.

731
01:23:57,471 --> 01:23:58,609
Yes.

732
01:24:48,554 --> 01:24:49,498
Kathy.

733
01:24:56,228 --> 01:24:57,948
Hey, we already stayed here several days.

734
01:24:58,164 --> 01:25:01,839
We won't come to any conclusion.
Let's go.

735
01:25:02,568 --> 01:25:04,343
Good, let's go.

736
01:25:04,570 --> 01:25:05,640
You miss that Jap.

737
01:25:05,738 --> 01:25:07,911
I am, so what.

738
01:25:08,274 --> 01:25:11,414
He must feel lonely on Nomad,
let's to visit him.

739
01:25:16,048 --> 01:25:19,029
We do nothing for the society.

740
01:25:19,585 --> 01:25:21,565
What society, we are the society.

741
01:27:09,829 --> 01:27:12,639
Japs... That's an insult.

742
01:27:12,898 --> 01:27:14,468
Why doesn't he come over?

743
01:27:15,734 --> 01:27:16,906
Let's go swimming.

744
01:27:17,169 --> 01:27:19,513
Faster.

745
01:27:32,351 --> 01:27:33,796
Run, she's going to kill you.

746
01:27:41,427 --> 01:27:44,567
Pong... Pong

747
01:27:44,663 --> 01:27:46,165
Kathy, don't go out.

748
01:27:46,232 --> 01:27:49,873
Pong... Pong.

749
01:28:41,633 --> 01:28:42,833
Hara-kiri.

750
01:29:26,302 --> 01:29:27,602
Cut off his head.
