1
00:02:43,325 --> 00:02:44,785
Katya, darling.

2
00:02:44,952 --> 00:02:46,662
Don't, you mustn't.

3
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:50,207
It was all such a long
time ago, Georgia.

4
00:02:51,625 --> 00:02:54,503
Not for me, Katya. Not for me.

5
00:02:55,421 --> 00:02:57,923
It's the blood of my
daughter on that blade.

6
00:02:59,174 --> 00:03:02,803
I cling to my hatred as
I cling to this dagger.

7
00:03:04,471 --> 00:03:06,682
Before I die, I swear...

8
00:03:06,682 --> 00:03:08,891
...I'll see this dagger
plunged into his throat.

9
00:03:10,935 --> 00:03:16,274
As I saw it in Tanya's because of him.

10
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:27,785
Crying won't help now.

11
00:03:33,624 --> 00:03:34,708
Go...

12
00:04:22,756 --> 00:04:25,592
He's back. Kurt is back.

13
00:04:27,677 --> 00:04:28,804
Georgia!

14
00:04:32,724 --> 00:04:39,356
Yes, Kurt is back.
You can't stop the hand of fate.

15
00:05:14,933 --> 00:05:17,811
Milord, Milord, Kurt is back!

16
00:05:18,019 --> 00:05:19,229
What did you say?

17
00:05:19,229 --> 00:05:20,564
Kurt is back.

18
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:23,775
Yes, Losat, I'm back.

19
00:05:36,663 --> 00:05:38,790
I told you never to come back.

20
00:05:41,209 --> 00:05:43,044
Who are you trying to frighten, Kurt?

21
00:05:44,588 --> 00:05:45,839
No one.

22
00:05:46,464 --> 00:05:48,925
I came back because
I heard of your marriage.

23
00:05:50,468 --> 00:05:51,511
Good luck.

24
00:06:02,355 --> 00:06:03,647
My compliments, Nevenka.

25
00:06:06,024 --> 00:06:06,983
Thank you, Kurt.

26
00:06:08,735 --> 00:06:11,571
Tell the truth, Kurt.
What do you want?

27
00:06:12,447 --> 00:06:18,161
Brother, I came back to compliment
you on your choice of a wife.

28
00:06:19,037 --> 00:06:20,620
You must be tired, Kurt.

29
00:06:21,371 --> 00:06:24,666
Kurt, you're not my son.
You're a serpent.

30
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,627
You like to make others suffer.

31
00:06:27,669 --> 00:06:30,213
You seduced Tanya, and
then abandoned her,

32
00:06:30,464 --> 00:06:32,215
...causing her to kill herself.

33
00:06:34,301 --> 00:06:36,219
The same old story.

34
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:38,597
Father, you promised.

35
00:06:39,431 --> 00:06:42,476
He didn't come back to
seek my forgiveness.

36
00:06:43,185 --> 00:06:47,731
You're so wrong, father.
I also came back for that.

37
00:06:47,898 --> 00:06:50,817
No, I don't believe you.

38
00:06:51,318 --> 00:06:53,487
Are you afraid of me, Christian?

39
00:06:54,863 --> 00:06:57,448
That which was once mine is now yours.

40
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:01,242
Now, it is you who are
the favorite son.

41
00:07:02,326 --> 00:07:04,118
I've never been afraid of you.

42
00:07:04,285 --> 00:07:09,332
As far as I'm concerned,
you can stay if you want to.

43
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:14,128
All right, Kurt, you can stay.

44
00:07:18,049 --> 00:07:20,258
I've never had a warmer welcome.

45
00:08:06,096 --> 00:08:08,181
It's wonderful to see things being born,

46
00:08:08,473 --> 00:08:11,226
...to see them born and to see them die.

47
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,730
Let me go.

48
00:08:14,938 --> 00:08:16,522
My pretty little cousin.

49
00:08:16,939 --> 00:08:18,858
You're still in love with my brother.

50
00:08:18,858 --> 00:08:21,067
You wouldn't exactly
refuse him if he -

51
00:08:21,067 --> 00:08:22,569
You miserable wretch.

52
00:08:22,569 --> 00:08:25,612
You always wanted to marry him.
Didn't you, Katya?

53
00:08:25,947 --> 00:08:27,198
And instead?

54
00:08:27,782 --> 00:08:29,617
You should hate me, you know?

55
00:08:29,993 --> 00:08:33,204
After all, Christian's marriage
was bitter for you too.

56
00:08:55,101 --> 00:08:56,144
Poisoned?

57
00:08:57,103 --> 00:08:59,981
No, that's not the way
it'll be, Kurt Menliff.

58
00:09:01,357 --> 00:09:03,902
You'll die the same way
you made my daughter die.

59
00:09:04,611 --> 00:09:06,780
I obtained forgiveness
from the masters.

60
00:09:06,988 --> 00:09:09,866
I would not presume
to that of the servants.

61
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:14,662
Ah, here are the masters.

62
00:09:18,832 --> 00:09:20,918
I see you've already
had your tea, Kurt.

63
00:09:21,669 --> 00:09:24,506
Yes, I'm not in the habit of waiting.

64
00:09:24,881 --> 00:09:26,549
Nobody asked you to.

65
00:09:28,301 --> 00:09:29,803
You did well to remind me.

66
00:09:35,225 --> 00:09:38,812
You shouldn't treat him like that.
You'll only make things worse.

67
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:41,438
You don't know him well,

68
00:09:42,147 --> 00:09:44,066
...if you think he could be worse.

69
00:10:09,716 --> 00:10:11,552
It is I, Father.

70
00:10:13,136 --> 00:10:15,178
There was a time when
you weren't so afraid...

71
00:10:15,179 --> 00:10:17,306
...when I came to say goodnight.

72
00:10:17,306 --> 00:10:18,349
Remember?

73
00:10:20,351 --> 00:10:23,146
You showed me the way.
I've never forgotten it.

74
00:10:25,148 --> 00:10:26,273
What do you want?

75
00:10:28,734 --> 00:10:30,069
I have your forgiveness,

76
00:10:30,778 --> 00:10:33,614
...but I must have my
rights restored to me,

77
00:10:33,614 --> 00:10:35,489
...my title and patrimony.

78
00:10:36,241 --> 00:10:38,033
I shall soon be dead.

79
00:10:39,577 --> 00:10:42,454
I have not enough time
to put you to the test.

80
00:10:43,622 --> 00:10:46,791
Whatever was yours, you forfeited.

81
00:10:47,292 --> 00:10:48,293
Forever!

82
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:51,462
You did it yourself
with your infamy.

83
00:10:51,921 --> 00:10:53,256
Be careful, father.

84
00:10:53,256 --> 00:10:54,716
Get out of here!

85
00:10:55,675 --> 00:10:57,218
Get out, I tell you.

86
00:11:27,957 --> 00:11:30,293
I think you've got
something against me.

87
00:11:30,835 --> 00:11:32,045
Isn't that true?

88
00:11:32,295 --> 00:11:34,756
You're wrong. I've nothing
for or against you.

89
00:13:34,417 --> 00:13:35,917
Are you afraid of me?

90
00:13:38,878 --> 00:13:40,588
You were fond of me once.

91
00:13:44,633 --> 00:13:45,885
Yes, once.

92
00:14:30,805 --> 00:14:32,765
You haven't changed, I see.

93
00:14:41,065 --> 00:14:42,899
You always loved violence.

94
00:15:47,423 --> 00:15:49,341
You two, search the grounds.

95
00:16:02,938 --> 00:16:04,522
Where is Nevenka?

96
00:16:05,773 --> 00:16:07,275
And how should I know?

97
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:13,281
And that whip?

98
00:16:13,948 --> 00:16:14,991
This?

99
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:18,244
I found it on the road a few
yards outside the gate.

100
00:16:18,786 --> 00:16:20,580
I've been looking at my estates.

101
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:25,417
It'll soon be night.
It'll be harder to find her.

102
00:16:26,251 --> 00:16:28,337
She's right. You'd better hurry.

103
00:16:29,004 --> 00:16:30,005
Let's go.

104
00:16:54,988 --> 00:16:56,990
They make quite a couple.

105
00:16:57,783 --> 00:16:59,493
I have the impression that...

106
00:16:59,868 --> 00:17:03,121
...Katya isn't so
eager to find Nevenka.

107
00:17:07,626 --> 00:17:08,960
You don't agree?

108
00:17:10,253 --> 00:17:12,129
You're a foolish old woman, Georgia.

109
00:17:17,134 --> 00:17:20,471
Let's light a lantern. I want
to have a look in the moats.

110
00:20:17,732 --> 00:20:19,984
<i>Kurt...</i>

111
00:20:24,530 --> 00:20:26,449
<i>Kurt...</i>

112
00:23:11,488 --> 00:23:13,616
Milady, Milady!

113
00:23:14,617 --> 00:23:17,077
Georgia! Georgia!

114
00:23:17,578 --> 00:23:18,829
I found her.

115
00:23:21,497 --> 00:23:22,498
Milady!

116
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,044
God be praised.
I thought she was dead.

117
00:23:26,754 --> 00:23:29,673
Let's take her home.
Come, help me carry her.

118
00:23:46,065 --> 00:23:47,775
She'll come around very soon now.

119
00:23:47,775 --> 00:23:50,026
It must have been fear
more than anything else.

120
00:23:50,194 --> 00:23:52,237
She must have been
thrown from the saddle.

121
00:23:53,030 --> 00:23:54,031
Kurt!?

122
00:23:54,657 --> 00:23:55,741
Where is Kurt?

123
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:58,535
- Go call him.
- Yes, sir.

124
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:15,886
Losat!

125
00:24:17,346 --> 00:24:18,472
Losat!

126
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:24,644
What's wrong with her?

127
00:24:24,644 --> 00:24:25,978
Oh, nothing serious.

128
00:24:26,270 --> 00:24:28,022
Only some welts on her back.

129
00:24:28,439 --> 00:24:29,482
As though -

130
00:24:30,692 --> 00:24:32,694
...as though somebody
had whipped her, Milord.

131
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,072
- Go, go on!
- Yes, sir.

132
00:24:50,670 --> 00:24:52,170
Mister Kurt?

133
00:24:53,505 --> 00:24:54,797
Mister Kurt?

134
00:25:30,207 --> 00:25:31,250
Kurt!

135
00:25:36,881 --> 00:25:38,716
Father, don't look.

136
00:25:39,924 --> 00:25:42,052
I had to stand the sight of him alive.

137
00:25:43,595 --> 00:25:45,346
It - it can't be any worse now.

138
00:25:46,347 --> 00:25:49,059
Look. Look. The dagger.

139
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:51,268
The dagger.

140
00:25:52,478 --> 00:25:53,812
It's Tanya's.

141
00:25:54,938 --> 00:25:56,857
He's died the same death she did.

142
00:25:59,526 --> 00:26:03,447
Tanya. Tanya. Rest now in peace.

143
00:26:16,126 --> 00:26:17,127
God.

144
00:26:18,378 --> 00:26:19,546
Dear God.

145
00:26:20,755 --> 00:26:21,798
Thank you.

146
00:26:22,549 --> 00:26:23,633
Thank you.

147
00:27:09,011 --> 00:27:12,682
Have mercy on me, oh, God,
according to thy great mercy.

148
00:27:12,849 --> 00:27:17,395
Block out mine iniquities.

149
00:27:17,854 --> 00:27:22,608
Wash me from mine iniquities
and cleanse me from my sins,

150
00:27:22,775 --> 00:27:27,113
...for I acknowledge mine iniquity
and my sin is always before me.

151
00:27:28,156 --> 00:27:31,951
Against Thee only have I sinned
and done evil before Thee.

152
00:27:32,243 --> 00:27:37,248
For behold, I was conceived in iniquities
and in sins that my mother conceived me.

153
00:27:37,832 --> 00:27:39,917
Turn away Thy face from my sins.

154
00:27:39,917 --> 00:27:42,003
Cast me not away from Thy face,

155
00:27:42,003 --> 00:27:44,505
...and take not Thy Holy Spirit from me.

156
00:27:45,756 --> 00:27:48,634
Eternal rest,
grant unto him, oh, Lord.

157
00:27:50,344 --> 00:27:54,682
Absolve the souls of the faithful
departed from every bond of sin,

158
00:27:54,891 --> 00:27:57,226
...and by the help of Thy
grace, may they be enabled...

159
00:27:57,226 --> 00:27:59,102
...to escape the avenging judgement.

160
00:27:59,394 --> 00:28:02,647
Oh, God, by whose mercy the souls
of the faithful find rest,

161
00:28:02,898 --> 00:28:06,943
...bless this grave. Release the
souls of all those buried here,

162
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:11,198
...that they may rejoice with Thy saints
forever through Christ our Lord, Amen.

163
00:28:26,546 --> 00:28:31,468
Now, our son, Kurt Menliff, is
ready for the last judgment.

164
00:28:33,637 --> 00:28:36,097
May one day,
who killed him,

165
00:28:36,765 --> 00:28:39,768
...also be directed by God.

166
00:28:41,186 --> 00:28:42,812
Let us pray for him.

167
00:28:51,238 --> 00:28:57,202
In the name of the Father, and of the
Son, and of the Holy Ghost, Amen.

168
00:30:53,568 --> 00:30:54,569
Who is it?

169
00:30:55,028 --> 00:30:56,863
It is I, Christian.

170
00:30:56,863 --> 00:30:58,198
What do you want?

171
00:30:58,823 --> 00:31:01,493
I want to speak to you, father.

172
00:31:06,122 --> 00:31:07,290
I'm listening, son.

173
00:31:09,376 --> 00:31:12,045
I wanted to speak to you about Kurt.

174
00:31:12,712 --> 00:31:14,129
I must know.

175
00:31:15,214 --> 00:31:18,341
It is hard for me to ask
this, but I've got to know.

176
00:31:19,842 --> 00:31:20,843
What?

177
00:31:21,594 --> 00:31:23,388
Everybody was away.

178
00:31:23,638 --> 00:31:25,598
There was only you in the castle.

179
00:31:25,764 --> 00:31:27,556
You and Kurt.

180
00:31:29,184 --> 00:31:32,396
You - you dare ask if I -

181
00:31:33,146 --> 00:31:36,608
I've always obeyed you,
father, as you well know.

182
00:31:36,817 --> 00:31:38,902
I have never dared to question you.

183
00:31:39,069 --> 00:31:40,112
Get out!

184
00:31:41,071 --> 00:31:43,949
Out of obedience, I
married the woman you had...

185
00:31:44,116 --> 00:31:45,991
...once intended for my brother.

186
00:31:46,493 --> 00:31:47,993
But now I must know.

187
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,412
What do you want to know?

188
00:31:49,911 --> 00:31:53,790
If it was you who killed
him, it's an act of justice.

189
00:31:54,208 --> 00:31:55,209
Get out.

190
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:57,461
Get out.

191
00:37:29,084 --> 00:37:30,168
Thank you, Georgia.

192
00:37:54,609 --> 00:37:56,277
What's wrong? Tell me.

193
00:37:57,653 --> 00:37:58,863
I saw Losat.

194
00:37:59,155 --> 00:38:02,491
He said he saw a shadow moving
in the chapel and a light.

195
00:38:07,538 --> 00:38:09,413
Losat is crazier than you.

196
00:38:09,873 --> 00:38:12,751
It was obviously only the
reflection of the moon.

197
00:38:41,071 --> 00:38:42,072
Kurt!

198
00:38:42,864 --> 00:38:43,865
Nevenka!

199
00:38:45,325 --> 00:38:46,535
Kurt.

200
00:38:51,623 --> 00:38:53,291
Nevenka, what's the matter?

201
00:38:54,251 --> 00:38:59,339
It was Kurt. He was watching me.
I saw him.

202
00:39:34,583 --> 00:39:36,459
It's all over, try to rest!

203
00:39:36,459 --> 00:39:39,212
It was only an hallucination.

204
00:39:40,588 --> 00:39:44,300
If you want,
I can stay with you tonight.

205
00:39:45,134 --> 00:39:46,634
You must not be afraid.

206
00:39:49,554 --> 00:39:50,638
No, go to bed.

207
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:53,266
I want to be alone.

208
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:57,603
All right, dear.
I'll leave my door open.

209
00:39:57,811 --> 00:39:59,479
Call me if you need anything.

210
00:43:23,141 --> 00:43:24,142
Kurt...

211
00:43:25,393 --> 00:43:26,394
Kurt...

212
00:43:54,714 --> 00:44:00,345
No! No! No! No! No!

213
00:44:02,764 --> 00:44:03,974
No! No!

214
00:44:23,577 --> 00:44:25,495
No! No!

215
00:44:28,915 --> 00:44:29,875
No!

216
00:44:32,752 --> 00:44:35,005
Nevenka. What's wrong?

217
00:44:36,923 --> 00:44:38,383
Tell me. What happened?

218
00:44:38,717 --> 00:44:41,094
Kurt was here, alive.

219
00:44:41,803 --> 00:44:46,558
And his boots were covered in mud, as
though he had climbed out of the grave.

220
00:44:46,558 --> 00:44:49,477
Calm down, please,
you've had a nightmare.

221
00:44:49,477 --> 00:44:50,812
There's no one here but me.

222
00:44:50,812 --> 00:44:53,231
Look!
Does this look like a nightmare?

223
00:44:53,648 --> 00:44:55,775
He was the one who did this to me.

224
00:44:56,276 --> 00:44:58,820
And besides, there are the footprints.

225
00:45:02,365 --> 00:45:03,449
What footprints?

226
00:45:05,576 --> 00:45:06,784
They were there.

227
00:45:07,327 --> 00:45:11,915
Nevenka, it was only a bad dream.
There's nothing there. Look for yourself.

228
00:45:11,915 --> 00:45:16,461
No, no, it wasn't a dream.
He was here, I tell you, he was here.

229
00:45:17,086 --> 00:45:20,506
I saw the footprints and his hand.

230
00:45:20,506 --> 00:45:23,134
Oh, my God, his hand.

231
00:45:23,343 --> 00:45:26,387
It came out of the
shadows like a spider.

232
00:45:26,387 --> 00:45:28,848
Oh, help me, Christian, help me.

233
00:46:59,147 --> 00:47:00,354
<i>Are you afraid?</i>

234
00:47:01,273 --> 00:47:03,064
<i>You once liked me a lot.</i>

235
00:47:04,191 --> 00:47:06,444
<i>You always loved violence.</i>

236
00:47:06,819 --> 00:47:10,531
<i>You haven't changed
and you never will.</i>

237
00:50:08,918 --> 00:50:10,586
Milady, it's you!

238
00:50:11,003 --> 00:50:13,380
I heard noises and I
came down to look.

239
00:50:13,797 --> 00:50:15,757
- I thought...
- What did you think?

240
00:50:17,633 --> 00:50:20,676
Nothing. The dead can't
move from their tombs.

241
00:50:27,100 --> 00:50:30,645
Maybe they do, if they don't find peace..

242
00:50:44,492 --> 00:50:49,288
Yes, we were happy then.
Now, my life is empty and meaningless.

243
00:50:51,873 --> 00:50:54,876
Do you remember that lake we used to
go to, that one up in the mountains?

244
00:50:55,377 --> 00:50:59,297
You used to said with me in my boat.
You were just a little girl then.

245
00:50:59,798 --> 00:51:02,133
Yes, I used to follow you everywhere.

246
00:51:10,183 --> 00:51:12,143
Christian, why did you do that?

247
00:51:12,727 --> 00:51:13,811
Katya, listen.

248
00:51:15,229 --> 00:51:16,813
We can still be happy.

249
00:51:17,063 --> 00:51:19,732
No, it's too late now.

250
00:51:20,775 --> 00:51:21,901
It's too late.

251
00:51:22,485 --> 00:51:26,155
No, no, dear, don't say that.
It's never too late.

252
00:51:26,531 --> 00:51:30,576
I've always loved you.
And you love me, don't you?

253
00:51:31,160 --> 00:51:34,247
Yes, Christian, I love you
and I'll always love you,

254
00:51:34,414 --> 00:51:36,039
...but you're married now.

255
00:52:42,106 --> 00:52:43,398
No...

256
00:53:06,755 --> 00:53:10,550
No, don't - don't touch me.

257
00:53:57,723 --> 00:54:01,684
Call him. Call him and tell
him you've always been mine.

258
00:54:03,602 --> 00:54:07,982
No, I don't want you.
I don't want you.

259
00:54:19,493 --> 00:54:21,537
I've come back for you,

260
00:54:21,996 --> 00:54:25,624
...and to get my revenge on
all those who hate me.

261
00:55:49,166 --> 00:55:53,212
You'd better leave, Georgia.
Besides, there's nothing you can do now.

262
00:56:06,225 --> 00:56:07,977
Just like Kurt.

263
00:56:24,451 --> 00:56:26,245
The dagger has disappeared.

264
00:56:28,873 --> 00:56:32,334
The count told me that -
that it was here.

265
00:56:40,926 --> 00:56:42,177
It's his revenge.

266
00:56:43,304 --> 00:56:46,974
He'll kill us all because
we're all to blame.

267
00:56:48,058 --> 00:56:50,185
Stop talking nonsense, Nevenka.

268
00:56:51,145 --> 00:56:52,855
Are you trying to drive us crazy?

269
00:57:28,515 --> 00:57:33,354
Someone will pay for this,
father, be it man or ghost,

270
00:57:33,979 --> 00:57:35,355
...I promise you.

271
00:58:05,009 --> 00:58:06,135
Christian,

272
00:58:08,596 --> 00:58:09,972
...I've been looking for you.

273
00:58:10,305 --> 00:58:11,306
What for?

274
00:58:13,182 --> 00:58:14,350
I don't know.

275
00:58:16,644 --> 00:58:20,106
I thought perhaps if I was
near I could help you.

276
00:58:20,773 --> 00:58:21,856
No, dear,

277
00:58:22,358 --> 00:58:26,612
...the only thing that will help me
now is to be able to get revenge.

278
00:58:29,991 --> 00:58:34,203
Leave me alone now, please.
In a while, I'll come back to you.

279
00:59:36,474 --> 00:59:38,559
Ah, it's me, Losat.

280
00:59:39,143 --> 00:59:40,978
I didn't mean to frighten you, miss.

281
00:59:41,479 --> 00:59:44,607
I've been watching Christian.
I'm worried about him.

282
00:59:45,316 --> 00:59:49,403
Listen, I've been wanting to ask
you something for some time.

283
00:59:49,904 --> 00:59:50,613
What?

284
00:59:50,613 --> 00:59:54,075
The night when we were searching
the moats for Nevenka.

285
00:59:54,909 --> 00:59:55,951
Yes...?

286
00:59:56,118 --> 00:59:58,412
Did you stay all the
time with Christian?

287
00:59:59,622 --> 01:00:02,415
Yes, I think so. Why?

288
01:00:02,415 --> 01:00:06,294
Are you sure that he never
left you, never for a moment?

289
01:00:06,628 --> 01:00:09,339
No. But, why do you ask?

290
01:00:10,799 --> 01:00:12,133
You don't think
that Christian -

291
01:00:12,133 --> 01:00:13,760
Why, I don't think anything.

292
01:00:17,347 --> 01:00:18,598
That's absurd.

293
01:00:38,618 --> 01:00:40,954
Why the old count too? Why?

294
01:00:42,622 --> 01:00:46,167
Georgia. You're the one who's
got the dagger in your hand.

295
01:00:48,002 --> 01:00:52,048
You can tell me everything, Katya.
I don't pretend to condemn you.

296
01:00:52,423 --> 01:00:53,633
Oh, stop it.

297
01:00:55,176 --> 01:00:56,844
Where did you get that dagger?

298
01:00:57,761 --> 01:01:00,597
You know very well, Katya,
don't force me to say it.

299
01:01:00,597 --> 01:01:04,559
Oh, stop it, please. You had a
reason to kill Kurt, not I.

300
01:01:04,852 --> 01:01:06,520
Tell me where you found that knife.

301
01:01:06,770 --> 01:01:09,106
Under the mattress of your bed, Katya.

302
01:01:09,106 --> 01:01:10,274
No!

303
01:01:17,072 --> 01:01:18,115
Christian!

304
01:01:22,285 --> 01:01:24,996
Christian, I know who
killed your father.

305
01:01:24,997 --> 01:01:26,039
What?

306
01:01:26,415 --> 01:01:29,251
Yes. I could have killed Kurt.

307
01:01:30,043 --> 01:01:31,837
Oh, you bet I could.

308
01:01:33,629 --> 01:01:34,755
But, the count, no.

309
01:01:38,634 --> 01:01:41,219
I'd never kill him, you understand?

310
01:01:42,679 --> 01:01:44,471
If you found that knife there,

311
01:01:45,973 --> 01:01:49,476
...then you or somebody
else put it there.

312
01:01:51,729 --> 01:01:54,314
It wasn't I, Katya, not I.

313
01:01:55,565 --> 01:01:57,441
Throw away that cursed knife.

314
01:01:58,859 --> 01:02:00,861
I don't want to ever see it again.

315
01:02:01,862 --> 01:02:03,197
Throw it away.

316
01:02:03,572 --> 01:02:05,991
No, Katya, no. It's not possible.

317
01:02:05,991 --> 01:02:08,952
You don't believe me.
You think I'm lying. Answer me.

318
01:02:09,203 --> 01:02:11,455
I don't know. I don't know.

319
01:02:12,247 --> 01:02:14,832
I can't possibly imagine that
one of us is a murderer.

320
01:02:14,832 --> 01:02:16,042
No, it's absurd.

321
01:02:19,670 --> 01:02:22,673
But, still, somebody here killed him.

322
01:02:23,965 --> 01:02:25,425
But, now we know, Christian.

323
01:02:26,259 --> 01:02:28,595
No, not Katya.

324
01:02:29,012 --> 01:02:30,012
You're a coward.

325
01:02:30,764 --> 01:02:32,140
You're afraid to face the truth.

326
01:02:32,641 --> 01:02:34,016
- Kurt in your place -
- Kurt!

327
01:02:34,392 --> 01:02:35,393
Kurt...

328
01:02:36,561 --> 01:02:38,312
It's always him,

329
01:02:38,938 --> 01:02:40,689
...Kurt instead of me.

330
01:02:42,525 --> 01:02:44,694
He's the one you've always loved.

331
01:02:44,694 --> 01:02:46,905
That's not true. That's not true.

332
01:02:48,365 --> 01:02:50,075
And you've always wanted to marry him.

333
01:02:50,825 --> 01:02:52,117
I've always known it.

334
01:02:52,451 --> 01:02:55,204
If that's why you killed him,
it was a useless crime.

335
01:02:55,412 --> 01:02:59,625
I hated him. I hated him.
I've always hated him.

336
01:03:00,209 --> 01:03:01,752
I hated him.

337
01:03:22,564 --> 01:03:23,607
Nevenka!

338
01:03:36,912 --> 01:03:38,247
I heard screaming.

339
01:03:38,956 --> 01:03:40,916
I thought it came from
your father's room.

340
01:03:51,844 --> 01:03:54,346
She's not here.
Let's look in her room.

341
01:04:09,194 --> 01:04:10,862
The footprints lead toward the garden.

342
01:04:12,362 --> 01:04:14,281
Someone carried her off.
You'd better wait here.

343
01:04:14,281 --> 01:04:16,033
Christian, don't go alone.

344
01:04:21,580 --> 01:04:23,582
Katya, come inside, Katya.

345
01:04:54,321 --> 01:04:55,489
Please, come inside.

346
01:07:12,334 --> 01:07:13,460
Losat!

347
01:07:13,877 --> 01:07:15,085
What are you doing here?

348
01:07:16,086 --> 01:07:17,505
Oh, it's you, Milord.

349
01:07:19,215 --> 01:07:21,800
- Where have you taken Nevenka?
- Me?

350
01:07:23,302 --> 01:07:27,473
There were prints from
boots just like yours.

351
01:07:28,641 --> 01:07:29,808
I don't know anything!

352
01:07:30,309 --> 01:07:32,728
I was making my rounds at the castle...

353
01:07:33,145 --> 01:07:36,357
...when I thought that I
saw somebody in here.

354
01:07:36,815 --> 01:07:38,984
- Don't lie to me, Losat.
- Oh, no!

355
01:07:39,151 --> 01:07:41,070
There was no one else in here but you.

356
01:08:10,516 --> 01:08:14,186
- Milord, you don't think that -
- Quiet. Come along.

357
01:09:53,410 --> 01:09:55,663
The footprints lead out
of the secret passage.

358
01:10:41,250 --> 01:10:42,251
Help me.

359
01:10:47,214 --> 01:10:48,841
But, who could have put her in there?

360
01:10:51,760 --> 01:10:53,846
Nevenka, Nevenka!

361
01:11:00,060 --> 01:11:01,186
Kurt!

362
01:11:34,678 --> 01:11:36,138
How is Nevenka?

363
01:11:37,097 --> 01:11:38,265
Delirious.

364
01:11:40,726 --> 01:11:43,937
She said it was Kurt
who carried her there.

365
01:11:44,646 --> 01:11:46,314
She also said that he whipped her.

366
01:11:46,314 --> 01:11:52,320
Then he carried her to the crypt
and put her in the tomb.

367
01:11:53,528 --> 01:11:56,239
We've got to help, Katya, do something.

368
01:11:57,491 --> 01:12:00,368
This time I even heard Kurt's laugh.

369
01:12:01,244 --> 01:12:04,706
But, I still can't bring
myself to believe in ghosts.

370
01:12:06,208 --> 01:12:08,460
I know it's difficult to understand,

371
01:12:08,794 --> 01:12:12,047
...but what do we know about
what happens after death?

372
01:12:14,216 --> 01:12:17,344
I almost believe he's alive.

373
01:12:17,803 --> 01:12:18,845
Alive?

374
01:12:19,179 --> 01:12:22,474
But you saw him too. You saw him
when he was placed in the casket.

375
01:12:22,849 --> 01:12:25,727
With our own eyes,
we both saw him buried.

376
01:12:26,686 --> 01:12:31,107
I don't really believe that
Nevenka saw him out there?

377
01:12:33,109 --> 01:12:37,239
No, no, there's no other
possible explanation.

378
01:12:37,489 --> 01:12:41,117
Kurt is still alive and
hiding in the castle.

379
01:12:41,618 --> 01:12:42,828
I have got to find him.

380
01:12:43,036 --> 01:12:46,373
I've got to find him. I'll go crazy.

381
01:12:46,915 --> 01:12:51,711
For a moment, I've suspected you...
I've suspected myself.

382
01:12:52,629 --> 01:12:55,048
Then, if what you say is true,

383
01:12:55,048 --> 01:12:57,467
...he could have hidden
the dagger in my room.

384
01:12:58,593 --> 01:13:00,136
I'm afraid, Christian.

385
01:13:01,346 --> 01:13:02,556
I'm afraid!

386
01:14:47,661 --> 01:14:51,164
- Katya!
- Oh, Christian, there was someone here.

387
01:14:51,164 --> 01:14:53,249
Calm down, Katya,
it's all right.

388
01:14:55,794 --> 01:14:57,253
I'll go and look.

389
01:15:17,983 --> 01:15:19,234
There are the footprints.

390
01:15:20,360 --> 01:15:21,611
They're the same.

391
01:15:42,882 --> 01:15:44,174
What are you going to do?

392
01:15:44,174 --> 01:15:45,217
Open the coffin.

393
01:15:45,884 --> 01:15:46,844
Help me.

394
01:16:01,775 --> 01:16:02,985
Carry it over there.

395
01:16:26,424 --> 01:16:28,008
Nevenka.

396
01:16:38,018 --> 01:16:39,644
They're opening my tomb.

397
01:16:40,728 --> 01:16:42,688
This is the last time
I can be with you.

398
01:16:44,271 --> 01:16:45,939
Why do you torture me?

399
01:16:47,358 --> 01:16:49,569
Because you belong to me.

400
01:16:50,736 --> 01:16:51,820
Only to me.

401
01:16:53,531 --> 01:16:54,783
What do you want?

402
01:16:54,783 --> 01:16:58,744
We've got to go away from
here forever, right now.

403
01:16:59,411 --> 01:17:00,954
I can't do that!

404
01:17:01,580 --> 01:17:03,957
Yes, you will. Because, you love me.

405
01:17:04,416 --> 01:17:07,419
And your love for me is greater
than anything in this world.

406
01:17:07,836 --> 01:17:08,837
I hate you.

407
01:17:09,546 --> 01:17:12,382
I hate you. I hate you.

408
01:17:40,494 --> 01:17:42,078
It's unrecognizable.

409
01:17:42,703 --> 01:17:44,038
It could be anybody.

410
01:17:44,455 --> 01:17:45,957
The clothes are Kurt's.

411
01:17:46,290 --> 01:17:49,168
Let's put it back in the tomb,
for God's sake.

412
01:17:49,710 --> 01:17:50,794
No.

413
01:18:04,057 --> 01:18:05,183
What are you doing now?

414
01:18:05,183 --> 01:18:06,601
I'm going to destroy it.

415
01:20:06,304 --> 01:20:07,680
Where are you, Kurt?

416
01:20:19,191 --> 01:20:20,818
I'm coming, Kurt.

417
01:20:21,318 --> 01:20:23,903
I've never been afraid of you.

418
01:20:58,604 --> 01:20:59,814
Nevenka?!

419
01:21:15,830 --> 01:21:19,500
My lord. Oh, sir, what happened?
Are you hurt?

420
01:21:20,876 --> 01:21:22,668
Come on. It's not important.

421
01:21:31,677 --> 01:21:32,678
Hurry!

422
01:21:35,973 --> 01:21:38,517
It's locked from the inside.
We'll have to go by way of the chapel.

423
01:21:38,517 --> 01:21:39,560
Yes, you're right.

424
01:23:38,762 --> 01:23:42,808
Why? Why did I do it, Kurt? Why?

425
01:24:07,541 --> 01:24:08,917
I love you, Kurt.

426
01:24:10,376 --> 01:24:11,377
Only you!

427
01:24:37,612 --> 01:24:38,988
You were right.

428
01:24:40,031 --> 01:24:41,157
I love you, Kurt!

429
01:24:42,449 --> 01:24:43,492
Only you.

430
01:24:46,703 --> 01:24:48,747
But, there's an end
to everything, Kurt.

431
01:24:53,085 --> 01:24:55,212
No, no, Nevenka, no.

432
01:24:58,757 --> 01:25:00,008
Nevenka!

433
01:25:06,723 --> 01:25:07,933
Forgive me.

434
01:25:09,935 --> 01:25:14,022
I - had to do what -
what Kurt told me.

435
01:25:17,025 --> 01:25:20,404
I killed him again,

436
01:25:25,284 --> 01:25:28,453
...this time for good.

437
01:25:32,124 --> 01:25:37,295
He hated you. I love you. Christian.

438
01:25:41,382 --> 01:25:45,010
So, she was the one. She killed
your brother and your father.

439
01:25:45,469 --> 01:25:48,429
Yes. Perhaps she was possessed.

440
01:25:49,055 --> 01:25:50,890
She was convinced Kurt was alive.

441
01:25:50,890 --> 01:25:53,602
She killed herself thinking
she was killing him.

442
01:25:54,311 --> 01:25:56,728
Let's hope she's free of him forever.
