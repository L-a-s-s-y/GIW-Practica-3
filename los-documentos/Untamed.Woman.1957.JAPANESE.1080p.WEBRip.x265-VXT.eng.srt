BEGINNING OF THE TAISHO ERA

9
00:02:34,516 --> 00:02:37,386
That's the new wife
who arrived last night.

10
00:02:37,936 --> 00:02:40,356
She's younger than the last one.

11
00:02:42,684 --> 00:02:44,163
Are you on your way somewhere?

12
00:02:44,206 --> 00:02:46,355
I dropped by as
I happened to be passing.

13
00:02:46,506 --> 00:02:49,356
I'll pay a visit to your place later.

14
00:02:49,433 --> 00:02:52,383
Now, you can leave the store
anytime you want.

15
00:02:52,447 --> 00:02:54,242
Yes, thanks to you.

16
00:02:54,609 --> 00:02:59,446
Sick and tired of weak women
like your ex-wife, right?

17
00:02:59,904 --> 00:03:03,486
Yes. As long as a wife is healthy
and works hard, I have no complaints.

18
00:03:03,742 --> 00:03:05,792
Shima is the one for you, then.

19
00:03:06,426 --> 00:03:12,966
I have to earn back the money that
I spent for my ex-wife's hospitalization.

20
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:19,122
And for sending her
to the seashore and all.

21
00:03:19,479 --> 00:03:25,156
Shima has worked like a horse for her
adoptive family since she was seven.

22
00:03:36,131 --> 00:03:38,721
How did you get
that scar on your hand?

23
00:03:39,551 --> 00:03:42,261
My mother burnt me with tongs
when I was little.

24
00:03:42,381 --> 00:03:45,581
I was adopted for a long time.

25
00:03:45,881 --> 00:03:49,831
Though I went back home from time
to time, I always felt isolated there.

26
00:03:49,951 --> 00:03:52,061
It must have been tough.

27
00:03:52,211 --> 00:03:56,641
Not at all. I had a better
life at the adoptive family.

28
00:03:56,721 --> 00:03:58,031
Is that right?

29
00:03:59,611 --> 00:04:04,114
Your husband is a handsome man.
You two will look great

30
00:04:04,301 --> 00:04:08,121
walking down the street together.

31
00:04:10,189 --> 00:04:15,503
His ex-wife favoured things
that were cheap but chic.

32
00:04:15,861 --> 00:04:22,300
She owned quite valuable stuff things
like combs, hairpins, and the like.

33
00:04:22,587 --> 00:04:25,946
If you can get all those,
it will be quite a fortune.

34
00:04:39,691 --> 00:04:42,118
You put on too much make-up!

35
00:04:51,531 --> 00:04:55,961
I'll lend you Okayo's kimono.
Go change into something more sober.

36
00:04:56,391 --> 00:05:00,200
I can't wear any. They're too old
fashioned, although the quality is good.

37
00:05:00,361 --> 00:05:03,272
I can't wear something a woman
ten years older than me wore.

38
00:05:04,871 --> 00:05:07,521
You should loosen
your belt a bit, too.

39
00:05:41,281 --> 00:05:44,061
I used to be a gardener for nobles.

40
00:05:44,371 --> 00:05:47,543
My family has always been important.

41
00:05:48,561 --> 00:05:51,461
He doesn't work unless
he's in the mood for it.

42
00:05:51,511 --> 00:05:53,281
That's the problem with him.

43
00:05:53,441 --> 00:05:55,991
He has a real artisan spirit.
He also has asthma.

44
00:05:56,091 --> 00:05:57,321
That's too bad.

45
00:06:01,026 --> 00:06:04,080
When is her brother
going back to the mountains?

46
00:06:04,569 --> 00:06:07,075
He came here to buy some trees, so...

47
00:06:07,231 --> 00:06:10,521
Please, come visit us at our store.

48
00:06:11,123 --> 00:06:14,679
Thank you. We feel relieved
that she married you.

49
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:16,696
She once escaped from a wedding.

50
00:06:16,811 --> 00:06:22,031
She didn't like the groom that
her adoptive family decided for her.

51
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:26,511
She is so selfish.

52
00:06:26,581 --> 00:06:31,649
She troubled the adoptive family a lot.
The Mizushima's are really upset with her.

53
00:06:32,111 --> 00:06:34,540
I didn't know you disliked men.

54
00:06:35,875 --> 00:06:38,481
- She tries to look prudish.
- Want your face slapped?

55
00:06:38,901 --> 00:06:40,321
Stop it.

56
00:06:41,011 --> 00:06:45,009
Anyway, I'm happy that a decent
man like you married her.

57
00:06:45,261 --> 00:06:48,038
But what if she fails
to serve you properly?

58
00:06:48,521 --> 00:06:53,880
She is such an odious wretch. You can
punish her to make her work hard.

59
00:07:32,271 --> 00:07:33,811
I'll get it.

60
00:07:35,868 --> 00:07:39,080
Hello? My husband?

61
00:07:40,591 --> 00:07:44,097
What's that?
He's not home yet.

62
00:07:46,001 --> 00:07:51,831
Who is it? Hello? Hello?

63
00:08:00,081 --> 00:08:01,891
You can lock the door.

64
00:08:06,231 --> 00:08:07,171
Good night.

65
00:08:07,231 --> 00:08:08,291
Good night.

66
00:08:08,991 --> 00:08:10,401
Good night.

67
00:08:25,341 --> 00:08:26,511
Is that you?

68
00:08:32,161 --> 00:08:33,251
Is that you?

69
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:43,611
Why lock the door?
How long must I keep knocking for?

70
00:08:43,741 --> 00:08:45,729
Because you didn't answer me.

71
00:08:46,185 --> 00:08:48,095
I didn't know what time
you'd be home.

72
00:08:48,186 --> 00:08:51,131
The master of the house has to call
out his name to enter his own place?

73
00:09:35,771 --> 00:09:37,135
Listen...

74
00:09:39,791 --> 00:09:43,831
I think something is
happening with my body.

75
00:09:45,916 --> 00:09:47,696
I might be pregnant.

76
00:09:48,611 --> 00:09:50,791
I think it's too early.

77
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:53,298
I doubt it's mine.

78
00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:56,736
Why?

79
00:09:58,617 --> 00:10:03,212
You were married once, right?

80
00:10:04,004 --> 00:10:06,250
Married to whom?

81
00:10:07,131 --> 00:10:10,611
Don't pretend you don't know.

82
00:10:10,891 --> 00:10:12,656
I really don't know.

83
00:10:12,761 --> 00:10:17,371
You know that I sneaked out from home
on the night before the wedding.

84
00:10:17,578 --> 00:10:20,881
But, why do your legal documents
say you married,

85
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:23,377
though you escaped from the wedding?

86
00:10:23,661 --> 00:10:28,161
My parents registered it
without telling me.

87
00:10:28,741 --> 00:10:31,736
It's not a question of
if you liked the guy or not.

88
00:10:32,231 --> 00:10:37,581
It's the fact that you were married.

89
00:10:40,071 --> 00:10:44,811
I don't know what document they made.
If you doubt it, go check with my family.

90
00:10:45,331 --> 00:10:54,051
He's a dummy who used to walk me
to school and home when we were kids.

91
00:10:54,551 --> 00:10:57,581
I don't care about it.
But, you slept with him, right?

92
00:10:57,631 --> 00:10:59,835
No. My adoptive family
also adopted him.

93
00:10:59,931 --> 00:11:02,821
The family planned to marry us
in order to keep their family line.

94
00:11:03,109 --> 00:11:05,408
Everyone laughs at me,
because of you.

95
00:11:05,851 --> 00:11:09,488
What do you mean?
Are you jealous?

96
00:11:10,731 --> 00:11:12,581
Don't insult me!

97
00:11:26,222 --> 00:11:29,384
Is that's why you are out
drinking every night?

98
00:11:30,485 --> 00:11:32,144
You don't believe me?

99
00:11:33,722 --> 00:11:35,694
If so, it's so heartless of you.

100
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:42,385
The night before the wedding, I ran away
to my sister's and I never went back there.

101
00:11:44,201 --> 00:11:46,171
Everyone called me a betrayer.

102
00:11:47,031 --> 00:11:49,080
Stop whining. Go to sleep.

103
00:11:50,614 --> 00:11:53,724
I'm visiting the factory
in Hokkaido, tomorrow.

104
00:11:58,248 --> 00:12:00,399
What time are you leaving?

105
00:12:04,271 --> 00:12:06,033
Early in the morning?

106
00:12:19,131 --> 00:12:20,831
Stop sobbing.

107
00:12:24,136 --> 00:12:27,621
You get a lot of calls from a woman.

108
00:12:28,151 --> 00:12:37,040
You can't blame me
for having married or whatever.

109
00:12:50,929 --> 00:12:55,394
You're really giving me all these things?
- They are wasted in a closet anyway.

110
00:12:55,559 --> 00:12:56,896
But...

111
00:12:58,829 --> 00:13:03,449
Sis. Look at this letter.
Came to him from the woman.

112
00:13:04,249 --> 00:13:05,919
From Hokkaido?

113
00:13:07,509 --> 00:13:11,739
He often sends her
a kimono or perfume.

114
00:13:13,319 --> 00:13:15,038
That's not cheap.

115
00:13:16,409 --> 00:13:19,587
She wrote to thank your husband.
Is she a geisha?

116
00:13:20,329 --> 00:13:27,439
He doesn't really go to Hokkaido for
the factory. He visits her everyday.

117
00:13:27,964 --> 00:13:34,174
"Soon, the master of the
paper mill is taking me to Tokyo.

118
00:13:34,585 --> 00:13:37,213
"Then, I can see you there everyday.

119
00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:39,887
I want to see you.
I'm dying to be with you.

120
00:13:40,039 --> 00:13:42,946
"Hope you know how I feel."

121
00:13:43,148 --> 00:13:47,703
He's an idiot. Every time he gets
back from there, he hums.

122
00:13:48,238 --> 00:13:50,472
So embarrassing
in front of the workers.

123
00:13:51,689 --> 00:13:55,732
He must have learned how to fool
around while his ex-wife was sick.

124
00:13:56,329 --> 00:14:01,661
No matter how well I take care of the
money, he spends it on her, it's no use.

125
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:06,088
But, you have a nice ring at least.

126
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:09,422
I'm married off to a poor man.

127
00:14:10,947 --> 00:14:13,146
I'll give it to you.

128
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:16,505
It won't suit an old wife like me.

129
00:14:16,729 --> 00:14:19,170
It's cheap stuff, anyway. Take it.

130
00:14:20,503 --> 00:14:21,823
Thanks.

131
00:14:24,899 --> 00:14:26,878
I'm just a replacement wife.

132
00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:30,270
Why shouldn't I be allowed to have
some freedom sometimes?

133
00:14:46,929 --> 00:14:49,439
Why didn't you take me
instead of her then?

134
00:15:11,089 --> 00:15:16,279
This is only between us though,
I've been crying.

135
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:18,341
Why?

136
00:15:21,739 --> 00:15:23,996
His mother comes even to our bedroom.

137
00:15:26,819 --> 00:15:28,476
Sorry to hear that.

138
00:15:29,663 --> 00:15:35,828
His mother has problems with her legs
and back. She spoils her only son badly.

139
00:15:43,364 --> 00:15:48,384
She doesn't let him work,
keeps her eye on him day and night...

140
00:15:48,719 --> 00:15:55,869
and even stays with him
till he falls asleep.

141
00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:02,460
She's worried you might make him sick.

142
00:16:02,635 --> 00:16:04,707
Me? Make him sick?

143
00:16:05,432 --> 00:16:08,988
Because you are so...

144
00:16:09,723 --> 00:16:11,783
Don't say that.

145
00:16:21,749 --> 00:16:24,729
Since I was around...

146
00:16:26,389 --> 00:16:29,649
It's always nice
and quiet around here.

147
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:32,719
Tsuru is here, too.

148
00:16:34,219 --> 00:16:36,036
Is he?

149
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:41,852
If I knew how she was,
I would have married you...

150
00:16:42,389 --> 00:16:45,715
How could a daughter of
the Kanna be interested...

151
00:16:45,811 --> 00:16:47,859
in the son of
a canned food manufacturer.

152
00:16:48,359 --> 00:16:50,646
You didn't have enough passion.

153
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:54,752
If only we could start all over.

154
00:16:58,838 --> 00:17:00,793
Tsuru's wife is here.

155
00:17:02,664 --> 00:17:04,135
What did she come here for?

156
00:17:04,209 --> 00:17:07,959
You don't have to stand up for her.

157
00:17:12,101 --> 00:17:13,981
- Hello.
- Hi.

158
00:17:14,763 --> 00:17:18,793
Tsuru, you shouldn't be so cranky.

159
00:17:19,239 --> 00:17:21,271
You are mature enough
to take this, aren't you?

160
00:17:23,282 --> 00:17:25,162
Have you got used to here, yet?

161
00:17:25,761 --> 00:17:29,682
I don't know much because I'm from
the countryside. He always scolds me.

162
00:17:30,239 --> 00:17:31,922
Look at her.

163
00:17:32,643 --> 00:17:35,898
She thinks she's a city girl, putting
too much make-up on her swollen face.

164
00:17:36,729 --> 00:17:38,745
Don't be so mean to her.

165
00:17:40,729 --> 00:17:43,289
My face gets swollen because...

166
00:17:43,581 --> 00:17:47,607
I don't sleep well.
Working at the store and the kitchen.

167
00:17:47,752 --> 00:17:49,811
Too tired to be his whore at night.

168
00:17:50,863 --> 00:17:52,234
I didn't say that.

169
00:17:52,939 --> 00:17:54,899
Cut it out.

170
00:17:56,009 --> 00:18:01,870
You, too. Stop talking back.
Women shouldn't talk back like that.

171
00:18:05,157 --> 00:18:08,649
Tsuru, why don't you help her
with some proper clothes to wear?

172
00:18:12,096 --> 00:18:14,596
Shall we have some tea over there.

173
00:18:19,429 --> 00:18:21,379
Unfortunately my wife is out.

174
00:18:22,219 --> 00:18:24,213
Go home.
Your belly is sticking out.

175
00:18:24,339 --> 00:18:26,566
Stop it. Please, come inside.

176
00:18:26,769 --> 00:18:28,918
Is it hard to be an accountant?

177
00:18:29,030 --> 00:18:30,706
She's terrible.

178
00:18:30,896 --> 00:18:33,649
She gets so proud of herself
for getting new suppliers.

179
00:18:33,782 --> 00:18:36,210
But they don't have any money.

180
00:18:36,349 --> 00:18:38,250
Ends up with more work for me to do.

181
00:18:38,899 --> 00:18:41,149
Whatever women do
they always end up with nothing,

182
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:44,550
and men have to make up for it.

183
00:18:45,169 --> 00:18:47,252
Take it easy till she gets used to it.

184
00:18:47,987 --> 00:18:51,071
He blames me for all those
he can't make money with.

185
00:18:54,769 --> 00:18:59,899
I wanted you to hear this
in front of her.

186
00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:02,529
You forget your own shortcomings.

187
00:19:03,074 --> 00:19:05,504
Tell me! What are your complaints?

188
00:19:06,689 --> 00:19:08,669
She's common.

189
00:19:08,772 --> 00:19:11,537
It sounds good that
she was adopted at 18.

190
00:19:11,717 --> 00:19:15,851
But, in fact she was like
a maid to the family.

191
00:19:16,729 --> 00:19:18,769
I set up your marriage.

192
00:19:19,269 --> 00:19:22,891
She suddenly became
the wife of a rich man.

193
00:19:22,999 --> 00:19:25,643
She thinks it's a waste
if she doesn't spend my money.

194
00:19:26,216 --> 00:19:28,666
You said that my clothes
smelt like mud.

195
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:33,534
She was adopted by farmers.
It's hard to become like a city girl.

196
00:19:34,069 --> 00:19:37,779
Our store, The Shinsyo,
is ruined since she came.

197
00:19:39,263 --> 00:19:41,251
You ruined it, too,
going out every night.

198
00:19:41,739 --> 00:19:42,799
What?

199
00:19:43,428 --> 00:19:48,490
You are even.
Shima, you sound a bit mean to him.

200
00:19:54,089 --> 00:19:57,735
I understand you have your complaints
but you should compromise a bit.

201
00:20:04,379 --> 00:20:08,459
Go home. You shouldn't
leave the store for so long.

202
00:20:08,539 --> 00:20:11,780
Let her stay.
She hasn't been here for long.

203
00:20:13,647 --> 00:20:15,597
Sorry if I disturbed you.
I'm leaving.

204
00:20:15,669 --> 00:20:17,891
Are you leaving so soon?

205
00:20:19,769 --> 00:20:21,279
Look at her dress.

206
00:20:21,636 --> 00:20:23,516
Don't be so mean.

207
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:40,496
You are going home, right?

208
00:20:41,013 --> 00:20:42,692
I'm visiting them again.

209
00:20:42,786 --> 00:20:44,736
He won't be there any more.

210
00:20:44,913 --> 00:20:48,551
He'd still be there.

211
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:51,164
- Just apologize to him.
- That's not my way.

212
00:20:51,344 --> 00:20:54,019
You don't need to go back
to fight again.

213
00:20:56,949 --> 00:20:59,649
- What's wrong?
- My clog thong got cut off.

214
00:20:59,769 --> 00:21:01,329
- Is it OK?
- Yes.

215
00:21:15,979 --> 00:21:20,209
I was suspicious of that girl, Oyu,
more than the woman in Hokkaido.

216
00:21:21,227 --> 00:21:24,644
She disgusts me with her horny voice.

217
00:21:25,419 --> 00:21:31,379
Depressing story. It's the fate of a
wife who has a handsome husband.

218
00:21:32,599 --> 00:21:36,289
How can he be so open about it?

219
00:21:37,189 --> 00:21:40,642
If I work hard, he gets scared
that a woman will control him.

220
00:21:40,805 --> 00:21:45,155
He's scared as if his head
was about to be shaved or sold.

221
00:21:45,719 --> 00:21:46,859
Yes.

222
00:21:47,189 --> 00:21:51,599
He does whatever he wants but he
wants to save his face at the same time.

223
00:21:52,670 --> 00:21:55,052
He calls me "Peak Belly".

224
00:21:56,279 --> 00:21:59,209
I didn't have my belly stuck out
when I was born.

225
00:22:03,219 --> 00:22:06,069
If I work, men complain that
I'm not sexy enough.

226
00:22:06,241 --> 00:22:09,869
I'm not a Geisha.
I can't be all over him all day long.

227
00:22:10,775 --> 00:22:14,114
I hate a sissy man like him.

228
00:22:15,759 --> 00:22:17,549
I can go alone from here.

229
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:21,944
My workers are waiting for me
at the store.

230
00:22:22,186 --> 00:22:23,888
I don't have time to complain.

231
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:37,190
Welcome, I'm back.

232
00:23:08,819 --> 00:23:10,389
Good night.

233
00:24:06,529 --> 00:24:08,879
What are you doing
at this time of night?

234
00:24:14,252 --> 00:24:16,082
Writing a letter to that woman?

235
00:24:22,869 --> 00:24:24,609
Give me that!

236
00:24:25,849 --> 00:24:27,459
Let me go!

237
00:24:30,769 --> 00:24:32,349
You scratched me.

238
00:24:32,849 --> 00:24:34,919
I didn't know
you were violent like this.

239
00:24:42,739 --> 00:24:45,164
I'll tell you something.

240
00:24:47,689 --> 00:24:52,229
If you do everything your way,
the business will be finished.

241
00:24:54,059 --> 00:24:57,689
This business belongs to my ex-wife.

242
00:24:58,349 --> 00:25:02,609
I'll lose face
if I lose the business.

243
00:25:04,218 --> 00:25:06,570
I don't know whose child
you are having but

244
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:09,773
I'll do you a favour
to raise him a great man.

245
00:25:10,929 --> 00:25:13,999
A favour? This is your child.

246
00:25:14,462 --> 00:25:17,692
You listen to Oyu's
complaints about me.

247
00:25:18,087 --> 00:25:19,156
What?

248
00:25:19,649 --> 00:25:24,359
Does it annoy you if I buy a Kimono
while you buy them for other women?

249
00:25:24,429 --> 00:25:25,919
Shut up.

250
00:25:26,809 --> 00:25:28,629
Go downstairs and sleep there.

251
00:25:28,749 --> 00:25:30,519
I will.

252
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:34,018
I mean right now.

253
00:25:34,542 --> 00:25:36,372
Don't be so rough with me.

254
00:25:38,949 --> 00:25:42,143
What are you doing?
You idiot.

255
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:47,149
- Get out of this house.
- I will.

256
00:26:10,599 --> 00:26:14,699
I've never heard of a woman fighting
physically with a man like she did.

257
00:26:16,599 --> 00:26:23,219
Taku, good that you didn't marry her.

258
00:26:43,589 --> 00:26:49,989
He came here to ask if
we could take Shima again.

259
00:26:50,741 --> 00:26:52,455
Did she get kicked out?

260
00:26:52,938 --> 00:26:56,196
Her baby died because
she fell on the stairs.

261
00:26:57,636 --> 00:27:00,346
Her husband has had enough of her.

262
00:27:03,104 --> 00:27:07,850
She's no use here.
Taku has a wife already.

263
00:27:13,918 --> 00:27:20,228
She doesn't get along with her mother
since she lived here for 10 years.

264
00:27:20,645 --> 00:27:32,012
She has nowhere to go.
Will you take her, please?

265
00:27:32,519 --> 00:27:35,307
She ran away from the wedding.

266
00:27:35,556 --> 00:27:39,907
We can't face Taku's parents
if we take her back here.

267
00:27:41,729 --> 00:27:47,546
I will make her work harder,
so please.

268
00:27:49,389 --> 00:27:55,376
Your son moves around on his trips.
You must worry a lot.

269
00:27:56,913 --> 00:27:58,952
Is his wife is still in her country?

270
00:28:08,553 --> 00:28:10,055
Do you want one?

271
00:28:13,128 --> 00:28:14,639
It's so far.

272
00:28:15,179 --> 00:28:17,349
There are only mountains.

273
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:20,680
You can find interesting things to do
if you get used to living there.

274
00:28:20,879 --> 00:28:23,279
You can survive almost anywhere.

275
00:28:26,168 --> 00:28:29,552
If I find a job there,
I will work hard.

276
00:28:29,952 --> 00:28:31,494
And, I'll come back.

277
00:29:15,929 --> 00:29:17,419
Eat this on the train.

278
00:29:17,469 --> 00:29:18,799
Thank you.

279
00:29:20,349 --> 00:29:23,519
I don't want to wait here alone.

280
00:29:25,119 --> 00:29:29,339
The trees I brought from Tokyo
don't suit the land here.

281
00:29:29,609 --> 00:29:32,190
They almost died before being sold.

282
00:29:32,804 --> 00:29:35,254
Then I couldn't have sold them
even at the rice mill.

283
00:29:36,614 --> 00:29:38,101
What are you going to do?

284
00:29:40,719 --> 00:29:43,139
I'm leaving for Chiba again.

285
00:29:43,312 --> 00:29:44,932
Chiba?

286
00:29:45,309 --> 00:29:48,084
Well... Take care.

287
00:30:39,666 --> 00:30:42,998
I came all the way
to the mountain country

288
00:30:43,104 --> 00:30:45,280
to work here to pay back
my brother's debt.

289
00:30:46,429 --> 00:30:51,748
Soon he'll come to take you
back from working here.

290
00:30:52,649 --> 00:30:55,009
I feel sorry for all the trouble

291
00:30:55,241 --> 00:30:57,493
that he caused you and
the master of the rice mill.

292
00:30:58,731 --> 00:31:00,627
That's because he started gambling.

293
00:31:01,009 --> 00:31:02,425
Yes.

294
00:31:03,049 --> 00:31:07,737
Your brother did a good job
with the rice mill garden.

295
00:31:08,039 --> 00:31:10,463
He's too good for the countryside.

296
00:31:11,229 --> 00:31:14,149
I heard that he came here
because of some woman.

297
00:31:14,329 --> 00:31:16,956
She had a husband in the Ueno mines.

298
00:31:17,149 --> 00:31:19,135
My brother's lover, you mean?

299
00:31:20,102 --> 00:31:21,895
Her name is Okana.

300
00:31:21,989 --> 00:31:24,508
You know so much.

301
00:31:25,499 --> 00:31:30,379
She moved to Chiba recently
after having divorced her husband.

302
00:31:32,469 --> 00:31:38,809
To Chiba? He didn't think of
coming back here, then.

303
00:31:55,789 --> 00:31:58,596
- Madam, where do I take this?
- Upstairs.

304
00:31:59,429 --> 00:32:00,699
Wait.

305
00:32:01,254 --> 00:32:04,994
The master of the rice mill came to
my room. So, come to see him later.

306
00:32:06,819 --> 00:32:08,659
Good evening.

307
00:32:23,739 --> 00:32:25,124
Excuse me.

308
00:32:27,959 --> 00:32:30,341
Can't you wait to hear "come in"?

309
00:32:31,339 --> 00:32:35,402
Sorry. I came to greet
the master of the rice mill.

310
00:32:36,409 --> 00:32:38,926
Thank you for all the things
you did for me this time.

311
00:32:40,789 --> 00:32:43,215
I can't say no to your brother.

312
00:32:43,589 --> 00:32:45,680
It must be hard for you

313
00:32:45,816 --> 00:32:49,134
that he left here so soon after you
came here to ask for his support.

314
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:50,819
Well...

315
00:32:51,649 --> 00:32:54,109
OK, get back to work.

316
00:33:28,669 --> 00:33:31,209
I can't find a pin
for the handkerchief.

317
00:33:31,407 --> 00:33:34,447
Here, I have one.

318
00:33:37,009 --> 00:33:39,929
Did you put extra snacks
in my lunch?

319
00:33:39,969 --> 00:33:44,708
Yes, I did.
Look for them yourself at lunch.

320
00:33:50,664 --> 00:33:53,076
Can I visit my mom
after school today?

321
00:33:53,228 --> 00:33:55,098
No. You can go next time.

322
00:33:55,335 --> 00:33:56,956
Why not?
Would we catch her sickness?

323
00:33:57,158 --> 00:34:01,669
You're too small to go there alone.
You won't be able to return by night.

324
00:34:02,195 --> 00:34:04,135
- Old scumbag.
- Watch your mouth!

325
00:34:04,677 --> 00:34:08,041
Ask your dad to take you there
when your dad visits her again.

326
00:34:08,431 --> 00:34:09,731
Now hurry up and go.

327
00:34:09,939 --> 00:34:12,598
Crooked old nose and belly.

328
00:34:45,227 --> 00:34:47,121
What are you thinking?

329
00:34:48,255 --> 00:34:50,395
Thinking really doesn't help me much.

330
00:34:51,017 --> 00:34:53,162
It's good that you are healthy at least.

331
00:34:54,698 --> 00:34:56,486
Is your wife still sick?

332
00:34:58,399 --> 00:35:00,159
I'm not sure.

333
00:35:02,179 --> 00:35:05,679
Since you told me that you
wanted to read something, here.

334
00:35:07,299 --> 00:35:08,631
Thank you.

335
00:35:12,658 --> 00:35:14,465
The master of the rice mill is leaving.

336
00:35:14,768 --> 00:35:15,862
Is that so?

337
00:35:16,439 --> 00:35:18,119
What is he to this place?

338
00:35:20,237 --> 00:35:22,954
We owe him a lot.

339
00:35:28,269 --> 00:35:30,723
We'll set it upstairs next time for...

340
00:35:30,909 --> 00:35:32,689
That's a good idea.

341
00:35:37,095 --> 00:35:41,088
Shima, I received this
from him for you.

342
00:35:51,348 --> 00:35:56,422
Oops. You also have big breasts.

343
00:35:56,799 --> 00:35:59,678
So big I have to tighten them with
cotton clothes. It's embarrassing.

344
00:35:59,799 --> 00:36:02,139
Not at all. They're great.

345
00:36:07,029 --> 00:36:08,449
Stop that.

346
00:36:18,690 --> 00:36:21,280
Come again soon.

347
00:37:15,249 --> 00:37:16,891
Are you taking a bath?

348
00:37:21,989 --> 00:37:23,567
I'm going to bed.

349
00:37:27,699 --> 00:37:29,843
No. You shouldn't.

350
00:38:14,279 --> 00:38:17,409
What should I do? My father
always writes the same thing.

351
00:38:19,219 --> 00:38:23,129
He thinks I'm prostituting myself.

352
00:38:26,009 --> 00:38:28,593
I wish I could go to Tokyo with you.

353
00:38:29,956 --> 00:38:32,386
Shima, Madam is calling you.

354
00:38:38,329 --> 00:38:41,249
It shouldn't be so bad
if we put her in the room...

355
00:38:42,039 --> 00:38:46,587
But, still people talk about them.
What if his wife finds out?

356
00:38:46,876 --> 00:38:50,988
So, we should do something about them.

357
00:38:51,309 --> 00:38:53,297
Madam, did you call for me?

358
00:38:53,413 --> 00:38:54,504
Come in.

359
00:39:01,199 --> 00:39:07,655
It's about you two. People will
start talking about you soon.

360
00:39:08,910 --> 00:39:10,728
They might blame me for this.

361
00:39:10,909 --> 00:39:14,374
I'm not his real mother
that is why I let this happen.

362
00:39:15,637 --> 00:39:18,505
So, can you go to Tarumo for a while?

363
00:39:18,844 --> 00:39:22,942
This is my special treat for you.

364
00:39:23,152 --> 00:39:25,520
It's a motel with
a hot spring in the mountains.

365
00:39:26,489 --> 00:39:31,596
The customers are mostly the neighbors and
sometimes someone comes from the city.

366
00:39:31,779 --> 00:39:34,079
The work isn't so hard.

367
00:39:39,979 --> 00:39:42,379
His wife is coming back soon.

368
00:39:46,359 --> 00:39:49,417
We can't let you stay
in the same house.

369
00:39:49,719 --> 00:39:52,259
It's not good for his kids, either.

370
00:40:25,667 --> 00:40:27,386
Shima!

371
00:40:28,719 --> 00:40:30,494
Shima!

372
00:40:59,513 --> 00:41:00,979
How did you come here?

373
00:41:02,236 --> 00:41:03,645
Let me carry that.

374
00:41:03,750 --> 00:41:06,310
No, I'm fine.
You'll get wet.

375
00:41:13,028 --> 00:41:14,213
Actually...

376
00:41:16,422 --> 00:41:17,480
What?

377
00:41:19,591 --> 00:41:22,889
Your father visited us from Tokyo
so I had to take him here.

378
00:41:24,709 --> 00:41:27,560
He's here?
When did he get here?

379
00:41:27,969 --> 00:41:29,600
Early this morning.

380
00:41:30,269 --> 00:41:34,383
He wants to take you home.
I told him that you worked here.

381
00:41:35,695 --> 00:41:38,593
He said he would come here alone
to take you home.

382
00:41:38,829 --> 00:41:40,563
Then, what?

383
00:41:41,405 --> 00:41:43,516
He's taking a rest at the motel.

384
00:41:45,677 --> 00:41:47,837
Is there a way not to see him?

385
00:41:48,409 --> 00:41:50,511
I already told him you were here.

386
00:41:52,188 --> 00:41:53,558
Damn.

387
00:41:58,829 --> 00:42:03,315
Anyway, you should meet him
and talk with him.

388
00:42:05,069 --> 00:42:09,001
I gave him my word that
I would never ask him for help,

389
00:42:09,168 --> 00:42:13,828
and that I would live a great life.
I hate to see him now.

390
00:42:20,221 --> 00:42:23,421
It can't be helped.
I'll see him then.

391
00:42:24,609 --> 00:42:26,869
We'll see how it goes.

392
00:42:34,435 --> 00:42:36,584
They'll be back soon.

393
00:42:46,809 --> 00:42:48,390
I'm glad you came.

394
00:42:54,417 --> 00:42:57,227
But, you really didn't have to.

395
00:42:57,369 --> 00:42:59,440
There is nothing to worry about here.

396
00:43:00,989 --> 00:43:05,517
But, since you came, why don't
you sit in the hot spring and relax.

397
00:43:06,159 --> 00:43:08,060
How can I relax?

398
00:43:08,436 --> 00:43:14,301
I don't care how you are as long
as I can drag you home.

399
00:43:14,919 --> 00:43:17,609
You can't take me home like that.

400
00:43:21,519 --> 00:43:24,249
Please, come inside.

401
00:43:24,549 --> 00:43:26,697
Get ready to go home.

402
00:43:49,874 --> 00:43:53,074
What should we do?
My dad is too stubborn.

403
00:43:54,629 --> 00:43:57,018
I thought about...

404
00:43:58,874 --> 00:44:02,001
what happened between us
and he should be upset.

405
00:44:02,687 --> 00:44:05,211
It's all my fault.
He has every right to hate me.

406
00:44:05,629 --> 00:44:09,679
Your words don't solve anything.
How can you say that now?

407
00:44:20,379 --> 00:44:24,629
It's raining hard.
You can't leave tonight.

408
00:44:26,859 --> 00:44:28,789
Have something to drink.

409
00:44:41,149 --> 00:44:43,179
I'll prepare your meal, too.

410
00:44:53,702 --> 00:44:54,735
Actually...

411
00:44:55,259 --> 00:45:02,314
We are from a family of gentry.
I'll pay you back right now.

412
00:45:04,162 --> 00:45:07,497
Here, I have 50 <i>ryo</i>.
It should cover most of it.

413
00:45:08,009 --> 00:45:11,090
No, I don't need it.
Shima worked hard for it.

414
00:45:12,146 --> 00:45:17,374
Father.
I didn't sleep with him for money.

415
00:45:22,009 --> 00:45:25,702
I thought about the best solution.

416
00:45:26,359 --> 00:45:29,999
How about her having
a house somewhere?

417
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:36,340
I'll ask the master of the rice mill
to help me for the money secretly.

418
00:45:36,939 --> 00:45:39,834
He is our benefactor.

419
00:45:40,159 --> 00:45:42,979
Or, she can do some business
going down the mountain.

420
00:45:43,019 --> 00:45:45,669
You want to have her
as your concubine?

421
00:45:45,889 --> 00:45:52,629
Well, my wife got better
with the medicine from Tokyo.

422
00:45:52,749 --> 00:46:00,607
She's coming back soon enough.
I have to ask Shima to be patient.

423
00:46:02,195 --> 00:46:05,509
I would never become
a concubine, even if I die.

424
00:46:06,759 --> 00:46:11,623
But, I have a responsibility.

425
00:46:12,129 --> 00:46:17,291
We both are responsible.
I don't need you to do all this for me.

426
00:46:19,029 --> 00:46:24,201
I won't be a concubine.
I can manage to live by myself.

427
00:46:24,719 --> 00:46:27,881
You already are a comfort woman.

428
00:46:30,219 --> 00:46:32,742
Shima, make up your mind.

429
00:47:04,911 --> 00:47:07,647
You and I will never
get to a conclusion.

430
00:47:08,379 --> 00:47:11,249
Get someone over here,
someone who can really talk.

431
00:47:12,118 --> 00:47:17,847
Listen to me. Since people here
took care of me so well,

432
00:47:18,429 --> 00:47:21,809
I don't want to leave them
just before it gets busy.

433
00:47:22,049 --> 00:47:25,208
So, I'll stay here till June
and I'll be...

434
00:47:27,482 --> 00:47:29,165
home by mid-August.

435
00:47:32,256 --> 00:47:34,433
The longer you stay,
the worse it will get.

436
00:47:37,302 --> 00:47:42,892
I have to say good bye
to Madam and the neighbors.

437
00:47:43,149 --> 00:47:48,966
I can't leave without asking them.

438
00:47:50,339 --> 00:47:52,469
You understand that, don't you?

439
00:48:24,409 --> 00:48:28,341
He wouldn't listen to me at all.

440
00:48:41,829 --> 00:48:46,119
I won't go anywhere.
Whatever it takes, I'll stay here.

441
00:48:48,966 --> 00:48:52,152
Once my wife comes back,
I can't come here often.

442
00:48:54,206 --> 00:48:57,126
Even if I see you once a year,
I'll be happy.

443
00:48:58,174 --> 00:49:04,253
I feel sorry for you. Maybe,
it's better if you go back to Tokyo.

444
00:49:07,289 --> 00:49:11,076
It's not good to keep you
as a comfort woman for so long.

445
00:49:13,992 --> 00:49:17,891
Is that what you really think?

446
00:49:22,207 --> 00:49:25,817
Maybe it's better to end this.

447
00:49:34,577 --> 00:49:37,473
You look angry
but it can't be helped.

448
00:49:37,759 --> 00:49:39,809
I can die for that.

449
00:49:40,799 --> 00:49:43,749
If you do such a thing,
people will talk.

450
00:49:45,714 --> 00:49:48,602
Are you afraid of rumors?

451
00:49:49,369 --> 00:49:53,729
Though you pushed me away
this far into the mountains,

452
00:49:55,639 --> 00:49:58,139
are you still afraid
of your reputation?

453
00:49:58,469 --> 00:50:01,805
I left everything behind for you.
You don't even want to get a scar?

454
00:50:02,149 --> 00:50:04,059
I'm trying to do the best for you.

455
00:50:06,810 --> 00:50:10,910
Enough of excuses.
If you can tell me to break up,

456
00:50:11,749 --> 00:50:14,039
you don't really love me that much.

457
00:50:14,959 --> 00:50:18,298
You're just full of excuses.

458
00:50:26,133 --> 00:50:28,454
What's wrong? Are you drunk?
Are you OK?

459
00:50:28,573 --> 00:50:30,025
I'm fine.

460
00:51:03,316 --> 00:51:04,904
Feeling better?

461
00:51:06,159 --> 00:51:07,742
What time is it?

462
00:51:08,194 --> 00:51:09,227
It's late.

463
00:51:15,629 --> 00:51:17,456
Why are you getting up?

464
00:51:19,743 --> 00:51:21,753
I have nothing to say.

465
00:51:22,056 --> 00:51:24,747
I've never seen a woman drunk
that bad.

466
00:51:32,950 --> 00:51:36,362
That folding screen.
Did I do that?

467
00:51:36,491 --> 00:51:37,352
Yes.

468
00:51:39,575 --> 00:51:41,371
What happened?

469
00:51:41,549 --> 00:51:44,991
Well, you did it with your arms.

470
00:51:46,153 --> 00:51:47,821
Was I out of control?

471
00:51:47,919 --> 00:51:51,987
Madam came here to check what
was going on. It was embarrassing.

472
00:51:58,040 --> 00:52:01,656
How much does it cost if
I want to pay for the damage?

473
00:52:23,797 --> 00:52:25,963
In two hours, day breaks.

474
00:52:30,467 --> 00:52:32,968
I'll go pack my things, now.

475
00:52:39,119 --> 00:52:42,249
I wonder how much
the folding screen costs.

476
00:52:44,199 --> 00:52:48,888
I'll take care of that. Don't worry
about the money. Just apologize.

477
00:52:56,589 --> 00:53:00,629
Take the sweets that
I brought you on the way here.

478
00:53:07,614 --> 00:53:14,643
If you don't find a place in Tokyo,
come back here anytime.

479
00:53:24,352 --> 00:53:26,831
Thank you.

480
00:54:42,989 --> 00:54:45,130
Auntie, Mr. Ogata is here.

481
00:54:47,059 --> 00:54:49,409
- Good day..
- Hello. You're early today.

482
00:54:50,249 --> 00:54:52,119
Another battle started.

483
00:54:53,118 --> 00:54:56,908
Then, we'll be making
more army suits for a while.

484
00:54:57,769 --> 00:54:59,159
I guess so.

485
00:54:59,309 --> 00:55:00,929
Good for you, too.

486
00:55:03,539 --> 00:55:05,029
We've done those.

487
00:55:05,306 --> 00:55:08,558
Already? You're five times
faster than the others are.

488
00:55:09,159 --> 00:55:10,867
You are also making more money.

489
00:55:10,944 --> 00:55:13,263
I wouldn't ask more
if I had a husband.

490
00:55:14,383 --> 00:55:18,098
She told me she would do sewing or
anything if I would let her stay here.

491
00:55:18,224 --> 00:55:20,564
Now, she's complaining
the job is too easy for her.

492
00:55:20,793 --> 00:55:23,801
It's no use if I learn how to
play the shamisen now.

493
00:55:24,009 --> 00:55:26,821
Why don't you come to learn how to use
the sewing machine in our factory?

494
00:55:27,516 --> 00:55:29,617
No women work there.

495
00:55:30,309 --> 00:55:32,089
It's not a problem for me.

496
00:55:33,019 --> 00:55:35,347
It doesn't matter at all.

497
00:55:38,239 --> 00:55:39,909
Give me one.

498
00:55:44,809 --> 00:55:47,489
Should I really go to the factory?

499
00:55:48,098 --> 00:55:49,948
Here is your money.

500
00:55:50,839 --> 00:55:53,029
With a wife like you,
I'd have no money problems.

501
00:55:53,149 --> 00:55:57,479
- You are right. Why don't you
marry me then? - No thanks.

502
00:55:57,809 --> 00:56:00,772
This is the picture of the girl
that I told you of before.

503
00:56:01,929 --> 00:56:03,949
- How old is she?
- 18.

504
00:56:04,461 --> 00:56:06,240
Three years younger
than Shima, then.

505
00:56:11,833 --> 00:56:15,903
Don't compare her with
a woman who's divorced.

506
00:56:16,079 --> 00:56:18,309
You haven't married before right?

507
00:56:19,079 --> 00:56:21,939
Good that a guy can
still have a chance after 30.

508
00:56:22,810 --> 00:56:24,540
He's still young as a man.

509
00:56:25,239 --> 00:56:27,589
She is 10 years younger than I am.

510
00:56:32,409 --> 00:56:34,209
You are leaving early.

511
00:56:34,399 --> 00:56:35,893
I'm going out.

512
00:56:36,069 --> 00:56:37,039
Where?

513
00:56:37,154 --> 00:56:38,104
Well...

514
00:56:54,626 --> 00:56:55,846
Mineko!

515
00:56:56,114 --> 00:56:59,284
Tonight is the last night for us
to stay together

516
00:57:00,061 --> 00:57:03,861
and that I can talk to you.

517
00:57:05,411 --> 00:57:10,711
17th of January,
everyone, please remember.

518
00:57:11,509 --> 00:57:15,509
I wonder what the moon
and the sea will be looking at

519
00:57:15,602 --> 00:57:17,212
this time next year.

520
00:57:18,839 --> 00:57:25,999
Tonight, the year after next, and
tonight this month in three years,

521
00:57:26,069 --> 00:57:28,558
I will never forget about tonight.

522
00:57:30,092 --> 00:57:34,722
How can I forget you.
Mineko, I'll promise you

523
00:57:34,889 --> 00:57:41,769
that I will shadow the moon with
my tears on this night next year.

524
00:57:42,912 --> 00:57:46,141
Don't say that, Kai.

525
00:57:46,488 --> 00:57:50,933
I will never forget you
as long as I live.

526
00:57:53,537 --> 00:57:55,737
Why did you leave me if you say so?

527
00:57:56,168 --> 00:57:57,388
Well because...

528
00:57:57,470 --> 00:57:59,026
I don't want to hear...

529
00:58:02,299 --> 00:58:04,293
What's the matter?!

530
00:58:05,785 --> 00:58:07,295
Maybe the film was cut off.

531
00:58:07,509 --> 00:58:08,906
Damn.

532
00:58:46,886 --> 00:58:51,570
I'll write you when
I come out to Tokyo again.

533
00:58:55,079 --> 00:58:58,929
We can go to see
the city together next time.

534
00:58:59,389 --> 00:59:02,342
I didn't like the way we left
the mountain with that argument.

535
00:59:07,179 --> 00:59:09,651
I'm glad I saw you again.

536
00:59:09,792 --> 00:59:13,242
Because your aunt is your father's sister,
you can feel relaxed there, right?

537
00:59:13,457 --> 00:59:16,916
As long as I make money for myself.

538
00:59:17,031 --> 00:59:19,452
She lives on the money that her
daughter makes working as a Geisha.

539
00:59:20,174 --> 00:59:24,556
Please, be patient. Someday,
I'll find the right mountain.

540
00:59:25,649 --> 00:59:27,360
Then, I will come for you.

541
00:59:31,109 --> 00:59:33,037
Don't you have to go now?

542
00:59:35,079 --> 00:59:39,009
I hate to see you off at the station,
so I won't come with you.

543
00:59:39,239 --> 00:59:40,519
That's OK.

544
00:59:42,307 --> 00:59:44,018
I'll say goodbye from here.

545
00:59:46,339 --> 00:59:48,714
I wish I could take you with me.

546
00:59:51,812 --> 00:59:56,249
I can't live far
in the mountains anymore.

547
00:59:58,189 --> 01:00:00,719
We'll see each other
in Tokyo again, then.

548
01:00:02,039 --> 01:00:04,139
It's the night of Tanabata,

549
01:00:06,409 --> 01:00:09,052
but we can barely see the stars.

550
01:00:17,402 --> 01:00:19,539
This is not much, but take it.

551
01:00:20,818 --> 01:00:24,104
- I don't need your money.
- I wish I could give you more.

552
01:00:24,180 --> 01:00:26,552
I don't need it.
I'm making money myself.

553
01:00:28,519 --> 01:00:31,209
Though you work all day,
you don't make that much, do you?

554
01:00:31,269 --> 01:00:34,089
- I don't really need it.
- You can buy the kimono belt for this.

555
01:00:37,529 --> 01:00:42,125
I don't want to be your concubine.

556
01:01:21,807 --> 01:01:25,059
Piece of cake.
Men are slow.

557
01:01:25,299 --> 01:01:26,978
You finished?

558
01:01:27,549 --> 01:01:30,433
If the office doesn't take them,
it's no use to be faster.

559
01:01:30,819 --> 01:01:32,249
They didn't?

560
01:01:36,769 --> 01:01:38,329
They didn't.

561
01:01:38,609 --> 01:01:39,955
Why not?

562
01:01:40,089 --> 01:01:42,568
- They pick on little stuff.
- Like what?

563
01:01:43,159 --> 01:01:46,917
"It is not the right material,"
or "the stitches are too loose."

564
01:01:47,449 --> 01:01:50,999
Can't you even negotiate with them?

565
01:01:51,155 --> 01:01:53,085
You're not negotiating the right way.

566
01:01:54,552 --> 01:01:56,262
They are officers.

567
01:01:58,019 --> 01:01:59,949
I can go with you.

568
01:02:00,749 --> 01:02:02,729
Maybe it's better if a woman goes.

569
01:02:03,377 --> 01:02:07,360
If it's you,
they'll be grinning at you.

570
01:02:07,949 --> 01:02:10,172
Tap their nose and come back.

571
01:02:12,759 --> 01:02:14,179
Stop joking.

572
01:02:14,892 --> 01:02:17,177
Well, we should try at least.

573
01:02:17,719 --> 01:02:21,639
We don't know what to do
with those if they don't take them.

574
01:02:21,849 --> 01:02:23,459
You're coming with me.

575
01:02:23,893 --> 01:02:26,631
Put them in the carrier, then.

576
01:02:42,169 --> 01:02:46,509
It was easy.
Some officers can talk.

577
01:02:47,069 --> 01:02:49,519
From now on, you
should do the delivering.

578
01:02:50,399 --> 01:02:53,769
They were surprised,
they'd never seen a female tailor.

579
01:02:54,159 --> 01:02:56,874
I don't think there are any others.

580
01:02:58,259 --> 01:03:00,059
Let's take a break.

581
01:03:07,139 --> 01:03:10,259
I think I can be a tailor.

582
01:03:10,679 --> 01:03:13,245
You worked for 20 years
in Nagoya before, right?

583
01:03:15,199 --> 01:03:17,846
*

584
01:03:20,249 --> 01:03:24,478
If you stay here,
you won't get anywhere.

585
01:03:25,009 --> 01:03:27,447
But, you need capital.

586
01:03:31,919 --> 01:03:33,332
How much?

587
01:03:34,029 --> 01:03:35,563
To run your own shop...

588
01:03:36,679 --> 01:03:41,179
Do you think you can get the capital?

589
01:03:43,079 --> 01:03:45,502
If I can, do you want to
go into business with me?

590
01:03:46,909 --> 01:03:47,794
Me?

591
01:03:48,959 --> 01:03:50,016
Yes.

592
01:03:52,989 --> 01:03:54,504
Will you really do it?

593
01:04:05,009 --> 01:04:10,343
You are the worst looking
guy I've ever met.

594
01:04:12,782 --> 01:04:15,422
At the office, too.
You just stood there like a big truck,

595
01:04:15,559 --> 01:04:17,948
I thought you were
one of the officers.

596
01:04:18,749 --> 01:04:22,201
But, you look like you're reliable.

597
01:04:50,379 --> 01:04:52,189
Is that you, Oyu?

598
01:04:54,219 --> 01:04:56,099
It's been a while.

599
01:04:56,729 --> 01:04:58,449
I wanted to see you, Shima.

600
01:04:59,679 --> 01:05:02,661
- I heard you're a tailor now.
- Yes...

601
01:05:02,829 --> 01:05:05,760
with western dress making in Chiba.

602
01:05:06,469 --> 01:05:08,147
Is that so?

603
01:05:08,268 --> 01:05:10,474
If you want a dress made,
we'll take your order anytime.

604
01:05:17,759 --> 01:05:20,453
Western dress.
That sounds modern.

605
01:05:21,369 --> 01:05:23,399
You look so different.

606
01:05:24,273 --> 01:05:25,369
Why?

607
01:05:25,859 --> 01:05:29,198
You've become much prettier
than before.

608
01:05:30,799 --> 01:05:33,649
I don't have time to
bother about that though.

609
01:05:33,969 --> 01:05:38,889
Maybe if I'd tied my hair more...

610
01:05:39,019 --> 01:05:41,955
I've lost a lot of hair.

611
01:05:42,191 --> 01:05:44,299
Sounds disheartening.

612
01:05:44,619 --> 01:05:46,569
That's a really nice wig.

613
01:05:50,189 --> 01:05:54,290
I've became a Geisha since then.

614
01:05:56,649 --> 01:05:58,219
Is that so?

615
01:05:58,329 --> 01:06:00,410
You look great.

616
01:06:00,689 --> 01:06:06,889
Though if I waited with my mouth
open, nothing would fall in.

617
01:06:06,989 --> 01:06:10,469
I made the capital selling
my wedding goods.

618
01:06:11,259 --> 01:06:15,919
It was right to leave Tsuru, though.

619
01:06:16,559 --> 01:06:18,449
He was such a wimp.

620
01:06:19,009 --> 01:06:25,549
He has a problem with the
woman from Kitamura town.

621
01:06:29,789 --> 01:06:32,849
Would you like to go have
something hot?

622
01:06:48,389 --> 01:06:52,207
Why did you get a divorce?

623
01:06:53,869 --> 01:06:58,318
Well, I can tell you
because it's over.

624
01:06:58,899 --> 01:07:06,486
When Tsuru asked me for money,
I sold my Kimono for it.

625
01:07:11,486 --> 01:07:14,221
You liked him, didn't you?

626
01:07:16,148 --> 01:07:17,810
He's such a handsome man.

627
01:07:27,077 --> 01:07:28,787
I'm leaving the money here.

628
01:07:29,269 --> 01:07:30,569
Thank you.

629
01:07:31,939 --> 01:07:34,030
What are you doing now?

630
01:07:35,196 --> 01:07:36,669
- Me?
- Yes.

631
01:07:38,439 --> 01:07:43,309
I left my husband since Tsuru
told me I could move in with him.

632
01:07:46,279 --> 01:07:50,827
But, he dumped me
for one of his maids.

633
01:07:51,399 --> 01:07:57,927
In the end he got kicked out
of his adoptive family.

634
01:08:00,809 --> 01:08:02,875
Get a hold of yourself.

635
01:08:08,949 --> 01:08:11,269
Don't let guys control you.

636
01:08:11,449 --> 01:08:14,109
You have to make them men.

637
01:08:21,149 --> 01:08:25,271
I still have to visit
a couple of stores for orders.

638
01:08:25,419 --> 01:08:27,797
You do?

639
01:08:27,999 --> 01:08:29,929
Drop by at my shop anytime.

640
01:08:30,119 --> 01:08:32,569
- Thank you for the coffee.
- Bye.

641
01:09:29,609 --> 01:09:31,764
- Welcome back.
- I'm home.

642
01:09:39,369 --> 01:09:42,259
How can you be sleeping?

643
01:09:42,569 --> 01:09:43,952
You're useless.

644
01:09:44,119 --> 01:09:45,913
Hey! Wake up!

645
01:09:48,251 --> 01:09:52,198
I wonder how you managed
to pay your taxes before.

646
01:09:53,799 --> 01:09:55,549
You really annoy me.

647
01:09:56,313 --> 01:09:57,346
Shut up.

648
01:10:02,089 --> 01:10:08,110
*

649
01:10:09,339 --> 01:10:12,354
We have only three days left
till New Year.

650
01:10:13,059 --> 01:10:19,820
We have to sell our dresses otherwise
we won't be able to pay the salaries.

651
01:10:23,539 --> 01:10:26,981
We can't run a business this way.

652
01:10:27,719 --> 01:10:31,382
We still have to pay for the
sewing machine by New Year's eve.

653
01:10:31,569 --> 01:10:34,160
Get up and work.

654
01:10:36,719 --> 01:10:39,219
*

655
01:10:39,719 --> 01:10:41,409
Make me some tea.

656
01:10:42,699 --> 01:10:45,019
I am fixing this for my customer.

657
01:10:51,999 --> 01:10:56,569
Everyone, be patient.
You'll have to work all night long.

658
01:10:57,409 --> 01:11:00,659
Though you get cranky,
we can't build Rome in a night.

659
01:11:29,736 --> 01:11:31,446
Let's take a break.

660
01:11:40,179 --> 01:11:45,236
I expected having a store
would mean more.

661
01:11:45,899 --> 01:11:47,829
How disappointing.

662
01:11:48,979 --> 01:11:52,999
If we pay your salary,
we don't have much left.

663
01:11:54,119 --> 01:11:56,999
But, we can't work like you.

664
01:11:59,079 --> 01:12:02,598
Think what if you had to work
and do the household like I do.

665
01:12:03,699 --> 01:12:09,129
Any business takes time to get settled.
Take it easy.

666
01:12:12,539 --> 01:12:15,913
Where can you find people playing chess
in the store before New Year's eve?

667
01:12:16,005 --> 01:12:17,355
Stop it.

668
01:12:19,729 --> 01:12:23,019
How could you?
You, bastard.

669
01:12:23,063 --> 01:12:24,403
Calm down.

670
01:12:35,395 --> 01:12:38,118
She gets cranky
at this time of the month.

671
01:12:38,287 --> 01:12:39,636
Don't take it out on us.

672
01:12:40,289 --> 01:12:45,009
What? I walked all the way
to the pawnshop to save money.

673
01:12:45,809 --> 01:12:48,999
Look at you. You take a nap
whenever you get a chance.

674
01:12:49,476 --> 01:12:52,406
If you worked harder
I wouldn't have to hire others.

675
01:12:53,363 --> 01:12:55,462
How can you say that in here.
Get back in.

676
01:12:56,999 --> 01:12:58,399
Calm down.

677
01:12:58,519 --> 01:13:00,071
She gets so hysterical.

678
01:13:00,169 --> 01:13:02,528
Let's get back to the chess.

679
01:13:05,986 --> 01:13:07,242
You, bastard!

680
01:13:08,299 --> 01:13:10,639
Have you woken up yet?

681
01:13:10,999 --> 01:13:12,549
Stop it.

682
01:13:19,429 --> 01:13:21,692
Did you wake up?

683
01:13:21,889 --> 01:13:23,350
Stop it.

684
01:14:08,699 --> 01:14:10,832
They finally took the sewing machine.

685
01:14:18,705 --> 01:14:22,629
That's why I told you
we should have...

686
01:14:24,129 --> 01:14:28,870
I was going to stay at my aunt's
but her daughter is back.

687
01:14:30,777 --> 01:14:34,600
I can't stay there.

688
01:14:36,019 --> 01:14:39,652
We could ask the landlord if
we could stay here a bit longer.

689
01:14:44,209 --> 01:14:46,079
Have you been waiting long?

690
01:14:58,956 --> 01:15:04,521
I didn't expect it to be so bad.
I can't find a job anywhere.

691
01:15:07,189 --> 01:15:10,959
I'll go back to my home.

692
01:15:12,849 --> 01:15:16,649
You know how difficult
it is in the countryside.

693
01:15:18,649 --> 01:15:22,789
That's why I told you
we should have worked harder.

694
01:15:23,273 --> 01:15:25,173
Don't keep saying that.

695
01:15:46,709 --> 01:15:51,319
Let's go to Shaga.
Your friends are there, right?

696
01:15:51,899 --> 01:15:54,359
It'd be like as if you
came back from the West.

697
01:15:55,149 --> 01:15:57,269
What are you going to do
if I go back there?

698
01:15:57,369 --> 01:15:59,749
I'll make money in Tokyo.

699
01:16:01,662 --> 01:16:06,796
Ask your boss
at where you used to work.

700
01:16:08,329 --> 01:16:11,119
I didn't work for the wages,
they paid me in advance.

701
01:16:11,355 --> 01:16:13,766
I can't take you to the factory.

702
01:16:16,153 --> 01:16:18,140
You can go by yourself, can't you?

703
01:16:20,999 --> 01:16:27,811
Maybe. I heard there's
a position available now.

704
01:16:29,199 --> 01:16:30,789
Try, then.

705
01:16:33,051 --> 01:16:34,391
Where will you go?

706
01:16:36,597 --> 01:16:39,218
I'll look for a room on
the second floor for rent.

707
01:16:39,991 --> 01:16:43,341
If I can't find any, I'll go to my
aunt for a couple of days.

708
01:16:44,159 --> 01:16:46,119
Are we going to separate?

709
01:16:47,039 --> 01:16:49,009
Not much we can do.

710
01:17:02,696 --> 01:17:05,754
Let's get out of here.

711
01:17:28,161 --> 01:17:29,211
- Welcome home.
- Hi.

712
01:17:29,309 --> 01:17:30,988
Your husband is here.

713
01:17:32,591 --> 01:17:33,701
Is he?

714
01:17:41,564 --> 01:17:43,202
Hi, I'm home.

715
01:17:43,322 --> 01:17:44,472
Welcome home.

716
01:17:52,613 --> 01:17:54,563
- Where are your clogs?
- There.

717
01:17:55,492 --> 01:17:58,032
Why did you put them there?

718
01:18:00,319 --> 01:18:02,799
The bottoms have been scuffed a lot.

719
01:18:16,409 --> 01:18:20,520
I was going to see you tomorrow.

720
01:18:20,849 --> 01:18:21,809
Why?

721
01:18:28,184 --> 01:18:29,827
Take a look at this.

722
01:18:30,039 --> 01:18:34,119
I bought you this for you.
The temperature has dropped lately.

723
01:18:35,009 --> 01:18:38,109
Those are nice stripes, aren't they?

724
01:18:47,692 --> 01:18:51,952
I had to let it out a bit
here and there.

725
01:18:52,609 --> 01:18:55,876
Did you buy this?
It must have cost you a lot.

726
01:18:56,459 --> 01:18:59,808
Not at all.
I got a good discount.

727
01:19:01,185 --> 01:19:05,095
The pawnshop owner asked me
to do some sewing jobs.

728
01:19:05,234 --> 01:19:07,074
I got this jacket for the work.

729
01:19:07,169 --> 01:19:10,112
- Are you working on these?
- Yes.

730
01:19:13,699 --> 01:19:15,633
Have you eaten?

731
01:19:16,830 --> 01:19:19,443
I bought you sardines.
I wanted to eat them with you.

732
01:19:20,923 --> 01:19:24,409
It's been a while since we ate together.
I'll cook them right away.

733
01:19:25,570 --> 01:19:27,186
It seems like a honeymoon.

734
01:19:45,164 --> 01:19:46,492
<i>Mrs. Ogata?</i>

735
01:19:46,616 --> 01:19:47,736
Yes.

736
01:19:47,929 --> 01:19:50,398
Is it here already?

737
01:19:51,944 --> 01:19:53,484
What is it?

738
01:19:55,067 --> 01:19:56,557
A sewing machine.

739
01:19:57,589 --> 01:19:58,922
Sewing machine?

740
01:20:03,689 --> 01:20:05,279
Thank you.

741
01:20:07,567 --> 01:20:09,157
You bought it finally.

742
01:20:09,829 --> 01:20:12,779
It's a monthly payment.
I haven't tried it out yet.

743
01:20:12,839 --> 01:20:15,190
I told them I had to try it
out to see if it works.

744
01:20:15,306 --> 01:20:17,476
And if it's any good, I'll buy it.

745
01:20:18,372 --> 01:20:20,392
That's a good idea.

746
01:20:21,549 --> 01:20:24,529
But, it might damage the tatami mat?

747
01:20:24,669 --> 01:20:28,559
No, it won't. If I do I'll make a
lot of money and pay you back.

748
01:20:45,037 --> 01:20:47,594
I can live with you soon.

749
01:20:47,819 --> 01:20:48,859
Yes.

750
01:21:04,233 --> 01:21:05,803
It's smooth.

751
01:21:11,129 --> 01:21:12,529
What's wrong?

752
01:21:14,499 --> 01:21:18,245
I was thinking about the future.

753
01:21:20,949 --> 01:21:22,933
Monthly payments aren't easy.

754
01:21:23,909 --> 01:21:27,612
If I can't pay, I'll ask
them if I can pay it next month,

755
01:21:28,209 --> 01:21:31,039
complaining the machine
doesn't work well.

756
01:21:31,579 --> 01:21:36,518
We can't survive this world
if we are naпve.

757
01:21:42,659 --> 01:21:45,485
I don't want to end my life
being a wage earner.

758
01:21:45,719 --> 01:21:48,523
We have to own the store.

759
01:21:50,009 --> 01:21:52,699
How about having a store in Izu?

760
01:21:53,059 --> 01:21:55,099
Izu? Maybe that would work.

761
01:21:55,549 --> 01:21:57,839
I can borrow irons from the factory.

762
01:21:58,049 --> 01:22:01,489
Then, all we have to do is
to earn the capital.

763
01:22:14,899 --> 01:22:18,462
Dad, that's not the way.
This way.

764
01:22:22,539 --> 01:22:23,939
Good morning.

765
01:22:24,119 --> 01:22:27,749
- Are you going to see the city?
- I'm taking my father to see Tokyo.

766
01:22:27,869 --> 01:22:29,579
Have a good time.

767
01:22:41,869 --> 01:22:43,189
Excuse me.

768
01:22:45,919 --> 01:22:47,219
Is madam here?

769
01:22:47,849 --> 01:22:48,869
Well...

770
01:22:50,639 --> 01:22:53,497
The guest from the countryside
was drinking all morning?

771
01:23:13,799 --> 01:23:15,112
What's wrong?

772
01:23:16,709 --> 01:23:18,957
My body is sore.

773
01:23:20,039 --> 01:23:23,792
You must be tired.
You work too hard.

774
01:23:25,079 --> 01:23:29,608
I can't stay in bed.
I have things to be done by today.

775
01:23:30,529 --> 01:23:32,439
I hate summer.

776
01:23:32,689 --> 01:23:34,417
Business isn't too good in the summer?

777
01:23:34,548 --> 01:23:35,798
Right.

778
01:23:36,609 --> 01:23:38,809
I can't have stamina
with a small income.

779
01:23:39,882 --> 01:23:41,179
True.

780
01:23:41,508 --> 01:23:46,197
How can I have energy left for nights.

781
01:23:47,414 --> 01:23:50,363
Then, your husband is
pretty tough at it?

782
01:23:53,479 --> 01:23:56,666
Well, he isn't really.

783
01:23:59,939 --> 01:24:01,553
Are you sure?

784
01:24:18,317 --> 01:24:22,794
Can I borrow a bowl of Soya source?
I'll give it back tomorrow.

785
01:24:24,459 --> 01:24:25,819
Sure.

786
01:24:27,199 --> 01:24:31,197
You are the only one who
lends to me so generously.

787
01:24:32,019 --> 01:24:34,159
We have to help each other.

788
01:24:42,407 --> 01:24:47,227
Your husband daydreams because
you don't spend time in bed with him.

789
01:24:48,589 --> 01:24:49,519
Excuse me?

790
01:24:49,989 --> 01:24:51,849
I can find someone for him.

791
01:24:52,169 --> 01:24:54,689
it would be easier for you, right?

792
01:24:55,109 --> 01:24:56,879
Are you joking?

793
01:24:57,109 --> 01:24:59,089
He's not a gentleman
to have a concubine.

794
01:25:01,929 --> 01:25:02,979
Here.

795
01:25:03,119 --> 01:25:06,700
Thank you.
Sorry if I said too much.

796
01:25:13,583 --> 01:25:16,430
I have to go out.

797
01:25:16,629 --> 01:25:20,346
But, there's deep-fried chikuwa
and pickled cabbage for lunch.

798
01:25:20,769 --> 01:25:21,683
Yes.

799
01:25:25,519 --> 01:25:28,109
Junkichi, put this away, will you?

800
01:25:46,599 --> 01:25:49,582
Madam.
Jien was waiting here for a while.

801
01:25:51,403 --> 01:25:53,315
Grandpa from the countryside?

802
01:25:54,591 --> 01:25:58,115
He was complaining
you were out all morning.

803
01:25:58,739 --> 01:26:00,319
I can't believe that.

804
01:26:02,169 --> 01:26:03,862
He said you were not like a woman.

805
01:26:04,799 --> 01:26:07,490
He doesn't know how hard I work here.

806
01:26:09,869 --> 01:26:11,309
It's for Mrs. Ogata.

807
01:26:13,809 --> 01:26:14,909
Madam.

808
01:26:33,668 --> 01:26:37,134
I'll buy you dinner tonight.
Something good is coming up.

809
01:26:37,419 --> 01:26:38,379
Thank you.

810
01:26:38,489 --> 01:26:41,214
I'd like to have a meal from the
western restaurant, the Tsunoki.

811
01:26:41,376 --> 01:26:43,536
Sure, work hard.

812
01:27:09,629 --> 01:27:11,995
Are you sick?
What's wrong?

813
01:27:13,024 --> 01:27:15,138
I don't know.

814
01:27:16,604 --> 01:27:20,060
They told me to be careful.

815
01:27:22,619 --> 01:27:29,244
I'll see a specialist doctor in Tokyo.
I might stay here for a while.

816
01:27:29,439 --> 01:27:31,770
I need to get some injections.

817
01:27:32,512 --> 01:27:34,947
You've got your wife's illness.

818
01:27:35,525 --> 01:27:38,263
It was good I didn't marry you
after all.

819
01:27:39,039 --> 01:27:43,124
Just kidding. I'll go take care of you
if you get a lung disease.

820
01:27:43,349 --> 01:27:45,146
I doubt it.

821
01:27:45,410 --> 01:27:46,987
Why not?

822
01:27:50,659 --> 01:27:51,999
Why not?

823
01:27:55,139 --> 01:27:59,348
You once thought of dying
in the mountains.

824
01:27:59,949 --> 01:28:03,020
That's really an old story.

825
01:28:03,825 --> 01:28:06,049
You weren't that mean before.

826
01:28:07,269 --> 01:28:09,721
It's not only me who's changed.

827
01:28:09,899 --> 01:28:12,004
Well, you got older, didn't you?

828
01:28:15,048 --> 01:28:19,218
Drop by at my shop with
the old folks from the mountain.

829
01:28:20,137 --> 01:28:22,407
I'll take them around.

830
01:28:46,674 --> 01:28:48,734
You became a nice woman.

831
01:28:48,809 --> 01:28:50,615
You must be joking.

832
01:28:50,749 --> 01:28:54,660
It's true.
You became a nice madam.

833
01:28:55,496 --> 01:28:57,568
You are a successful woman.

834
01:28:57,962 --> 01:29:04,157
Not quite so yet. It's still hard.
Will you invest some money?

835
01:29:06,819 --> 01:29:12,779
Why not? If it's a favour to you,
we'll dig the gold mountain.

836
01:29:16,306 --> 01:29:18,410
We should order some clothes.

837
01:29:18,539 --> 01:29:21,039
Summer suits for me.

838
01:29:21,459 --> 01:29:25,019
And winter suits for you, right?

839
01:29:26,419 --> 01:29:29,330
Make a good one.

840
01:29:30,029 --> 01:29:33,193
I will. Thank you.

841
01:29:33,979 --> 01:29:37,239
Madam, please advertise
our clothes to your neighbors.

842
01:29:37,289 --> 01:29:40,209
I will.

843
01:29:40,449 --> 01:29:46,700
If you send me the samples,
we can find you good connections.

844
01:29:47,709 --> 01:29:52,707
Thank you.
Well, please have some more.

845
01:30:07,074 --> 01:30:09,886
I should go upstairs and say hi.

846
01:30:11,469 --> 01:30:13,879
You don't have to.
Stay away from there.

847
01:30:15,099 --> 01:30:17,534
Why don't you want
my father to go upstairs?

848
01:30:18,001 --> 01:30:22,082
Well, he's drunk and...

849
01:30:23,669 --> 01:30:28,324
How can I get drunk
on two bottles of beer?

850
01:30:28,999 --> 01:30:31,657
Don't make an display of yourself
because of your ex. or whatever.

851
01:30:31,859 --> 01:30:33,789
What are you talking about?

852
01:30:36,326 --> 01:30:39,504
- It is that man, right?
- Shut up. Fool.

853
01:30:40,616 --> 01:30:42,376
How could you leave my father alone?

854
01:30:43,425 --> 01:30:45,199
I'm sorry.

855
01:30:46,379 --> 01:30:49,079
Please be patient.

856
01:30:49,389 --> 01:30:51,648
*

857
01:30:52,359 --> 01:30:56,796
I can't keep running up
and downstairs all night.

858
01:30:57,279 --> 01:30:59,139
Shut up. What a wife!

859
01:31:01,219 --> 01:31:07,429
You can work hard,
but how could you...

860
01:31:08,899 --> 01:31:16,344
tell your father-in-law
to stay back here?

861
01:31:17,369 --> 01:31:23,629
You just want to drink more, right?
You drink out every night.

862
01:31:24,642 --> 01:31:27,732
Why not go out to drink tonight, too?
You can charge us for what you drink.

863
01:31:28,509 --> 01:31:31,214
You don't mind if I charge my drinks?

864
01:31:31,980 --> 01:31:35,094
I don't tell you not to drink.

865
01:31:36,137 --> 01:31:39,626
Well, let me tell you something then.
Did you come here to see Tokyo?

866
01:31:40,249 --> 01:31:41,848
I sent him over here.

867
01:31:43,969 --> 01:31:50,103
If you plan to stay here, I can't treat
you like a guest all the time.

868
01:31:52,134 --> 01:31:53,601
You don't want me here, right?

869
01:31:58,169 --> 01:31:59,791
Calm down.

870
01:32:01,569 --> 01:32:03,150
What a wife.

871
01:32:20,139 --> 01:32:22,525
Hang in there.

872
01:32:28,299 --> 01:32:33,306
I can't stay here alone just for
the injections, so I'm going back.

873
01:32:36,789 --> 01:32:39,756
I'll take these for my kids then,
thank you.

874
01:32:51,309 --> 01:32:53,297
Do you want to come with me?

875
01:32:58,018 --> 01:33:02,282
You'll get bored with life
in the mountains.

876
01:33:08,754 --> 01:33:13,402
People change as time goes by.

877
01:33:21,348 --> 01:33:24,756
If the economy gets better,
things will get better.

878
01:33:31,636 --> 01:33:34,087
The location isn't good for business.

879
01:33:34,214 --> 01:33:36,457
So, soon we'll move.

880
01:33:37,619 --> 01:33:41,101
We'll try our luck once more.

881
01:33:42,429 --> 01:33:43,983
That sounds good, too.

882
01:33:48,240 --> 01:33:51,231
Since you made a fortune,
will you lend me some money?

883
01:33:54,109 --> 01:33:55,389
Sure.

884
01:33:56,335 --> 01:33:58,610
I'll pay you back
with interest per year.

885
01:34:04,869 --> 01:34:06,917
Onoda tailors.

886
01:34:10,190 --> 01:34:13,089
Please visit us.

887
01:34:15,008 --> 01:34:16,129
What is it?

888
01:34:16,189 --> 01:34:18,419
Some tailor that just came
back from the west.

889
01:34:19,749 --> 01:34:21,613
We'll give you discount.

890
01:34:23,279 --> 01:34:25,112
Onoda tailors.

891
01:34:25,869 --> 01:34:30,509
You can't do this here.
We have a regular tailor here.

892
01:34:30,549 --> 01:34:31,479
Take it easy.

893
01:34:31,519 --> 01:34:34,643
We have a regular tailor...

894
01:34:34,789 --> 01:34:36,153
But let me...

895
01:34:46,929 --> 01:34:48,879
Onoda tailors.

896
01:34:49,432 --> 01:34:50,667
Please.

897
01:34:51,441 --> 01:34:54,234
Please come visit us.

898
01:35:02,072 --> 01:35:03,506
Make a turn here.

899
01:35:09,038 --> 01:35:10,573
Turn here again.

900
01:35:12,559 --> 01:35:14,071
Are you OK?

901
01:35:58,843 --> 01:36:01,762
Sir, your pattern is old.

902
01:36:01,999 --> 01:36:03,767
We don't make them anymore.

903
01:36:05,169 --> 01:36:06,215
Really?

904
01:36:12,053 --> 01:36:14,271
- Well, I'll leave it to you, then.
- You will?

905
01:36:14,341 --> 01:36:16,544
Junkichi. Did you give some tea
to the guest upstairs?

906
01:36:17,329 --> 01:36:18,793
I did.

907
01:36:19,289 --> 01:36:20,425
Good.

908
01:36:42,171 --> 01:36:45,521
Sorry she isn't back yet.

909
01:36:46,369 --> 01:36:49,239
Don't worry about me.

910
01:36:55,759 --> 01:36:58,719
- That's a nice record player.
- Nothing special.

911
01:36:58,929 --> 01:37:01,190
We don't have much of
a collection yet.

912
01:37:01,479 --> 01:37:03,919
I want to collect
all the Naniwa songs.

913
01:37:04,449 --> 01:37:08,129
Is that so? That's nice.

914
01:37:12,539 --> 01:37:17,431
Really sorry to keep you waiting.
Maybe I'll learn instead of her.

915
01:37:18,659 --> 01:37:25,165
That's nice. Men arrange
flowers better than women.

916
01:37:29,349 --> 01:37:34,966
I told her to learn it since
she's getting to know more people.

917
01:37:35,309 --> 01:37:38,516
It's embarrassing if she
doesn't know these things.

918
01:37:38,775 --> 01:37:40,645
But, she's always out.

919
01:38:06,027 --> 01:38:07,477
Welcome home.

920
01:38:07,659 --> 01:38:08,899
I'm back.

921
01:38:21,666 --> 01:38:23,346
How uncomfortable.

922
01:38:25,219 --> 01:38:29,236
But, Sir was right.
You do look younger.

923
01:38:31,313 --> 01:38:32,301
Really?

924
01:38:32,829 --> 01:38:35,096
You look like a magician
from Hawaii at least.

925
01:38:37,399 --> 01:38:40,964
I'm sore from riding a bicycle all day.

926
01:38:41,449 --> 01:38:42,689
Sore where?

927
01:38:42,939 --> 01:38:44,445
You don't have to ask.

928
01:38:44,969 --> 01:38:46,469
Is it so?

929
01:38:49,369 --> 01:38:52,369
Are you making a pattern?

930
01:38:52,509 --> 01:38:55,443
Yes. Mr. Ogata's pattern is old.

931
01:38:58,459 --> 01:38:59,792
Really?

932
01:39:04,439 --> 01:39:05,759
Do we have a guest?

933
01:39:05,809 --> 01:39:07,649
Your flower arrangement teacher.

934
01:39:11,863 --> 01:39:13,923
<i>No. Don't say that...</i>

935
01:39:14,029 --> 01:39:19,332
<i>It's nothing.
I've always adored you.</i>

936
01:39:21,569 --> 01:39:23,976
We'll finish here today.

937
01:39:24,081 --> 01:39:26,841
- Well, see you.
- Thank you.

938
01:39:36,764 --> 01:39:38,915
You are back.

939
01:39:39,722 --> 01:39:41,684
This is for the month.

940
01:39:44,249 --> 01:39:50,018
I don't have time for this.
Don't come back.

941
01:40:05,589 --> 01:40:07,259
You're such an idiot.

942
01:40:07,497 --> 01:40:14,487
You get your beard in a twist over
a woman who has the skin of a goldfish.

943
01:40:14,892 --> 01:40:16,155
What?

944
01:40:17,089 --> 01:40:19,039
Damn all this!

945
01:40:19,239 --> 01:40:20,391
What are you doing?!

946
01:40:21,059 --> 01:40:22,519
Bastard!

947
01:41:39,309 --> 01:41:41,033
It's miserable.

948
01:41:41,809 --> 01:41:48,924
She works so hard. But, she told me
you were one out of a thousand.

949
01:41:49,509 --> 01:41:51,094
Stop joking, OK?

950
01:41:55,859 --> 01:42:00,599
You don't have to be so patient.
I can find a good girl for you.

951
01:42:07,482 --> 01:42:09,202
- Here, have some.
- With pleasure.

952
01:42:10,489 --> 01:42:15,579
I didn't know you knew his wife.

953
01:42:16,424 --> 01:42:18,151
I found it out just now.

954
01:42:18,267 --> 01:42:20,269
*

955
01:42:27,265 --> 01:42:33,275
This is a daughter of the Kanna Family.
Her father helped me a lot.

956
01:42:34,349 --> 01:42:39,459
I've been a friend with Shima's
ex-husband since we were kids.

957
01:42:40,109 --> 01:42:43,679
She got so jealous.

958
01:42:45,319 --> 01:42:46,979
Really.

959
01:42:48,600 --> 01:42:51,190
She gave me a lot of trouble.

960
01:42:52,431 --> 01:42:54,019
I had a sip, but...

961
01:42:54,099 --> 01:42:55,449
Thank you.

962
01:42:55,569 --> 01:43:03,579
I had to get out of my husband's house
because she lied about me and her ex.

963
01:43:05,446 --> 01:43:11,450
She's smart with money.
She's like a man right?

964
01:43:12,009 --> 01:43:14,592
Yes, she's just like a man.

965
01:43:15,589 --> 01:43:17,379
See, I know her.

966
01:43:19,758 --> 01:43:22,528
I'm never without scars.

967
01:43:23,358 --> 01:43:27,431
Here. Here. And here.

968
01:43:28,968 --> 01:43:31,311
How terrible.

969
01:43:32,038 --> 01:43:34,188
I'm sorry for you.

970
01:43:36,948 --> 01:43:40,617
I know a good house in Hakusai.

971
01:43:41,568 --> 01:43:43,672
I'll leave it to you.

972
01:43:45,468 --> 01:43:52,639
I can make dresses.
I can get you customers, too.

973
01:43:54,774 --> 01:43:58,704
Well, you are gentle with people.
Maybe you're good at it.

974
01:44:00,278 --> 01:44:01,398
Maybe.

975
01:44:01,528 --> 01:44:04,978
It really doesn't matter though.
Please.

976
01:44:19,138 --> 01:44:20,188
Here.

977
01:44:21,718 --> 01:44:22,808
Thank you.

978
01:44:23,148 --> 01:44:25,008
Well, I'm taking this...

979
01:44:27,058 --> 01:44:32,509
It was really terrible of you
leaving me alone in the mountains.

980
01:44:32,673 --> 01:44:34,844
I was going to pick you up later on.

981
01:44:35,078 --> 01:44:38,508
But, my master got sick
and I couldn't go anywhere.

982
01:44:39,198 --> 01:44:44,167
You should return
and ask your wife to come back.

983
01:44:44,648 --> 01:44:48,308
I'm thinking about that.
A man's life is tough.

984
01:44:48,498 --> 01:44:51,624
You are all cowards.

985
01:44:53,134 --> 01:44:56,337
I heard the master of the Hamaya
in the mountains was really sick.

986
01:44:58,723 --> 01:45:00,035
You mean him?

987
01:45:00,650 --> 01:45:02,420
I heard from someone.

988
01:45:03,538 --> 01:45:04,958
Really.

989
01:45:06,298 --> 01:45:07,728
How bad is he?

990
01:45:09,088 --> 01:45:10,868
He's in bed, I heard.

991
01:45:20,748 --> 01:45:22,948
Call for sweet sake.

992
01:45:24,808 --> 01:45:26,433
I'm leaving.

993
01:45:26,536 --> 01:45:28,186
Have another drink before you go.

994
01:45:30,070 --> 01:45:31,294
The sake vendor's here.

995
01:45:31,832 --> 01:45:33,967
Order one for each of us.

996
01:45:34,748 --> 01:45:36,798
You should go see him.

997
01:45:37,288 --> 01:45:41,138
Right. I also have to pay him back.

998
01:46:10,072 --> 01:46:11,493
Welcome home.

999
01:46:16,113 --> 01:46:17,978
She was waiting for you.

1000
01:46:18,908 --> 01:46:20,686
Did she go out?

1001
01:46:21,388 --> 01:46:23,603
Yes, to the mountains.

1002
01:46:25,081 --> 01:46:26,571
To the mountains?

1003
01:46:26,734 --> 01:46:27,704
What for?

1004
01:46:27,996 --> 01:46:30,044
To pay some money back.

1005
01:46:30,548 --> 01:46:31,828
What?

1006
01:46:33,698 --> 01:46:35,408
She was waiting for you
for a long time,

1007
01:46:35,478 --> 01:46:38,028
but she just left because
she didn't want to miss the train.

1008
01:46:39,208 --> 01:46:40,617
Why?

1009
01:46:40,884 --> 01:46:44,419
Taking money to the mountains...
What's the rush?

1010
01:46:47,478 --> 01:46:52,538
The master in the mountains got sick so
she thought he might need the money.

1011
01:46:52,614 --> 01:46:56,346
Since we can manage to run the business,
she thought she had to pay him back.

1012
01:47:00,968 --> 01:47:02,888
Junkichi, make a fire.

1013
01:48:19,358 --> 01:48:21,381
Are you the madam here?

1014
01:48:22,113 --> 01:48:25,018
You are Shima from Tokyo?

1015
01:48:27,458 --> 01:48:29,948
I am very sorry.

1016
01:48:32,078 --> 01:48:34,108
I had no idea.

1017
01:48:35,582 --> 01:48:40,877
We should have let you know,
but we were pretty busy, then.

1018
01:48:43,128 --> 01:48:49,349
We couldn't be troubled to send
a telegram to one of our ex-maids.

1019
01:49:00,695 --> 01:49:05,790
Since I didn't know about this,
I brought these for him.

1020
01:49:06,058 --> 01:49:07,838
What are they?

1021
01:49:07,958 --> 01:49:12,526
Some cakes and sweets.
He loved them.

1022
01:49:15,078 --> 01:49:17,283
I didn't know that.

1023
01:49:17,774 --> 01:49:19,288
Thank you, anyway.

1024
01:49:29,078 --> 01:49:31,608
Is his grave far?

1025
01:49:32,068 --> 01:49:34,408
It takes about half day.

1026
01:49:35,718 --> 01:49:41,968
You'll miss your train
if you don't go now.

1027
01:51:03,776 --> 01:51:05,052
I'll give you this.

1028
01:51:06,004 --> 01:51:08,044
This much money?

1029
01:51:08,648 --> 01:51:11,658
Take it.
Your master gave it to me once.

1030
01:51:14,368 --> 01:51:21,693
Is it OK?
I wanted to pay you back, but...

1031
01:51:26,732 --> 01:51:29,566
I'll say good bye here.

1032
01:52:28,384 --> 01:52:29,914
To Hakusan.

1033
01:53:32,808 --> 01:53:34,338
Welcome back.

1034
01:53:41,068 --> 01:53:43,655
I told people I would visit
my country home for a week.

1035
01:53:43,828 --> 01:53:45,209
That's great.

1036
01:53:45,528 --> 01:53:47,066
Go get changed.

1037
01:53:51,498 --> 01:53:53,169
I sewed this.

1038
01:53:55,909 --> 01:53:57,309
It's well done.

1039
01:53:58,558 --> 01:54:00,948
I'll do it.

1040
01:54:03,828 --> 01:54:06,094
Who is it? Umeya?

1041
01:54:10,676 --> 01:54:11,978
Hello?

1042
01:54:23,872 --> 01:54:24,902
My bag!

1043
01:54:46,078 --> 01:54:47,396
Shima!

1044
01:54:54,628 --> 01:54:56,771
How did you know about here?

1045
01:54:57,488 --> 01:54:59,080
Well, come inside.

1046
01:55:02,288 --> 01:55:05,498
You wear a wig well
on your balding head!

1047
01:55:10,708 --> 01:55:14,176
I wanted to see you
and have a talk with you.

1048
01:55:17,788 --> 01:55:21,085
I hate foul women like you.

1049
01:55:22,479 --> 01:55:24,259
You do?

1050
01:55:32,358 --> 01:55:36,528
If you don't want your husband to
cheat on you, take better care of him.

1051
01:55:37,254 --> 01:55:40,804
Because you are so uptight,
your husbands leave you.

1052
01:55:41,448 --> 01:55:44,506
If you want shit on your head,
I'll give it to you.

1053
01:55:44,595 --> 01:55:45,885
So, say "thank you."

1054
01:55:47,532 --> 01:55:49,452
How thoughtful yet stubborn.

1055
01:55:50,693 --> 01:55:52,763
I'll teach you how to bow.

1056
01:55:56,308 --> 01:55:57,818
You brute!

1057
01:56:25,804 --> 01:56:27,946
Someone help me!

1058
01:57:57,388 --> 01:57:58,568
Welcome!

1059
01:57:58,638 --> 01:58:01,375
- Can I have an umbrella?
- Which one?

1060
01:58:01,783 --> 01:58:04,917
This one?
It's terrible rain isn't it?

1061
01:58:05,948 --> 01:58:08,797
I'll take this. How much is it?

1062
01:58:08,966 --> 01:58:10,984
1 yen and 30 sen.

1063
01:58:14,028 --> 01:58:16,478
- Can I use the phone?
- The phone is over there.

1064
01:58:25,888 --> 01:58:26,826
Hello?

1065
01:58:27,748 --> 01:58:28,971
Junkichi?

1066
01:58:29,168 --> 01:58:32,122
Is the bastard home yet?

1067
01:58:32,818 --> 01:58:35,594
Can you pass the phone to Mr. Kimura?

1068
01:58:40,251 --> 01:58:41,861
From Madam?

1069
01:58:46,513 --> 01:58:47,753
Mr. Kimura?

1070
01:58:47,968 --> 01:58:53,168
I have to ask you for some advice.
Can you bring my bag over to me?

1071
01:58:54,348 --> 01:59:00,846
I might leave the store.
I want you to do the pattern...

1072
01:59:01,038 --> 01:59:03,618
and I want to run
a new store with you.

1073
01:59:08,546 --> 01:59:10,226
So, I can close the store now?

1074
01:59:10,661 --> 01:59:13,811
Close before the bastard comes back.

1075
01:59:14,408 --> 01:59:17,000
Let's talk more at the hot springs.

1076
01:59:17,528 --> 01:59:18,675
Really?

1077
01:59:22,567 --> 01:59:25,429
Can you also take Junkichi with you?

1078
01:59:26,298 --> 01:59:30,637
He's been working hard so
we should give him a day off, too.

1079
01:59:31,535 --> 01:59:33,944
So, I'll see you at the station.

1080
01:59:41,068 --> 01:59:43,719
Thank you. Here's your change.

1081
01:59:43,968 --> 01:59:45,938
Take it. It's for the phone.

1082
01:59:46,588 --> 01:59:48,498
Thank you very much.

1083
02:00:29,579 --> 02:00:36,000
THE END
