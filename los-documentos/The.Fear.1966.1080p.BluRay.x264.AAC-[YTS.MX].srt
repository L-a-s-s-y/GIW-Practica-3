1
00:00:22,769 --> 00:00:24,269
THE FEAR

2
00:06:42,784 --> 00:06:44,071
Who is it?

3
00:06:44,289 --> 00:06:45,575
<i>Me.</i>

4
00:07:07,335 --> 00:07:08,835
Why do you lock yourself in?

5
00:07:10,518 --> 00:07:11,818
For fear of thieves?

6
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:16,293
What do you want?

7
00:10:50,931 --> 00:10:52,531
So you're here for 4 days only?

8
00:10:53,774 --> 00:10:57,298
The Histology Professor became ill and
the exams were postponed for a week.

9
00:11:01,231 --> 00:11:03,881
So I managed to come over for a few days.

10
00:11:11,771 --> 00:11:13,621
In some 20 days I'm finishing studies.

11
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:17,281
That means you're coming back
with the diploma.

12
00:11:23,923 --> 00:11:25,873
Wheat looks good this year.

13
00:11:26,945 --> 00:11:28,495
We had rains last week.

14
00:11:30,144 --> 00:11:32,444
Most of it was brought down by the wind.

15
00:11:39,393 --> 00:11:40,846
Did you find her?

16
00:11:47,622 --> 00:11:48,822
She's nowhere.

17
00:11:49,049 --> 00:11:50,526
Perhaps she went to the fields?

18
00:11:51,063 --> 00:11:52,863
I asked the field guard.

19
00:11:54,468 --> 00:11:55,945
She's not in the stable either.

20
00:11:58,092 --> 00:12:00,142
The earth has swallowed her.

21
00:12:04,207 --> 00:12:06,307
Now we have worries with Chrysa, too.

22
00:12:15,406 --> 00:12:16,806
I won't come at noon.

23
00:12:18,033 --> 00:12:19,233
I'm busy.

24
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:37,590
Chrysa gives me extra work today.

25
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:42,873
- Leave it mother, I'll do it.
- You rest. You're only here for 2 days.

26
00:12:56,288 --> 00:12:57,574
Does he sleep with you now?

27
00:13:02,192 --> 00:13:04,342
I saw him come into your room last night.

28
00:13:07,586 --> 00:13:08,836
When he's drunk.

29
00:13:11,525 --> 00:13:13,373
He only comes to humiliate me.

30
00:13:17,391 --> 00:13:20,076
- He won't come at noon.
- Said he's busy.

31
00:13:22,336 --> 00:13:23,536
You know what with.

32
00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:54,458
A good thing you'll finish
and be back soon.

33
00:13:59,552 --> 00:14:01,648
He's started selling off
parts of the fields.

34
00:14:03,854 --> 00:14:05,054
Selling off?

35
00:14:05,489 --> 00:14:07,489
The field guard confided it to me.

36
00:14:08,077 --> 00:14:10,411
For some time now, he's been going
down to Thebes.

37
00:14:11,259 --> 00:14:13,069
This place is no good for him anymore.

38
00:14:15,174 --> 00:14:17,174
Recently he was away for 3 days.

39
00:14:17,993 --> 00:14:19,743
Having a ball with some hussies.

40
00:14:39,026 --> 00:14:40,481
Where's that girl?

41
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:42,829
She hasn't done this before.

42
00:14:46,254 --> 00:14:48,916
How are you getting along with Anestis?

43
00:14:49,385 --> 00:14:51,685
You can never tell
what he's thinking about.

44
00:14:52,511 --> 00:14:55,411
He's wandering in the fields all day
like a wild beast.

45
00:14:56,162 --> 00:14:58,182
I'm worried about this boy.

46
00:14:58,762 --> 00:15:00,044
Never speaks.

47
00:15:00,064 --> 00:15:02,249
Let his father care for him.

48
00:15:02,269 --> 00:15:03,469
I won't meddle anymore.

49
00:15:07,481 --> 00:15:09,781
I'm his stepmother and
may be misunderstood.

50
00:16:49,901 --> 00:16:51,162
Where's Anna?

51
00:16:52,325 --> 00:16:54,825
Said she'd walk in the fields.

52
00:16:54,903 --> 00:16:56,503
I would have seen her if she had.

53
00:16:58,318 --> 00:17:00,128
She may have gone down to the village.

54
00:17:01,309 --> 00:17:02,609
She took the horse too.

55
00:17:03,219 --> 00:17:05,219
You expected her to walk down there?

56
00:17:07,764 --> 00:17:10,241
She might have got together
with that mechanic again.

57
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:17,627
I won't stand for this.

58
00:17:18,379 --> 00:17:20,427
You mind your business and
don't think evil.

59
00:17:22,123 --> 00:17:23,402
Well, yeah...

60
00:17:23,975 --> 00:17:25,783
If father catches her...

61
00:17:39,097 --> 00:17:40,697
You set the table already?

62
00:17:45,222 --> 00:17:46,485
You're late.

63
00:17:56,427 --> 00:17:57,924
What about Chrysa?

64
00:17:59,863 --> 00:18:01,063
Hasn't shown up yet.

65
00:18:03,301 --> 00:18:04,851
What if she fell into a channel?

66
00:18:07,277 --> 00:18:09,877
A shepherd was found drowned
the other day.

67
00:18:10,446 --> 00:18:11,946
Ah, that shepherd again...

68
00:18:13,318 --> 00:18:14,918
Don't speak of adversity, mother.

69
00:18:17,987 --> 00:18:20,587
A good thing they brought us
these fish from the lake.

70
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:27,030
MYSTERIOUS DISAPPEARANCE
OF DEAF MUTE GIRL

71
00:19:14,667 --> 00:19:16,236
Where have you been?

72
00:19:16,717 --> 00:19:19,367
Where? I went to get hay for the cattle.

73
00:19:21,096 --> 00:19:23,646
I've told you to take these off
when you walk in here.

74
00:19:34,523 --> 00:19:36,423
She's giving me a hard time, that slut!

75
00:19:37,884 --> 00:19:39,484
Now we're in the papers too.

76
00:19:45,153 --> 00:19:46,353
What does this mean?

77
00:19:56,513 --> 00:19:58,413
Self-slaughter means suicide.

78
00:20:01,483 --> 00:20:03,058
Read it from the word go.

79
00:20:12,444 --> 00:20:16,741
Our fellow residents are obviously
overwhelmed with emotion by the

80
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:21,411
mysterious disappearance of the deaf
mute girl Chrysa Kavanari

81
00:20:22,615 --> 00:20:25,799
who was adopted daughter to
well-known land owner

82
00:20:26,507 --> 00:20:27,957
Dimitrios Kanalis

83
00:20:28,698 --> 00:20:31,212
whose residence she disappeared from.

84
00:20:34,079 --> 00:20:36,429
Many support the possibility
of an accident

85
00:20:37,188 --> 00:20:39,998
while another number of residents
are expressing a suspicion

86
00:20:40,023 --> 00:20:41,976
that it might be a case of self-slaughter

87
00:20:43,843 --> 00:20:46,156
or a flight of the missing girl

88
00:20:46,281 --> 00:20:47,881
which reportedly was subjected to

89
00:20:49,605 --> 00:20:50,879
maltreatment

90
00:20:51,481 --> 00:20:53,143
by the Kanalis family.

91
00:20:55,449 --> 00:20:57,980
Lastly, a third category of residents

92
00:20:58,385 --> 00:21:02,135
are overwhelmed with the belief
claiming this as being a miracle.

93
00:21:03,153 --> 00:21:06,644
As known as it is, the deaf mute girl
has often revealed

94
00:21:06,672 --> 00:21:08,530
through gestures and inarticulate cries

95
00:21:08,803 --> 00:21:11,279
that she envisaged the Madonna
who through signalling

96
00:21:11,299 --> 00:21:13,699
exhorted the girl to follow Her.

97
00:21:15,351 --> 00:21:18,321
The Constabulary are conducting a search

98
00:21:18,348 --> 00:21:20,158
for the discovery of the missing girl.

99
00:21:21,329 --> 00:21:24,279
What came upon that poor child
so as to do this?

100
00:21:26,161 --> 00:21:28,361
Hope it has no consequence on us.

101
00:21:29,626 --> 00:21:30,976
We, maltreating her...

102
00:21:34,474 --> 00:21:36,046
I know who spreads these rumours.

103
00:21:39,375 --> 00:21:41,025
One day I'll smash his head!

104
00:21:41,316 --> 00:21:42,650
Talking about Santo, father?

105
00:21:44,675 --> 00:21:46,339
You stay out of this.

106
00:21:46,658 --> 00:21:49,222
I saw him with his son, the mechanic.

107
00:21:49,349 --> 00:21:53,249
They were talking with others and
when they saw me they quit their talk.

108
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:56,260
We found her in a chapel far away.

109
00:22:56,536 --> 00:22:59,036
We fed her, she was starving.

110
00:22:59,056 --> 00:23:00,343
Go away, boys.

111
00:23:12,955 --> 00:23:16,705
We tried to find out why she left
but we couldn't.

112
00:23:16,725 --> 00:23:18,094
I can't understand it.

113
00:23:18,921 --> 00:23:21,871
My wife went down to her room today
but she was not there.

114
00:23:22,287 --> 00:23:25,487
Sir Dimitris, will you tell her
to say something for us?

115
00:23:26,145 --> 00:23:29,845
Mother of God appeared before her,
that's why the girl was scared off.

116
00:23:44,357 --> 00:23:45,939
She's scared stiff!

117
00:23:46,673 --> 00:23:49,623
Take care of her.
She's the lucky charm of your house.

118
00:25:06,854 --> 00:25:08,054
Hand me a cigarette.

119
00:25:19,589 --> 00:25:21,447
Has your father caught you out smoking?

120
00:25:25,908 --> 00:25:27,271
My mother did.

121
00:25:29,266 --> 00:25:31,566
The other day I had trouble with
my own father.

122
00:25:34,574 --> 00:25:37,124
My uncle told him I spoke to a girl.

123
00:25:37,566 --> 00:25:38,766
What if I did?

124
00:25:42,379 --> 00:25:44,379
No, he said, such things are immoral.

125
00:25:45,007 --> 00:25:47,579
If I hear of such things again,
I'll cut your legs off.

126
00:25:48,639 --> 00:25:51,389
So, I'll leave next year and
go work in Athens.

127
00:25:51,776 --> 00:25:53,776
Lots of women there if you want them.

128
00:25:54,913 --> 00:25:56,863
My father does not allow me to leave.

129
00:25:57,678 --> 00:25:58,917
He wants me in the fields.

130
00:26:00,164 --> 00:26:01,678
Suits him fine...

131
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:04,659
He has money to pay for women.

132
00:26:07,517 --> 00:26:08,855
You fancy women.

133
00:26:11,552 --> 00:26:12,752
You're a little...

134
00:26:14,726 --> 00:26:15,989
...cowardly.

135
00:26:17,477 --> 00:26:19,877
They'll go with married men more easily.

136
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:22,950
My father's rich too.

137
00:26:28,345 --> 00:26:30,695
They all act as if they know nothing.

138
00:26:32,126 --> 00:26:33,426
In their own interest.

139
00:26:42,682 --> 00:26:45,882
You could do it with one of the girls
working in your fields.

140
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:50,967
But you're brusk and you scare them.

141
00:26:51,563 --> 00:26:53,467
You're not cunning enough.

142
00:26:53,593 --> 00:26:55,194
If anyone sees me...

143
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:03,922
Those ones mock you behind your back.

144
00:27:04,047 --> 00:27:05,741
They say you're a...

145
00:27:08,455 --> 00:27:09,717
...virgin.

146
00:27:11,673 --> 00:27:14,573
Lambros was chased by Tasia's father
with a rifle.

147
00:27:20,586 --> 00:27:22,539
You have to do your thing
in a sneaky way.

148
00:27:28,619 --> 00:27:29,881
My uncle...

149
00:27:30,454 --> 00:27:32,181
They'd gone to church.

150
00:27:33,311 --> 00:27:34,861
My cousin was alone at home.

151
00:27:36,378 --> 00:27:39,378
I pretended I didn't know
the others were away.

152
00:27:39,567 --> 00:27:40,767
I went in.

153
00:27:40,974 --> 00:27:44,374
She gathered something was on my mind
and she blushed.

154
00:27:45,329 --> 00:27:46,579
She made me some coffee.

155
00:27:47,288 --> 00:27:48,488
Her hands were shaking.

156
00:27:49,346 --> 00:27:50,685
She asked me...

157
00:27:50,811 --> 00:27:52,466
if I liked the coffee.

158
00:27:53,489 --> 00:27:55,189
I put my hand on her leg...

159
00:27:56,292 --> 00:27:57,692
A nice dress, I told her.

160
00:28:01,121 --> 00:28:02,645
Is there lace on your petticoat?

161
00:28:04,787 --> 00:28:06,087
She started to tremble.

162
00:28:07,079 --> 00:28:08,279
I threw her on the sofa.

163
00:28:13,095 --> 00:28:15,195
Shame on you, shame! she kept saying.

164
00:28:16,623 --> 00:28:17,873
You're creepy...

165
00:28:18,527 --> 00:28:19,777
You're quite a creeper.

166
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:25,136
Like a dove she purred.

167
00:28:38,532 --> 00:28:40,182
Finally she burst into tears.

168
00:28:41,955 --> 00:28:46,134
Not a word about this to anyone,
or you'll be ridiculed, I told her.

169
00:28:46,261 --> 00:28:48,061
Even murder may come out of it.

170
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:50,420
She said nothing.

171
00:28:55,142 --> 00:28:59,177
She banged herself on the sofa
like an animal being slaughtered.

172
00:29:06,819 --> 00:29:09,764
With your cousin, people won't
suspect easy.

173
00:29:10,115 --> 00:29:12,972
And you can visit without
being misjudged.

174
00:29:25,494 --> 00:29:26,944
Have you seen a woman naked?

175
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:32,081
No.

176
00:29:43,622 --> 00:29:46,922
Don't let any of this slip
out of your mouth. Only you know it.

177
00:29:48,396 --> 00:29:49,596
I won't take any risks.

178
00:33:40,013 --> 00:33:42,213
You think I won't get my hands on you?

179
00:33:42,373 --> 00:33:44,273
I saw you, you're Kanalis' son.

180
00:33:44,392 --> 00:33:45,842
You, bastard!

181
00:33:46,932 --> 00:33:48,132
Ravenous!

182
00:50:42,873 --> 00:50:44,397
How did your face get like this?

183
00:50:46,254 --> 00:50:47,954
I got scratched somewhere.

184
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:55,670
Why give me this look, mother?

185
00:51:10,260 --> 00:51:11,460
Where's Chrysa?

186
00:51:13,732 --> 00:51:15,209
Wasn't she going to the church?

187
00:51:26,082 --> 00:51:27,654
What are you trying to hide?

188
00:51:30,494 --> 00:51:31,694
Mother...

189
00:51:31,735 --> 00:51:34,491
- I'll tell you, mother...
- Let me see!

190
00:51:34,647 --> 00:51:36,838
- Let me tell you.
- Stand back I say!

191
00:51:59,569 --> 00:52:01,474
Enough, mother.
Don't look anymore!

192
00:52:01,847 --> 00:52:04,104
I didn't mean to, mother, I didn't!

193
00:52:04,726 --> 00:52:06,983
I tried to push her and she fell, mother!

194
00:52:48,344 --> 00:52:49,544
Scum!

195
00:52:53,712 --> 00:52:55,073
Don't tell father anything.

196
00:52:58,051 --> 00:53:00,101
What'll become of your soul, dirty dog?

197
00:55:08,554 --> 00:55:09,754
Come out here, you!

198
00:55:30,229 --> 00:55:32,629
This animal's got to hide for 2-3 days.

199
00:55:33,904 --> 00:55:35,571
Until the scratches leave his face.

200
00:55:42,041 --> 00:55:44,851
Then I'll notify the police that
Chrysa's disappeared again.

201
00:55:58,235 --> 00:55:59,807
Get lost, out of my sight!

202
00:56:20,772 --> 00:56:23,222
If this became known,
we'd have to leave this place.

203
00:56:25,434 --> 00:56:26,634
We'd be lynched.

204
00:56:30,672 --> 00:56:31,872
We've got property.

205
00:56:35,640 --> 00:56:36,840
There's also Anna.

206
00:57:12,420 --> 00:57:14,373
Why stand there like a scarecrow?

207
00:57:16,591 --> 00:57:17,841
Shine me some light here.

208
00:58:20,388 --> 00:58:21,738
Good evening, Sir Dimitris.

209
00:58:22,532 --> 00:58:23,732
Hi Nicolas.

210
00:58:26,098 --> 00:58:27,748
One of my calves is ill.

211
00:58:31,547 --> 00:58:33,297
I saw light and thought I'd ask you

212
00:58:33,317 --> 00:58:36,317
about that irrigation system we
talked about the other day...

213
01:04:42,259 --> 01:04:45,164
The way he carries on he'll probably
get us burned in the end.

214
01:04:46,564 --> 01:04:48,514
A woman asked me about the bell.

215
01:04:51,429 --> 01:04:53,579
I told her we heard thuds one night

216
01:04:53,662 --> 01:04:55,412
and we worried about thieves.

217
01:04:56,932 --> 01:04:58,132
Did she believe you?

218
01:05:01,690 --> 01:05:02,890
Dunno.

219
01:05:03,351 --> 01:05:04,551
The scoundrel...

220
01:05:06,412 --> 01:05:08,112
He nailed a bell to the door!

221
01:05:11,308 --> 01:05:12,975
He's scared of his shadow too.

222
01:05:15,588 --> 01:05:19,538
The other day when your cousin came,
I had another fright attack.

223
01:05:20,073 --> 01:05:21,823
He shut himself in his room...

224
01:05:24,143 --> 01:05:25,382
Her eye caught him.

225
01:05:29,553 --> 01:05:30,853
I didn't know what to say.

226
01:05:34,408 --> 01:05:38,058
He must leave here after this thing
starts being forgotten.

227
01:05:40,258 --> 01:05:44,058
What I really care about is that
Anna must not know any of this.

228
01:05:45,813 --> 01:05:47,163
She'll be staying here now.

229
01:05:48,322 --> 01:05:49,972
She's bound to know in the end.

230
01:05:53,557 --> 01:05:56,307
She was upset when she heard
about Chrysa.

231
01:05:56,934 --> 01:05:58,534
You know how much she loved her.

232
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:00,480
The wretched one!

233
01:06:01,719 --> 01:06:03,148
Why the hell was he ever born?

234
01:06:05,150 --> 01:06:06,350
Don't swear.

235
01:06:07,360 --> 01:06:08,660
He's to be pitied as well.

236
01:06:13,923 --> 01:06:15,523
What do they say in the village?

237
01:06:17,339 --> 01:06:20,189
They believed her to be found again
like the first time.

238
01:06:21,987 --> 01:06:23,940
There's also some of them mumbling about.

239
01:06:27,382 --> 01:06:30,132
Today they were collecting donations
for the new church.

240
01:06:31,869 --> 01:06:33,069
I gave them a thousand.

241
01:06:41,771 --> 01:06:43,371
Are waters deep in the lake?

242
01:13:14,605 --> 01:13:15,805
Where were you?

243
01:13:21,619 --> 01:13:22,819
For a walk at the lake.

244
01:13:24,562 --> 01:13:26,162
Aren't you going too far?

245
01:14:38,526 --> 01:14:41,026
Eat now while they're hot.
Father, want some?

246
01:14:44,534 --> 01:14:45,984
They give me indigestion.

247
01:14:47,636 --> 01:14:49,236
They never did before.

248
01:14:52,118 --> 01:14:53,431
Will you eat some, mother?

249
01:15:00,405 --> 01:15:01,605
I'm full.

250
01:20:18,080 --> 01:20:19,630
The policeman came at home.

251
01:20:21,083 --> 01:20:23,383
He asked father for a complementary
statement.

252
01:20:25,051 --> 01:20:27,251
Everybody wonders what became of Chrysa.

253
01:20:27,801 --> 01:20:31,701
They searched at the river in case she
fell into a channel and got carried away

254
01:20:31,721 --> 01:20:34,921
at cliffs, caves and monasteries...

255
01:20:35,235 --> 01:20:37,435
They should have found her somewhere.

256
01:20:38,221 --> 01:20:39,421
Living or dead.

257
01:20:46,040 --> 01:20:47,990
He asked for your statement too.

258
01:20:50,786 --> 01:20:54,186
He said when you go by the village
you should visit his office.

259
01:20:55,734 --> 01:20:57,534
I gave a statement.

260
01:21:01,345 --> 01:21:03,245
He may have something more to ask you.

261
01:21:23,726 --> 01:21:25,631
Were you at home when the sergeant came?

262
01:21:26,568 --> 01:21:27,768
I was here.

263
01:21:29,232 --> 01:21:30,582
Planting scarecrows.

264
01:21:31,942 --> 01:21:34,492
I thought I saw you running
behind the stable.

265
01:24:29,982 --> 01:24:31,182
Blackie...

266
01:26:44,471 --> 01:26:45,821
Take me out of that house.

267
01:26:47,113 --> 01:26:48,663
I can't live in there anymore.

268
01:26:50,693 --> 01:26:53,265
- What have they done to you, Anna?
- I can't tell you.

269
01:26:54,299 --> 01:26:55,499
I cannot!

270
01:26:58,036 --> 01:26:59,736
Why didn't you tell me about these?

271
01:27:00,555 --> 01:27:03,955
When I told you I saw them at the lake
you took it out on me.

272
01:27:04,489 --> 01:27:06,039
It's your fault. Hoggish idiot!

273
01:27:06,824 --> 01:27:09,324
Why beat me? Because she
makes out with the mechanic?

274
01:27:12,299 --> 01:27:14,399
If I'd told you, you'd have caught them.

275
01:27:15,065 --> 01:27:16,665
Then, she'd tell on us.

276
01:27:19,593 --> 01:27:20,793
She knows all about us.

277
01:27:21,492 --> 01:27:22,826
Although she doesn't say so.

278
01:27:24,218 --> 01:27:27,768
She came fishing for me, the day the
policeman came at home.

279
01:28:08,886 --> 01:28:10,172
What are you up to, father?

280
01:28:12,075 --> 01:28:13,275
Father...

281
01:28:34,463 --> 01:28:35,663
Slut...

282
01:29:21,912 --> 01:29:23,112
Turn in and sleep.

283
01:29:23,261 --> 01:29:24,461
It's 4 o'clock.

284
01:29:37,788 --> 01:29:39,338
Now come inside, it's chilly.

285
01:29:49,450 --> 01:29:50,650
Better accept it.

286
01:29:50,967 --> 01:29:52,617
There's nothing you can do.

287
01:29:54,442 --> 01:29:55,642
Is that so?

288
01:29:55,862 --> 01:29:58,012
Our daughter will be in command
from now on!

289
01:30:03,393 --> 01:30:04,743
Behind a stack of hay.

290
01:30:05,615 --> 01:30:06,815
Like a bitch!

291
01:30:07,440 --> 01:30:08,640
They're in love.

292
01:30:09,883 --> 01:30:11,217
The mechanic will marry her.

293
01:30:12,883 --> 01:30:14,083
My daughter...

294
01:30:15,095 --> 01:30:16,295
Santos' son?

295
01:30:23,934 --> 01:30:25,334
Is that what bothers you?

296
01:30:27,778 --> 01:30:30,826
Can't you think of how disgusted Anna
must be with us?

297
01:30:33,477 --> 01:30:34,763
I'm ashamed to look at her.

298
01:30:36,565 --> 01:30:38,015
Let her marry and go...

299
01:30:39,990 --> 01:30:42,590
So that I won't feel her eyes nailing me.

300
01:30:42,835 --> 01:30:44,035
Stop it now.

301
01:30:49,049 --> 01:30:51,099
I'm praying for my child to go away.

302
01:30:55,716 --> 01:30:57,966
She'll never set her foot
in this house again.

303
01:30:59,575 --> 01:31:00,775
I know it.

304
01:31:02,795 --> 01:31:03,995
I won't see her again.

305
01:31:04,923 --> 01:31:06,323
You wedded them already...

306
01:31:09,321 --> 01:31:12,271
It crosses your mind that I might ever
accept this marriage?

307
01:31:12,926 --> 01:31:15,326
You know only too well, you cannot
do otherwise.

308
01:31:17,873 --> 01:31:19,873
This makes your heart beat, I guess.

309
01:31:20,454 --> 01:31:21,704
You never liked me.

310
01:31:23,335 --> 01:31:26,085
All this time, you've playing a comedy.

311
01:31:31,633 --> 01:31:33,110
You got a chance to paddock me.

312
01:31:34,233 --> 01:31:36,583
Even in bed, I'm sure you're mocking me

313
01:31:36,586 --> 01:31:39,086
for being a fool under your gowns.

314
01:31:40,507 --> 01:31:44,007
You're raging with anger 'cause
you can't walk out on me again.

315
01:31:44,062 --> 01:31:47,212
So that you can gamble and
go around with whores.

316
01:31:49,866 --> 01:31:52,516
You walked out from the first moment
you married me.

317
01:31:53,962 --> 01:31:56,962
Still in my wedding dress
I already was a grass widow.

318
01:32:03,279 --> 01:32:06,679
It took a disaster to remind you
that you had a wife and a home.

319
01:32:06,839 --> 01:32:08,089
You recovered your tone.

320
01:32:08,560 --> 01:32:10,860
Just as you did to your first wife.

321
01:32:13,428 --> 01:32:14,678
But God pays you off.

322
01:32:16,607 --> 01:32:19,188
All these years you never said a word.

323
01:32:19,195 --> 01:32:20,546
So you raged with anger.

324
01:32:24,114 --> 01:32:25,864
Cause I never spoke anything out.

325
01:32:29,666 --> 01:32:30,866
You said it all tonight.

326
01:32:31,853 --> 01:32:35,003
You poisoned my life and now you're
poisoning my child's life too.

327
01:32:36,160 --> 01:32:37,860
You and that wastrel son of yours.

328
01:32:38,652 --> 01:32:41,652
My son's sticking in your throat
cause he's another woman's son.

329
01:32:44,911 --> 01:32:47,626
Heavenly fire will consume you
if you ever say that again.

330
01:32:48,893 --> 01:32:52,043
You know very well I never treated him
any different from Anna.

331
01:33:40,809 --> 01:33:42,009
I'm finished.

332
01:33:44,276 --> 01:33:45,576
My son a murderer.

333
01:33:47,790 --> 01:33:48,990
My daughter...

334
01:33:49,903 --> 01:33:51,353
that I was so proud of...

335
01:33:52,478 --> 01:33:54,078
that I saw to her studies...

336
01:33:55,386 --> 01:33:56,586
she humiliated me.

337
01:34:01,298 --> 01:34:05,098
Tell that son of a bitch to come
and ask for her.

338
01:34:05,963 --> 01:34:07,913
Tell her I'd rather have her marry him

339
01:34:07,971 --> 01:34:10,671
than go around with him and ridicule me.

340
01:34:11,901 --> 01:34:14,101
Act like other people told us.

341
01:34:14,138 --> 01:34:15,996
She's clever and she'll see me through.

342
01:34:16,935 --> 01:34:18,135
Too late anyway.

343
01:34:21,966 --> 01:34:25,347
We'd better send that other one to
Athens so he doesn't chase after her.

344
01:34:26,645 --> 01:34:29,217
He's crazy with fear that
one day she'll give him away.

345
01:36:50,478 --> 01:36:51,978
He's drinking cup after cup.

346
01:36:52,782 --> 01:36:54,068
I'm afraid he'll get drunk.

347
01:36:55,088 --> 01:36:58,288
I went through hell to have him
come to the wedding.

348
01:36:58,703 --> 01:37:00,653
He says he can't meet with people.

349
01:37:04,062 --> 01:37:05,262
<i>Long live the newlyweds!</i>

350
01:37:20,545 --> 01:37:21,745
Anything wrong?

351
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:25,200
You look cheerless.

352
01:37:26,812 --> 01:37:28,462
I got so tired these days.

353
01:38:18,755 --> 01:38:19,955
Hey, Anestis...

354
01:38:20,043 --> 01:38:22,443
Don't sulk, your time will come too.

355
01:38:28,251 --> 01:38:29,451
Tasos!

356
01:38:31,604 --> 01:38:33,704
Play a tune for Anestis to dance!

357
01:38:39,804 --> 01:38:41,004
I don't dance.

358
01:38:41,133 --> 01:38:43,483
You shouldn't say so
at your sister's wedding.

359
01:38:52,569 --> 01:38:53,769
Dance.

360
01:39:08,904 --> 01:39:10,104
Stand up, Anestis!

361
01:39:16,771 --> 01:39:17,971
Stand up, you...

362
01:46:02,066 --> 01:46:03,416
THE END
