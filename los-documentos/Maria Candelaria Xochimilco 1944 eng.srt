00:00:15,215 --> 00:00:16,015
<i>MARIA CANDELARIA

2
00:01:59,864 --> 00:02:03,502
A love tragedy torn from an
indigenous corner of Mexico.

3
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:07,121
Xochimilco, 1909.

4
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,161
Do you see?

5
00:02:45,465 --> 00:02:48,798
Painting a portrait is not as
 difficult as people imagine.

6
00:02:49,102 --> 00:02:52,401
 Master, in what subjects 
do you  find inspiration?

7
00:02:52,972 --> 00:02:54,405
I dont paint subjects.

8
00:02:54,974 --> 00:02:56,276
I paint my life.

9
00:02:56,311 --> 00:02:57,777
And what I see.

10
00:02:57,812 --> 00:02:59,301
Mexico.

11
00:03:03,249 --> 00:03:05,615
I heard somewhere, master,

12
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:09,889
About a picture you
have never wanted to sell.

13
00:03:09,924 --> 00:03:12,050
Could you tell us why?

14
00:03:12,292 --> 00:03:14,988
There are many pictures that
I didn't want to sell.

15
00:03:15,023 --> 00:03:16,957
No, sir.

16
00:03:16,992 --> 00:03:19,256
This one is very special.

17
00:03:19,732 --> 00:03:22,394
It's a nude portrait of a 
very beautiful indian woman.

18
00:03:22,635 --> 00:03:24,830
that you painted years ago.

19
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,907
Excuse me, master.

20
00:03:37,016 --> 00:03:39,041
But I'm writing your biography.

21
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:41,918
I have a fantasy of
writing a great book.

22
00:03:43,089 --> 00:03:44,283
However,

23
00:03:45,091 --> 00:03:46,858
it would be incomplete

24
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:49,327
if you dont reveal the mystery of
this chapter of your life.

25
00:03:55,201 --> 00:03:57,294
Let's talk another day.

26
00:03:57,503 --> 00:03:59,300
Now I need to
be alone.

27
00:04:01,207 --> 00:04:02,074
Excuse me.

28
00:04:02,109 --> 00:04:02,907
Good afternoon.

29
00:04:02,942 --> 00:04:05,211
See you tomorrow, sir.

30
00:04:05,246 --> 00:04:06,644
With your permission.

31
00:04:09,983 --> 00:04:12,315
Good aftenoon, master.

32
00:04:29,836 --> 00:04:31,997
I beg your pardon, master.

33
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:34,001
Are you still here?

34
00:04:34,507 --> 00:04:36,941
I already said I don't have
nothing more to add.

35
00:04:36,976 --> 00:04:38,943
I'm sorry to bother you.

36
00:04:38,978 --> 00:04:42,607
Yes, you bothered me,
and you keep bothering me.

37
00:04:44,817 --> 00:04:46,375
Wait.

38
00:04:48,721 --> 00:04:51,386
I don't know why you
journalists believe, that 

39
00:04:51,421 --> 00:04:54,051
you have the right to meddle
in other people's lives.

40
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:57,718
The world likes to know what
the great men did, master.

41
00:04:58,131 --> 00:04:59,223
Besides that,

42
00:04:59,499 --> 00:05:01,990
everyone knows
that this picture exists.

43
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:06,271
Everyone talks about it,
in Mexico and abroad.

44
00:05:06,539 --> 00:05:08,062
And for my book,

45
00:05:08,097 --> 00:05:11,142
it is essential that
you to talk about it.

46
00:05:13,446 --> 00:05:15,073
Look, miss.

47
00:05:16,249 --> 00:05:19,150
There are things, that you just touch

48
00:05:19,886 --> 00:05:21,148
and they bleed.

49
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:24,923
Do you understand?

50
00:05:26,793 --> 00:05:28,590
This is one of them.

51
00:05:33,533 --> 00:05:36,991
Many years have passed
since I painted this picture.

52
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:41,167
I can think about it,
only with horror.

53
00:05:42,108 --> 00:05:44,599
Because it was the cause
of a tragedy.

54
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:06,123
There are times when life uses us as
instruments of others' misfortune.

55
00:06:08,067 --> 00:06:10,365
You know that us, painters,

56
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:13,204
we always dream of finding

57
00:06:13,239 --> 00:06:17,039
the materialization of what
we carry within us.

58
00:06:17,477 --> 00:06:20,207
Of course, nearly 
nobody finds it.

59
00:06:20,913 --> 00:06:24,280
I had the privilege
of finding it.

60
00:06:24,917 --> 00:06:28,409
And it would have been better
to never have been found.

61
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:32,289
Come here.

62
00:07:20,006 --> 00:07:22,566
What a beautiful woman!

63
00:07:25,411 --> 00:07:26,400
Who is she?

64
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:30,281
An Indian woman of pure, 
mexican race.

65
00:07:32,051 --> 00:07:33,985
As you can see,

66
00:07:34,921 --> 00:07:38,618
this native has the beauty
of the ancient princesses,

67
00:07:38,825 --> 00:07:41,385
that the conquerors
came to oppress.

68
00:07:41,727 --> 00:07:44,161
She was a daughter
of a prostitute,

69
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:46,955
who was murdered
by her own people.

70
00:07:48,334 --> 00:07:52,566
Her life has always been tarnished
because of her mother,

71
00:07:53,105 --> 00:07:55,665
like some kind of a curse.

72
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:59,846
Her people always 
kept her isolated.

73
00:07:59,881 --> 00:08:02,076
Like a wild animal.

74
00:08:05,384 --> 00:08:07,181
There is something in this story

75
00:08:07,954 --> 00:08:11,151
so terrible and sweet
at the same time

76
00:08:12,592 --> 00:08:15,527
that I haven't been yet
able to forget.

77
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:18,687
And it still weighs on me
despite all this time.

78
00:08:21,234 --> 00:08:22,919
She lived nearby.

79
00:08:22,954 --> 00:08:24,569
In Xochimilco.

80
00:08:24,604 --> 00:08:27,402
In a garden surrounded by flowers.

81
00:08:30,376 --> 00:08:32,173
Her name was

82
00:08:32,912 --> 00:08:35,107
Maria Candelária!

83
00:08:40,953 --> 00:08:42,853
Maria Candelária!

84
00:08:48,928 --> 00:08:50,452
Maria Candelária!

85
00:09:05,177 --> 00:09:05,939
What do you want?

86
00:09:07,313 --> 00:09:08,748
Don't thank me
for coming.

87
00:09:08,783 --> 00:09:10,306
My boss sent me.

88
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:11,682
He can't wait any longer.

89
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:13,309
He wants you
pay your debt.

90
00:09:13,753 --> 00:09:16,187
He said that I
could pay with flowers.

91
00:09:16,589 --> 00:09:17,248
He said.

92
00:09:17,283 --> 00:09:19,790
But what Mr. Damian
want is his money.

93
00:09:19,825 --> 00:09:21,189
He's spiteful.

94
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:23,291
You ignored him.

95
00:09:23,529 --> 00:09:24,928
How much do I owe?

96
00:09:25,197 --> 00:09:26,664
Here is the bill.

97
00:09:36,509 --> 00:09:38,577
Butter: 3,20 pesos.

98
00:09:38,612 --> 00:09:40,544
Molasses: 2,18 pesos.

99
00:09:40,579 --> 00:09:42,477
Coffee: 1,20 pesos.

100
00:09:42,682 --> 00:09:44,013
Soap: 6 pesos.

101
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:47,117
Candles: 2,50 pesos. Total.

102
00:09:47,954 --> 00:09:48,749
Total?

103
00:09:48,784 --> 00:09:50,911
Total: 15,08 pesos.

104
00:09:50,946 --> 00:09:52,503
And the boss told me
to tell you that

105
00:09:52,538 --> 00:09:54,025
you have until
tomorrow to pay.

106
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:56,722
And if you don't pay, 
he will take your sow.

107
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:59,696
You dont have 15,08 pesos?

108
00:10:00,967 --> 00:10:04,095
With the flowers you sold,
there should be a lot more.

109
00:10:05,304 --> 00:10:08,831
You know that the people of 
the city don't let me sell them.

110
00:10:09,475 --> 00:10:12,000
That was before.
But I think they have changed.

111
00:10:12,211 --> 00:10:14,543
After what the
priest has been saying.

112
00:10:14,814 --> 00:10:15,507
Damn it.

113
00:10:15,542 --> 00:10:17,615
All of this because 
of your mother.

114
00:10:26,192 --> 00:10:27,784
Well, it's not 
that I believe it,

115
00:10:27,994 --> 00:10:29,086
but that's what they say.

116
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:31,756
It hurts me deeply,
Maria Candelária.

117
00:10:32,031 --> 00:10:33,999
Because I'm a friend
of Lorenzo Rafael.

118
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,428
And I know that he loves you.

119
00:10:35,735 --> 00:10:38,397
You better fight and try
to pay Mr. Damian.

120
00:10:48,781 --> 00:10:49,179
No.

121
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:52,379
No. He will not take 
my little pig.

122
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:55,814
First I'm going to sell flowers.

123
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:57,513
Whatever happens.

124
00:12:15,301 --> 00:12:20,806
<i>I have my flowers
to offer

125
00:12:22,608 --> 00:12:24,337
It's the voice of
Maria Candelária?

126
00:12:25,678 --> 00:12:27,009
It's her.

127
00:12:27,646 --> 00:12:32,015
How dare she come and sell flowers?
We will make it stop.

128
00:12:54,353 --> 00:13:02,643
<i>My flowers that
opened at dawn

129
00:15:07,706 --> 00:15:08,832
Maria Candelária!

130
00:15:12,945 --> 00:15:15,413
Go back to
your floating garden.

131
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:25,451
I told you to go back.

132
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:55,678
Look for whom
you have left me.

133
00:15:56,689 --> 00:15:59,021
Maria Candelária
will bring you bad luck.

134
00:15:59,525 --> 00:16:01,288
You will be very unhappy.

135
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:03,754
Because she is not
a good woman.

136
00:16:04,396 --> 00:16:06,193
Like mother, like daughter.

137
00:16:06,432 --> 00:16:08,957
Just remember who
her mother was.

138
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:20,475
You will pay for it.

139
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:57,144
Why do you go out
and sell flowers?

140
00:16:58,317 --> 00:17:00,251
Mr. Damian wants me to pay him.

141
00:17:00,819 --> 00:17:02,184
Or he will take the sow.

142
00:17:03,222 --> 00:17:05,349
You aren't angry with
me for what happened?

143
00:17:05,824 --> 00:17:07,279
- Are you?
- Not angry.

144
00:17:07,314 --> 00:17:10,053
But I don't want people
to insult you anymore.

145
00:17:10,963 --> 00:17:14,262
You know, Maria Candelária.
It would be better to get out of here.

146
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:18,558
To Santa Anita, Iztacalco
or further on.

147
00:17:18,971 --> 00:17:20,962
Where nobody knows us. 

148
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:22,867
Where we can live in peace.

149
00:17:23,308 --> 00:17:24,775
And what about our gardens?

150
00:17:25,244 --> 00:17:26,575
And our flowers?

151
00:17:27,446 --> 00:17:29,141
We were both born here.

152
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:31,474
And we always lived here.

153
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:49,191
This is our land.

154
00:17:49,935 --> 00:17:51,129
See how dark it is.

155
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:52,962
And how soft it is.

156
00:17:55,174 --> 00:17:56,937
How can we leave?

157
00:18:03,115 --> 00:18:04,639
The townspeople don't want you here.

158
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:06,208
and Mr. Damian doesn't want me.

159
00:18:07,052 --> 00:18:08,679
No, they don't like us.

160
00:18:09,655 --> 00:18:11,384
But out there is worse.

161
00:18:13,358 --> 00:18:15,450
What hurts me most is
that because of me ...

162
00:18:15,485 --> 00:18:18,118
the people of the city
are angry with you, too.

163
00:18:19,298 --> 00:18:21,425
I will never leave you,
Maria Candelária.

164
00:18:24,069 --> 00:18:25,627
How much do you owe to Mr. Damian?

165
00:18:26,905 --> 00:18:29,237
15,08 pesos.

166
00:18:30,175 --> 00:18:33,110
We have to pay it, that
cannot go on like this.

167
00:18:33,345 --> 00:18:35,643
- With the piglet?
- No, not the piglet.

168
00:18:35,981 --> 00:18:37,815
It's all that
we have at the moment.

169
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:39,650
We will get married
thanks to her.

170
00:18:40,185 --> 00:18:41,018
I'm going to see
Mr. Damian and ask

171
00:18:41,053 --> 00:18:43,578
if we can pay with
my vegetables.

172
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:45,154
May God hear you.

173
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:48,058
My vegetables are worth
more than anything we owe him.

174
00:19:11,216 --> 00:19:12,376
My little virgin!

175
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:22,444
What brings you here?

176
00:20:23,422 --> 00:20:26,914
I deserve Rafael Lorenzo
more than you do.

177
00:20:30,162 --> 00:20:33,689
It's not my fault
you are what you are.

178
00:21:06,198 --> 00:21:08,530
Come on, hurry up.

179
00:21:40,832 --> 00:21:41,958
Good morning, Mr. Damian.

180
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,734
Good morning to you, doctor.

181
00:21:43,769 --> 00:21:46,033
Here is the quinine
for the whole week.

182
00:21:46,238 --> 00:21:47,535
Do people
answer you?

183
00:21:47,873 --> 00:21:49,500
Not many.

184
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:52,761
But I already told them to
come and get your quinine,

185
00:21:52,796 --> 00:21:55,647
and I myself will convince them
to take it here.

186
00:21:56,982 --> 00:22:00,383
These damned Indians
are like the devil.

187
00:22:00,418 --> 00:22:04,248
And if I don't do it this way,
they throw the medicine away.

188
00:22:04,283 --> 00:22:05,998
Was there more malaria?

189
00:22:06,033 --> 00:22:07,714
Few cases, doctor.

190
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:10,290
Some kicked the bucket.

191
00:22:10,595 --> 00:22:12,779
It is strange, that it is 
the female mosquito who bites

192
00:22:12,814 --> 00:22:14,963
and makes people sick.

193
00:22:15,467 --> 00:22:16,831
Strange? Why?

194
00:22:16,866 --> 00:22:18,870
Women are the
root of all evil.

195
00:22:18,905 --> 00:22:20,996
Oh, doctor.

196
00:22:21,031 --> 00:22:22,773
Well, see you, Mr. Damian.

197
00:22:22,808 --> 00:22:25,743
Make sure all of these bums
take their quinine.

198
00:22:25,778 --> 00:22:28,211
I will give it to them myself.

199
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:38,119
It's true, women are
the root of all evil.

200
00:22:39,858 --> 00:22:42,088
Go ahead, go ahead.

201
00:22:45,831 --> 00:22:47,526
I'll talk to him,
it may work.

202
00:22:47,561 --> 00:22:49,362
Thank you very much, José Afonso.

203
00:22:54,606 --> 00:22:57,870
Lorenzo Rafael is there,
loaded with vegetables.

204
00:22:57,905 --> 00:23:00,604
 He wants to talk to you,
he has problems.

205
00:23:08,487 --> 00:23:10,580
Have a nice day, Mr. Damian.

206
00:23:16,461 --> 00:23:18,588
Have a nice day, Mr. Damian.

207
00:23:29,941 --> 00:23:30,965
José Afonso.

208
00:23:31,376 --> 00:23:32,866
Bring some water for the Indians.

209
00:23:38,183 --> 00:23:40,048
I wanted to ask you, boss ...

210
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:44,984
Ei.

211
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:47,920
Come and take your quinine.
Line up.

212
00:23:53,698 --> 00:23:55,063
Come on, next.

213
00:24:16,021 --> 00:24:18,581
This starving Indian
has no shame.

214
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:22,787
After robbing me of the woman I liked
the most, he comes to bother me.

215
00:24:23,094 --> 00:24:24,789
 Who does he think he is?

216
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:25,854
Here.

217
00:25:19,651 --> 00:25:21,175
Did you see mr. Damian?

218
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,077
 I'll have to go somewhere else,
far away

219
00:25:23,112 --> 00:25:25,155
to sell my vegetables.

220
00:25:27,926 --> 00:25:31,020
I'll go with you,
I do not want to stay alone.

221
00:25:31,055 --> 00:25:33,097
You are better off alone.

222
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:36,698
You know, people outside 
never had respect for us.

223
00:25:37,168 --> 00:25:39,830
They are abusing you
because you're beautiful.

224
00:25:40,572 --> 00:25:43,632
The problem is that,
only they buy our flowers.

225
00:25:44,943 --> 00:25:46,570
I do not want to be alone.

226
00:25:49,681 --> 00:25:52,047
If you want, I will cover 
my face with mud

227
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:55,884
so that no one looks at me
and we can go together.

228
00:25:59,858 --> 00:26:01,086
Let's go then.

229
00:26:01,893 --> 00:26:04,054
I will get the flowers,
the most beautiful ones.

230
00:26:04,296 --> 00:26:07,265
If God wills,
we'll sell them all.

231
00:27:22,407 --> 00:27:24,409
Flowers of Xochimilco, mister.

232
00:27:24,444 --> 00:27:25,671
How much do you want
for all of them?

233
00:27:27,145 --> 00:27:27,873
All of them?

234
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:29,847
Yes, all of them.

235
00:27:30,682 --> 00:27:31,376
Well...

236
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:33,613
Three reals, sir.

237
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:40,317
Listen.

238
00:27:40,725 --> 00:27:42,056
Do you want some pesos?

239
00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:44,318
I'm a painter and I want
paint your wife.

240
00:28:06,017 --> 00:28:08,781
José Maria, follow these two
and see where they live.

241
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,714
Hurry, they are leaving.
Leave it here, I'll take care of it.

242
00:28:11,749 --> 00:28:13,620
I can't leave
my pots here.

243
00:28:13,655 --> 00:28:15,392
You are so suspicious.

244
00:28:15,427 --> 00:28:18,590
Here. Follow them, go ahead.
Quickly.

245
00:28:22,801 --> 00:28:25,429
This is the model
that I was looking for.

246
00:29:32,804 --> 00:29:34,999
The Virgin will not allow them
to take you away from us.

247
00:29:37,876 --> 00:29:39,571
I will make tortillas.

248
00:29:40,145 --> 00:29:41,077
I'm not hungry.

249
00:29:42,013 --> 00:29:43,412
See you tomorrow.

250
00:29:45,183 --> 00:29:45,774
It's all right.

251
00:30:19,117 --> 00:30:22,609
- Good afternoon, Father.
- Good afternoon, Lorenzo Rafael.

252
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:24,755
What a miracle that
you came here.

253
00:30:25,223 --> 00:30:26,918
How is
Maria Candelária?

254
00:30:27,625 --> 00:30:28,785
Good, father.

255
00:30:29,894 --> 00:30:32,089
I came to pray to the Virgin
to help us, 

256
00:30:32,397 --> 00:30:33,830
so we dont lose the sow.

257
00:30:34,232 --> 00:30:35,426
And so we can get married.

258
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:38,430
She will help you, Lorenzo
Rafael, she will help you.

259
00:30:38,636 --> 00:30:40,501
 But, why would you
 lose the pig?

260
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:41,862
Because...

261
00:30:44,309 --> 00:30:46,140
...we owe
to mr. Damian.

262
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:48,676
He doesn't want vegetables,
nor flowers.

263
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:50,247
He wants money.

264
00:30:51,316 --> 00:30:52,681
Well, well.

265
00:30:53,451 --> 00:30:55,316
So, when
will I marry you?

266
00:30:56,087 --> 00:30:58,885
Well, the sow is still young.

267
00:30:59,157 --> 00:31:02,149
We are hoping that she
grows up and has her piglets.

268
00:31:02,184 --> 00:31:03,091
So that we can sell them.

269
00:31:03,628 --> 00:31:05,220
This is a long way off.

270
00:31:06,297 --> 00:31:07,389
Yes, father.

271
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:11,331
But only then can I buy
a new dress for Maria Candelária,

272
00:31:11,366 --> 00:31:12,369
and have her hand.

273
00:31:13,204 --> 00:31:14,899
Well, say a rosary.

274
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:18,373
And don't forget tomorrow is a day
of the blessing for the animals.

275
00:31:18,576 --> 00:31:21,568
Tell Maria Candelária
to come to the church with you

276
00:31:21,813 --> 00:31:25,499
and bring the pig so that
she has a big litter,

277
00:31:25,534 --> 00:31:29,185
so you can buy the new dress
for the day I marry you.

278
00:34:21,325 --> 00:34:22,849
The moon is beautiful.

279
00:34:24,562 --> 00:34:25,927
And so big.

280
00:34:28,599 --> 00:34:31,830
It looks like a white poppy.

281
00:34:37,942 --> 00:34:39,239
Where did you go?

282
00:34:42,046 --> 00:34:42,808
To the church.

283
00:34:44,315 --> 00:34:45,680
I was very sad.

284
00:34:47,418 --> 00:34:48,316
You are not anymore?

285
00:34:48,853 --> 00:34:49,649
No.

286
00:34:50,421 --> 00:34:52,286
Father told me
some good things .

287
00:34:53,291 --> 00:34:54,656
He asked me about you.

288
00:34:55,626 --> 00:34:57,753
He wants you to take the sow

289
00:34:58,062 --> 00:35:00,189
tomorrow for the blessing of animals.

290
00:35:02,533 --> 00:35:05,636
He said I could
go with everyone?

291
00:35:05,671 --> 00:35:07,035
Yes, Maria Candelária.

292
00:35:08,172 --> 00:35:09,264
And if he said that,

293
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:11,571
he must have his reasons.

294
00:35:13,811 --> 00:35:14,641
I think so.

295
00:35:19,034 --> 00:35:23,617
I wanted the priest
to get it out of their heads.

296
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:30,189
It would be nice to live at peace
with the inhabitants of the city.

297
00:35:31,529 --> 00:35:33,190
To treat them like brothers,

298
00:35:34,999 --> 00:35:37,126
and not like wild animals.

299
00:35:44,542 --> 00:35:46,009
It must be beautiful

300
00:35:47,178 --> 00:35:48,770
to be greeted on the street

301
00:35:49,914 --> 00:35:52,007
and to have friends to talk to.

302
00:35:54,051 --> 00:35:55,313
And they smile at you,

303
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:58,245
when they see you pass.

304
00:36:03,361 --> 00:36:06,922
You don't want to go for a walk,
like every full moon?

305
00:36:09,467 --> 00:36:10,126
It's all right.

306
00:37:47,164 --> 00:37:51,464
How good there exist full-moon
nights, so we can traverse them.

307
00:38:15,059 --> 00:38:17,323
What would I do without
Lorenzo Rafael?

308
00:38:42,186 --> 00:38:44,586
Do you love me so much,
Lorenzo Rafael?

309
00:38:51,228 --> 00:38:54,129
Yes, you love me very much.

310
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:27,190
- José Afonso.
- Yes, boss?

311
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:32,603
- Maria Candelária already paid you?
- Not yet, boss.

312
00:39:32,638 --> 00:39:35,265
With what? If the poor thing
is broke.

313
00:39:35,873 --> 00:39:38,535
She has to pay me,
even if it's with the pig.

314
00:39:38,909 --> 00:39:40,467
Let's go get it

315
00:39:45,082 --> 00:39:47,116
Let us go to bless her
with the father

316
00:39:47,151 --> 00:39:49,779
So that it grows fast and
has many piglets. 

317
00:39:51,455 --> 00:39:52,683
and we can get married.

318
00:40:24,288 --> 00:40:26,620
BLESSING OF ANIMALS

319
00:41:16,106 --> 00:41:18,472
Maria Candelária came to
bring us bad luck.

320
00:41:18,809 --> 00:41:20,538
What do you do here? At church.

321
00:41:23,447 --> 00:41:25,506
She came to curse
our animals.

322
00:41:25,749 --> 00:41:27,979
If she comes, the blessing
won't do any good.

323
00:41:28,014 --> 00:41:30,244
- Our animals will die.
- Yes.

324
00:41:30,279 --> 00:41:33,582
Now that the priest is not
here, let's throw her out

325
00:41:48,672 --> 00:41:49,639
What is happening?

326
00:41:58,182 --> 00:41:59,649
And you, get down here.

327
00:42:00,551 --> 00:42:02,212
I'm coming down, father

328
00:42:03,187 --> 00:42:05,239
but her mother was a bad woman.

329
00:42:05,274 --> 00:42:07,164
So she is also stained.

330
00:42:07,199 --> 00:42:09,054
I order you to come down.

331
00:42:10,528 --> 00:42:12,689
Maria Candelária, come here.

332
00:42:20,704 --> 00:42:23,229
I see that my
words are useless.

333
00:42:23,507 --> 00:42:27,102
This is the House of God.
Insulting someone here,

334
00:42:27,137 --> 00:42:29,272
is like spitting into
the holy water,

335
00:42:29,307 --> 00:42:31,407
or stepping on the wings of angels.

336
00:42:32,116 --> 00:42:35,847
You accuse this woman,
but who accuses you?

337
00:42:35,882 --> 00:42:38,283
Because you, all of you, 

338
00:42:38,318 --> 00:42:40,356
murdered the mother of
Maria Candelária

339
00:42:40,391 --> 00:42:42,760
accusing her of bringing
shame on this city

340
00:42:42,795 --> 00:42:44,022
with her bad behaviour.

341
00:42:44,228 --> 00:42:46,628
That poor woman did sin.

342
00:42:46,964 --> 00:42:49,833
But remember that
our Lord punishes

343
00:42:49,868 --> 00:42:51,801
and you all have children.

344
00:42:52,603 --> 00:42:55,059
We all knew
this woman's mother.

345
00:42:55,094 --> 00:42:56,674
And her story should
hurt us deeply,

346
00:42:56,709 --> 00:42:59,403
because, despite her faults,

347
00:42:59,438 --> 00:43:03,536
sinner and all, she has already
been judged by God.

348
00:43:03,571 --> 00:43:07,095
Nobody has the right
to offend her daughter,

349
00:43:07,130 --> 00:43:10,620
who has been for years
accepting humiliation in silence.

350
00:43:10,854 --> 00:43:13,254
A mother is a mother.

351
00:43:13,457 --> 00:43:15,859
And I want you all
to respect 

352
00:43:15,894 --> 00:43:17,554
Maria Candelária.

353
00:43:20,030 --> 00:43:22,294
Thank you very much, father.

354
00:43:28,172 --> 00:43:30,572
I did not accuse her, sir.

355
00:43:31,475 --> 00:43:33,067
I did not accuse her.

356
00:43:33,777 --> 00:43:35,176
One should never accuse anyone.

357
00:43:37,081 --> 00:43:39,914
Now, let's bless the animals.

358
00:43:42,252 --> 00:43:43,583
Is this the pig?

359
00:43:44,455 --> 00:43:48,016
- Yes, father.
- How cute is this little animal!

360
00:44:29,166 --> 00:44:33,694
Forgive her, Father. It is
scared among so many people.

361
00:44:38,208 --> 00:44:40,472
So, you couldn't pay me.

362
00:44:40,944 --> 00:44:42,843
I am collecting now.

363
00:44:42,878 --> 00:44:44,971
José Afonso, take the sow.

364
00:44:53,657 --> 00:44:55,190
Mr. Damian is a heretic.

365
00:44:55,225 --> 00:44:58,991
He wants to take the sow
after she was blessed.

366
00:44:59,196 --> 00:45:02,324
That woman owes me money,
I came to collect.

367
00:45:02,359 --> 00:45:04,735
We can only pay with
flowers and vegetables,

368
00:45:04,770 --> 00:45:06,726
but he doesn't want to
accept them, father.

369
00:45:07,538 --> 00:45:08,630
How much do they owe?

370
00:45:08,665 --> 00:45:10,831
15,08 pesos.

371
00:45:11,075 --> 00:45:13,509
It should be more for the delay.

372
00:45:13,711 --> 00:45:14,871
But I will leave it at that.

373
00:45:15,112 --> 00:45:17,379
Don't set your foot
here again

374
00:45:17,414 --> 00:45:18,949
when you're
collecting money.

375
00:45:18,984 --> 00:45:20,974
Understood?
Go away.

376
00:45:21,185 --> 00:45:22,918
God willing, as soon as I can, 

377
00:45:22,953 --> 00:45:25,319
I'll pay you your money.
So you can sleep in peace.

378
00:45:25,354 --> 00:45:27,189
Don't pay, father.

379
00:45:27,224 --> 00:45:31,126
Cast her out like Jesus
did with street vendors.

380
00:45:31,562 --> 00:45:33,655
You must sew your mouth.

381
00:45:34,264 --> 00:45:35,464
And you children

382
00:45:35,499 --> 00:45:38,059
take the sow and
may God be with you.

383
00:45:40,104 --> 00:45:41,366
Thank you, Father.

384
00:45:47,377 --> 00:45:50,312
This shameless Indian
will pay for it.

385
00:45:55,619 --> 00:45:57,319
What a luck.

386
00:45:57,354 --> 00:46:01,120
You have neither the girl 
 or the pig, sir.

387
00:46:01,325 --> 00:46:03,885
Just like that man who
wanted an Indian girl. 

388
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:07,122
That in despair
 sent her to the devil:

389
00:46:07,157 --> 00:46:10,064
"You talk a lot
but never do anything ".

390
00:46:10,501 --> 00:46:12,366
That's it.

391
00:46:18,809 --> 00:46:22,232
Oh, sir Damian.
That's the secret.

392
00:46:22,267 --> 00:46:24,937
You said you were so powerful,
and what happened?

393
00:46:24,972 --> 00:46:28,007
When would I ever let
a dirty Indian to insult me?

394
00:46:28,042 --> 00:46:31,043
To top it up, she is the
daughter of one... you know.

395
00:46:35,392 --> 00:46:36,256
Let's go.

396
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:37,825
You are cursed, sir. Damian.

397
00:46:43,901 --> 00:46:44,833
Everybody out!

398
00:46:46,403 --> 00:46:48,871
They say that
the truth is bitter.

399
00:46:49,173 --> 00:46:51,141
But let us not play the fools.

400
00:46:51,441 --> 00:46:54,069
You and I are outraged.

401
00:46:54,444 --> 00:46:55,570
Or not?

402
00:46:56,079 --> 00:46:58,775
I'm a woman,
I will do it my way,

403
00:46:58,810 --> 00:47:00,780
even if it means
killing someone.

404
00:47:01,351 --> 00:47:03,147
Starting with the pig.

405
00:47:03,182 --> 00:47:05,311
So they don't get married.

406
00:47:24,007 --> 00:47:26,373
- What are you looking at, primitive?
- Nothing, boss.

407
00:47:26,408 --> 00:47:28,377
- Give me a rifle.
- Yes, boss.

408
00:47:31,248 --> 00:47:31,976
Follow me.

409
00:47:42,693 --> 00:47:43,591
What's wrong with you?

410
00:47:45,462 --> 00:47:46,156
Nothing.

411
00:47:46,663 --> 00:47:48,062
My whole body hurts, as if 

412
00:47:48,332 --> 00:47:49,594
someone had beaten me up.

413
00:47:50,334 --> 00:47:53,132
- It's nothing, let's go.
- No.

414
00:47:53,804 --> 00:47:54,532
Not you.

415
00:47:56,106 --> 00:47:57,368
You are not well.

416
00:47:58,342 --> 00:47:59,536
I can see it in your eyes.

417
00:48:01,078 --> 00:48:03,569
Get some medicine,
rub on the body.

418
00:48:03,604 --> 00:48:05,691
If you are not
well until tomorrow,

419
00:48:05,726 --> 00:48:07,778
I will bring a shaman
to heal you.

420
00:48:08,018 --> 00:48:08,677
It is OK.

421
00:48:09,686 --> 00:48:11,210
Do not worry about me.

422
00:48:12,177 --> 00:48:14,094
And take care of yourself,
Lorenzo Rafael.

423
00:49:47,250 --> 00:49:48,717
Jesus, Maria, José.

424
00:50:01,765 --> 00:50:02,993
My piggy.

425
00:50:24,354 --> 00:50:25,446
They killed her.

426
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:31,000
Now we can never get married.

427
00:50:53,116 --> 00:50:55,141
It was Mr. Damian, no one but him.

428
00:50:56,920 --> 00:50:58,444
But since he is the boss,

429
00:50:58,789 --> 00:50:59,653
they can do it.

430
00:51:14,104 --> 00:51:15,071
What happened?

431
00:52:05,388 --> 00:52:06,650
It must be the fever.

432
00:52:08,391 --> 00:52:09,483
I will bring the shaman.

433
00:52:13,263 --> 00:52:15,959
I'm sure it's the fever.

434
00:52:16,199 --> 00:52:18,155
But you know that
I can not go.

435
00:52:18,190 --> 00:52:21,396
If people see me in the city
they will attack me.

436
00:52:21,972 --> 00:52:24,839
Wait until nightfall,
then I will find a way.

437
00:52:25,375 --> 00:52:26,273
She is very sick.

438
00:52:26,877 --> 00:52:28,658
Only you can cure it.

439
00:52:28,693 --> 00:52:30,405
Are you giving her quinine?

440
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:32,249
No, sir Damian
doesn't want to give us any.

441
00:52:32,284 --> 00:52:33,773
But it is not his.

442
00:52:34,050 --> 00:52:35,183
The government provides it

443
00:52:35,218 --> 00:52:37,379
to be administered to everyone.

444
00:52:37,754 --> 00:52:39,152
Go and ask him

445
00:52:39,187 --> 00:52:42,156
if you don't want Maria Candelária
to die. Go ahead.

446
00:52:42,392 --> 00:52:45,589
Let me see if anyone
saw you come here.

447
00:52:49,599 --> 00:52:51,657
Nobody, thank God.

448
00:52:51,692 --> 00:52:54,599
Go ahead, hurry up.
Bring the quinine.

449
00:53:07,617 --> 00:53:09,380
One more step and
I will kill you.

450
00:53:10,220 --> 00:53:12,518
I'm not here
to argue, sir.

451
00:53:13,223 --> 00:53:14,918
Maria Candelária
is very sick.

452
00:53:15,125 --> 00:53:15,989
This is not true.

453
00:53:16,793 --> 00:53:17,918
Get out of here.

454
00:53:17,953 --> 00:53:21,224
I swear by the Virgin that
I'm not lying, Mr. Damian.

455
00:53:22,933 --> 00:53:25,663
The shaman said that only
quinine can save her.

456
00:53:27,904 --> 00:53:30,134
Here is the pig
to pay you.

457
00:53:32,242 --> 00:53:35,177
Please give me our
part of the quinine.

458
00:53:35,745 --> 00:53:37,576
There's nothing here for you.

459
00:53:38,048 --> 00:53:40,506
José Afonso!

460
00:53:42,152 --> 00:53:43,551
Yes, boss.

461
00:53:43,954 --> 00:53:46,320
Take that bastard out
of here or I'll kill him.

462
00:53:46,623 --> 00:53:47,521
Take him.

463
00:53:56,333 --> 00:53:58,824
Go away, Lorenzo Rafael,
he will kill you.

464
00:54:01,137 --> 00:54:01,899
All right.

465
00:54:02,772 --> 00:54:06,071
Take it, and tell mr. Damian that
Maria Candelária owes him nothing.

466
00:54:28,765 --> 00:54:31,598
- Who is it?
- It me, José Afonso.

467
00:54:38,875 --> 00:54:40,570
Why did you accept the pig?

468
00:54:40,977 --> 00:54:43,946
She must be poisoned,
it did not come with good intentions.

469
00:54:43,981 --> 00:54:46,515
- What should I do with it?
- Bury it.

470
00:54:47,150 --> 00:54:49,118
Dogs can get sick.

471
00:54:49,519 --> 00:54:50,508
Wait.

472
00:54:52,255 --> 00:54:54,223
I will close the store
for a few days.

473
00:54:55,058 --> 00:54:56,787
I'm going to Xochimilco.

474
00:54:57,360 --> 00:54:59,574
Why this shameless Indian
 will come back

475
00:54:59,609 --> 00:55:01,788
and take me
by surprise.

476
00:55:02,198 --> 00:55:04,734
All Indians are treacherous.

477
00:55:04,769 --> 00:55:05,826
Yes, boss.

478
00:55:09,539 --> 00:55:10,672
This is her hut.

479
00:55:10,707 --> 00:55:13,437
I told you that Maria Candelária
does not speak to anyone.

480
00:55:13,472 --> 00:55:15,408
Nobody talks to her,

481
00:55:15,443 --> 00:55:17,344
you already know why.

482
00:55:19,616 --> 00:55:20,844
Maria Candelária!

483
00:55:28,391 --> 00:55:29,415
Maria Candelária!

484
00:55:33,396 --> 00:55:35,864
- What happened? Are you sick?
- What do you want?

485
00:55:37,667 --> 00:55:38,497
Go away.

486
00:55:39,235 --> 00:55:40,793
I did not know that
you were sick.

487
00:55:41,504 --> 00:55:43,335
I came because
I want to paint you.

488
00:55:43,940 --> 00:55:45,669
But let's leave that
for another time.

489
00:55:47,377 --> 00:55:48,810
What do you need?

490
00:55:55,885 --> 00:55:57,113
Maria Candelária!

491
00:55:59,289 --> 00:56:00,119
Where are you going?

492
00:56:03,059 --> 00:56:05,220
Maria Candelária, do not run.

493
00:56:06,262 --> 00:56:08,958
Do not run. I did not come
to do you harm.

494
00:56:09,366 --> 00:56:11,163
I just want to talk.

495
00:56:11,868 --> 00:56:13,460
I won't hurt you, creature.

496
00:56:14,070 --> 00:56:15,037
Don't get wet.

497
00:56:15,438 --> 00:56:16,871
You can stay, I'm leaving.

498
00:58:08,117 --> 00:58:09,607
Lorenzo Rafael.

499
00:58:12,755 --> 00:58:15,815
Look how beautiful are
the poppies from my garden.

500
00:58:17,126 --> 00:58:18,889
They look like
 small moons.

501
00:58:22,365 --> 00:58:24,299
See how they descend from the sky.

502
00:58:29,939 --> 00:58:32,066
Why are we so poor?

503
00:58:35,879 --> 00:58:37,039
The pig.

504
00:58:37,714 --> 00:58:38,874
The pig.

505
00:58:39,415 --> 00:58:44,676
No, don't let him take her.

506
00:58:43,079 --> 00:58:44,676
No, don't let him take her.

507
00:58:45,488 --> 00:58:47,718
Ela é como se fosse

508
00:58:48,391 --> 00:58:49,824
She's like our family.

509
00:58:54,797 --> 00:58:56,025
Dear God.

510
00:58:56,799 --> 00:58:58,232
Dear God, why?

511
00:59:00,937 --> 00:59:02,336
Why there is no water?

512
00:59:03,406 --> 00:59:05,237
The channels have dried up.

513
00:59:05,808 --> 00:59:09,608
All animals
in the city are dying.

514
00:59:10,547 --> 00:59:12,538
Just like the pig.

515
00:59:16,853 --> 00:59:18,286
Lorenzo Rafael.

516
00:59:19,956 --> 00:59:22,389
The gardens are burning,

517
00:59:22,424 --> 00:59:25,688
and the flames are coming
here. Let's go.

518
00:59:26,396 --> 00:59:27,328
Let's go.

519
00:59:34,804 --> 00:59:36,431
Lorenzo Rafael.

520
00:59:37,707 --> 00:59:39,971
You are everything
I have in the world.

521
00:59:41,277 --> 00:59:44,769
Don't go without me,
Do not leave me alone.

522
00:59:45,381 --> 00:59:47,440
Do not leave me alone.

523
00:59:49,218 --> 00:59:53,416
Mother, dear mother.

524
00:59:55,592 --> 01:00:00,222
The pig that Lorenzo Rafael
gave to me on my birthday ...

525
01:00:01,497 --> 01:00:02,862
She was so...

526
01:00:04,233 --> 01:00:05,427
small.

527
01:00:06,703 --> 01:00:08,796
It fit in the palm of the hand.

528
01:04:15,218 --> 01:04:18,449
Look what I brought you,
Maria Candelária.

529
01:04:20,089 --> 01:04:24,753
A dress so I can ask for your hand.
Now you have to be well.

530
01:04:55,491 --> 01:04:57,789
Holy Virgin of Guadalupe.

531
01:05:00,396 --> 01:05:01,863
I offer you my life

532
01:05:02,365 --> 01:05:03,730
in exchange for hers.

533
01:05:06,369 --> 01:05:07,961
It's all I have.

534
01:05:11,073 --> 01:05:11,835
Heal her.

535
01:05:12,675 --> 01:05:14,939
And let my will be yours

536
01:05:17,947 --> 01:05:20,142
I'm the doctor who came to
take care of the patient.

537
01:05:21,050 --> 01:05:23,018
But we cannot afford it.

538
01:05:23,352 --> 01:05:24,376
No problem.

539
01:05:24,887 --> 01:05:26,081
The painter sent me.

540
01:05:38,534 --> 01:05:40,001
When did the fever start?

541
01:05:40,569 --> 01:05:42,867
The chills started
yesterday, doctor.

542
01:05:44,740 --> 01:05:46,469
Are you giving her the quinine?

543
01:05:46,909 --> 01:05:47,967
I just brought it.

544
01:05:48,511 --> 01:05:50,342
She just took a pill.

545
01:06:04,994 --> 01:06:06,985
I am running risking to be seen

546
01:06:07,263 --> 01:06:08,831
and they already brought
another one.

547
01:06:08,866 --> 01:06:11,857
Listen to me, Lorenzo Rafael.

548
01:06:12,201 --> 01:06:17,006
If this man is a medical doctor
and touches Maria Candelária,

549
01:06:17,041 --> 01:06:19,742
I will not be responsible
for her salvation,

550
01:06:19,777 --> 01:06:22,210
and the Virgin will punish you.

551
01:06:23,746 --> 01:06:25,373
Are you a doctor?

552
01:06:26,048 --> 01:06:28,346
Don't insult me.
I am a healer.

553
01:06:28,381 --> 01:06:30,885
With the grace of God I healed

554
01:06:30,920 --> 01:06:32,911
all the sick people in the city.

555
01:06:34,023 --> 01:06:35,650
Oh, yes.

556
01:06:36,726 --> 01:06:38,125
An osteopath.

557
01:06:38,594 --> 01:06:40,083
Do not call me that.

558
01:06:40,118 --> 01:06:42,093
I said that I am a healer.

559
01:06:44,900 --> 01:06:47,820
I warned. If this charlatan here

560
01:06:47,855 --> 01:06:50,705
touches Maria Candelária,

561
01:06:50,740 --> 01:06:53,231
I won't be responsible
if she dies.

562
01:06:55,711 --> 01:06:58,077
Do not go. I beg you, don't go.

563
01:07:01,350 --> 01:07:02,950
Look, miss healer 

564
01:07:02,985 --> 01:07:04,515
Let's do something.

565
01:07:04,550 --> 01:07:08,054
This creature is very sick,
let's heal her together.

566
01:07:08,089 --> 01:07:10,342
Allow me to
give her an injection,

567
01:07:10,377 --> 01:07:12,595
and then I leave her
in your hands.

568
01:07:12,630 --> 01:07:13,925
No way.

569
01:07:13,960 --> 01:07:15,963
First I will
break your bones.

570
01:07:15,998 --> 01:07:19,431
So you think I'm a mule.
With all these things that you brought.

571
01:07:19,466 --> 01:07:22,864
When a mule doesn't move,
there are no spurs that will move it.

572
01:07:23,511 --> 01:07:24,176
How long will it take?

573
01:07:24,211 --> 01:07:24,921
A little.

574
01:07:25,206 --> 01:07:27,808
Please hurry up, madam.

575
01:07:27,843 --> 01:07:29,376
Wait outside.

576
01:07:29,411 --> 01:07:30,910
But why, miss healer?

577
01:07:31,247 --> 01:07:34,774
What why? Don't you know
 that I have to rub her whole body?

578
01:07:34,809 --> 01:07:36,851
Get out quick.

579
01:07:36,886 --> 01:07:39,480
because I don't have time
to heat the ointment.

580
01:07:40,990 --> 01:07:42,389
All right, all right.

581
01:07:42,725 --> 01:07:44,249
Let's go outside.

582
01:07:59,575 --> 01:08:00,872
Maria Candelária was healed.

583
01:08:02,011 --> 01:08:04,377
He went to ask for her hand,
as they said.

584
01:08:05,848 --> 01:08:09,249
Maria Candelária was
happy with her new dress.

585
01:08:13,789 --> 01:08:15,381
Take him. He's the thief.

586
01:08:16,826 --> 01:08:18,020
Just a minute.

587
01:08:18,561 --> 01:08:20,654
Once again desecrating the
house of the Lord.

588
01:08:20,963 --> 01:08:21,759
What is wrong?

589
01:08:22,098 --> 01:08:24,298
Today when I returned to the village,

590
01:08:24,333 --> 01:08:26,699
I found out that this Indian
broke into my store.

591
01:08:27,103 --> 01:08:28,169
This time, he will go

592
01:08:28,204 --> 01:08:30,172
to jail like
a bandit should.

593
01:08:30,439 --> 01:08:33,101
Is not true,
it is not true, Father.

594
01:08:33,509 --> 01:08:36,444
Lorenzo Rafael is not
capable of robbing anyone.

595
01:08:36,879 --> 01:08:39,006
You know him, Father.

596
01:08:39,281 --> 01:08:42,614
Oh no? And that dress
that you are wearing? 

597
01:08:55,331 --> 01:08:56,263
The dress. 

598
01:08:57,600 --> 01:09:00,330
It's your dress to get married.

599
01:09:00,569 --> 01:09:01,797
And the medicines?

600
01:09:02,204 --> 01:09:03,171
And the money?

601
01:09:03,539 --> 01:09:05,029
Not money, father.

602
01:09:06,041 --> 01:09:07,133
I took the medicine

603
01:09:07,409 --> 01:09:09,877
for Maria Candelária
who was sick.

604
01:09:11,013 --> 01:09:14,312
For the love of God, Don Damian,
don't take him away.

605
01:09:16,852 --> 01:09:18,581
Help us, Father.

606
01:09:19,188 --> 01:09:22,316
I will return the dress
and the medicine he stole.

607
01:09:22,351 --> 01:09:24,050
But don't let them take him.

608
01:09:25,027 --> 01:09:27,086
What are you waiting for?
Move!

609
01:09:27,530 --> 01:09:30,294
Lorenzo Rafael,
Lorenzo Rafael, no!

610
01:09:35,538 --> 01:09:36,596
Father!

611
01:09:39,308 --> 01:09:40,866
Please take care of her.

612
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:20,405
Cry, put it out.

613
01:10:20,440 --> 01:10:23,109
We should not keep despair inside.

614
01:10:23,144 --> 01:10:25,914
I can't bear my cross
anymore, father 

615
01:10:28,257 --> 01:10:29,849
I feel like screaming,

616
01:10:30,392 --> 01:10:32,860
scream until my throat is dry,

617
01:10:33,229 --> 01:10:35,356
or God, our Lord hears me.

618
01:10:51,213 --> 01:10:51,975
And you?

619
01:10:52,548 --> 01:10:53,981
Why can't you hear me?

620
01:10:55,351 --> 01:10:58,343
What did we do to be
punished like two criminals?

621
01:10:59,121 --> 01:11:01,681
We loved each other,
we were poor?

622
01:11:02,458 --> 01:11:04,824
You never look at us.

623
01:11:05,728 --> 01:11:07,559
To everyone else, however,

624
01:11:07,594 --> 01:11:08,459
you listen,

625
01:11:08,494 --> 01:11:11,498
and help them and extend
your hands to support them.

626
01:11:12,534 --> 01:11:16,265
With us, you are tough,
you are bad.

627
01:11:16,905 --> 01:11:17,963
Maria Candelária!

628
01:11:18,674 --> 01:11:20,266
Don't talk to the
Virgin like that.

629
01:11:20,509 --> 01:11:22,909
You are stabbing
her heart again.

630
01:11:29,752 --> 01:11:32,380
Look, see how her
 eyes are crying.

631
01:11:41,163 --> 01:11:41,822
No.

632
01:11:43,132 --> 01:11:43,860
No.

633
01:11:44,566 --> 01:11:46,966
I do not want to
hurt the Virgin.

634
01:11:48,037 --> 01:11:50,870
It was despair, father.

635
01:11:52,541 --> 01:11:54,338
It was despair.

636
01:12:07,189 --> 01:12:10,352
Forgive me,
Blessed Mother of Jesus.

637
01:12:11,393 --> 01:12:13,725
I know that you
are very busy.

638
01:12:14,863 --> 01:12:17,889
There are so many of us who 
ask you things all the time.

639
01:12:19,101 --> 01:12:20,568
I am so small.

640
01:12:21,136 --> 01:12:22,967
I'm so behind everyone else,

641
01:12:24,340 --> 01:12:26,399
that probably
it's not my turn yet,

642
01:12:26,909 --> 01:12:27,671
to be heard.

643
01:12:33,015 --> 01:12:34,107
Tell her to

644
01:12:34,516 --> 01:12:36,882
forgive me
for everything I said.

645
01:12:37,786 --> 01:12:39,447
I didn't mean to offend her.

646
01:12:40,889 --> 01:12:44,052
How could I want to
offend her, Father?

647
01:12:44,793 --> 01:12:46,761
Quando eu era pequena

648
01:12:47,629 --> 01:12:51,190
my mother taught me how to
see the light in things.

649
01:12:53,702 --> 01:12:54,964
Tell her

650
01:12:55,671 --> 01:12:57,605
that I will not
complain again.

651
01:12:58,574 --> 01:13:00,041
And to do with us

652
01:13:02,077 --> 01:13:03,908
what she wants.

653
01:13:06,548 --> 01:13:08,015
Lorenzo Rafael.

654
01:13:09,785 --> 01:13:10,615
And you?

655
01:13:11,120 --> 01:13:12,018
Yes, sir.

656
01:13:13,322 --> 01:13:14,687
I'll give you ...

657
01:13:15,891 --> 01:13:17,153
one year in prison.

658
01:13:17,526 --> 01:13:19,585
I didn't steal
a penny, sir.

659
01:13:20,662 --> 01:13:22,027
Only the medicine

660
01:13:23,699 --> 01:13:24,631
and the dress.

661
01:13:25,534 --> 01:13:26,023
For...

662
01:13:27,736 --> 01:13:29,135
For Maria Candelária.

663
01:13:30,172 --> 01:13:32,333
And the money that
 I had in the drawer?

664
01:13:32,368 --> 01:13:34,238
Shameless Indian.

665
01:13:34,643 --> 01:13:35,837
One year in prison.

666
01:13:37,179 --> 01:13:38,009
Arrest him.

667
01:13:49,758 --> 01:13:51,555
Another one.

668
01:13:53,362 --> 01:13:54,693
Bathe him.

669
01:13:55,264 --> 01:13:56,458
Stay quiet.

670
01:14:00,169 --> 01:14:02,660
- He looks like a thief.
- Shut up.

671
01:14:03,939 --> 01:14:05,304
This is not Xochimilco.

672
01:14:05,974 --> 01:14:07,908
Hey, a cigarette.

673
01:14:45,614 --> 01:14:47,479
Let me see him, sir.

674
01:14:47,883 --> 01:14:49,475
I can't

675
01:14:50,786 --> 01:14:53,311
I brought the dress
and the medicine.

676
01:14:53,856 --> 01:14:55,323
so you can let him go.

677
01:14:56,758 --> 01:14:57,655
He was tried.

678
01:14:57,690 --> 01:14:59,691
The crime must be punished.

679
01:15:00,062 --> 01:15:03,122
Get your things, go.
It can get worse.

680
01:15:04,066 --> 01:15:05,431
My God,
what should I do?

681
01:15:06,301 --> 01:15:07,733
Do you want an advice?

682
01:15:07,768 --> 01:15:09,771
You better
find a lawyer.

683
01:15:09,806 --> 01:15:11,738
One of those who talk a lot.

684
01:15:11,773 --> 01:15:14,173
Or speak to Mr Damian
to drop the charges.

685
01:15:16,044 --> 01:15:18,137
No. Not him.

686
01:15:18,347 --> 01:15:20,415
Come on, I said that
you can't see him.

687
01:15:20,450 --> 01:15:21,278
Let's go.

688
01:15:21,313 --> 01:15:23,314
For the thousandth time,
stop pestering.

689
01:15:23,349 --> 01:15:24,942
Let's eat in peace.

690
01:15:25,254 --> 01:15:27,301
You too, what
are you waiting for?

691
01:15:27,336 --> 01:15:29,349
Don't waste you time with women.

692
01:15:30,259 --> 01:15:31,419
No, man.

693
01:15:38,267 --> 01:15:39,461
Didn't I tell you?

694
01:15:39,668 --> 01:15:42,603
That you would bring bad luck
to Lorenzo Rafael.

695
01:15:43,071 --> 01:15:44,595
Well, you already did.

696
01:15:44,873 --> 01:15:47,103
You had to stay what you are.

697
01:15:48,210 --> 01:15:49,311
This is a time to prove that

698
01:15:49,346 --> 01:15:51,370
you are
a real woman.

699
01:15:52,147 --> 01:15:54,082
Make Mr Damian forgive

700
01:15:54,117 --> 01:15:56,015
Lorenzo Rafael.

701
01:15:56,050 --> 01:15:58,482
Didn't you say you love him?

702
01:16:03,392 --> 01:16:04,832
Buy flowers!

703
01:16:10,032 --> 01:16:12,933
Buy flowers!

704
01:16:28,550 --> 01:16:29,517
What do you want?

705
01:16:29,952 --> 01:16:32,750
I want to see the man
who paints.

706
01:16:33,021 --> 01:16:34,922
Here is the paper
that he left in my hut.

707
01:16:34,957 --> 01:16:36,823
He's in Mexico City.

708
01:16:40,262 --> 01:16:41,286
Will he come back?

709
01:16:41,321 --> 01:16:42,362
I do not know.

710
01:16:42,397 --> 01:16:44,365
He may come back tomorrow.

711
01:16:45,634 --> 01:16:47,431
I'll wait outside,

712
01:16:47,636 --> 01:16:49,433
with your permission. 

713
01:17:04,886 --> 01:17:06,444
Maria Candelária.

714
01:17:08,624 --> 01:17:10,751
- Sir.
- What is it?

715
01:17:11,460 --> 01:17:13,328
They put him in jail.

716
01:17:13,363 --> 01:17:15,197
- Who?
- Lorenzo Rafael.

717
01:17:15,232 --> 01:17:16,390
But, why?

718
01:17:16,425 --> 01:17:19,567
Because he stole the medicine
that would heal me.

719
01:17:19,935 --> 01:17:22,699
Only you can help us.

720
01:17:23,538 --> 01:17:25,472
Well, let's go.

721
01:17:36,218 --> 01:17:38,118
No, gentlemen.

722
01:17:38,654 --> 01:17:40,121
I'm sorry.

723
01:17:40,322 --> 01:17:42,174
The judge is on vacation.

724
01:17:42,209 --> 01:17:44,026
I think he went hunting.

725
01:17:44,061 --> 01:17:45,994
I was trying to do something,

726
01:17:46,261 --> 01:17:49,162
but I am poor and
I can't pay the bail.

727
01:17:50,399 --> 01:17:52,663
Look at the bail amount, Mr Secretary.

728
01:17:52,698 --> 01:17:53,768
I will pay.

729
01:17:54,302 --> 01:17:57,100
It is for Lorenzo
Rafael to leave right now.

730
01:17:57,439 --> 01:17:58,871
I'm sorry, sir.

731
01:17:58,906 --> 01:18:01,441
Only the judge
can set bail.

732
01:18:01,476 --> 01:18:03,976
Ten days will fly by.

733
01:18:06,748 --> 01:18:08,238
Maria Candelária.

734
01:18:08,450 --> 01:18:09,815
Come here.

735
01:18:18,160 --> 01:18:19,092
So,

736
01:18:19,127 --> 01:18:21,458
at least, let
this girl see him.

737
01:18:21,697 --> 01:18:23,459
Of course, she can see him.

738
01:18:23,494 --> 01:18:25,930
She can even bring him
food, if she wants.

739
01:18:25,965 --> 01:18:28,233
I believe that the prisoner

740
01:18:28,268 --> 01:18:30,502
hasn't eaten since he arrived.

741
01:18:30,872 --> 01:18:31,964
Hey, you.

742
01:18:32,274 --> 01:18:35,937
Take these men and the Indian
to the prisoner in cell 30.

743
01:18:49,458 --> 01:18:52,154
Almighty heaven,
I knew you were coming ...

744
01:18:56,698 --> 01:18:58,723
Lorenzo Rafael.

745
01:19:04,773 --> 01:19:07,140
Maria Candelária.

746
01:19:07,175 --> 01:19:10,474
- Lorenzo Rafael.
- Maria Candelária.

747
01:19:20,422 --> 01:19:22,913
You will be leaving in ten days.

748
01:19:23,191 --> 01:19:25,785
They promised the priest.

749
01:19:27,095 --> 01:19:29,154
Maria Candelária.

750
01:19:33,201 --> 01:19:37,535
I was not able to sleep
since they caught you.

751
01:19:38,240 --> 01:19:40,970
Just thinking about
how lonely and sad

752
01:19:41,309 --> 01:19:42,970
you must be here.

753
01:19:47,215 --> 01:19:49,080
Don't cry, Maria Candelária.

754
01:19:49,684 --> 01:19:51,311
Or I cannot handle it.

755
01:19:53,955 --> 01:19:55,946
I am not
crying, Lorenzo Rafael.

756
01:19:57,325 --> 01:19:58,155
Look at me.

757
01:19:59,461 --> 01:20:00,894
You see?
I'm not crying anymore.

758
01:20:04,900 --> 01:20:06,266
As soon as I leave

759
01:20:06,301 --> 01:20:09,634
we will see the priest
to give us his blessing.

760
01:20:09,838 --> 01:20:12,102
He has just blessed us.

761
01:20:13,675 --> 01:20:16,075
We're almost married.

762
01:20:16,645 --> 01:20:18,011
So,

763
01:20:18,046 --> 01:20:20,014
do you forgive me
for what I did?

764
01:20:22,851 --> 01:20:24,011
Forgive you?

765
01:20:25,854 --> 01:20:27,788
You know that I love you more

766
01:20:28,590 --> 01:20:30,057
than myself.

767
01:20:33,395 --> 01:20:35,931
Poor thing. You should see
how good she is.

768
01:20:35,966 --> 01:20:37,564
Look, father.

769
01:20:37,599 --> 01:20:40,397
It is not an exaggeration
to say that in Maria Candelária

770
01:20:40,432 --> 01:20:42,766
I found everything
I was looking for.

771
01:20:42,971 --> 01:20:45,140
I paint Indians,
as you know.

772
01:20:45,175 --> 01:20:46,439
And since I saw her,

773
01:20:46,474 --> 01:20:49,244
I felt in her what, must
have been, in the past, 

774
01:20:49,279 --> 01:20:50,911
that delicate race.

775
01:20:50,946 --> 01:20:52,792
Emotional and wonderful.

776
01:20:52,827 --> 01:20:54,603
For me, it is like

777
01:20:54,638 --> 01:20:57,547
 the essence of true
Mexican beauty.

778
01:20:57,582 --> 01:20:59,745
I understand perfectly.

779
01:21:00,322 --> 01:21:02,858
I'll try to convince
Lorenzo Rafael.

780
01:21:02,893 --> 01:21:04,450
We are very good friends.

781
01:21:04,485 --> 01:21:06,707
Me too, sometimes,
I paint my portraits.

782
01:21:06,742 --> 01:21:08,930
I am only
a newbie, you know.

783
01:21:08,965 --> 01:21:10,797
Altarpieces for believers,

784
01:21:10,832 --> 01:21:13,134
that take us to church
with devotion.

785
01:21:13,169 --> 01:21:15,303
And for me it's a
great happiness.

786
01:21:15,338 --> 01:21:17,222
I charge for the painting.

787
01:21:17,257 --> 01:21:19,106
May God forgive me.

788
01:21:21,243 --> 01:21:22,911
Thank you very much, Father.

789
01:21:22,946 --> 01:21:24,275
Don't thank me.

790
01:21:24,310 --> 01:21:28,315
Thank this gentleman who managed
for Maria Candelária to see you.

791
01:21:28,717 --> 01:21:30,685
Thank you very much, sir.

792
01:21:30,986 --> 01:21:34,089
You are the one who sent
the doctor, right?

793
01:21:34,124 --> 01:21:36,057
Yes, it was me.

794
01:21:36,558 --> 01:21:39,823
We were thinking about thanking you
after we get married.

795
01:21:40,161 --> 01:21:42,026
But it was not possible.

796
01:21:45,066 --> 01:21:47,591
I didn't steal the money, Father.

797
01:21:49,337 --> 01:21:50,964
Only the medicine.

798
01:21:52,240 --> 01:21:54,140
And the dress for
Maria Candelária.

799
01:21:54,576 --> 01:21:55,907
To get married.

800
01:21:58,079 --> 01:22:00,240
I've already returned everything,
Lorenzo Rafael.

801
01:22:00,548 --> 01:22:02,148
I don't disapprove of you, son.

802
01:22:02,183 --> 01:22:03,952
I am hurt because of
what happened.

803
01:22:03,987 --> 01:22:05,384
Do not worry.

804
01:22:05,419 --> 01:22:08,522
You will have to stay for a few days,
because the judge is not there,

805
01:22:08,557 --> 01:22:10,305
but we’ll get you out.

806
01:22:10,340 --> 01:22:12,047
May God pay you, sir.

807
01:22:12,082 --> 01:22:13,719
Why didn't you eat?

808
01:22:13,754 --> 01:22:17,023
Maria Candelária will bring
your food every day.

809
01:22:17,632 --> 01:22:19,565
I'm going back to
my garden

810
01:22:19,600 --> 01:22:20,999
to start making
some tortillas.

811
01:22:21,202 --> 01:22:22,633
It won't be long.

812
01:22:22,668 --> 01:22:24,030
Take these centavos.

813
01:22:24,065 --> 01:22:26,070
Pay me back
when you can.

814
01:22:27,075 --> 01:22:28,269
No, sir.

815
01:22:28,476 --> 01:22:29,841
Not money.

816
01:22:30,178 --> 01:22:33,147
In the garden we always have
corn and beans.

817
01:22:34,115 --> 01:22:37,084
Thank you very much, Father
Thank you.

818
01:22:37,319 --> 01:22:39,082
I'll be right back.

819
01:22:39,421 --> 01:22:41,355
May God be with you.

820
01:22:47,128 --> 01:22:48,686
Shut up.

821
01:22:49,464 --> 01:22:51,091
Stay quiet.

822
01:22:56,905 --> 01:22:58,405
Look, Lorenzo Rafael.

823
01:22:58,440 --> 01:23:01,710
He is a painter, and is
interested in you a lot.

824
01:23:01,745 --> 01:23:04,980
Yesterday Maria Candelária
talked to him.

825
01:23:05,015 --> 01:23:07,077
I said that she
could go see him.

826
01:23:07,112 --> 01:23:09,140
I was always
interested in the Indians.

827
01:23:09,351 --> 01:23:11,546
Everybody knows me
in Xochimilco.

828
01:23:11,886 --> 01:23:14,081
They committed many
abuses against you.

829
01:23:14,389 --> 01:23:18,018
It is natural that you
are wary of strangers.

830
01:23:18,727 --> 01:23:19,853
I'm telling you this because

831
01:23:20,295 --> 01:23:22,664
since I saw you
on the market,

832
01:23:22,699 --> 01:23:24,894
and I asked to paint
Maria Candelária,

833
01:23:25,133 --> 01:23:26,896
I noticed your distrust.

834
01:23:27,635 --> 01:23:29,796
I wish you
had listened to me.

835
01:23:30,171 --> 01:23:32,036
None of this would have happened.

836
01:23:32,273 --> 01:23:34,036
Isn't that right, Father?

837
01:23:34,409 --> 01:23:36,945
If he wants to paint
Maria Candelária,

838
01:23:36,980 --> 01:23:38,611
I do not see anything
wrong with that.

839
01:23:38,646 --> 01:23:41,346
It's like any other
kind of work. Honestly.

840
01:23:41,381 --> 01:23:44,046
It is a distinction that he
wants to paint her.

841
01:23:44,486 --> 01:23:46,454
I don't want to paint just her.

842
01:23:46,788 --> 01:23:48,187
You too.

843
01:23:48,757 --> 01:23:50,782
Me whenever 
you please, Father.

844
01:23:51,326 --> 01:23:54,159
Especially because he was
so kind to us.

845
01:23:55,563 --> 01:23:57,929
But as for
Maria Candelária,

846
01:23:58,433 --> 01:23:59,661
well,

847
01:24:00,468 --> 01:24:02,231
I prefer not.

848
01:24:08,276 --> 01:24:09,641
Maria Candelária.

849
01:24:10,078 --> 01:24:11,636
Look at me.

850
01:24:26,728 --> 01:24:27,717
Lupe.

851
01:24:34,202 --> 01:24:35,794
I do not know
how to talk to her.

852
01:24:36,104 --> 01:24:37,799
I'm afraid that
she refuses.

853
01:24:38,339 --> 01:24:41,308
However, there is no other
way to finish painting.

854
01:24:44,879 --> 01:24:47,177
I think I can
convince her, master.

855
01:24:47,549 --> 01:24:48,641
You will see.

856
01:24:53,755 --> 01:24:54,821
Come, beautiful.

857
01:24:54,856 --> 01:24:56,687
I will show you
something.

858
01:25:07,635 --> 01:25:08,870
It's me?

859
01:25:08,905 --> 01:25:10,119
Is it not?

860
01:25:10,154 --> 01:25:11,333
Yes.

861
01:25:16,211 --> 01:25:18,026
But she is broken.

862
01:25:18,061 --> 01:25:19,842
Well, it lacks the body.

863
01:25:20,248 --> 01:25:22,250
The master has to paint it.

864
01:25:22,285 --> 01:25:24,252
He's just getting started.

865
01:25:24,287 --> 01:25:26,220
Come on. Let's go.

866
01:25:31,559 --> 01:25:32,988
Do not worry.

867
01:25:33,023 --> 01:25:34,417
You are very beautiful.

868
01:25:34,696 --> 01:25:38,325
But only without clothes
you can be as beautiful as you are.

869
01:25:42,003 --> 01:25:44,699
There's nothing wrong
Maria Candelária.

870
01:25:45,707 --> 01:25:47,071
No.

871
01:25:47,342 --> 01:25:48,536
Creature!

872
01:25:48,810 --> 01:25:50,111
Hey!

873
01:25:50,146 --> 01:25:51,377
Don't go!

874
01:25:51,412 --> 01:25:53,107
Maria Candelária.

875
01:26:00,922 --> 01:26:02,651
She's gone, master.

876
01:26:03,424 --> 01:26:06,393
I was almost sure
that this was going to happen.

877
01:26:06,694 --> 01:26:08,594
The natives are like that.

878
01:26:09,030 --> 01:26:12,022
And that’s why her
virtue was not touched 

879
01:26:12,057 --> 01:26:14,896
neither by money,
nor by civilization.

880
01:26:15,103 --> 01:26:17,594
But you have to finish
painting, master.

881
01:26:17,906 --> 01:26:19,472
The face is already there 

882
01:26:19,507 --> 01:26:21,737
and you drew the rest.

883
01:26:22,877 --> 01:26:25,146
My body looks
like hers, master.

884
01:26:25,181 --> 01:26:27,114
If you want, I can.

885
01:26:28,983 --> 01:26:30,177
All right.

886
01:26:30,552 --> 01:26:32,417
Let's start, then.

887
01:26:43,831 --> 01:26:49,531
The Flowers of Xochimilco

888
01:26:50,538 --> 01:26:53,371
- Good morning, dear.
- Good morning.

889
01:26:53,406 --> 01:26:56,205
- What news do you bring?
- None.

890
01:26:56,240 --> 01:26:59,047
In Xochimilco everything
 is the same, and here?.

891
01:26:59,912 --> 01:27:02,250
See if you recognize this painting.

892
01:27:03,785 --> 01:27:06,470
Holy Mother of Christ!

893
01:27:06,505 --> 01:27:09,156
Maria Candelária.

894
01:27:10,291 --> 01:27:11,011
Naked.

895
01:27:41,623 --> 01:27:42,555
Here it is

896
01:27:42,590 --> 01:27:44,353
I was not lying.

897
01:27:45,026 --> 01:27:47,295
There is no way
to get around this.

898
01:27:47,330 --> 01:27:49,195
It is Maria Candelária.

899
01:27:49,864 --> 01:27:53,134
A shame for
the people of Xochimilco!

900
01:27:53,169 --> 01:27:55,036
We'll throw her out of the garden.
She is just like her mother.

901
01:27:56,799 --> 01:27:57,904
Yes.

902
01:27:57,939 --> 01:28:01,342
We will expel her from the city
so she never returns.

903
01:28:01,377 --> 01:28:03,911
The shame that she puts us through.

904
01:28:03,946 --> 01:28:05,191
Right?

905
01:28:05,226 --> 01:28:06,436
Yes!

906
01:28:06,681 --> 01:28:08,916
Let's expel her.
Don't let her escape.

907
01:28:08,951 --> 01:28:10,485
 Yes, expel her.

908
01:28:10,520 --> 01:28:12,077
Expel her.

909
01:29:20,421 --> 01:29:24,292
Let's get the shameless one.

910
01:29:24,327 --> 01:29:25,960
Everybody follow me.

911
01:29:25,995 --> 01:29:27,587
Let's go.

912
01:31:41,362 --> 01:31:42,930
Lorenzo Rafael.

913
01:31:42,965 --> 01:31:44,464
Lorenzo Rafael!

914
01:31:44,499 --> 01:31:46,467
Do not leave me alone.

915
01:32:05,253 --> 01:32:08,122
Open for me, sir.

916
01:32:08,157 --> 01:32:09,856
Let me out.

917
01:32:09,891 --> 01:32:11,557
Let me out, sir.

918
01:32:11,592 --> 01:32:14,128
Let me out, let me out, sir.

919
01:32:14,163 --> 01:32:15,194
Let me out.

920
01:32:15,229 --> 01:32:16,797
- Open the gate.
- Shut up.

921
01:32:16,832 --> 01:32:18,765
Scandalous Indian.

922
01:32:24,405 --> 01:32:26,305
Let me out, sir.

923
01:32:26,340 --> 01:32:28,007
Please.

924
01:32:28,042 --> 01:32:30,010
Let me out, sir.

925
01:33:55,963 --> 01:33:57,089
Oh my God.

926
01:33:58,432 --> 01:33:59,865
They will kill her.

927
01:34:08,709 --> 01:34:12,579
Lorenzo Rafael!

928
01:34:13,214 --> 01:34:15,116
I didn't do anything wrong.

929
01:34:15,151 --> 01:34:16,583
I know that.

930
01:34:17,051 --> 01:34:19,246
Maria Candelária.

931
01:34:19,920 --> 01:34:21,822
I did nothing wrong.

932
01:34:21,857 --> 01:34:23,380
Slut.

933
01:34:23,591 --> 01:34:25,752
She turned out to be
just like her mother.

934
01:35:17,678 --> 01:35:19,976
I didn't do anything wrong.

935
01:35:20,548 --> 01:35:21,981
Lorenzo Rafael.

936
01:35:23,551 --> 01:35:25,610
I didn't do anything wrong.
