1
00:00:05,071 --> 00:00:08,407
Mizoguchi showed me once —

2
00:00:08,574 --> 00:00:11,844
<i>not</i> when I <i>shot Ugetsu,</i>

3
00:00:12,111 --> 00:00:16,148
but when I first worked with him
on a film called <i>Miss Oyu.</i>

4
00:00:16,616 --> 00:00:20,119
I visited him at home one day.

5
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:24,824
He had a variety of
e-maki picture scrolls,

6
00:00:25,057 --> 00:00:27,593
And he showed them to me

7
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:33,499
And said,
“Movies are like picture scrolls.”

8
00:00:34,333 --> 00:00:36,802
That's what he told me.

9
00:00:37,103 --> 00:00:40,406
Movies shouldn't be viewed like books,
by turning pages.

10
00:00:40,573 --> 00:00:44,377
Pictures in movies should roll out
one after another

11
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:47,880
yet still have a focal point
for the viewer.

12
00:00:48,047 --> 00:00:50,583
He said something to that effect.

13
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:54,587
E-maki are mostly images
in the distance, with no close-ups,

14
00:00:54,754 --> 00:00:59,992
but he said some points that draw
the viewer's eye are like close-ups.

15
00:01:01,193 --> 00:01:03,429
And because of these points,

16
00:01:04,096 --> 00:01:08,868
you understand the story shown
in an e-maki as it unrolls.

17
00:01:09,802 --> 00:01:13,339
I completely agreed with what he said,

18
00:01:13,739 --> 00:01:15,942
And from then on

19
00:01:16,108 --> 00:01:20,947
I became very interested in seeing
old pictures shown in e-maki scrolls.

20
00:01:27,086 --> 00:01:29,655
Masayuki Mori's character comes home,

21
00:01:29,822 --> 00:01:34,026
opens the door and looks inside,
but he finds no one.

22
00:01:34,193 --> 00:01:37,263
So he circles around the house
looking for his family

23
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:39,432
And comes back in through the door.

24
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:45,605
This time, Kinuyo Tanaka's character
is there inside.

25
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:52,244
That scene was such a challenge
for the lighting crew.

26
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:57,717
And it was only possible in film.

27
00:01:57,883 --> 00:02:01,988
All the tricks would've been visible
if it were on stage.

28
00:02:02,121 --> 00:02:06,759
But on film you can shoot
only the parts you need.

29
00:02:07,026 --> 00:02:11,364
You can make Tanaka materialize
while the camera follows Mori.

30
00:02:13,899 --> 00:02:17,203
This is something...

31
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:21,240
that applies
to Mizoguchi's films in general:

32
00:02:21,407 --> 00:02:23,409
He uses lots of crane shots.

33
00:02:23,576 --> 00:02:26,946
Especially in the case of <i>Ugetsu.</i>

34
00:02:27,113 --> 00:02:29,048
I like crane shots,

35
00:02:29,181 --> 00:02:31,250
And so did Mizoguchi.

36
00:02:32,284 --> 00:02:36,789
But in the case of Ugetsu,
about 70% of it is crane shots.

37
00:02:37,223 --> 00:02:41,160
The crane was moving...

38
00:02:42,628 --> 00:02:45,931
for sweeping shots

39
00:02:46,065 --> 00:02:49,635
and when there was a great deal
of movement, naturally.

40
00:02:50,369 --> 00:02:55,808
But it was also moving in still scenes
in the Kutsuki manor.

41
00:02:57,410 --> 00:03:02,214
The camera was never still
in the scenes in the manor,

42
00:03:02,381 --> 00:03:05,584
though its movement
wasn't meant to be noticeable.

43
00:03:06,318 --> 00:03:10,723
Images shot this way gave
a slightly unstable impression.

44
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:14,560
We shot that way
after I'd made a test shot,

45
00:03:14,727 --> 00:03:17,596
and Mizoguchi agreed to give it a try.

46
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:19,765
I think that...

47
00:03:20,499 --> 00:03:27,406
because the images give the viewer
an unstable impression...

48
00:03:29,308 --> 00:03:32,545
that helped give the feeling

49
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:37,616
that people in the mansion
were images of ghosts.

50
00:03:40,486 --> 00:03:44,724
Some people said they didn't see
the camera's movement.

51
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:48,160
So I said, “Lay one frame
over another and you'll see it.”

52
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:53,032
I talked about this once
at a film school.

53
00:03:53,365 --> 00:03:58,104
One frame of a scene in the mansion
was placed over another,

54
00:03:58,270 --> 00:04:00,973
and you could see
there was a deviation.

55
00:04:05,845 --> 00:04:09,448
Actors knew that
a certain director worked one way

56
00:04:09,615 --> 00:04:12,518
And another director worked
in a different way.

57
00:04:16,722 --> 00:04:20,626
Sometimes they had difficulty playing
their characters, like Masayuki Mori <i>—</i>

58
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,795
When was that?

59
00:04:23,195 --> 00:04:25,631
Wait. When did that happen?

60
00:04:26,799 --> 00:04:28,968
We were having a meal.

61
00:04:29,135 --> 00:04:33,639
It was a lunch break,
and we were in a cafeteria.

62
00:04:38,344 --> 00:04:41,213
And an actor as skilled
as Mori was saying...

63
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:44,150
“How does he want me to do it?”

64
00:04:46,085 --> 00:04:50,923
I said, “You have
a chest of drawers inside you

65
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:55,761
from which to pull out what you need,
so start from the top drawer.”

66
00:04:55,928 --> 00:04:58,764
He said, “I've already rummaged
through all the drawers.”

67
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,169
Then after that lunch break,

68
00:05:03,335 --> 00:05:06,739
he finally got an okay from Mizoguchi.

69
00:05:09,008 --> 00:05:13,412
It was around 2:00 or 3:00.
He got the okay right after lunch.

70
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:18,217
I was happy for him, so I said,
“You got through it.”

71
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:23,322
And what did he say?
We had a good laugh.

72
00:05:23,589 --> 00:05:27,359
He said,
“lt was in the top drawer after all.”

73
00:05:29,094 --> 00:05:31,330
Isn't that a good story?

74
00:05:31,931 --> 00:05:37,236
That stayed in my mind
like a really good joke.

75
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:44,009
I was sick for three years.

76
00:05:44,176 --> 00:05:47,980
I don't like to be inactive,

77
00:05:48,647 --> 00:05:54,453
But for three years
I couldn't go to the movies.

78
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:57,356
All I could do was watch television.

79
00:05:57,623 --> 00:06:00,025
So I watched TV dramas...

80
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:03,062
and commercials.

81
00:06:06,565 --> 00:06:09,501
I guess I got to study
TV commercials.

82
00:06:10,436 --> 00:06:15,741
I realized a lot of money is spent
making TV commercials.

83
00:06:15,908 --> 00:06:18,344
The fact that they looked great

84
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:22,181
meant quite a bit of money
was spent making them.

85
00:06:22,514 --> 00:06:26,752
The money is spent
on a lot of effort and energy

86
00:06:26,919 --> 00:06:29,421
in technical processing
and postproduction.

87
00:06:29,588 --> 00:06:33,626
If you run the figures,
the money spent

88
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:37,062
making a short commercial

89
00:06:37,229 --> 00:06:42,101
must be proportionally greater
than that spent on a feature film.

90
00:06:42,534 --> 00:06:47,106
I thought, “| wish they'd use
that money to make a feature.”

91
00:06:49,608 --> 00:06:54,113
I've seen some terrible TV shows.

92
00:06:54,546 --> 00:07:00,352
In contrast, TV movies <i>—</i>

93
00:07:00,519 --> 00:07:03,355
Or rather, TV dramas <i>—</i>

94
00:07:03,522 --> 00:07:08,294
I'd gradually lost my hearing
due to my illness.

95
00:07:08,694 --> 00:07:11,397
I couldn't hear at all.

96
00:07:11,964 --> 00:07:15,634
So I was watching TV
with no sound...

97
00:07:16,568 --> 00:07:21,073
and I was just feeling
empty and sad.

98
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:25,544
Then, as I watched TV,

99
00:07:25,711 --> 00:07:30,516
I realized the images in commercials
were better than in TV dramas,

100
00:07:30,683 --> 00:07:34,053
and also that more money
was spent making them.

101
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,622
<i>In contrast...</i>

102
00:07:38,924 --> 00:07:45,965
TV dramas made by directors
using regular actors were boring.

103
00:07:46,131 --> 00:07:49,468
If you can't hear,

104
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:54,073
you don't understand stories
in Japanese TV dramas at all.

105
00:07:55,207 --> 00:07:58,410
That means there's
no exposition through images.

106
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:06,352
TV dramas,
and films too, naturally,

107
00:08:06,885 --> 00:08:10,222
should tell their story through images.

108
00:08:10,389 --> 00:08:13,192
Look back at silent films.

109
00:08:13,492 --> 00:08:17,896
If you watch them now,
you'll be surprised

110
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:22,334
at the effort expended trying
to make viewers understand.

111
00:08:22,968 --> 00:08:25,137
You'll see repeated efforts

112
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:29,108
at making the viewer
understand the story.

113
00:08:29,775 --> 00:08:33,212
I really sensed

114
00:08:33,379 --> 00:08:38,283
That effort at expression
in those old films.

115
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:42,154
I felt the same way
when I saw silent films recently.

116
00:08:42,621 --> 00:08:45,491
But today's TV dramas

117
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:51,330
won't make any sense to you
unless you can hear.

118
00:08:52,698 --> 00:09:00,773
TV dramas seem no different
to me than radio dramas.

119
00:09:02,508 --> 00:09:06,045
In contrast, I wonder <i>—</i>

120
00:09:09,114 --> 00:09:14,920
I saw a film in a theater
for the first time after a long while.

121
00:09:16,755 --> 00:09:19,658
It was a sad
and depressing experience

122
00:09:19,792 --> 00:09:22,528
after being bedridden
for three years.

123
00:09:23,929 --> 00:09:29,301
In those three years
there'd been great advances

124
00:09:29,468 --> 00:09:34,406
in technology and hardware.

125
00:09:35,641 --> 00:09:40,412
The changes over
those three or four years

126
00:09:40,946 --> 00:09:44,316
showed amazing development
in the images on-screen.

127
00:09:44,683 --> 00:09:47,519
In that sense...

128
00:09:48,053 --> 00:09:52,124
more and more feature films
have to keep up,

129
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:55,527
And by taking advantage
of these advances,

130
00:09:55,694 --> 00:09:59,231
they should be able to make
interesting images of their own.

131
00:10:00,666 --> 00:10:02,434
Anyway- --

132
00:10:03,902 --> 00:10:09,174
Overall, though, it seems to <i>me...</i>

133
00:10:10,476 --> 00:10:15,380
That making images by utilizing
advanced technology is still unrefined.

134
00:10:18,417 --> 00:10:22,287
It might be a good idea
to go back to silent films.

135
00:10:22,421 --> 00:10:25,657
If people studied them all over again,

136
00:10:25,824 --> 00:10:30,195
I think movies might become
different and more interesting.
