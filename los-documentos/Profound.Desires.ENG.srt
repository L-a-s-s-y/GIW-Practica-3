Shown in the 1968 arts festival

2
00:00:08,884 --> 00:00:16,884
a nikkatsu production

3
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:31,128
Grandpa! A rat! A rat!

4
00:04:23,013 --> 00:04:24,431
Kame!

5
00:04:25,849 --> 00:04:27,142
Kametaro!

6
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:18,527
Brother?

7
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,238
Brother!

8
00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:30,163
Uma...

9
00:05:40,257 --> 00:05:42,050
Hide it, brother.

10
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:44,636
Grandpa will give you hell if he finds it.

11
00:05:45,971 --> 00:05:47,889
How's taro's illness?

12
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:50,600
He's not eaten since this morning.

13
00:05:52,143 --> 00:05:54,729
There's a curse on him.

14
00:05:55,272 --> 00:05:57,983
You've been to the sea,
haven't you, brother?

15
00:05:58,108 --> 00:05:59,818
No, I haven't.

16
00:05:59,943 --> 00:06:02,237
You're not supposed
to leave the pit at all.

17
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:05,198
If they find you poaching fish,
they'll kill you.

18
00:06:05,323 --> 00:06:07,158
I haven't been!

19
00:06:07,284 --> 00:06:08,910
I hope not.

20
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:11,496
Grandpa's coming.

21
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:20,088
Nekichi?

22
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:22,215
Has uma been here?

23
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:25,385
I don't know.

24
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:39,608
Right, kametaro...

25
00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:45,280
Taro! Taro!

26
00:06:50,702 --> 00:06:52,537
- He's better!
- He's better!

27
00:06:55,624 --> 00:06:59,586
Toriko, you mustn't let taro
drink too much water.

28
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:03,757
Uma, you must leave nekichi alone.

29
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:07,469
I haven't seen him, grandpa.

30
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:11,973
What would happen
if people found out?

31
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:14,768
How would you explain it to ryu?

32
00:07:21,191 --> 00:07:22,901
Long ago

33
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:29,616
long ago

34
00:07:29,741 --> 00:07:34,746
very long ago

35
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:45,423
there came to the kurage sea...

36
00:07:53,890 --> 00:08:01,606
A brother and a sister

37
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:07,570
a god and a goddess

38
00:08:09,364 --> 00:08:17,122
together, they created an island

39
00:08:17,247 --> 00:08:22,002
this is their tale

40
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:33,304
the tale of how the island began...

41
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:48,528
Then one day, the god of heaven
called the male god to him.

42
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:55,410
He told him to become
the guardian deity of an island.

43
00:08:55,535 --> 00:09:01,374
The god of heaven gave him
a bright red rock.

44
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:04,586
The male god was overjoyed

45
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:09,007
and threw the rock into the ocean.

46
00:09:09,132 --> 00:09:14,262
It made an enormous splash.

47
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:16,181
Lo and behold!

48
00:09:16,306 --> 00:09:21,853
All of a sudden, kurage island
appeared in the ocean.

49
00:09:22,854 --> 00:09:24,147
And then what?

50
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:30,612
And then the male god
tried to go down to the island.

51
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:33,239
But he couldn't.

52
00:09:33,364 --> 00:09:38,620
"I must get down somehow,
but I can't!"

53
00:09:42,624 --> 00:09:45,752
So he begged the god of heaven,

54
00:09:45,877 --> 00:09:51,424
"I beg you, bestow upon me
the part of my body that I lack."

55
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:54,636
The god of heaven was astounded
and said,

56
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:59,015
"what part of your body
do you lack?"

57
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:08,350
”The part of my body
that I lack...

58
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:24,116
”...is that of a woman

59
00:10:31,256 --> 00:10:39,256
”I lack the body of a woman ”

60
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:58,658
Profound des/res of the gods

How's the fishing today?

71
00:12:18,488 --> 00:12:20,073
So-so!

72
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:25,245
Pig overboard!

73
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:27,830
Turn around!

74
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,709
Fumoto, turn around!

75
00:12:42,345 --> 00:12:45,890
- Damn shark got it!
- Shark!

76
00:12:49,394 --> 00:12:50,937
Come on!

77
00:13:01,698 --> 00:13:03,116
Tomari...

78
00:13:04,951 --> 00:13:06,369
Tonoshiro...

79
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:10,290
Ohama... ohama!

80
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,753
Ryu's share.

81
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:22,051
Here, toriko.

82
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:26,347
That's for me.

83
00:13:28,599 --> 00:13:30,727
We're heading back!

84
00:13:34,981 --> 00:13:36,816
We're off!

85
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:41,904
All right, kame...

86
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:46,451
Brother...

87
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:31,120
We, the futori family,
are the oldest family on the island.

88
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:38,961
In recent years, our transgressions
have caused trouble on the island,

89
00:14:39,087 --> 00:14:42,632
therefore, I now promise the gods,

90
00:14:42,757 --> 00:14:45,593
that the futori family
will never go out to sea,

91
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:49,138
and I will keep nekichi in shackles.

92
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:52,225
We will topple the rock

93
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:55,937
and restore the paddy fields
of the gods.

94
00:14:56,062 --> 00:14:59,023
Once we have made good
our promises,

95
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:01,234
please let us associate
with the islanders again,

96
00:15:01,359 --> 00:15:03,945
please let us
go out to sea again,

97
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:06,989
and please let us participate
in the dongama festival.

98
00:15:07,115 --> 00:15:11,577
Please let us restore
the way things were.

99
00:15:25,216 --> 00:15:29,929
The paddy fields of k urage island

100
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:34,350
are floating fields

101
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:38,896
stamp on the paddy field paths

102
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:42,650
and the ears of the rice plants
will quiver

103
00:15:47,405 --> 00:15:51,909
the breasts of running girls

104
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:57,540
they quiver too,
they quiver too!

105
00:15:58,374 --> 00:16:06,174
When their breasts quiver,
they make the blood run wild

106
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:10,553
they make the blood run wild

107
00:16:15,433 --> 00:16:23,433
all the boys and girls
run down to the beach

108
00:16:23,774 --> 00:16:29,530
and dance all night long
in the shade of the Adan tree...

109
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:36,204
The boys have come out
to play with toriko.

110
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:39,749
Run down to the beach

111
00:16:39,874 --> 00:16:47,715
and dance all night
in the shade of the Adan tree

112
00:17:08,236 --> 00:17:10,988
Show us more! Come on, toriko!

113
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:12,532
More! More!

114
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:40,184
- Toriko?
- What?

115
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:42,853
Whose wife are you, toriko?

116
00:17:45,856 --> 00:17:48,401
Toriko is kametaro's wife!

117
00:17:51,654 --> 00:17:53,990
I'm kametaro's wife!

118
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:08,045
Toriko is nekichi's wife, nekichi's...

119
00:18:10,548 --> 00:18:15,678
Toriko is... nekichi's... wife!

120
00:18:17,555 --> 00:18:19,932
She says she's nekichi's wife!

121
00:18:33,487 --> 00:18:35,448
Grandpa!

122
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:40,286
- You beasts!
- Bastards!

123
00:18:41,621 --> 00:18:43,497
Sister-fucker!

124
00:18:44,749 --> 00:18:48,085
Don't make fun of us, you bastards!

125
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:50,254
Sister-fucker!

126
00:18:51,339 --> 00:18:52,757
Grandpa!

127
00:18:53,883 --> 00:18:57,303
Grandpa! It itches!

128
00:18:57,428 --> 00:19:00,598
Grandpa! I can't bear the itching!

129
00:19:00,723 --> 00:19:03,059
- There, there.
- It itches!

130
00:19:03,184 --> 00:19:04,602
Toriko...

131
00:19:06,312 --> 00:19:08,147
There, there...

132
00:19:11,484 --> 00:19:13,152
What are you doing, nekichi?

133
00:19:13,277 --> 00:19:16,489
- Toriko...
- My ear itches, grandpa!

134
00:19:16,614 --> 00:19:18,157
Your ear?

135
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:22,787
- Where?
- My ear! Scratch my ear, father!

136
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:27,375
Here?

137
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:32,963
Who taught you this, toriko?

138
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:35,966
Grandpa...

139
00:19:37,968 --> 00:19:42,348
Toriko knows nothing of pleasure.

140
00:19:42,473 --> 00:19:46,352
That's why they call us beasts, grandpa!

141
00:19:46,477 --> 00:19:50,356
Thanks to you, we all have to suffer.

142
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,401
What are you talking about?

143
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:58,531
The reason they call us beasts
is because you broke the rules.

144
00:19:59,532 --> 00:20:05,121
I told you not to,
but you used dynamite to poach fish.

145
00:20:05,246 --> 00:20:06,789
What's that?

146
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:11,043
They all used to do it!

147
00:20:12,128 --> 00:20:16,006
They didn't do it so openly,
like you, you fool!

148
00:20:16,132 --> 00:20:21,053
And on top of that, you laid hands
on another man's wife.

149
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:23,514
But sato was my comrade-in-arms!

150
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:29,645
He couldn't love his wife, so I did it
for him. What's wrong with that?

151
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:32,690
It's always about
"comrades-in-arms" with you.

152
00:20:32,815 --> 00:20:34,984
He was my comrade-in-arms!

153
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:41,490
He was my friend
during the happiest time of my life.

154
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:44,034
Better than this forsaken place,

155
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:48,873
where they call us beasts
all the time!

156
00:20:49,707 --> 00:20:51,459
All because you're insane!

157
00:20:51,584 --> 00:20:53,085
Idiot!

158
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:56,839
A man should always
look after his woman.

159
00:20:56,964 --> 00:21:01,802
Ushi's husband rejected her
so I loved her.

160
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:05,431
- There's nothing wrong with that.
- What? You bastard!

161
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:10,060
Ushi was your own daughter!

162
00:21:11,145 --> 00:21:12,772
What about it?

163
00:21:12,897 --> 00:21:15,733
I made her feel happy, didn't I?

164
00:21:15,858 --> 00:21:17,860
She died happy, didn't she?

165
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:23,491
No one would marry her
because she was carrying your baby!

166
00:21:23,616 --> 00:21:26,577
You owe your own life to her!

167
00:21:26,702 --> 00:21:29,079
How dare you insult your own father!

168
00:21:56,941 --> 00:21:58,567
Hot today, isn't it?

169
00:21:58,692 --> 00:22:00,361
Working hard?

170
00:22:00,486 --> 00:22:03,072
No, times are hard. See you!

171
00:22:11,956 --> 00:22:13,999
Are you mr kariya?

172
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:21,340
I'm ryu ryugen
of the kurage sugar factory.

173
00:22:21,465 --> 00:22:23,133
Was it choppy?

174
00:22:23,259 --> 00:22:27,012
We were expecting your predecessor,
mr shimajiri, to come,

175
00:22:27,137 --> 00:22:28,889
but he had other business.

176
00:22:55,583 --> 00:23:01,964
What kind of man has come

177
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:10,097
come to catch me?
Tempt me with sweet words?

178
00:23:24,778 --> 00:23:27,781
- Nekichi?
- Oh, my comrade-in-arms!

179
00:23:28,616 --> 00:23:33,245
- What's up today?
- An engineer's arrived from Tokyo.

180
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:35,497
He's going to dig a well for the factory.

181
00:23:35,623 --> 00:23:39,460
- Ryugen! Nice to see you.
- Honourable elder. Here...

182
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:43,297
I just brought you a little something.

183
00:23:47,509 --> 00:23:51,096
- Blessings be upon you.
- Please accept it.

184
00:23:53,182 --> 00:23:58,854
In actual fact, I'd like to borrow
kametaro as the engineer's assistant.

185
00:23:58,979 --> 00:24:04,360
He's like family to me,
so I'd very much like to give him the job.

186
00:24:04,485 --> 00:24:06,779
Kametaro belongs
to the futori family,

187
00:24:06,904 --> 00:24:09,365
he has to dig the pit
for the islanders.

188
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:13,118
Of course, that's important,
but there's plenty of time for that.

189
00:24:13,243 --> 00:24:17,623
- Uma's agreed, as well.
- Uma? Why?

190
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:23,379
Uma's also a futori!
She wouldn't halt digging the well.

191
00:24:23,504 --> 00:24:27,967
But all the farmers on the island
make a living growing sugar cane.

192
00:24:28,092 --> 00:24:32,888
The machines in the factory can't
function without water. We'd all die!

193
00:24:34,807 --> 00:24:39,645
It was you who had the whole island
switch from growing rice to sugar cane!

194
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:41,981
The island can't thrive otherwise.

195
00:24:42,106 --> 00:24:45,526
But I want to be
the engineer's assistant...

196
00:24:47,695 --> 00:24:53,367
I've already mentioned kametaro
to the island elders.

197
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:58,038
If he helps the engineer, then he can be
in this year's dongama festival.

198
00:24:58,163 --> 00:24:59,832
In the festival?

199
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:04,753
Thank you for saying so.
Blessings upon you.

200
00:25:07,381 --> 00:25:08,799
Comrade...

201
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:12,261
What's kametaro's daily wage?

202
00:25:12,386 --> 00:25:15,556
500 yen a day.

203
00:25:16,265 --> 00:25:19,143
Nekichi, you mustn't accept any money.

204
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:23,689
The engineer's a god
from across the sea.

205
00:25:23,814 --> 00:25:27,151
You can't accept payment
for working for a god...

206
00:25:27,276 --> 00:25:31,321
Keep out of this!
This is between comrades.

207
00:25:33,407 --> 00:25:36,994
Honourable elder,
the world has changed.

208
00:25:37,119 --> 00:25:39,038
Work means money.

209
00:25:39,163 --> 00:25:41,832
That's why people work,
for the money.

210
00:25:41,957 --> 00:25:43,751
I don't understand.

211
00:25:43,876 --> 00:25:49,465
Since ancient times, those who render
service to the island are seen as gods.

212
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:53,635
So working for a god is...

213
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:58,098
I don't understand.

214
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:22,372
Nekichi? Nekichi!

215
00:26:53,028 --> 00:26:54,446
Nekichi!

216
00:27:03,247 --> 00:27:04,873
Come on, hurry!

217
00:27:30,732 --> 00:27:32,317
Mr engineer?

218
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:39,408
- Good evening.
- Oh, good evening.

219
00:27:39,533 --> 00:27:42,953
- You're the engineer from Tokyo?
- Yes, I'm from Tokyo.

220
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:45,289
Konoe... konoe...

221
00:27:45,414 --> 00:27:46,498
Konoe?

222
00:27:46,623 --> 00:27:48,625
The konoe army division
from Tokyo.

223
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:50,794
Oh, you were in the konoe division?

224
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:53,130
How I miss Tokyo.

225
00:27:53,255 --> 00:27:58,010
Ryu ryugen is a fairly decent man,
but the futoris are fools!

226
00:27:58,135 --> 00:28:01,013
- The futoris?
- Kame, kametaro!

227
00:28:01,138 --> 00:28:04,516
- Oh, you mean kametaro's father?
- Mad, totally mad.

228
00:28:04,641 --> 00:28:06,226
They're beasts!

229
00:28:08,896 --> 00:28:13,025
This engineer is the favourite
son-in-law

230
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:15,402
of the higashi sugar
company's chairman.

231
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:18,322
- So work hard.
- Yes, sir.

232
00:28:18,447 --> 00:28:22,075
I'm the headman of the island
and the manager of the factory.

233
00:28:22,201 --> 00:28:24,745
You are a youth of the island.

234
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:29,333
You must say nothing to the engineer
about this island's shameful past.

235
00:28:29,458 --> 00:28:33,045
For the sake of your parents
and your siblings. Understand?

236
00:28:35,005 --> 00:28:39,218
If there's anything that you don't
understand, then ask me.

237
00:29:09,915 --> 00:29:11,708
They're late.

238
00:29:46,868 --> 00:29:50,080
May I introduce your predecessor,
mr shimajiri.

239
00:29:54,501 --> 00:29:58,088
Why haven't you reported
to the company, mr shimajiri?

240
00:29:58,213 --> 00:30:00,382
No word for 6 months.

241
00:30:00,507 --> 00:30:02,426
I'm very sorry.

242
00:30:02,551 --> 00:30:05,304
Either the water supply's no good,
and we close down the factory,

243
00:30:05,429 --> 00:30:08,098
or it's fine, and we push ahead
with the work.

244
00:30:08,223 --> 00:30:09,808
It's one of the two.

245
00:30:09,933 --> 00:30:13,520
The company is waiting
for your report, you know.

246
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:15,939
- My report?
- Of course.

247
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:18,025
Why is that?

248
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:21,945
Why? Obviously all employees
have to write reports for the company!

249
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:24,614
The company pays your salary,
doesn't it?

250
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:28,285
But I haven't received any salary.

251
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:32,039
Of course not!
Your wife and child in Tokyo receive it!

252
00:30:34,291 --> 00:30:36,001
Mr engineer, sir,

253
00:30:36,126 --> 00:30:39,421
all these fields used to be
paddy fields in the old days.

254
00:30:39,546 --> 00:30:42,466
These are the remains
of the "hitomasuda".

255
00:30:42,591 --> 00:30:47,220
Long ago, a bell was rung
to gather the islanders.

256
00:30:47,346 --> 00:30:51,933
Those who arrived late were killed,

257
00:30:52,059 --> 00:30:54,519
in order to control
the population numbers.

258
00:30:54,644 --> 00:30:57,689
There were cruel practices in the past.

259
00:30:57,814 --> 00:31:00,025
Thank you all.

260
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:01,651
Blessings upon you all.

261
00:31:01,777 --> 00:31:05,947
Ryu, you are a man of high morals
and greatly respected by the islanders.

262
00:31:06,073 --> 00:31:08,200
Thank you, thank you!

263
00:31:08,325 --> 00:31:10,285
Blessings upon you all.

264
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:17,209
Long ago, these were all paddy fields,
but now they are sugar cane fields.

265
00:31:17,334 --> 00:31:19,044
Oh, I see.

266
00:31:19,169 --> 00:31:20,754
It's so hot!

267
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:23,006
- Let's press on.
- Yes, sir.

268
00:31:26,259 --> 00:31:29,429
Eh? Didn't we pass this way before?

269
00:31:29,554 --> 00:31:32,933
- Yes, that's right.
- What do you mean?

270
00:31:33,058 --> 00:31:35,143
I'm so sorry about the heat, sir.

271
00:31:35,268 --> 00:31:37,896
I want all the workers to see you,

272
00:31:38,021 --> 00:31:40,607
that way, you can give them hope
for the future.

273
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:42,192
What are you on about?

274
00:31:42,317 --> 00:31:45,153
Enough of this!
Take me straight to the factory!

275
00:31:45,278 --> 00:31:46,696
Yes, sir.

276
00:31:55,872 --> 00:31:58,917
How are things at the central office?

277
00:31:59,042 --> 00:32:02,879
What? Well, the sugar business
isn't going too well.

278
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:06,425
But I'm just an engineer,
so I don't really know.

279
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:09,219
Must be hard on your father-in-law?

280
00:32:09,344 --> 00:32:14,307
It doesn't really affect him,
he owns plenty of other companies.

281
00:32:14,433 --> 00:32:16,643
It's so hot!

282
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:22,983
The company hasn't paid
the balance of last year's advance yet.

283
00:32:23,108 --> 00:32:25,527
The islanders are worried.

284
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:31,366
But they place great trust
in chairman higashi's name.

285
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,927
Newspaper! Newspaper!

286
00:32:51,052 --> 00:32:53,472
- Deliver it to my house.
- Morning edition?

287
00:32:53,597 --> 00:32:57,017
No, the earliest edition we get
is already a week old.

288
00:32:58,393 --> 00:33:01,438
Comrade! I delivered yours
to your home, comrade!

289
00:33:01,563 --> 00:33:02,814
Thank you.

290
00:33:02,939 --> 00:33:06,693
- This lot should have some water.
- That would be wonderful.

291
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:11,740
Excuse me, but would you have
a drink of water for the engineer?

292
00:33:12,741 --> 00:33:14,159
Fine, fine.

293
00:33:18,371 --> 00:33:19,831
Disgusting!

294
00:33:19,956 --> 00:33:22,667
Many of the Wells have dried up
in the drought,

295
00:33:22,792 --> 00:33:25,128
and the water's getting very salty.

296
00:33:28,131 --> 00:33:29,966
How's the sugar cane?

297
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:35,597
Look, chairman higashi's son-in-law
has come from Tokyo.

298
00:33:35,722 --> 00:33:39,142
The factory's secure.
So work hard, everyone! Right?

299
00:34:21,142 --> 00:34:25,105
- What an amazing place!
- It's called "kuburabari".

300
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:26,982
- "Kuburabari"?
- Yes.

301
00:34:27,107 --> 00:34:31,444
In olden times, they used to make
pregnant women jump from here

302
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:35,365
to control the population numbers,
so they say.

303
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:41,538
In feudal times, this island belonged
to an oppressive warrior clan...

304
00:34:41,663 --> 00:34:43,665
Mr ryu, where's the water source?

305
00:34:44,708 --> 00:34:47,294
I think there's an underground
spring here.

306
00:34:47,419 --> 00:34:50,088
It comes out from under the cliff.

307
00:34:51,298 --> 00:34:54,676
Can you see it?
Shall we climb down for a look?

308
00:34:54,801 --> 00:34:57,345
- This place is no good.
- Eh?

309
00:34:57,470 --> 00:35:00,682
- It's too far from the factory.
- It's the best on the island...

310
00:35:00,807 --> 00:35:04,311
It may well be,
but it's no good for the company!

311
00:35:04,436 --> 00:35:06,980
The water quality is good, isn't it?

312
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:09,024
The water quality's good.

313
00:35:09,149 --> 00:35:11,735
- You've tried here?
- Yes.

314
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:14,613
That's where we bored a hole.

315
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:20,535
And?

316
00:35:21,494 --> 00:35:24,289
- What were the results?
- Well, the results...

317
00:35:25,624 --> 00:35:27,876
During the work, there was a wedding.

318
00:35:28,001 --> 00:35:30,253
A wedding? Whose?

319
00:35:30,378 --> 00:35:33,256
It was... mine.

320
00:35:33,381 --> 00:35:39,220
Mr shimajiri was boarding in the house
of a woman who'd been made a widow.

321
00:35:39,346 --> 00:35:42,015
Anyway, it's hard, this bedrock.

322
00:35:43,391 --> 00:35:45,393
It's 5km from here to the factory.

323
00:35:45,518 --> 00:35:49,272
Even if boring was successful,
manual labour costs would be enormous.

324
00:35:49,397 --> 00:35:52,734
Labour costs are not something
you need to worry about.

325
00:35:52,859 --> 00:35:58,615
Since the olden days, we've had
a traditional labour service.

326
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:01,368
It can provide free labour
when necessary.

327
00:36:01,493 --> 00:36:04,871
Anyway, we have no other
sources of water.

328
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:08,792
So you'll have to draw
the water from here somehow.

329
00:36:08,917 --> 00:36:15,465
What kind of man will come

330
00:36:16,424 --> 00:36:24,307
come to catch me?
Tempt me with sweet words?

331
00:36:28,687 --> 00:36:31,064
Toriko, you're working hard.

332
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:40,031
Look at these,
they're from america.

333
00:36:40,156 --> 00:36:41,783
Very pretty!

334
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:49,541
Hey, you don't put them on your head!
They're panties!

335
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:51,835
Try them on.

336
00:36:55,672 --> 00:36:59,050
Take your dirty ones off.
I'll give you a hand.

337
00:37:01,469 --> 00:37:03,346
These are filthy!

338
00:37:06,850 --> 00:37:08,268
Lie down.

339
00:37:14,607 --> 00:37:16,025
You fool!

340
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:18,528
Oh, kame!

341
00:37:18,653 --> 00:37:22,073
I brought over nekichi's coal.
Give me a pongee for it.

342
00:37:22,198 --> 00:37:25,368
- Go away!
- Give me the pongee.

343
00:37:25,493 --> 00:37:29,247
- Go away!
- Toriko, give me those knickers back!

344
00:37:30,999 --> 00:37:33,918
What will you do?
They were 550 yen.

345
00:37:36,379 --> 00:37:38,298
You've got money?

346
00:37:41,509 --> 00:37:44,721
Hey, kame, want a fountain pen?

347
00:37:44,846 --> 00:37:47,390
- Get lost!
- I'm going, I'm going.

348
00:37:47,515 --> 00:37:50,560
Have the pongee ready for me.
I'll come tomorrow.

349
00:38:01,821 --> 00:38:03,239
Brother!

350
00:38:05,325 --> 00:38:06,743
Stop it!

351
00:38:09,329 --> 00:38:11,706
Panties! Panties!

352
00:38:19,547 --> 00:38:20,965
Stop it!

353
00:38:35,772 --> 00:38:37,690
My ear itches!

354
00:38:39,025 --> 00:38:42,278
Brother! My ear itches!

355
00:38:42,403 --> 00:38:45,406
Scratch my ear for me!

356
00:38:45,532 --> 00:38:47,158
Brother!

357
00:38:47,283 --> 00:38:49,953
Brother, my ear!

358
00:38:50,078 --> 00:38:51,496
My ear!

359
00:38:52,372 --> 00:38:53,873
My ear!

360
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:56,960
Scratch my ear for me, brother!

361
00:39:25,321 --> 00:39:26,823
Stop it, toriko!

362
00:39:27,323 --> 00:39:29,075
Stop! Stop!

363
00:39:33,037 --> 00:39:34,455
Brother!

364
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:37,584
My ear!

365
00:39:59,147 --> 00:40:01,274
Damn this island!

366
00:40:02,358 --> 00:40:03,776
Hell hole!

367
00:40:57,288 --> 00:40:59,457
Others must be at it too.

368
00:42:32,759 --> 00:42:36,220
Nekichi, get up! Get up!

369
00:42:48,524 --> 00:42:50,276
God of kurage!

370
00:42:51,319 --> 00:42:56,824
Nekichi futori has disobeyed thee
by taking off his chains.

371
00:42:56,949 --> 00:43:02,038
He has broken the law
in order to poach.

372
00:43:02,163 --> 00:43:05,166
Fumoto! I wasn't the only one doing it.

373
00:43:07,376 --> 00:43:10,046
Damn you, you all betrayed me.

374
00:43:10,171 --> 00:43:16,219
I, yamamori futori, your humble servant
will punish him in thy place.

375
00:43:16,344 --> 00:43:18,346
You all right, grandpa?

376
00:43:20,556 --> 00:43:23,267
For taking off his chains, fifty lashes!

377
00:43:23,392 --> 00:43:25,770
For poaching, fifty lashes!

378
00:43:25,895 --> 00:43:27,855
One hundred, all told!

379
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:31,109
I will now begin his punishment!

380
00:43:32,527 --> 00:43:37,240
One! Two! Three...

381
00:43:43,830 --> 00:43:46,666
You're hurting me! My feet!

382
00:43:48,709 --> 00:43:51,087
Six, seven, eight...

383
00:44:00,972 --> 00:44:03,099
You unfilial son!

384
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:06,811
You damn idiot!

385
00:44:07,645 --> 00:44:09,063
Lawbreaker!

386
00:44:17,113 --> 00:44:18,698
Don't you dare!

387
00:44:18,823 --> 00:44:20,491
You lawbreaker!

388
00:44:34,505 --> 00:44:36,507
Please heal nekichi.

389
00:44:40,928 --> 00:44:42,847
It hurts here.

390
00:44:46,726 --> 00:44:48,144
Here?

391
00:44:49,729 --> 00:44:51,147
Uma...

392
00:44:52,773 --> 00:44:55,818
That rock will fall this year,
I'm sure of it.

393
00:44:57,695 --> 00:45:00,740
- Is that true?
- It's true.

394
00:45:00,865 --> 00:45:04,160
And when it falls,
I'll reclaim the paddy fields,

395
00:45:04,285 --> 00:45:06,704
then we'll live together again.

396
00:45:07,496 --> 00:45:09,916
I hope it's soon.

397
00:45:16,047 --> 00:45:19,383
- Brother!
- Why not?

398
00:45:19,508 --> 00:45:22,595
- Why is it bad?
- Because it is!

399
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:27,391
All the islanders call you my wife.

400
00:45:28,142 --> 00:45:30,770
They say the futoris are beasts.

401
00:45:32,021 --> 00:45:33,606
Anyway...

402
00:45:35,066 --> 00:45:37,109
My late sister-in-law would curse us.

403
00:45:39,195 --> 00:45:41,239
The gods would punish me.

404
00:45:45,701 --> 00:45:47,536
Do you hate me?

405
00:45:50,623 --> 00:45:52,041
Do you hate me?

406
00:45:53,793 --> 00:45:55,795
I love you.

407
00:46:27,535 --> 00:46:28,953
Thank you!

408
00:46:29,787 --> 00:46:31,205
Thanks.

409
00:46:33,249 --> 00:46:35,876
Are you ryu's daughter?

410
00:46:38,129 --> 00:46:39,880
His wife, then?

411
00:46:40,798 --> 00:46:42,591
Uma? Uma!

412
00:46:42,717 --> 00:46:44,343
Yes?

413
00:46:44,468 --> 00:46:46,804
Fresh air makes me hungry.

414
00:46:56,981 --> 00:46:59,191
Thank you, thank you!

415
00:46:59,317 --> 00:47:01,319
It's you, honourable elder.

416
00:47:05,948 --> 00:47:07,366
Well!

417
00:47:08,159 --> 00:47:13,164
Thank you so much
for the pumpkin the other day.

418
00:47:15,374 --> 00:47:18,878
I offer these in return.

419
00:47:19,003 --> 00:47:20,880
Blessings upon you. Thanks.

420
00:47:22,798 --> 00:47:27,762
Thank you for all the kindness
you show to uma.

421
00:47:27,887 --> 00:47:29,972
No, not at all.

422
00:47:30,097 --> 00:47:34,685
And thank you for being so good
to kametaro.

423
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:37,313
- Where are you off to?
- My pleasure...

424
00:47:43,944 --> 00:47:47,156
- Where's she going?
- To the sacred forest.

425
00:47:47,281 --> 00:47:49,950
- What's with the white kimono?
- It's for a noro.

426
00:47:50,076 --> 00:47:53,287
- Noro?
- What do you call it on the mainland?

427
00:47:54,288 --> 00:47:57,166
- A sort of shaman.
- Ashaman?

428
00:47:57,291 --> 00:47:59,627
- What's she going for?
- To pray for rain.

429
00:47:59,752 --> 00:48:02,129
- For rain?
- It's a superstition.

430
00:48:03,172 --> 00:48:05,716
What's that old man to you?

431
00:48:05,841 --> 00:48:07,593
He's my grandfather.

432
00:48:07,718 --> 00:48:10,471
- He and uma?
- Father and daughter.

433
00:48:11,639 --> 00:48:13,641
Then what is she to ryu?

434
00:48:13,766 --> 00:48:16,102
What do you call it
on the mainland?

435
00:48:16,227 --> 00:48:20,022
Are you working before breakfast?

436
00:48:20,147 --> 00:48:21,440
What is it?

437
00:48:21,565 --> 00:48:25,653
- That bore we saw yesterday...
- But it's too far away.

438
00:48:25,778 --> 00:48:28,823
Please have another look.
It won't take long by car.

439
00:48:28,948 --> 00:48:33,702
- I have to send a telegram to work.
- But it's Sunday, so...

440
00:48:33,828 --> 00:48:37,915
- I can't send it?
- You'd better put on this straw hat.

441
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:39,875
How about breakfast?

442
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,461
It'll be ready by the time you return.

443
00:48:42,586 --> 00:48:44,880
Take him to the site first.

444
00:48:50,719 --> 00:48:54,014
I must meet your father.

445
00:48:54,140 --> 00:48:58,686
My mother died a long time ago.
I don't know if my father's at home.

446
00:48:58,811 --> 00:49:01,856
- Let's go and see.
- You don't have to.

447
00:49:01,981 --> 00:49:03,816
Yes, I do have to.

448
00:49:05,234 --> 00:49:09,238
- It's dirty. We should clean up first...
- I don't mind.

449
00:49:17,121 --> 00:49:18,914
Grandpa! Toriko!

450
00:49:27,131 --> 00:49:28,757
The engineer's coming!

451
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:32,303
Put the pig in the sty!

452
00:49:33,262 --> 00:49:35,347
Then boil some water.

453
00:49:36,599 --> 00:49:38,267
Grandpa!

454
00:49:40,603 --> 00:49:42,605
Fix your loincloth!

455
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:47,818
Grandpa!

456
00:49:49,153 --> 00:49:51,363
This is my grandfather.

457
00:49:51,489 --> 00:49:52,907
The engineer.

458
00:49:54,158 --> 00:49:56,702
So you're the engineer?

459
00:49:56,827 --> 00:50:00,331
I am indebted to you for the kindness
you show to my grandson.

460
00:50:00,456 --> 00:50:02,082
Blessings upon you.

461
00:50:02,208 --> 00:50:04,168
You look very fit. What's your age?

462
00:50:04,293 --> 00:50:07,213
Well... how old am I?

463
00:50:07,338 --> 00:50:09,340
Nice place you have here.

464
00:50:09,465 --> 00:50:15,179
For generations, we futoris
have served the gods as noro.

465
00:50:16,305 --> 00:50:19,225
- Kametaro and his sister...
- He has a sister?

466
00:50:19,350 --> 00:50:20,643
Yes.

467
00:50:25,564 --> 00:50:28,526
- Where's toriko?
- I don't know.

468
00:50:29,610 --> 00:50:35,199
- Kame, the engineer's a very nice man.
- Of course he is!

469
00:50:35,324 --> 00:50:38,661
Once...

470
00:50:41,872 --> 00:50:45,292
I catch...

471
00:50:49,296 --> 00:50:54,343
A man in my clutches

472
00:50:56,303 --> 00:50:58,556
I know...

473
00:50:59,515 --> 00:51:02,059
I'll never let him go

474
00:51:05,771 --> 00:51:10,317
I 7! Never let him go

475
00:51:11,277 --> 00:51:14,238
come, come at night...

476
00:51:14,363 --> 00:51:16,615
Hey, help me!

477
00:51:21,412 --> 00:51:23,539
Let go, toriko!

478
00:51:23,664 --> 00:51:25,499
- She's your sister?
- Yes.

479
00:51:25,624 --> 00:51:27,876
She's a bit funny in the head.

480
00:51:31,046 --> 00:51:34,300
Listen, don't act strange. Please.

481
00:51:34,425 --> 00:51:39,680
I want to help the engineer
so that he'll take me to Tokyo.

482
00:51:39,805 --> 00:51:42,057
- Tokyo, understand?
- Tokyo?

483
00:51:43,017 --> 00:51:47,021
Yes. There are millions
of people in Tokyo.

484
00:51:47,938 --> 00:51:51,859
There's electricity, trains,
universities, everything!

485
00:51:53,110 --> 00:51:57,364
Once I'm a success in Tokyo,
I'll take you there.

486
00:52:04,663 --> 00:52:06,915
Are you mr futori?

487
00:52:14,006 --> 00:52:16,467
Oh, you're the engineer?

488
00:52:16,592 --> 00:52:18,427
Kametaro's a great help.

489
00:52:22,431 --> 00:52:25,809
What is this hole?

490
00:52:25,934 --> 00:52:30,522
Twenty years ago, a tidal wave
washed up that big rock.

491
00:52:30,648 --> 00:52:32,900
We're digging the hole to drop it in.

492
00:52:33,984 --> 00:52:37,029
The sea water comes in here.

493
00:52:37,571 --> 00:52:40,949
- You've been digging for 20 years?
- Yes.

494
00:52:41,992 --> 00:52:44,495
We have to restore
those paddy fields

495
00:52:44,620 --> 00:52:48,666
so we can offer rice to the gods.

496
00:52:48,791 --> 00:52:52,002
The rest all became
sugar cane fields.

497
00:52:52,711 --> 00:52:54,129
I see...

498
00:52:54,963 --> 00:52:58,300
But how many more years will it take
for the rock to drop?

499
00:52:58,425 --> 00:53:00,052
I don't know.

500
00:53:00,177 --> 00:53:05,099
When nekichi grows old,
kametaro will carry on the task.

501
00:53:05,224 --> 00:53:09,311
When kame dies,
his children will do it.

502
00:53:11,855 --> 00:53:15,317
I see. Such hard work.

503
00:53:22,032 --> 00:53:25,077
It's a fine paddy field.

504
00:53:25,202 --> 00:53:29,915
There's sunshine, no wind,
and plenty of water.

505
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:33,085
Water?
Where does the water come from?

506
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:36,004
The water? Let me see...

507
00:53:37,297 --> 00:53:40,050
The water comes from... well...

508
00:53:40,175 --> 00:53:43,804
Engineer! Can you bring this up?

509
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:48,475
- That?
- Aye. Just pull that rope.

510
00:54:00,112 --> 00:54:01,989
Do you have a cigarette?

511
00:54:08,495 --> 00:54:10,372
There you are.

512
00:54:16,003 --> 00:54:20,466
Mr futori, where does this water
for the paddy field come from?

513
00:54:21,550 --> 00:54:23,427
I don't know.

514
00:54:24,636 --> 00:54:26,889
Where could it come from?

515
00:54:30,893 --> 00:54:33,103
Well, now...

516
00:54:44,615 --> 00:54:48,911
Hey, I hear something.
Sounds like water!

517
00:54:49,036 --> 00:54:51,830
We passed by here once before.

518
00:54:51,955 --> 00:54:54,458
We can't go any further in.

519
00:54:55,626 --> 00:54:59,087
No one really knows where
the water's coming from?

520
00:54:59,213 --> 00:55:01,256
That's correct, sir.

521
00:55:01,381 --> 00:55:04,218
It's getting dark. Let's head back.

522
00:55:06,220 --> 00:55:10,516
- Just a little further.
- Soon the habu will be coming out.

523
00:55:10,641 --> 00:55:14,102
- What?
- Habu. Poisonous snakes.

524
00:55:15,854 --> 00:55:17,773
Tomorrow, then.

525
00:55:22,110 --> 00:55:25,405
When did we receive the advance?

526
00:55:25,531 --> 00:55:27,491
The end of last year.

527
00:55:27,616 --> 00:55:31,453
They said they'd pay the balance
when they finished refining the sugar.

528
00:55:31,578 --> 00:55:33,997
It's been four months since then.

529
00:55:34,122 --> 00:55:36,291
"Recession, recession!"
That's all they say.

530
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:40,170
- Ryu must be taking the money.
- Of course he is.

531
00:55:40,295 --> 00:55:43,465
We're too poor
to wait for the harvest.

532
00:55:43,590 --> 00:55:45,884
He takes advantage of that.

533
00:55:46,009 --> 00:55:48,554
I hate this dirty little island!

534
00:55:48,679 --> 00:55:52,057
If you hate it that much,
why don't you leave?

535
00:55:52,182 --> 00:55:55,686
What did you say, you digger?

536
00:55:55,811 --> 00:55:57,771
I'm not a digger anymore!

537
00:55:57,896 --> 00:56:02,025
What are you, then? Ryu's dog?
Or the engineer's dog?

538
00:56:02,150 --> 00:56:04,236
Either way, you're not human.

539
00:56:04,361 --> 00:56:08,323
I am human.
I'll be in the next dongama festival.

540
00:56:09,157 --> 00:56:12,160
What about dongama?
It's just superstition!

541
00:56:13,203 --> 00:56:16,123
Shall we try a little poaching?

542
00:56:16,248 --> 00:56:18,542
Too risky with a dog on the team.

543
00:56:19,710 --> 00:56:22,421
I don't want to end up like nekichi,
banned from the sea.

544
00:56:22,546 --> 00:56:25,674
Damn, when will this drought be over?

545
00:56:26,633 --> 00:56:29,970
Many have already left the island.

546
00:56:30,095 --> 00:56:33,432
Those who remain are just losers.

547
00:56:33,557 --> 00:56:38,312
What a bore! All we can do
is a bit of night crawling!

548
00:56:46,778 --> 00:56:51,408
The girls in kurage

549
00:56:51,533 --> 00:56:55,913
all have warm hearts

550
00:56:56,038 --> 00:57:00,792
two snakes

551
00:57:00,918 --> 00:57:05,672
writhing with each other

552
00:57:05,797 --> 00:57:10,427
night crawling, night crawling

553
00:57:10,552 --> 00:57:15,724
night crawling
brings such pleasure

554
00:57:19,853 --> 00:57:24,691
once I catch a man

555
00:57:24,816 --> 00:57:29,488
in my clutches

556
00:57:29,613 --> 00:57:33,450
I will never let him go

557
00:57:34,409 --> 00:57:38,956
I will never let him go

558
00:57:39,081 --> 00:57:43,835
night crawling, night crawling

559
00:57:43,961 --> 00:57:48,757
night crawling
brings such pleasure...

560
00:57:59,309 --> 00:58:00,727
Whisky.

561
00:58:10,654 --> 00:58:14,741
- Can you give me some water?
- The water's salty.

562
00:58:24,251 --> 00:58:28,380
Have any of you been
in the sacred forest?

563
00:58:30,716 --> 00:58:34,094
- No one's been in?
- No.

564
00:58:35,637 --> 00:58:38,140
There has to be water there.

565
00:58:41,476 --> 00:58:42,894
Don't you know?

566
00:58:43,854 --> 00:58:46,023
"Don't you know?"

567
00:58:52,154 --> 00:58:53,572
Father?

568
00:58:56,616 --> 00:58:58,702
What's the matter, father?

569
00:58:58,827 --> 00:59:02,539
I can hear someone calling.

570
00:59:14,801 --> 00:59:16,636
- Who is it?
- I don't know.

571
00:59:17,637 --> 00:59:21,933
But lately, someone's been
calling me at night, "nekichi!"

572
00:59:22,934 --> 00:59:25,687
Someone's calling me
from underground.

573
00:59:32,694 --> 00:59:36,490
- Where did you get that key?
- From mr ryu.

574
00:59:36,615 --> 00:59:40,577
- Ryu?
- He wants you to come over.

575
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:56,551
Here?

576
01:00:03,183 --> 01:00:05,227
Over there, then?

577
01:00:06,478 --> 01:00:08,188
Over there.

578
01:00:15,904 --> 01:00:19,282
Tokusato lost his soul last night,

579
01:00:19,407 --> 01:00:21,326
so he's looking for it.

580
01:00:21,451 --> 01:00:23,286
It's just superstition.

581
01:00:23,411 --> 01:00:27,791
- Do such things happen?
- They say they do on this island.

582
01:00:27,916 --> 01:00:29,709
It's stupid, though.

583
01:00:31,419 --> 01:00:34,381
Mr engineer, that's the wrong way!
Not that way!

584
01:00:35,132 --> 01:00:38,385
Mr engineer, the proposed site
is over here.

585
01:00:38,510 --> 01:00:40,554
This is the wrong way!

586
01:00:45,684 --> 01:00:49,062
Mr engineer, this is wrong.
It's best not to go that way.

587
01:00:51,022 --> 01:00:52,440
There!

588
01:01:07,539 --> 01:01:13,170
Rain, rain, rain to fall

589
01:01:13,962 --> 01:01:17,841
rain, rain, rain to fall...

590
01:01:26,391 --> 01:01:28,185
Water!

591
01:01:28,310 --> 01:01:30,812
- The source must be here.
- Mr engineer!

592
01:01:35,442 --> 01:01:37,402
That hurts! That hurts!

593
01:01:40,197 --> 01:01:44,201
Hurry, take me down!
It's throbbing!

594
01:01:44,326 --> 01:01:46,536
Fool! Cut down the tree!

595
01:01:47,370 --> 01:01:52,375
Our carelessness has delayed
your work. I am truly sorry.

596
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:57,547
It's not futori's fault.
I was too hasty.

597
01:01:58,298 --> 01:02:00,592
It'll make a good story to tell at home.

598
01:02:03,345 --> 01:02:08,558
Ryugen, why didn't you tell me
about that source of good water?

599
01:02:08,683 --> 01:02:14,522
The shrine's well is the last water
left on the island.

600
01:02:14,648 --> 01:02:17,901
This drought has lasted
for three months so far,

601
01:02:18,026 --> 01:02:20,904
but nobody uses that water.

602
01:02:21,029 --> 01:02:24,157
The gods punish those who touch it.

603
01:02:29,412 --> 01:02:32,540
We don't tell outsiders, that's the rule.

604
01:02:32,666 --> 01:02:37,462
Without water, the factory will close.
Then the whole island will suffer.

605
01:02:37,587 --> 01:02:43,260
Yes, but we can't disregard
our island's traditions and beliefs.

606
01:02:43,385 --> 01:02:48,265
It's better using this water source
than laying a 5-kilometre pipeline!

607
01:02:49,307 --> 01:02:51,309
God's water or not!

608
01:02:54,980 --> 01:03:00,568
I'm the factory manager,
but also the headman of the island.

609
01:03:00,694 --> 01:03:06,116
Even more so, then. It's an opportunity
to do away with these old superstitions!

610
01:03:06,241 --> 01:03:11,913
Kurage island lags fifty years
behind the mainland, so it takes time.

611
01:03:12,038 --> 01:03:14,416
- There is no time.
- No!

612
01:03:18,878 --> 01:03:20,547
Oh, thank you.

613
01:03:22,007 --> 01:03:23,675
Blessings upon you.

614
01:03:25,343 --> 01:03:30,265
Furthermore, I have absolutely
no influence over that place.

615
01:03:30,390 --> 01:03:33,768
The noro are in charge of it.

616
01:03:33,893 --> 01:03:36,146
- Ah, the shamans?
- Yes.

617
01:03:36,271 --> 01:03:39,941
They have an unspoken
sovereign authority there.

618
01:03:40,066 --> 01:03:43,445
So I have to get the noro together
and ask them first.

619
01:03:43,570 --> 01:03:45,989
Will they agree?

620
01:03:46,114 --> 01:03:50,160
I don't know.
That's why I must ask them.

621
01:03:50,910 --> 01:03:53,163
I'll make some preliminary checks,
all right?

622
01:03:53,288 --> 01:03:54,873
I imagine so.

623
01:03:58,710 --> 01:04:02,714
- She's a very religious woman?
- She's my wife.

624
01:04:04,007 --> 01:04:05,967
Then uma is...?

625
01:04:06,092 --> 01:04:09,554
Unari, show him the shackles.

626
01:04:10,597 --> 01:04:14,142
Back in feudal times,
the ryu family suffered greatly,

627
01:04:14,267 --> 01:04:16,853
they worked as serfs
in the cane fields.

628
01:04:19,647 --> 01:04:24,861
These are the shackles
that were used in those days.

629
01:04:24,986 --> 01:04:29,532
We keep them to remind ourselves
of our ancestors' hardships.

630
01:04:29,657 --> 01:04:35,789
And to prevent ourselves
from breaking the laws of the gods.

631
01:04:35,914 --> 01:04:37,916
Lend me a match, please.

632
01:04:40,585 --> 01:04:44,714
The people of the island
are deeply religious, aren't they?

633
01:04:44,839 --> 01:04:46,466
What deity is it?

634
01:04:46,591 --> 01:04:50,804
The whole of creation,
each blade of grass, they are all gods.

635
01:04:51,971 --> 01:04:57,227
There are gods in the sea,
in the fields and in our homes.

636
01:04:58,436 --> 01:05:03,775
If you take the gods away,
there would be nothing left here.

637
01:05:25,922 --> 01:05:27,757
The boar trap?

638
01:05:35,974 --> 01:05:37,725
Blessings upon you.

639
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:44,357
Will you let me see uma?

640
01:05:44,482 --> 01:05:46,443
How dare you?

641
01:05:46,568 --> 01:05:48,403
Be off with you!

642
01:05:54,993 --> 01:05:57,287
And keep the chains quiet.

643
01:05:57,412 --> 01:05:59,497
Disgrace to the island!

644
01:06:34,949 --> 01:06:38,620
After nekichi returned from the army,
his wife died.

645
01:06:40,205 --> 01:06:42,832
That's when he became wild.

646
01:06:43,708 --> 01:06:47,295
He started poaching with dynamite
and stealing,

647
01:06:47,420 --> 01:06:51,257
chasing women and
seducing other men's wives.

648
01:06:51,382 --> 01:06:54,427
In the end, even his own sister!

649
01:06:55,929 --> 01:07:00,642
Many islanders died
in the malaria epidemic of 1947.

650
01:07:02,936 --> 01:07:06,689
Nekichi's crimes had angered the gods.

651
01:07:07,649 --> 01:07:09,108
Is that true?

652
01:07:09,234 --> 01:07:11,903
As proof, a tidal wave came

653
01:07:12,028 --> 01:07:16,157
and swept a big red rock
onto his paddy field.

654
01:07:16,282 --> 01:07:18,159
What an awful story.

655
01:07:19,911 --> 01:07:24,666
So ryu made uma stay
in his house with him.

656
01:07:26,125 --> 01:07:28,086
- Uma?
- Right.

657
01:07:29,087 --> 01:07:34,175
Leading an honest life,
she was inspired to become a noro.

658
01:07:35,218 --> 01:07:37,845
Her ancestors were all shaman,

659
01:07:37,971 --> 01:07:41,140
so uma's the head shaman here.

660
01:07:43,726 --> 01:07:48,773
So you could say that uma
is ryu's mistress, isn't she?

661
01:07:50,275 --> 01:07:53,069
How do they call it on the mainland?

662
01:07:53,194 --> 01:07:55,613
How do they call it here?

663
01:07:55,738 --> 01:07:59,158
"Taking care of a woman," we say.

664
01:08:04,205 --> 01:08:09,002
Anyway, it's lucky for us that ryu's
looking after the leading shaman.

665
01:08:10,461 --> 01:08:14,799
- To get water from the gods!
- That's something else entirely.

666
01:08:29,606 --> 01:08:31,941
Where have you been?

667
01:08:32,066 --> 01:08:34,944
Praying on the beach.

668
01:08:36,195 --> 01:08:39,032
- Is that true?
- Yes, it is.

669
01:08:40,116 --> 01:08:42,118
You should serve the engineer.

670
01:08:43,536 --> 01:08:48,333
A shaman's duty is to protect
the shrine and the island. Understood?

671
01:09:00,511 --> 01:09:03,056
Go and comfort the engineer.

672
01:09:04,390 --> 01:09:05,808
Go on!

673
01:09:11,731 --> 01:09:15,568
- Here.
- Thanks. I've had quite enough.

674
01:09:15,693 --> 01:09:18,154
- One more.
- No, I can't.

675
01:09:25,453 --> 01:09:26,871
Mr engineer...

676
01:09:26,996 --> 01:09:28,790
Are you hot?

677
01:09:28,915 --> 01:09:32,460
Yes, so don't come close to me.

678
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:36,339
Do you dislike me, mr engineer?

679
01:09:36,464 --> 01:09:39,717
It's not a matter of like or dislike.

680
01:09:42,261 --> 01:09:44,514
Ah, it's too damn hot!

681
01:10:03,574 --> 01:10:04,992
Uma, wait!

682
01:10:07,328 --> 01:10:12,500
I don't know what this is all about,
but it's all a bit too much.

683
01:10:12,625 --> 01:10:14,585
I'll sleep outside tonight.

684
01:10:14,711 --> 01:10:17,004
Wait, mr engineer!

685
01:10:17,130 --> 01:10:21,259
You should show more self respect.
Understand?

686
01:10:21,384 --> 01:10:22,802
Goodnight.

687
01:10:23,720 --> 01:10:25,179
Engineer!

688
01:10:44,031 --> 01:10:45,450
You fool!

689
01:10:46,284 --> 01:10:49,287
You can't even fulfil your duty
as a noro!

690
01:10:51,372 --> 01:10:53,207
What happened tonight?

691
01:10:54,083 --> 01:10:55,501
Nothing.

692
01:10:59,505 --> 01:11:01,340
You didn't...?

693
01:11:02,759 --> 01:11:04,927
You met with nekichi?

694
01:11:06,053 --> 01:11:10,183
I would never do
such a terrible thing.

695
01:11:10,933 --> 01:11:12,351
Damn you!

696
01:11:14,437 --> 01:11:19,567
- What happened to you here?
- I stumbled on a tree branch.

697
01:11:21,736 --> 01:11:24,572
- And here?
- Same thing.

698
01:11:26,240 --> 01:11:28,451
- And here?
- The same.

699
01:11:34,582 --> 01:11:37,585
Where did you meet
that damn nekichi?

700
01:11:37,710 --> 01:11:39,796
- Where?
- In the pit!

701
01:11:42,006 --> 01:11:46,803
- What did you do with nekichi?
- We did nothing! Nothing...

702
01:11:51,390 --> 01:11:55,686
- Is that the truth?
- Yes. We didn't do anything!

703
01:11:56,437 --> 01:12:00,024
- Swear it to the gods.
- I swear!

704
01:12:03,069 --> 01:12:05,822
To the dongama gods?

705
01:12:05,947 --> 01:12:08,533
I swear to the gods!

706
01:12:30,263 --> 01:12:31,848
To the gods...

707
01:12:37,144 --> 01:12:38,563
Father?

708
01:12:41,232 --> 01:12:42,859
Hey, kame.

709
01:12:42,984 --> 01:12:45,194
Will you let me have this engine?

710
01:12:46,070 --> 01:12:50,032
- You should've asked me first!
- You were fast asleep.

711
01:12:50,157 --> 01:12:52,952
It took me half a year
to fix that engine!

712
01:12:53,077 --> 01:12:57,999
I'm off to bird island to collect
some bullets to make gunpowder.

713
01:12:58,124 --> 01:12:59,542
Don't! You'll break it!

714
01:13:03,796 --> 01:13:06,549
You'll break it like that!

715
01:13:06,674 --> 01:13:08,551
You try it, then.

716
01:13:12,722 --> 01:13:14,557
I'm getting old.

717
01:13:15,474 --> 01:13:17,768
I used to row easily
when I was young.

718
01:13:20,229 --> 01:13:22,231
There's no wind for sailing.

719
01:13:30,990 --> 01:13:33,659
She runs so fast!

720
01:13:36,454 --> 01:13:39,749
Father... what if they find us?

721
01:13:40,625 --> 01:13:43,336
We futoris aren't allowed out at sea.

722
01:13:43,461 --> 01:13:45,296
They won't find us.

723
01:14:15,534 --> 01:14:17,578
That's heading for Vietnam.

724
01:14:23,960 --> 01:14:26,504
Kametaro, look...

725
01:14:27,797 --> 01:14:31,926
Beyond the shining sea in the west,
there's holy island.

726
01:14:33,219 --> 01:14:36,681
There are no rules,
no betrayers there.

727
01:14:37,515 --> 01:14:41,227
There's enough land
to produce food for yourself.

728
01:14:41,352 --> 01:14:44,355
There's no such holy island
in the west.

729
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:46,732
That's only in old folk tales.

730
01:14:46,857 --> 01:14:52,113
No, I saw it during the war,
when I was drifting in a storm.

731
01:14:53,614 --> 01:14:56,200
Not many on kurage island
know about it.

732
01:14:56,951 --> 01:14:58,995
But some do.

733
01:15:00,329 --> 01:15:04,709
They just never mention it.
Maybe they go there to poach.

734
01:15:06,002 --> 01:15:10,047
- Why do they keep it secret?
- Because it's no longer part ofjapan.

735
01:15:11,007 --> 01:15:13,634
It belongs to that country now.

736
01:15:13,759 --> 01:15:16,387
How come no one lives there?

737
01:15:16,512 --> 01:15:19,974
It's already enormous, that country.

738
01:15:21,225 --> 01:15:24,311
No one would want to live
on such a tiny island.

739
01:15:27,648 --> 01:15:29,692
Do you want to go there?

740
01:15:33,320 --> 01:15:35,656
Why don't you go, then?

741
01:15:37,241 --> 01:15:39,702
Because I'm digging the hole
to remove the rock.

742
01:15:39,827 --> 01:15:44,957
- Why do you have to do that?
- That's the promise I made to ryu.

743
01:15:45,082 --> 01:15:46,625
A promise?

744
01:15:47,793 --> 01:15:51,714
Ryu was my comrade-in-arms.
I keep my promises to him.

745
01:15:51,839 --> 01:15:55,342
Liar! You're digging
because you like it!

746
01:15:56,385 --> 01:15:58,012
You idiot!

747
01:16:03,059 --> 01:16:06,771
Everybody says
the futoris are beasts.

748
01:16:08,689 --> 01:16:10,107
Father...

749
01:16:12,359 --> 01:16:15,362
Did you really do the same thing
as grandpa did?

750
01:16:16,781 --> 01:16:19,909
Is auntie your sister
as well as your wife...?

751
01:16:20,034 --> 01:16:22,161
Fool! Don't talk stupid!

752
01:16:22,286 --> 01:16:24,121
- But they all...
- Kame!

753
01:16:25,998 --> 01:16:28,501
Human beings aren't allowed
to do such things.

754
01:16:30,336 --> 01:16:32,922
Man must not imitate the gods.

755
01:16:33,047 --> 01:16:36,509
He may be a war comrade,
but it's an old promise.

756
01:16:37,760 --> 01:16:39,762
A promise is a promise.

757
01:16:41,764 --> 01:16:43,057
Kame...

758
01:16:44,642 --> 01:16:46,519
That rock may fall...

759
01:16:48,354 --> 01:16:51,774
By the end of this year,
maybe even sooner.

760
01:16:51,899 --> 01:16:53,317
Really?

761
01:16:54,860 --> 01:16:59,406
When it falls, we, the futoris,
will move to holy island.

762
01:16:59,532 --> 01:17:04,203
Not me. I don't want to go.
I want to go to Tokyo.

763
01:17:05,913 --> 01:17:07,665
What for?

764
01:17:07,790 --> 01:17:10,501
Whatever. I just want to go.

765
01:17:11,627 --> 01:17:18,384
When the island first began

766
01:17:18,509 --> 01:17:23,013
the brother god and the sister goddess

767
01:17:25,141 --> 01:17:33,141
did not know how to have a baby

768
01:17:38,445 --> 01:17:44,952
So the young god and goddess

769
01:17:45,077 --> 01:17:53,077
they prayed to the god of heaven
and they asked him

770
01:17:58,382 --> 01:18:03,512
They asked him for advice

771
01:18:04,972 --> 01:18:11,770
they telephoned the god of heaven

772
01:18:11,896 --> 01:18:16,317
to ask him!

773
01:18:16,442 --> 01:18:19,320
Engineer! A letter, a letter!

774
01:18:21,113 --> 01:18:23,449
It's from a woman in Tokyo.

775
01:18:25,034 --> 01:18:27,369
- My sister.
- "My sister"!

776
01:18:28,954 --> 01:18:32,458
The god of heaven told them:

777
01:18:32,583 --> 01:18:37,087
"Go in opposite directions
around the well."

778
01:18:37,922 --> 01:18:40,674
The two of them did
as they were told,

779
01:18:40,799 --> 01:18:44,094
and they embraced
when they met again.

780
01:18:44,970 --> 01:18:49,808
And the brother and daughter
became husband and wife.

781
01:18:49,934 --> 01:18:56,690
Then the god of heaven sent down
birds and animals, all in pairs.

782
01:18:56,815 --> 01:19:03,155
Thus people, birds, animals
and insects populated the island.

783
01:19:07,826 --> 01:19:09,495
What is it?

784
01:19:10,788 --> 01:19:14,166
Uma, no. It's far too hot.

785
01:19:14,291 --> 01:19:16,043
Such fair skin!

786
01:19:16,168 --> 01:19:19,004
- Oh, stop it, uma.
- It's so shiny!

787
01:19:20,172 --> 01:19:22,174
Mr futori will come.

788
01:19:27,388 --> 01:19:31,183
- Give it back to me.
- Please hold me.

789
01:19:31,308 --> 01:19:34,186
- Give it back!
- Hold me, please.

790
01:19:35,854 --> 01:19:38,357
Give it back to me.

791
01:19:40,985 --> 01:19:45,239
What would we tell ryu?
I have a wife and children!

792
01:19:45,364 --> 01:19:48,742
But your wife's having an affair!

793
01:19:51,537 --> 01:19:54,498
How do you know that?
Did you open it?

794
01:19:55,874 --> 01:19:57,376
Damn you!

795
01:20:02,047 --> 01:20:05,342
Hold me or this will happen to me.

796
01:20:07,303 --> 01:20:10,014
But I can't do that, I can't.

797
01:20:11,390 --> 01:20:14,685
What did I tell you?
Show some self respect.

798
01:20:14,810 --> 01:20:17,271
I'm not like mr shimajiri.

799
01:20:17,396 --> 01:20:19,606
I'm sorry, but leave me alone.

800
01:20:26,864 --> 01:20:29,867
This island's totally beyond me.

801
01:20:31,618 --> 01:20:33,370
Beyond me!

802
01:20:38,375 --> 01:20:42,087
Give me a hand.
This branch is in the way.

803
01:20:44,923 --> 01:20:47,009
- Futori!
- Yes, sir.

804
01:20:48,969 --> 01:20:51,263
One, two, three...

805
01:20:52,014 --> 01:20:54,224
Break it downwards!

806
01:20:54,350 --> 01:20:56,310
One, two, three.

807
01:20:57,728 --> 01:20:59,772
What's the matter?

808
01:20:59,897 --> 01:21:03,275
We must ask the noro first
about breaking any trees.

809
01:21:03,400 --> 01:21:06,320
We're only breaking the trees
that block the survey.

810
01:21:06,445 --> 01:21:09,448
- They are dead anyway!
- Yes, but...

811
01:21:09,573 --> 01:21:10,991
But what?

812
01:21:11,116 --> 01:21:14,536
- The gods will punish us.
- You believe that?

813
01:21:14,661 --> 01:21:18,374
No, I don't believe it,
it's just a superstition.

814
01:21:18,499 --> 01:21:19,917
Right...

815
01:21:21,335 --> 01:21:25,672
- Cut down this tree then.
- No! I'll do anything else.

816
01:21:25,798 --> 01:21:28,217
Cut it down. Go on!

817
01:21:28,342 --> 01:21:31,178
Please don't fire me! Please don't!

818
01:21:31,303 --> 01:21:33,305
I won't fire you if you do it!

819
01:21:33,430 --> 01:21:36,433
You have to destroy
all these superstitions! Do it!

820
01:21:37,726 --> 01:21:39,144
Quickly!

821
01:21:55,953 --> 01:21:58,789
Stop this nonsense, you idiot!

822
01:22:00,916 --> 01:22:03,502
If you won't do it, then I will.

823
01:22:03,627 --> 01:22:05,671
See if I'm punished!

824
01:22:09,550 --> 01:22:12,261
- That hurt.
- Are you all right?

825
01:23:09,276 --> 01:23:10,694
What happened?

826
01:23:11,612 --> 01:23:13,238
We hit something.

827
01:23:13,363 --> 01:23:16,533
- Another interference?
- Seems so.

828
01:23:17,534 --> 01:23:18,952
Pull it up!

829
01:23:44,770 --> 01:23:46,522
It's blocked.

830
01:23:54,321 --> 01:23:56,949
This is the third time. Shit!

831
01:23:58,158 --> 01:24:00,160
It's so damn hot.

832
01:24:01,870 --> 01:24:03,497
Mr kariya...

833
01:24:03,622 --> 01:24:09,127
I approved a preliminary investigation,
but this is going too far.

834
01:24:09,253 --> 01:24:12,673
What is the shamans' answer?
It's been a fortnight already.

835
01:24:12,798 --> 01:24:18,095
At any rate, the very destiny
of the island is at stake.

836
01:24:19,304 --> 01:24:22,099
That's rubbish!
You always exaggerate.

837
01:24:22,224 --> 01:24:27,396
The islanders' beliefs are the foundation
of their love for their homeland.

838
01:24:27,521 --> 01:24:29,022
I understand that.

839
01:24:31,191 --> 01:24:35,737
The company must take this
absolutely seriously.

840
01:24:35,862 --> 01:24:41,076
The factory gets cheap sugar cane
and low-cost labour

841
01:24:41,201 --> 01:24:43,870
because of the islanders' love
of their homeland.

842
01:24:44,621 --> 01:24:46,832
The company profits from that...

843
01:24:46,957 --> 01:24:51,587
Until now maybe,
but such old ideas are out after this.

844
01:24:52,504 --> 01:24:57,217
But friendship is the bond
between the factory and the people.

845
01:24:57,342 --> 01:25:00,929
That's too outmoded!
You have to be more rational about it.

846
01:25:01,054 --> 01:25:05,684
In that case, the factory must pay
the balance of the advance.

847
01:25:07,227 --> 01:25:11,857
I've already asked the company about it,
and I've received no answer yet.

848
01:25:11,982 --> 01:25:13,817
- Hey, shimajiri!
- But...

849
01:25:13,942 --> 01:25:15,110
Futori!

850
01:25:15,235 --> 01:25:19,323
In article 1 of the higashi construction
company policy,

851
01:25:19,448 --> 01:25:22,618
it states "to be humane" as its aim.

852
01:25:22,743 --> 01:25:27,080
I don't deny that. I'm doing this
for the sake of islanders.

853
01:25:27,205 --> 01:25:28,540
Yes...

854
01:25:28,665 --> 01:25:30,709
But I'm constantly being interrupted!

855
01:25:30,834 --> 01:25:33,378
An improvement in your attitude
would help!

856
01:25:33,503 --> 01:25:36,256
- But...
- I want to finish this and go home!

857
01:25:37,132 --> 01:25:39,426
I know exactly how you feel.

858
01:25:39,551 --> 01:25:41,970
You must be terribly worried
about your wife...

859
01:25:42,095 --> 01:25:44,640
Make your stance clear
or I'll do it for you!

860
01:25:44,765 --> 01:25:48,602
And I'll catch the culprit who's
sabotaging our work! Is that clear?

861
01:26:20,133 --> 01:26:21,760
Chase him, futori!

862
01:26:25,722 --> 01:26:27,140
Father!

863
01:26:29,810 --> 01:26:32,979
Mr engineer, this way!
He went this way!

864
01:26:52,708 --> 01:26:55,752
- I've discovered who the saboteur is.
- Oh, who is it?

865
01:26:55,877 --> 01:26:57,963
- This man.
- Oh...

866
01:26:58,964 --> 01:27:02,467
He's the criminal.
I took his photo last night and printed it.

867
01:27:02,592 --> 01:27:04,469
I see. Well, well.

868
01:27:07,597 --> 01:27:10,016
Who do you think it is?

869
01:27:11,268 --> 01:27:13,729
Don't you think it's futori nekichi?

870
01:27:13,854 --> 01:27:15,731
I don't think so.

871
01:27:15,856 --> 01:27:17,816
Who do you think it is, then?

872
01:27:17,941 --> 01:27:19,484
I don't know.

873
01:27:22,738 --> 01:27:24,156
Futori.

874
01:27:25,323 --> 01:27:27,159
Who do you think this is?

875
01:27:27,284 --> 01:27:29,161
It's your father, isn't it?

876
01:27:31,872 --> 01:27:33,707
I'm not too sure.

877
01:27:34,624 --> 01:27:37,210
What? You've forgotten
your own father's face?

878
01:27:37,335 --> 01:27:39,755
Are you sure you're not mistaken,
mr engineer?

879
01:27:39,880 --> 01:27:41,298
Why?

880
01:27:43,842 --> 01:27:46,553
Halt!

881
01:28:02,027 --> 01:28:04,070
We all make mistakes.

882
01:28:04,196 --> 01:28:06,406
Are you joking? It's definitely nekichi!

883
01:28:06,531 --> 01:28:12,287
As you know,
nekichi's tied in the pit with iron chains.

884
01:28:12,412 --> 01:28:14,414
Therefore it cannot be nekichi.

885
01:28:14,539 --> 01:28:17,083
Someone must have let him loose.

886
01:28:17,209 --> 01:28:20,921
- You! It must have been you!
- I didn't do it.

887
01:28:21,046 --> 01:28:23,423
You've no idea, ryu?

888
01:28:23,548 --> 01:28:26,384
- No.
- Then who could it be?

889
01:28:26,510 --> 01:28:29,679
The insects are swarming!

890
01:28:29,805 --> 01:28:33,308
The night has come!

891
01:28:33,433 --> 01:28:35,811
It might be nekichi.

892
01:28:39,314 --> 01:28:44,611
On the other hand,
it might not be.

893
01:28:44,736 --> 01:28:47,197
Everybody, lie down!

894
01:28:50,450 --> 01:28:52,786
Here, please, mr engineer.

895
01:28:56,289 --> 01:28:58,083
What's this?

896
01:28:58,208 --> 01:29:01,628
It's a superstition, I think,
a spell to ward off insects.

897
01:29:01,753 --> 01:29:03,463
Don't make a fool of me.

898
01:29:03,588 --> 01:29:06,466
Ryu, tonight I'll sleep at the site.

899
01:29:06,591 --> 01:29:08,802
- Outside?
- Shut up!

900
01:29:08,927 --> 01:29:10,971
You don't need to come any more.

901
01:29:38,623 --> 01:29:41,251
Oh, it refreshes you

902
01:29:42,544 --> 01:29:45,005
Coca-Cola!

903
01:29:56,349 --> 01:30:02,564
What man will catch me
and tempt me with sweet words?

904
01:30:02,689 --> 01:30:06,902
Weaving the traditional pattern

905
01:30:07,027 --> 01:30:13,408
once it's finished,
I dedicate it to the gods

906
01:30:13,533 --> 01:30:19,581
on a moonlit night,
I leave the house

907
01:30:19,706 --> 01:30:23,168
- for the gods of the sea...
- Toriko?

908
01:30:25,503 --> 01:30:30,508
The engineer's sleeping out
in the forest, near the machine.

909
01:30:31,509 --> 01:30:33,511
Take him this sake.

910
01:30:36,348 --> 01:30:38,308
And a pillow, too.

911
01:30:40,393 --> 01:30:42,103
- Toriko!
- Kame...

912
01:30:42,771 --> 01:30:44,230
Don't stop her.

913
01:30:44,356 --> 01:30:47,484
She's getting a husband.
A husband!

914
01:30:47,609 --> 01:30:49,027
But...

915
01:31:18,765 --> 01:31:23,228
Snakes writhing together

916
01:31:25,188 --> 01:31:27,148
night crawling

917
01:31:28,066 --> 01:31:30,443
night crawling

918
01:31:31,778 --> 01:31:34,197
night crawling

919
01:31:34,322 --> 01:31:37,158
no, you can't come in, toriko! Toriko!

920
01:31:44,791 --> 01:31:48,169
Aren't you... hot?

921
01:31:48,294 --> 01:31:50,255
Aren't you hot?

922
01:31:51,715 --> 01:31:53,299
Hot, isn't it?

923
01:31:54,259 --> 01:31:56,136
Hot... hot...

924
01:31:59,305 --> 01:32:00,890
No, toriko!

925
01:32:01,516 --> 01:32:02,934
Stop it!

926
01:32:05,186 --> 01:32:06,604
Toriko!

927
01:32:13,361 --> 01:32:15,864
Stop it, toriko. No!

928
01:32:15,989 --> 01:32:18,199
- Tomorrow! Tomorrow!
- Tomorrow?

929
01:32:18,324 --> 01:32:20,201
Tomorrow. Honest.

930
01:32:20,326 --> 01:32:22,662
Tomorrow. At the west beach.

931
01:32:24,289 --> 01:32:26,583
West beach, all right, got it.

932
01:32:27,542 --> 01:32:29,461
Now hurry, toriko!

933
01:32:32,088 --> 01:32:34,132
Hey, what are you doing?

934
01:32:35,884 --> 01:32:38,094
You're the saboteur!

935
01:32:43,558 --> 01:32:46,603
What do you think you're doing?

936
01:32:59,741 --> 01:33:04,162
- Why are you chaining me up?
- Fool. Ask yourself the reason.

937
01:33:06,790 --> 01:33:08,625
I don't understand.

938
01:33:09,834 --> 01:33:12,962
You grow older but not wiser.

939
01:33:13,755 --> 01:33:17,801
You'll be punished simply
for walking around.

940
01:33:17,926 --> 01:33:21,721
And now you've gone and hurt
the engineer!

941
01:33:23,181 --> 01:33:25,183
And you've got ryugen into trouble.

942
01:33:25,308 --> 01:33:29,312
No. Ryu himself told me
to protect the sacred woods.

943
01:33:29,437 --> 01:33:32,607
My job is to sabotage
the engineer's work.

944
01:33:32,732 --> 01:33:34,609
I know that!

945
01:33:34,734 --> 01:33:39,739
But did ryugen tell you
to do it quite so overtly?

946
01:33:39,864 --> 01:33:42,242
You've even had your photograph taken!

947
01:33:44,119 --> 01:33:47,288
Nekichi, put out your leg.

948
01:33:56,756 --> 01:33:58,550
Spanner, please.

949
01:34:15,984 --> 01:34:18,862
- Can you look after the baby?
- What's up?

950
01:34:18,987 --> 01:34:22,323
- My sister's in labour and needs me.
- All right, all right.

951
01:34:22,448 --> 01:34:24,617
- He's wet himself.
- I can see that.

952
01:34:24,742 --> 01:34:26,953
I'll do it. Hurry, go.

953
01:34:27,954 --> 01:34:29,372
Thanks!

954
01:34:35,170 --> 01:34:36,588
Mr kariya?

955
01:34:41,134 --> 01:34:44,220
Oh, it's you. What is it?

956
01:34:45,054 --> 01:34:48,474
Well... she's waiting
at the west beach.

957
01:34:49,684 --> 01:34:51,519
West beach?

958
01:34:51,644 --> 01:34:56,816
You promised her, so she's been
waiting since yesterday.

959
01:34:56,941 --> 01:34:58,818
Who has?

960
01:34:58,943 --> 01:35:00,862
My sister, toriko.

961
01:35:05,658 --> 01:35:10,413
She hasn't eaten for two days.
She won't talk to anyone but you.

962
01:35:11,873 --> 01:35:13,708
Poor girl!

963
01:35:43,404 --> 01:35:44,822
Toriko!

964
01:35:50,745 --> 01:35:52,413
You came!

965
01:35:53,706 --> 01:35:57,168
Toriko, have you been waiting
since yesterday?

966
01:35:59,337 --> 01:36:01,381
You've been here all this time?

967
01:36:04,300 --> 01:36:07,595
I'm sorry, I broke my promise.

968
01:36:11,474 --> 01:36:13,017
Mr engineer...

969
01:36:21,609 --> 01:36:23,861
I waited for you.

970
01:37:16,205 --> 01:37:18,791
Toriko's decided on a husband.

971
01:37:18,916 --> 01:37:21,711
So you can join
the dongama festival.

972
01:37:21,836 --> 01:37:23,421
And, kame...

973
01:37:23,546 --> 01:37:28,134
I've been told to help put
a new roof on tsuchimochi's.

974
01:37:28,259 --> 01:37:30,053
- Tsuchimochi's?
- Yes.

975
01:37:30,178 --> 01:37:34,599
Long ago, his grandfather helped us
thatch our roof.

976
01:37:35,767 --> 01:37:38,811
I couldn't die without repaying the debt.

977
01:37:40,521 --> 01:37:43,149
My first work for the village
for 20 years!

978
01:37:43,274 --> 01:37:47,653
Once the rock falls, we can be part
of the community once again.

979
01:38:07,799 --> 01:38:10,426
When did I come here?

980
01:38:11,761 --> 01:38:15,390
On the one hand,
it seems like only yesterday.

981
01:38:16,933 --> 01:38:21,020
On the other hand,
it seems like a long time ago.

982
01:38:34,075 --> 01:38:36,119
Mr engineer!

983
01:40:46,958 --> 01:40:49,794
The wind won't let up for a while yet.

984
01:40:52,880 --> 01:40:55,132
Let's leave the thatching for now.

985
01:40:55,258 --> 01:40:58,344
Typhoon no 12's origins
are over the south seas.

986
01:40:58,469 --> 01:41:04,183
It is now at latitude 24 degrees north
and longitude 130 degrees east,

987
01:41:04,308 --> 01:41:07,186
moving to nne at 10km per hour...

988
01:41:07,311 --> 01:41:11,857
Latitude 24 north is exactly
kurage island, isn't it?

989
01:41:12,608 --> 01:41:14,026
Mr engineer?

990
01:41:16,362 --> 01:41:19,615
This year's wind brings no rain.

991
01:41:19,740 --> 01:41:21,576
- A dry wind!
- Grandpa...

992
01:41:22,660 --> 01:41:24,412
The rock's falling.

993
01:41:26,497 --> 01:41:29,625
Kame! Toriko! The rock's falling!

994
01:41:29,750 --> 01:41:31,377
Get out of here!

995
01:41:32,587 --> 01:41:35,298
Come on, mr engineer!

996
01:41:47,059 --> 01:41:48,894
The rock is falling!

997
01:41:49,020 --> 01:41:50,938
- The rock is falling!
- Fall!

998
01:42:18,591 --> 01:42:20,926
Get under, everyone!

999
01:42:38,736 --> 01:42:40,154
Damn it!

1000
01:42:51,749 --> 01:42:53,501
Just a little more.

1001
01:42:55,461 --> 01:43:00,007
God of the wind!
Please make the rock fall!

1002
01:43:01,133 --> 01:43:04,011
I beseech thee! I pray to thee!

1003
01:43:04,970 --> 01:43:06,889
God of the wind!

1004
01:43:09,266 --> 01:43:11,394
Please blow harder!

1005
01:43:44,009 --> 01:43:46,887
That's no good!
Lower your hips more!

1006
01:43:50,516 --> 01:43:52,893
You're getting slack! Try harder!

1007
01:44:01,777 --> 01:44:03,279
Feeling hungry?

1008
01:44:04,488 --> 01:44:08,242
Eat a lot to get stronger
and you'll make a good son-in-law.

1009
01:44:12,663 --> 01:44:14,373
Right, come on up!

1010
01:44:25,718 --> 01:44:27,553
Got a cigarette?

1011
01:44:36,312 --> 01:44:38,564
Mr engineer!

1012
01:45:03,923 --> 01:45:08,636
Is that all right, father?
I have to take him to kuburabari.

1013
01:45:08,761 --> 01:45:13,182
He's my son-in-law,
so he's only doing our work.

1014
01:45:15,017 --> 01:45:16,393
Brother!

1015
01:45:16,519 --> 01:45:18,521
Grandpa... grandpa...

1016
01:45:18,646 --> 01:45:20,064
What happened?

1017
01:45:21,106 --> 01:45:24,985
Grandpa fell from the roof.
He's dying!

1018
01:45:34,245 --> 01:45:36,121
Pray, uma!

1019
01:45:38,582 --> 01:45:40,835
Why aren't you praying?

1020
01:45:42,044 --> 01:45:45,881
Call him back!
Summon his soul back with your powers!

1021
01:45:46,006 --> 01:45:48,050
Summon him back!

1022
01:45:57,935 --> 01:46:01,939
Dear departed soul
of futori yamamori

1023
01:46:44,815 --> 01:46:46,233
Hold on.

1024
01:47:10,090 --> 01:47:12,134
He's returning to nature.

1025
01:47:30,736 --> 01:47:33,989
Why did I make you
the engineer's assistant?

1026
01:47:34,114 --> 01:47:39,912
To help the construction work
go smoothly.

1027
01:47:40,037 --> 01:47:42,414
Is he all right now?

1028
01:47:45,042 --> 01:47:50,172
The pipes are arriving from Tokyo.
He has work to do.

1029
01:47:50,297 --> 01:47:51,715
Yes.

1030
01:48:07,106 --> 01:48:08,732
Entering.

1031
01:48:09,525 --> 01:48:10,818
Entering.

1032
01:48:10,943 --> 01:48:13,195
The island gods are entering.

1033
01:48:26,250 --> 01:48:28,877
The pain!

1034
01:48:30,796 --> 01:48:33,298
Reveal your name to us.

1035
01:48:34,466 --> 01:48:37,177
My head hurts!

1036
01:48:39,388 --> 01:48:41,765
Hurry, tell us. Who are you?

1037
01:48:44,560 --> 01:48:48,230
Say it clearly, tell us your name.
Who are you?

1038
01:48:51,442 --> 01:48:59,442
My feet slipped from the roof.

1039
01:49:00,367 --> 01:49:01,785
Grandpa...

1040
01:49:06,915 --> 01:49:14,381
I cracked my head open.

1041
01:49:24,308 --> 01:49:32,308
Everyone in kurage is one family.

1042
01:49:36,487 --> 01:49:44,487
All the families should help each other.

1043
01:49:48,415 --> 01:49:51,710
The pain!

1044
01:49:54,296 --> 01:49:58,801
What's hurting you? Tell us.

1045
01:50:02,971 --> 01:50:06,683
Nekichi...

1046
01:50:08,185 --> 01:50:13,315
Don't take off your chain.

1047
01:50:15,526 --> 01:50:17,694
It's so painful!

1048
01:50:37,131 --> 01:50:39,383
Mr engineer...

1049
01:50:41,718 --> 01:50:49,718
Don't desert toriko.

1050
01:51:04,449 --> 01:51:06,243
Kame...

1051
01:51:07,578 --> 01:51:15,578
Fear the gods of dongama.

1052
01:52:07,304 --> 01:52:09,348
Toriko is pregnant.

1053
01:52:21,318 --> 01:52:25,030
Mr engineer, return to the site.
The pipes are arriving from Tokyo.

1054
01:52:25,155 --> 01:52:26,698
You mustn't stay here.

1055
01:52:26,823 --> 01:52:29,993
What are you saying, kame?
He's your brother now.

1056
01:52:30,118 --> 01:52:32,663
Don't get in the way!
I promised ryu...

1057
01:52:32,788 --> 01:52:38,460
Ryu? Whatever he says, the engineer
is family now, he's toriko's husband!

1058
01:52:38,585 --> 01:52:40,003
Come on!

1059
01:52:41,088 --> 01:52:43,924
- Kametaro!
- What are you doing?

1060
01:52:44,758 --> 01:52:47,886
- Kame, I won't go.
- Why not?

1061
01:52:48,011 --> 01:52:51,556
- It's better here.
- But the work is hard and dirty.

1062
01:52:51,682 --> 01:52:55,018
- But I'm happier here.
- But the pipes...

1063
01:52:55,143 --> 01:52:57,938
I'll commute from here
when they arrive. Tell ryu.

1064
01:52:58,063 --> 01:53:03,860
- I can't...
- And bring my stuff here from his house.

1065
01:53:07,155 --> 01:53:09,950
It still hasn't rained
despite all our prayers.

1066
01:53:10,075 --> 01:53:12,995
It's all superstition.
Who believes in noro?

1067
01:53:13,120 --> 01:53:15,747
I envy that ryu ryugen.

1068
01:53:15,872 --> 01:53:19,167
He makes love to uma
and prays for rain!

1069
01:53:20,502 --> 01:53:25,340
What's this whisky?
Did you put sea water in it?

1070
01:53:25,465 --> 01:53:29,636
Pipe down! You'll have to wait
till it rains to drink fresh water.

1071
01:53:39,021 --> 01:53:40,522
What's up, kame?

1072
01:53:41,732 --> 01:53:44,860
The pipes are coming
from Tokyo tomorrow.

1073
01:53:44,985 --> 01:53:48,780
The company's in a hurry,
but the engineer's in a state...

1074
01:53:48,905 --> 01:53:50,157
So what?

1075
01:53:50,282 --> 01:53:55,912
Take the engineer back to mr ryu's
to dig for water in kuburabari.

1076
01:53:56,038 --> 01:53:58,415
What about toriko?

1077
01:53:58,540 --> 01:54:00,584
What about her?

1078
01:54:00,709 --> 01:54:04,921
- She's a futori.
- So you want to break them up?

1079
01:54:05,047 --> 01:54:06,465
Yes.

1080
01:54:08,675 --> 01:54:13,263
I get it. You're jealous
because he took your wife away.

1081
01:54:14,931 --> 01:54:16,475
Stop it!

1082
01:54:16,600 --> 01:54:20,062
Yamashiro, you could be
her husband too.

1083
01:54:20,187 --> 01:54:24,649
Fool! A lot of you had her before me.

1084
01:54:24,775 --> 01:54:27,944
But the first one was kametaro.

1085
01:54:28,070 --> 01:54:30,197
We'll never know.

1086
01:54:47,255 --> 01:54:50,050
The fish! The fish are coming!

1087
01:54:50,967 --> 01:54:55,222
- Who said so?
- Uma the noro said so.

1088
01:54:55,347 --> 01:54:59,601
There was a flash of lightning,
so a shoal of fish is coming.

1089
01:54:59,726 --> 01:55:02,521
The nets! Get the nets!

1090
01:55:13,073 --> 01:55:15,242
Let's go. They're not coming.

1091
01:55:16,451 --> 01:55:17,869
Let's go!

1092
01:55:47,065 --> 01:55:50,402
No, you mustn't give up
being a noro.

1093
01:55:51,528 --> 01:55:56,533
I am no longer a noro.
The gods have abandoned me.

1094
01:55:57,492 --> 01:56:01,163
The rain won't fall.
My prophecies never come true.

1095
01:56:01,288 --> 01:56:03,457
Your prophecies aren't the problem.

1096
01:56:04,583 --> 01:56:09,463
The sugar cane suffers in this drought.
And there's no fish.

1097
01:56:09,588 --> 01:56:15,218
The islanders are confused,
so they doubt everything.

1098
01:56:15,343 --> 01:56:21,349
We must show them the right path,
that's why the noro are needed now.

1099
01:56:21,475 --> 01:56:27,355
The gods have just told me
to hand over my duties.

1100
01:56:27,481 --> 01:56:30,066
- To whom?
- Toriko.

1101
01:56:30,192 --> 01:56:31,860
Fool!

1102
01:56:31,985 --> 01:56:34,154
Toriko's not fit to be a noro.

1103
01:56:34,279 --> 01:56:37,282
But the gods have spoken.

1104
01:56:38,325 --> 01:56:41,495
- Your mind is clouded.
- Clouded?

1105
01:56:41,620 --> 01:56:45,582
Ask yourself,
have you broken the divine laws?

1106
01:57:08,647 --> 01:57:11,733
Please come immediately.
Mr ryu's waiting.

1107
01:57:14,528 --> 01:57:16,530
I don't want to!

1108
01:57:18,740 --> 01:57:20,909
Hey! Kametaro!

1109
01:57:22,619 --> 01:57:25,914
- Don't be rough.
- Hey, father!

1110
01:57:30,835 --> 01:57:32,671
What's going on?

1111
01:57:35,590 --> 01:57:37,634
They've taken the engineer.

1112
01:57:41,805 --> 01:57:43,431
There you are.

1113
01:57:45,517 --> 01:57:48,770
- Congratulations!
- What's this?

1114
01:57:49,771 --> 01:57:51,731
- I don't like violence.
- Forgive me.

1115
01:57:51,856 --> 01:57:54,943
It was unavoidable.
Over there, please.

1116
01:57:56,194 --> 01:57:59,239
You've been promoted to head
of department. Congratulations.

1117
01:58:00,115 --> 01:58:04,703
- Head of department?
- Mr higashi informed me last night.

1118
01:58:04,828 --> 01:58:07,956
He's set up a new company,
the higashi tourist company,

1119
01:58:08,081 --> 01:58:11,376
and you are the head of sales.

1120
01:58:11,501 --> 01:58:15,714
Your task will be to develop
tourism in kurage island.

1121
01:58:15,839 --> 01:58:19,801
Tourism? I heard him mention
the subject before.

1122
01:58:19,926 --> 01:58:23,179
A letter from your wife
was also enclosed.

1123
01:58:25,640 --> 01:58:30,020
Tourism is your father-in-law's dream.

1124
01:58:30,145 --> 01:58:33,440
And as we've now been granted
permission to build an airport,

1125
01:58:33,565 --> 01:58:35,525
that dream will come true.

1126
01:58:35,650 --> 01:58:37,068
An airport?

1127
01:58:38,028 --> 01:58:39,946
Unari, where's uma?

1128
01:58:40,071 --> 01:58:42,032
She went to pray.

1129
01:58:43,158 --> 01:58:48,997
By the way, mr higashi will be
visiting the island in a few days.

1130
01:58:50,624 --> 01:58:53,501
Really? The chairman himself?

1131
01:58:54,544 --> 01:58:59,716
Here's the rain we've been waiting for.
Congratulations!

1132
01:58:59,841 --> 01:59:02,844
Welcome chairman higashi

1133
01:59:06,723 --> 01:59:11,394
it is with deep regret that
I have to inform you of this

1134
01:59:11,519 --> 01:59:14,689
on such a joyous day,

1135
01:59:14,814 --> 01:59:21,404
but the payment of the balance
of the advance has been cancelled.

1136
01:59:22,697 --> 01:59:26,368
In the face of a worldwide drop
in sugar prices,

1137
01:59:26,493 --> 01:59:30,622
all my efforts have been
totally in vain.

1138
01:59:31,581 --> 01:59:34,793
My deepest apologies to you all.

1139
01:59:36,419 --> 01:59:43,426
But I am confident about the talks
concerning land for the airport.

1140
01:59:44,260 --> 01:59:49,974
I am sure we can sell our land
at a high price

1141
01:59:50,100 --> 01:59:53,478
to compensate
for the cancelled balance payment.

1142
01:59:53,603 --> 01:59:56,898
For those whose land is not
on the proposed site,

1143
01:59:57,023 --> 02:00:02,737
well-paid jobs in construction
of the airport will be secured.

1144
02:00:03,488 --> 02:00:07,242
I have your best interests at heart!

1145
02:00:20,046 --> 02:00:21,464
Engineer!

1146
02:00:22,424 --> 02:00:23,842
Wait.

1147
02:00:27,846 --> 02:00:30,098
Why don't you come home?

1148
02:00:30,223 --> 02:00:32,058
My father-in-law is here.

1149
02:00:34,227 --> 02:00:36,312
Toriko's gone mad.

1150
02:00:37,856 --> 02:00:40,817
She won't eat or drink anything.

1151
02:00:42,736 --> 02:00:46,489
- Will you come home?
- Don't worry, I will.

1152
02:00:46,614 --> 02:00:49,284
- Don't make the baby fatherless.
- I know.

1153
02:00:50,243 --> 02:00:53,455
I promise I'll come back... later.

1154
02:00:58,001 --> 02:00:59,836
I'll be waiting.

1155
02:01:03,214 --> 02:01:04,632
Brother...

1156
02:01:10,138 --> 02:01:13,308
You mustn't go.
Settle the matter with money.

1157
02:01:13,433 --> 02:01:15,477
It's not a question of money.

1158
02:01:16,269 --> 02:01:19,522
- I'll talk to my father-in-law...
- Don't be ridiculous.

1159
02:01:19,647 --> 02:01:23,693
You'd put me
in a very difficult position.

1160
02:01:26,488 --> 02:01:27,906
Auntie!

1161
02:01:39,959 --> 02:01:44,339
Mr ryu has given me some money

1162
02:01:44,464 --> 02:01:48,635
to take toriko to the mainland
for an abortion.

1163
02:01:48,760 --> 02:01:53,431
Father will be so angry.
Tell me what I should do!

1164
02:01:54,557 --> 02:01:59,813
The gods have abandoned me.

1165
02:02:03,149 --> 02:02:05,735
I don't know anything anymore.

1166
02:02:05,860 --> 02:02:11,074
Must she have the abortion
for the sake of the island?

1167
02:02:12,408 --> 02:02:14,118
Auntie, tell me!

1168
02:02:15,286 --> 02:02:17,664
It's a terrible thing...

1169
02:02:21,918 --> 02:02:23,878
Where are we going?

1170
02:02:24,003 --> 02:02:26,631
A nice place. To the mainland.

1171
02:02:28,341 --> 02:02:30,677
To have fun.

1172
02:02:30,802 --> 02:02:35,723
There'll be cars, electricity
and pinball machines!

1173
02:02:36,683 --> 02:02:39,435
Where are we going, brother?

1174
02:02:42,856 --> 02:02:45,692
Don't worry. Just relax, all right?

1175
02:02:46,985 --> 02:02:48,403
Excuse me.

1176
02:03:00,874 --> 02:03:03,877
Let's go and play pinball!
Stay put, toriko!

1177
02:03:10,466 --> 02:03:13,177
The futoris are beasts after all.

1178
02:03:13,303 --> 02:03:16,222
It runs in the family.

1179
02:03:16,347 --> 02:03:18,057
How frightening.

1180
02:03:18,182 --> 02:03:21,352
I wonder what awful things
will happen.

1181
02:03:21,477 --> 02:03:24,981
Kurage island is cursed
because of the futoris.

1182
02:03:25,106 --> 02:03:28,985
It's rained but all the island's Wells
are still dry.

1183
02:03:29,110 --> 02:03:31,529
It's because of nekichi's pit.

1184
02:03:31,654 --> 02:03:34,324
The shrine well is almost dry, too.

1185
02:03:34,449 --> 02:03:38,202
Without water, we'll never get
a good price for our land.

1186
02:03:38,328 --> 02:03:42,290
Everyone says it's all because
of those beasts, the futoris.

1187
02:03:42,415 --> 02:03:45,668
Everyone says
it's because of nekichi's pit.

1188
02:03:56,304 --> 02:03:57,972
Jump! Jump!

1189
02:04:05,730 --> 02:04:07,398
Jump! Jump!

1190
02:04:09,442 --> 02:04:10,860
I'm scared!

1191
02:04:11,736 --> 02:04:13,279
I'm scared!

1192
02:04:16,074 --> 02:04:17,700
Jump! Jump!

1193
02:04:18,451 --> 02:04:19,869
I'm scared!

1194
02:04:21,204 --> 02:04:23,164
Jump! Jump!

1195
02:04:25,875 --> 02:04:29,128
Jump! Goddamn it, jump!

1196
02:04:30,380 --> 02:04:31,798
Brother!

1197
02:04:35,385 --> 02:04:41,933
The brother god
and the sister goddess

1198
02:04:42,058 --> 02:04:47,063
they were laughing and smiling

1199
02:04:49,649 --> 02:04:57,031
they were happy

1200
02:04:57,156 --> 02:05:02,245
living together

1201
02:05:04,747 --> 02:05:11,963
but a violent god

1202
02:05:12,088 --> 02:05:17,427
appeared before them

1203
02:05:18,928 --> 02:05:25,810
he forced them to part

1204
02:05:25,935 --> 02:05:30,857
forced them to part

1205
02:05:33,109 --> 02:05:39,991
the brother's tears

1206
02:05:40,116 --> 02:05:44,787
became clouds

1207
02:05:47,373 --> 02:05:54,464
and the sister's blood

1208
02:05:54,589 --> 02:06:00,470
became the earth

1209
02:06:01,637 --> 02:06:08,478
the clouds and the earth

1210
02:06:08,603 --> 02:06:13,191
existed in Harmony

1211
02:06:18,321 --> 02:06:22,408
Leave?
You're telling me to leave this pit?

1212
02:06:22,533 --> 02:06:25,036
Yes, I am, nekichi.

1213
02:06:25,161 --> 02:06:27,330
You've laboured long and hard,

1214
02:06:27,455 --> 02:06:30,750
but your work is now over,
you can leave this place.

1215
02:06:31,709 --> 02:06:36,422
This is public property, so normally
you wouldn't get anything,

1216
02:06:36,547 --> 02:06:41,427
but after all your hard work,
I'm ready to pay you.

1217
02:06:43,179 --> 02:06:47,141
The rock's going to fall
in less than 10 days.

1218
02:06:47,266 --> 02:06:50,103
Good work, you must be tired.

1219
02:06:50,228 --> 02:06:53,272
It's time to take the money
and take it easy.

1220
02:06:54,982 --> 02:06:58,778
And uma?
Will you give her back to me?

1221
02:07:01,030 --> 02:07:03,449
Not right away, no...

1222
02:07:03,574 --> 02:07:07,328
She still has her duty
as a noro to fulfil.

1223
02:07:09,705 --> 02:07:12,083
I've been digging for 20 years.

1224
02:07:13,167 --> 02:07:16,921
I kept digging for 20 years
so I could get uma back.

1225
02:07:17,046 --> 02:07:19,590
I did it because we were comrades...

1226
02:07:19,715 --> 02:07:23,177
I didn't order it, the gods did.

1227
02:07:23,302 --> 02:07:26,139
I just followed their orders.

1228
02:07:26,264 --> 02:07:29,851
So when did the gods
change their minds?

1229
02:07:29,976 --> 02:07:33,646
First they tell me to stay here
and now to leave?

1230
02:07:33,771 --> 02:07:35,356
Damn fool!

1231
02:07:35,481 --> 02:07:37,567
Aren't you afraid of the gods?

1232
02:07:42,989 --> 02:07:45,032
Do as you please.

1233
02:07:46,492 --> 02:07:48,494
I won't leave!

1234
02:07:50,538 --> 02:07:54,750
Until the rock falls
and I get uma back,

1235
02:07:54,876 --> 02:07:57,420
I'm not moving!

1236
02:07:59,297 --> 02:08:01,549
And I have to protect the shrine as well.

1237
02:08:01,674 --> 02:08:07,388
No need, we're moving the shrine
to the south woods.

1238
02:08:07,513 --> 02:08:10,141
We need this place for the airport.

1239
02:08:10,266 --> 02:08:12,643
- You're moving the shrine?
- Yes.

1240
02:08:12,768 --> 02:08:17,732
Straight after the dongama festival.
The noro have agreed.

1241
02:08:17,857 --> 02:08:21,194
- Even uma?
- Of course she agreed.

1242
02:08:22,778 --> 02:08:24,739
She'd never agree.

1243
02:08:24,864 --> 02:08:28,451
She wants to stop being a shaman
and come back.

1244
02:08:29,785 --> 02:08:33,873
Nekichi, uma's over 30 years old.

1245
02:08:33,998 --> 02:08:36,834
She's not a little girl anymore.

1246
02:08:36,959 --> 02:08:40,922
She hasn't changed,
she's still the same.

1247
02:08:41,047 --> 02:08:43,716
The island's changed, uma's changed.

1248
02:08:43,841 --> 02:08:45,635
She's not yours anymore.

1249
02:08:48,179 --> 02:08:49,722
She's not changed!

1250
02:08:50,681 --> 02:08:53,517
She wouldn't change for you!

1251
02:08:53,643 --> 02:08:55,228
Uma's my sister!

1252
02:08:55,353 --> 02:08:58,648
The gods know of your sins.

1253
02:08:58,773 --> 02:09:00,733
It's not the gods, it's you!

1254
02:09:00,858 --> 02:09:04,195
You accused uma and me,
but we were innocent!

1255
02:09:06,489 --> 02:09:11,327
But I gave in,
because we were comrades-in-arms.

1256
02:09:11,452 --> 02:09:16,374
That's why I don't want
to force you to leave.

1257
02:09:18,793 --> 02:09:20,419
Listen...

1258
02:09:20,544 --> 02:09:24,507
Everyone is happy to sell their land.

1259
02:09:24,632 --> 02:09:28,010
They'll get an unbelievable
amount of money.

1260
02:09:28,135 --> 02:09:31,264
Your stubbornness will spoil everything.

1261
02:09:31,389 --> 02:09:35,685
Reconsider for the sake
of the island and the others.

1262
02:09:35,810 --> 02:09:37,812
No! I refuse!

1263
02:09:37,937 --> 02:09:40,606
- Even with compensation?
- Of course.

1264
02:09:45,027 --> 02:09:46,821
Go home, comrade!

1265
02:09:47,905 --> 02:09:51,200
- And send the engineer back here!
- I refuse!

1266
02:09:51,325 --> 02:09:53,452
Toriko refuses to talk.

1267
02:09:54,370 --> 02:09:56,372
The engineer must be sad.

1268
02:09:57,623 --> 02:10:01,210
Things change.
Everything must change.

1269
02:10:01,335 --> 02:10:04,547
Ryugen! You're the sinner!

1270
02:10:08,175 --> 02:10:11,053
It's you who should fear the gods!

1271
02:10:12,096 --> 02:10:16,976
Twenty years ago, we were falsely
accused by the islanders.

1272
02:10:18,853 --> 02:10:23,357
Amongst them, only ryugen and unari
showed us any kindness.

1273
02:10:24,650 --> 02:10:26,360
But he's changed.

1274
02:10:27,987 --> 02:10:29,405
Uma...

1275
02:10:30,573 --> 02:10:32,908
Have you changed too?

1276
02:10:33,034 --> 02:10:35,995
No, I haven't changed!

1277
02:10:38,039 --> 02:10:41,250
But you're ryugen's...

1278
02:10:43,753 --> 02:10:45,171
Mistress.

1279
02:10:46,922 --> 02:10:50,718
I was only 15 then.
I couldn't do anything about it!

1280
02:10:50,843 --> 02:10:55,556
Ryugen must have realised
that you were a virgin.

1281
02:10:56,974 --> 02:11:00,978
We're man and wife
in our hearts.

1282
02:11:02,146 --> 02:11:04,774
Can we be so, in our hearts?

1283
02:11:04,899 --> 02:11:07,526
The gods know everything.

1284
02:11:14,116 --> 02:11:17,370
No, brother. We mustn't!

1285
02:11:32,301 --> 02:11:34,053
Brother!

1286
02:11:35,012 --> 02:11:36,430
Wait!

1287
02:11:52,196 --> 02:11:55,783
Stop! It won't be long now.

1288
02:12:12,758 --> 02:12:14,593
What are you doing?

1289
02:12:17,138 --> 02:12:19,056
Stop it!

1290
02:12:19,890 --> 02:12:22,768
Stop! Damn you!

1291
02:12:29,733 --> 02:12:32,736
You're filling up the hole, damn you!

1292
02:12:36,991 --> 02:12:38,951
Uma, run!

1293
02:12:41,370 --> 02:12:44,707
I'm digging for the gods' paddy field!

1294
02:12:44,832 --> 02:12:49,753
I'm doing this...
For everybody's sake!

1295
02:12:52,339 --> 02:12:54,925
Stop! Wait a minute!

1296
02:13:05,686 --> 02:13:09,482
Spare me! Forgive me!

1297
02:13:09,607 --> 02:13:12,026
Won't you forgive me?

1298
02:13:20,910 --> 02:13:25,581
Spare me and I won't see
uma anymore!

1299
02:13:26,332 --> 02:13:30,878
I won't take off my chains
and I'll pray to the gods!

1300
02:13:33,255 --> 02:13:35,591
I won't go to the sea!

1301
02:13:39,136 --> 02:13:41,847
I won't poach with gunpowder!

1302
02:13:41,972 --> 02:13:43,641
I won't do anything!

1303
02:13:44,600 --> 02:13:47,645
I'll do anything you say!

1304
02:13:49,063 --> 02:13:50,773
I beg you!

1305
02:13:51,357 --> 02:13:53,150
I beg you!

1306
02:13:53,275 --> 02:13:55,110
Forgive me!

1307
02:13:56,195 --> 02:13:58,822
Forgive me!

1308
02:14:05,621 --> 02:14:07,456
Thank you.

1309
02:14:09,750 --> 02:14:12,503
I understand you now.

1310
02:14:14,672 --> 02:14:19,009
I won't do anything bad any more!

1311
02:14:40,906 --> 02:14:43,867
Uma, give me a match.

1312
02:15:06,056 --> 02:15:07,474
Brother...

1313
02:15:18,736 --> 02:15:22,156
The rock's falling! Uma, run quick!

1314
02:15:45,846 --> 02:15:47,431
Brother!

1315
02:15:58,317 --> 02:16:00,486
Brother, where are you?

1316
02:16:02,404 --> 02:16:03,822
Father!

1317
02:16:05,407 --> 02:16:06,825
Brother!

1318
02:16:08,369 --> 02:16:10,204
Brother, are you all right?

1319
02:16:12,539 --> 02:16:14,166
Are you injured?

1320
02:16:14,291 --> 02:16:15,709
Father!

1321
02:16:30,349 --> 02:16:31,767
It fell...

1322
02:16:32,893 --> 02:16:34,645
Uma, it fell.

1323
02:16:36,105 --> 02:16:37,898
The rock fell!

1324
02:16:38,023 --> 02:16:42,736
Brother, the rock fell!
I'm so glad! I'm so happy!

1325
02:16:43,737 --> 02:16:46,824
It fell down!

1326
02:16:56,834 --> 02:16:59,044
Hurry, get on.

1327
02:17:04,758 --> 02:17:06,301
Father...

1328
02:17:06,427 --> 02:17:11,515
All the islanders are in trouble
because you won't sell this place.

1329
02:17:11,640 --> 02:17:14,435
Sell it for everybody's sake.

1330
02:17:14,560 --> 02:17:18,147
You'd get 250,000 yen for the field.

1331
02:17:18,272 --> 02:17:21,859
And you'd get land and a house
on the mainland.

1332
02:17:23,694 --> 02:17:28,073
A paltry sum. This field belongs
to the gods, I can't sell it.

1333
02:17:28,198 --> 02:17:32,327
- But father, everyone is...
- Bring that here.

1334
02:17:36,165 --> 02:17:38,167
The field is back,

1335
02:17:38,292 --> 02:17:40,961
and the futoris are back like before.

1336
02:17:41,086 --> 02:17:43,046
I wish grandpa was here to see it.

1337
02:17:43,172 --> 02:17:47,092
Auntie, mr ryu wants you back
right away.

1338
02:17:47,217 --> 02:17:48,802
Why?

1339
02:17:48,927 --> 02:17:51,680
For the dongama festival.
You're a noro!

1340
02:17:52,765 --> 02:17:55,559
I was abandoned by the gods.

1341
02:17:57,186 --> 02:17:58,812
I can't take part.

1342
02:18:00,606 --> 02:18:02,024
Toriko...

1343
02:18:04,943 --> 02:18:08,947
You have to take my place
as a noro.

1344
02:18:12,075 --> 02:18:14,369
The gods want you to.

1345
02:18:16,580 --> 02:18:19,208
Toriko, do you understand?

1346
02:18:22,836 --> 02:18:26,632
The boss of the company
wants me to go back.

1347
02:18:26,757 --> 02:18:31,136
I have to go back to Tokyo
on the next ship.

1348
02:18:32,971 --> 02:18:34,515
Tokyo?

1349
02:18:36,058 --> 02:18:40,437
I'll be back no matter what.
That's the truth!

1350
02:18:43,899 --> 02:18:45,692
Ow, that hurts!

1351
02:18:49,571 --> 02:18:52,950
Toriko... believe me.

1352
02:18:53,659 --> 02:18:55,619
I hate Tokyo.

1353
02:18:56,495 --> 02:19:00,332
I don't like my wife or her parents.

1354
02:19:04,044 --> 02:19:07,005
I love you more than anything!

1355
02:19:11,468 --> 02:19:14,763
So listen to what I have to say.

1356
02:19:18,100 --> 02:19:21,144
Toriko... what is it?

1357
02:19:30,946 --> 02:19:33,907
Watch out! It's still alive!

1358
02:19:34,032 --> 02:19:36,201
Wait, toriko!

1359
02:19:37,411 --> 02:19:40,914
- Let's go to west beach!
- All right, let's go.

1360
02:19:41,039 --> 02:19:43,584
Tomorrow! Let's go then!

1361
02:19:43,709 --> 02:19:47,170
- Tomorrow?
- Yes, before the ship leaves!

1362
02:19:47,296 --> 02:19:49,798
What? Futori got 250,000 yen?

1363
02:19:49,923 --> 02:19:54,344
Yes. I only got 150,000
for the same amount of land.

1364
02:19:54,469 --> 02:19:57,681
Of course, futori's special.

1365
02:19:57,806 --> 02:20:00,225
Because it's the gods' paddy field.

1366
02:20:00,350 --> 02:20:03,937
Fool! Uma is ryugen's mistress.

1367
02:20:04,062 --> 02:20:06,356
But nekichi hasn't sold it yet.

1368
02:20:06,481 --> 02:20:10,861
- The rock fell but he's still holding on.
- He wants to raise the price.

1369
02:20:11,820 --> 02:20:14,114
At night, uma works on ryugen.

1370
02:20:14,239 --> 02:20:16,366
Damn!

1371
02:20:16,491 --> 02:20:18,577
The rest of us work so hard.

1372
02:20:18,702 --> 02:20:21,330
We didn't even get
the rest of the advance.

1373
02:20:21,455 --> 02:20:25,083
Nekichi's the smart one.

1374
02:20:25,208 --> 02:20:26,710
We're all fools.

1375
02:20:26,835 --> 02:20:31,798
Shit! We should have buried him
in that pit.

1376
02:20:31,924 --> 02:20:33,926
Kill that beast!

1377
02:20:36,678 --> 02:20:41,642
Kame, from now on,
you pay for all our drinks!

1378
02:20:41,767 --> 02:20:42,851
Why?

1379
02:20:42,976 --> 02:20:45,520
How much were you paid
for being ryu's dog?

1380
02:20:46,521 --> 02:20:49,274
Father and son, both beasts!

1381
02:20:49,399 --> 02:20:51,568
- I'm not!
- You are!

1382
02:20:51,693 --> 02:20:57,240
- I'm in the dongama...
- It won't make you a human being.

1383
02:20:57,366 --> 02:21:00,786
It's just a superstitious festival
for the natives!

1384
02:21:02,955 --> 02:21:06,750
But you'll all take part, won't you?

1385
02:21:09,586 --> 02:21:12,130
We won't help ryugen anymore.

1386
02:21:12,255 --> 02:21:16,635
You won't catch any of our families
being his mistress!

1387
02:21:21,431 --> 02:21:25,602
But if you don't take part,
mr fumoto will give you a hard time.

1388
02:21:25,727 --> 02:21:29,481
- Who's fumoto?
- Just ryugen's shadow!

1389
02:21:29,606 --> 02:21:32,734
- Who's ryugen, anyway?
- Who cares!

1390
02:21:32,859 --> 02:21:35,988
The festival's just a fake
coming-of-age ceremony!

1391
02:21:36,113 --> 02:21:39,408
- We won't go!
- Never!

1392
02:21:39,533 --> 02:21:42,035
Fuck the dongama!

1393
02:21:47,499 --> 02:21:53,255
Master, please don't do this
to me any more. Spare me!

1394
02:21:53,380 --> 02:21:56,925
Only you know my true feelings.

1395
02:21:57,050 --> 02:21:58,677
Only you.

1396
02:21:59,761 --> 02:22:03,223
I can't take part
in the dongama festival.

1397
02:22:04,474 --> 02:22:06,476
I can hear the drums.

1398
02:22:08,562 --> 02:22:10,230
Make up your mind.

1399
02:22:10,981 --> 02:22:13,942
The dongama is our most
important festival.

1400
02:22:14,067 --> 02:22:15,819
A noro must attend.

1401
02:22:17,070 --> 02:22:22,284
What will we do without you?
Who will save our island from evil?

1402
02:22:22,409 --> 02:22:26,747
My prophecies don't come true
anymore. The rain...

1403
02:22:28,457 --> 02:22:31,418
How many times do I have to tell you?

1404
02:22:31,543 --> 02:22:35,005
Obey the gods
and your powers will return.

1405
02:22:36,673 --> 02:22:39,593
Let toriko... become the noro!

1406
02:22:39,718 --> 02:22:41,136
Idiot!

1407
02:22:48,060 --> 02:22:52,856
All this talk of a tourist industry
for a pathetic little island like this,

1408
02:22:54,900 --> 02:23:00,030
so the people become greedy
and doubts arise.

1409
02:23:00,906 --> 02:23:04,743
I understand the love the peasants
have for their land,

1410
02:23:04,868 --> 02:23:09,331
but we must introduce
a new system to kurage island.

1411
02:23:10,791 --> 02:23:14,795
We have to get rid of those
who oppose it as quickly as possible.

1412
02:23:17,047 --> 02:23:24,888
You know I only care about
the happiness of the islanders.

1413
02:23:29,184 --> 02:23:34,606
Uma, attend the festival
and receive the divine message.

1414
02:23:34,731 --> 02:23:38,819
Then tell everybody
that nekichi opposes it.

1415
02:23:41,154 --> 02:23:47,160
Tell them he's against tourism
and against mr higashi, uma!

1416
02:23:49,371 --> 02:23:51,498
I won't do that!

1417
02:23:51,623 --> 02:23:55,085
Spare me this! Please!

1418
02:24:02,634 --> 02:24:04,052
Engineer!

1419
02:24:04,845 --> 02:24:06,263
Kafiya!

1420
02:24:18,900 --> 02:24:20,485
Damn you...

1421
02:24:20,610 --> 02:24:22,612
Are you disobeying me?

1422
02:24:22,737 --> 02:24:25,031
Forgive me, master!

1423
02:24:25,157 --> 02:24:27,409
What did you do with nekichi?

1424
02:24:31,204 --> 02:24:33,748
Tell me, or I'll hit you like this!

1425
02:24:35,208 --> 02:24:37,502
Forgive me!

1426
02:24:37,627 --> 02:24:39,045
Never!

1427
02:24:40,172 --> 02:24:43,592
I won't give you up
to the likes of nekichi!

1428
02:24:51,224 --> 02:24:53,977
Never to the likes of him!

1429
02:24:54,936 --> 02:24:57,939
No matter what happens
to the rock or the pit...

1430
02:24:59,441 --> 02:25:01,193
You're mine!

1431
02:25:08,408 --> 02:25:09,951
Master...

1432
02:25:13,622 --> 02:25:15,040
Master!

1433
02:25:57,791 --> 02:26:01,920
You're here?
You said you wouldn't come.

1434
02:26:02,045 --> 02:26:03,922
You came, too.

1435
02:26:04,047 --> 02:26:07,509
My father cried when I said
I wouldn't attend.

1436
02:26:07,634 --> 02:26:09,636
Mine, too.

1437
02:26:09,761 --> 02:26:12,222
It's hard when old people cry.

1438
02:26:12,347 --> 02:26:15,558
The dongama is our most
important festival.

1439
02:26:15,684 --> 02:26:20,730
We'll never be able to introduce
any reforms like this.

1440
02:26:20,855 --> 02:26:26,611
But if we don't get along with others,
we can't live on kurage.

1441
02:26:26,736 --> 02:26:30,198
But it hurts getting clubbed
at dongama.

1442
02:26:31,116 --> 02:26:35,161
Do you or do you not believe
in the god dongama?

1443
02:26:37,414 --> 02:26:39,791
- I do!
- Really?

1444
02:26:41,001 --> 02:26:43,920
- It's true.
- Arms up!

1445
02:26:46,965 --> 02:26:49,718
All right! Bring the sake!

1446
02:26:58,101 --> 02:27:00,353
Don't choke! Drink it all!

1447
02:27:03,231 --> 02:27:05,025
Don't drop your arms!

1448
02:28:31,403 --> 02:28:34,531
Mr ryu, it's time for the oracle.

1449
02:28:36,032 --> 02:28:37,283
Mr ryu?

1450
02:28:40,620 --> 02:28:42,539
No ryu...

1451
02:28:42,664 --> 02:28:45,458
Not here? Since when?

1452
02:28:45,583 --> 02:28:48,253
Since we started, I think.

1453
02:28:48,378 --> 02:28:51,840
Not at all? Why?

1454
02:28:51,965 --> 02:28:53,508
I don't know.

1455
02:28:54,426 --> 02:28:55,927
Where's mr ryu?

1456
02:28:56,970 --> 02:28:59,556
Mr ryu? I don't know.

1457
02:29:20,160 --> 02:29:23,455
Do you know where uma's gone?

1458
02:29:23,580 --> 02:29:27,917
- His wife!
- Ryu's dead! He's been killed!

1459
02:29:28,042 --> 02:29:29,586
Who killed him?

1460
02:29:32,630 --> 02:29:36,301
He's chained... with shackles...

1461
02:29:37,552 --> 02:29:39,220
Nekichi...

1462
02:29:39,345 --> 02:29:41,639
- It's nekichi.
- It's nekichi!

1463
02:29:48,396 --> 02:29:49,731
The oil store!

1464
02:29:49,856 --> 02:29:52,192
- Who set fire to it?
- Who?

1465
02:29:52,984 --> 02:29:57,113
- It's nekichi! The beast!
- Find him!

1466
02:30:00,700 --> 02:30:02,494
Nekichi, come out!

1467
02:30:04,829 --> 02:30:07,123
Nekichi, come out!

1468
02:30:15,048 --> 02:30:17,342
He's run away.

1469
02:30:17,467 --> 02:30:18,885
Father...

1470
02:30:47,080 --> 02:30:49,165
Uma...

1471
02:30:49,290 --> 02:30:52,293
Do you think toriko's all right?

1472
02:30:52,418 --> 02:30:54,087
She's fine.

1473
02:30:54,212 --> 02:31:00,343
Once I've built a paddy field and house
on holy island, I'll go fetch her.

1474
02:31:00,468 --> 02:31:03,263
But that'll take at least three months.

1475
02:31:03,388 --> 02:31:06,349
Don't worry. Kametaro's there.

1476
02:31:06,474 --> 02:31:08,643
We can't count on kame!

1477
02:31:11,271 --> 02:31:14,107
I know he'll go to Tokyo.

1478
02:31:15,149 --> 02:31:17,527
Ryu's wife will look after her.

1479
02:31:19,320 --> 02:31:21,864
But toriko's half-witted.

1480
02:31:21,990 --> 02:31:25,493
Toriko's a noro. A true noro.

1481
02:31:27,537 --> 02:31:30,415
The gods will protect her.

1482
02:32:14,459 --> 02:32:16,419
What is it, uma?

1483
02:32:17,795 --> 02:32:19,505
Nothing, only...

1484
02:32:19,631 --> 02:32:22,008
Are you thinking about ryugen?

1485
02:32:23,968 --> 02:32:27,055
What will people say about us
not attending his funeral?

1486
02:32:27,180 --> 02:32:30,683
That's why we asked unari
to take care of things.

1487
02:32:32,435 --> 02:32:34,270
But...

1488
02:32:34,395 --> 02:32:38,107
It's already Autumn. We must hurry.

1489
02:32:39,317 --> 02:32:43,780
I told unari that I'd visit
ryugen's grave later.

1490
02:32:45,823 --> 02:32:49,869
When the dongama and the funeral
are over, it will be storm season.

1491
02:32:51,412 --> 02:32:55,041
That's why unari told us to go at once.

1492
02:32:56,751 --> 02:32:59,420
Uma, feed the chickens.

1493
02:34:02,024 --> 02:34:04,068
The engine's overheated.

1494
02:34:06,487 --> 02:34:08,740
I need to give it a rest for a while.

1495
02:34:21,753 --> 02:34:23,171
Eat.

1496
02:34:24,756 --> 02:34:26,966
You'll lose energy if you don't.

1497
02:34:28,050 --> 02:34:29,469
Brother!

1498
02:34:30,553 --> 02:34:32,972
I love you, brother!

1499
02:34:33,806 --> 02:34:39,061
We're alone. There's no one but us.
We're all alone!

1500
02:34:43,065 --> 02:34:45,276
We have much work to do, uma.

1501
02:34:46,319 --> 02:34:48,529
There's no one on holy island.

1502
02:34:48,654 --> 02:34:51,115
We'll work, just the two of us.

1503
02:34:51,240 --> 02:34:56,871
We'll farm the land, catch fish
and build up our farm stock.

1504
02:35:01,918 --> 02:35:06,088
Aren't we just like the gods?

1505
02:35:08,966 --> 02:35:11,844
We'll be the founders of holy island.

1506
02:35:12,720 --> 02:35:14,430
Won't we, uma?

1507
02:35:15,932 --> 02:35:19,602
We'll found a new island.

1508
02:35:22,063 --> 02:35:25,566
Brother! I love you more
than anybody else.

1509
02:35:26,859 --> 02:35:28,361
More than anyone else.

1510
02:35:40,373 --> 02:35:44,293
To the west. They must be
headed for holy island.

1511
02:35:44,418 --> 02:35:48,130
Kame, how long will his motor last?

1512
02:35:48,256 --> 02:35:49,799
Not very long.

1513
02:35:49,924 --> 02:35:53,302
- How long?
- Five or six hours.

1514
02:35:53,427 --> 02:35:56,013
All right. Pretty soon, then.

1515
02:36:24,000 --> 02:36:26,669
Uma, drink this.

1516
02:36:30,923 --> 02:36:34,510
Why not? Do you feel ill?

1517
02:36:36,345 --> 02:36:38,472
Are you seasick?

1518
02:36:38,598 --> 02:36:40,474
Cheer up!

1519
02:36:40,600 --> 02:36:44,562
We still have a long way to go.
You need to drink.

1520
02:37:06,042 --> 02:37:07,835
Kame, water!

1521
02:37:11,881 --> 02:37:13,299
Tsuchimochi...

1522
02:37:27,605 --> 02:37:31,734
I've found it! I see a red sail!

1523
02:37:52,171 --> 02:37:54,006
Damn it!

1524
02:38:44,306 --> 02:38:46,851
Who are you?

1525
02:38:48,019 --> 02:38:49,645
Is it fumoto?

1526
02:38:50,813 --> 02:38:53,691
Kametaro, brother!

1527
02:38:56,652 --> 02:39:00,156
Uma! What's all this about?

1528
02:39:02,950 --> 02:39:05,494
Maybe they're bringing toriko?

1529
02:39:14,045 --> 02:39:16,297
Sacred wine! Drink it!

1530
02:39:18,799 --> 02:39:20,551
Kame...

1531
02:39:20,676 --> 02:39:23,763
It's hard, but you've got to drink,
it's the rules!

1532
02:39:33,814 --> 02:39:35,816
Put on your masks!

1533
02:39:52,083 --> 02:39:53,876
Hey, who are you?

1534
02:40:01,634 --> 02:40:03,344
Uma's sick!

1535
02:40:05,012 --> 02:40:06,639
Take off your masks!

1536
02:40:07,598 --> 02:40:10,059
I know who you are anyway!

1537
02:40:12,186 --> 02:40:14,313
Don't be silly!

1538
02:40:14,438 --> 02:40:17,983
I know the helmsman's fumoto.
Take off your mask!

1539
02:40:19,777 --> 02:40:22,530
Is toriko there? Kame!

1540
02:40:23,864 --> 02:40:25,116
Kametaro!

1541
02:40:33,958 --> 02:40:37,628
Uma, what's going on?

1542
02:40:38,629 --> 02:40:42,883
You tell them! Don't they know
what happened?

1543
02:40:46,262 --> 02:40:49,098
Uma! Tell them!

1544
02:40:58,858 --> 02:41:01,026
We didn't do anything!

1545
02:41:01,819 --> 02:41:04,280
Ryugen died of natural causes!

1546
02:41:05,281 --> 02:41:07,449
We are innocent!

1547
02:41:08,742 --> 02:41:12,371
Ask unari, if you think I'm lying!

1548
02:41:12,496 --> 02:41:14,832
Unari knows everything!

1549
02:41:16,584 --> 02:41:20,462
Kame! If you're there, tell them!

1550
02:41:24,133 --> 02:41:26,385
Are you there, kame?

1551
02:41:26,510 --> 02:41:28,262
Kametaro!

1552
02:41:28,387 --> 02:41:30,931
Paddles up!

1553
02:41:35,436 --> 02:41:39,940
- Punish him!
- Brother!

1554
02:41:41,817 --> 02:41:43,235
Brother!

1555
02:41:48,782 --> 02:41:53,120
Why do they...? Uma, come to me.

1556
02:42:00,753 --> 02:42:03,547
- He's my father!
- Kame!

1557
02:42:22,358 --> 02:42:24,902
Brother!

1558
02:42:44,588 --> 02:42:48,759
Brother! Brother, I loved you!

1559
02:43:42,521 --> 02:43:45,316
Let's head back. Row!

1560
02:43:52,781 --> 02:43:54,533
Put on your masks!

1561
02:44:03,167 --> 02:44:04,918
Take your paddles!

1562
02:45:50,649 --> 02:45:57,573
Five years later

1563
02:46:12,463 --> 02:46:15,382
- Hello, it's been a long time!
- Long time no see.

1564
02:46:15,507 --> 02:46:17,426
I hope you're well.

1565
02:46:17,551 --> 02:46:20,679
This is mrs higashi, and this is my wife.

1566
02:46:20,804 --> 02:46:24,808
- Mr fumoto, the factory manager.
- Blessings upon you.

1567
02:46:27,269 --> 02:46:34,026
Once upon a time

1568
02:46:34,151 --> 02:46:38,697
a long, long time ago

1569
02:46:41,283 --> 02:46:48,165
a brother and a sister

1570
02:46:48,290 --> 02:46:53,545
a god and a goddess

1571
02:46:55,297 --> 02:47:02,429
they founded an island together

1572
02:47:02,554 --> 02:47:07,267
this is the story

1573
02:47:09,561 --> 02:47:17,194
how the island began

1574
02:47:17,319 --> 02:47:21,990
this is their tale

1575
02:47:24,493 --> 02:47:31,542
a red sail on a sabani boat...

1576
02:47:31,667 --> 02:47:34,920
Cold Coca-Cola!
Ice-cold Coca-Cola!

1577
02:47:35,045 --> 02:47:37,714
Should we give him money?

1578
02:47:37,839 --> 02:47:40,884
- How much is appropriate?
- Ten yen is enough.

1579
02:47:41,009 --> 02:47:43,845
What's the song about?
It's hard to understand.

1580
02:47:43,971 --> 02:47:47,933
It's an old song about our island,
a traditional song.

1581
02:47:48,058 --> 02:47:49,977
This way, please.

1582
02:47:53,313 --> 02:47:59,903
One day, the sabani,
all on its own...

1583
02:48:00,028 --> 02:48:01,947
What's a sabani?

1584
02:48:02,072 --> 02:48:06,285
It's a canoe.
They have motors attached now.

1585
02:48:06,410 --> 02:48:10,581
Even now, on evenings
with a west wind,

1586
02:48:10,706 --> 02:48:14,042
you can see the red sail
of the sabani of the gods.

1587
02:48:14,167 --> 02:48:16,878
- Really?
- No, no, it's an old story.

1588
02:48:17,004 --> 02:48:19,506
Not something you'd see
in modern times.

1589
02:48:19,631 --> 02:48:23,885
But I've seen it
and so have other islanders.

1590
02:48:24,886 --> 02:48:27,180
Dear oh dear...

1591
02:48:27,306 --> 02:48:29,474
Why did you come back?

1592
02:48:30,559 --> 02:48:33,395
You suddenly disappeared.
I was worried.

1593
02:48:33,520 --> 02:48:36,898
Sorry I left the position
you recommended me for.

1594
02:48:37,024 --> 02:48:40,068
Why? Didn't you like Tokyo?

1595
02:48:40,193 --> 02:48:41,945
No, it wasn't that...

1596
02:48:45,157 --> 02:48:50,078
You had a reputation at the factory
as a hard worker, for five years.

1597
02:48:50,203 --> 02:48:52,164
I'm sorry.

1598
02:48:52,289 --> 02:48:54,916
I heard there was work here

1599
02:48:55,042 --> 02:48:58,337
on the anniversary of my father's
and sister's death.

1600
02:49:00,047 --> 02:49:02,591
It's better for you to be back home, right?

1601
02:49:02,716 --> 02:49:04,509
No, it's not.

1602
02:49:05,469 --> 02:49:08,096
It pains me more to be here.

1603
02:49:10,098 --> 02:49:11,516
But...

1604
02:49:14,186 --> 02:49:16,897
In Tokyo I didn't feel like myself.

1605
02:49:18,357 --> 02:49:20,108
I was in pieces...

1606
02:49:21,985 --> 02:49:24,112
I was troubled there.

1607
02:49:28,033 --> 02:49:30,827
I wanted to reflect
on what my father had done,

1608
02:49:30,952 --> 02:49:33,538
what I've done,

1609
02:49:33,664 --> 02:49:35,707
and what you did...

1610
02:49:35,832 --> 02:49:37,709
I was in a difficult position.

1611
02:49:37,834 --> 02:49:41,213
No, I'm not trying to blame you,
mr engineer.

1612
02:49:43,882 --> 02:49:47,010
Why did you leave toriko to her fate?

1613
02:49:48,095 --> 02:49:52,391
Why did I kill my own father?

1614
02:49:53,934 --> 02:49:57,479
Was it really for the sake of the island?

1615
02:49:58,397 --> 02:50:01,692
I want to think it over,
here on the island.

1616
02:50:14,329 --> 02:50:17,207
Mother, look at that unusual rock!

1617
02:50:18,458 --> 02:50:25,132
They say it's a girl who turned to rock
while waiting for her lover.

1618
02:50:25,257 --> 02:50:27,384
What a romantic story!

1619
02:50:27,509 --> 02:50:32,681
It's called "toriko rock".
It really happened not so long ago.

1620
02:50:32,806 --> 02:50:35,016
- Really?
- Sure!

1621
02:50:36,226 --> 02:50:39,604
Mr kariya knows all about toriko.

1622
02:50:39,730 --> 02:50:41,565
Do you, darling?

1623
02:50:44,359 --> 02:50:47,028
The islanders aren't particularly clever,

1624
02:50:47,154 --> 02:50:51,575
so they get their stories and reality
all mixed up.

1625
02:50:51,700 --> 02:50:55,746
It just shows
how simple and pure they are.

1626
02:50:55,871 --> 02:50:58,832
Kurage island is steeped in emotion.

1627
02:51:28,320 --> 02:51:29,529
Toriko?

1628
02:52:47,732 --> 02:52:48,984
I'm sorry.
