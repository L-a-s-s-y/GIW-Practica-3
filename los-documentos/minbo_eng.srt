1
00:01:14,058 --> 00:01:14,820
Pardon me.

2
00:01:14,926 --> 00:01:15,950
What?

3
00:01:16,093 --> 00:01:19,551
The sign says persons with
tattoos can't use the pool.

4
00:01:24,735 --> 00:01:26,327
You can't go in.

5
00:01:26,437 --> 00:01:27,426
Fuck you!

6
00:01:29,073 --> 00:01:29,937
Piss off!

7
00:01:30,041 --> 00:01:32,532
Please follow the rules.

8
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:35,342
Tattooed guests can't use the pool.

9
00:01:35,446 --> 00:01:37,414
You should have told us earlier.

10
00:01:37,515 --> 00:01:40,416
Before we bought our
swimming trunks.

11
00:01:41,085 --> 00:01:42,609
Will you reimburse us?

12
00:01:45,323 --> 00:01:47,518
I'm from the Dragon Gang.

13
00:01:47,858 --> 00:01:50,326
You're embarrassing me in public.

14
00:01:51,696 --> 00:01:55,325
We ain't leaving until you apologize.

15
00:01:55,433 --> 00:01:56,991
You got that?

16
00:02:02,974 --> 00:02:04,771
It's beautiful.

17
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:09,574
I've never seen such a wonderful
'Lion with Peonies' before.

18
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,908
Who are you?

19
00:02:11,482 --> 00:02:13,746
Look to his 'Lion with Peonies'.

20
00:02:13,851 --> 00:02:14,579
No thanks.

21
00:02:14,685 --> 00:02:17,813
Go ahead. He won't bite you.

22
00:02:17,989 --> 00:02:19,320
Lions are the king of beasts.

23
00:02:19,423 --> 00:02:21,550
Peonies are the king of flowers.

24
00:02:21,659 --> 00:02:25,755
On him the king of beasts rests
with the king of flowers.

25
00:02:25,863 --> 00:02:26,352
Right?

26
00:02:26,464 --> 00:02:27,522
Right.

27
00:02:27,632 --> 00:02:30,032
You know a lot, madam.

28
00:02:30,401 --> 00:02:32,198
Are you one of us?

29
00:02:32,303 --> 00:02:33,668
Am I what?

30
00:02:34,672 --> 00:02:36,697
Quit busting my balls, punks.

31
00:02:36,807 --> 00:02:39,935
Don't give civilians a hard time.

32
00:02:40,044 --> 00:02:41,773
Or don't you know better?

33
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:44,439
You want to swim in a sewer?

34
00:02:44,548 --> 00:02:46,982
Then quit fucking with me.!

35
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:50,682
Aren't I good?

36
00:02:52,823 --> 00:02:55,348
Are you some boss's moll?

37
00:02:57,928 --> 00:03:01,364
A foreign VIP is here and
this place is full of cops.

38
00:03:01,465 --> 00:03:02,955
See them?

39
00:03:03,434 --> 00:03:05,834
They're detectives.

40
00:03:06,003 --> 00:03:08,096
If you're smart...

41
00:03:08,205 --> 00:03:09,968
You should go.

42
00:03:10,708 --> 00:03:12,175
We will. Thanks.

43
00:03:18,049 --> 00:03:18,879
Hey, you!

44
00:03:20,151 --> 00:03:21,618
Watch your livers.

45
00:03:22,553 --> 00:03:25,545
Tattoos are bad for them.

46
00:03:25,656 --> 00:03:27,681
Thanks for the advice.

47
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:38,097
Thank you so much. You're so brave.

48
00:03:39,103 --> 00:03:44,439
Are you really a boss's moll?

49
00:03:45,676 --> 00:03:46,904
Do I look it?

50
00:03:47,011 --> 00:03:49,206
You certainly do.

51
00:03:54,719 --> 00:03:57,279
This is who I am.

52
00:03:59,256 --> 00:04:02,191
Mahiru Inoue, Attorney at Law.

53
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:05,221
A lawyer...

54
00:04:05,796 --> 00:04:08,458
Yes. I specialize in 'Minbo'.

55
00:04:08,566 --> 00:04:09,828
What's Minbo?

56
00:04:10,267 --> 00:04:14,363
It's lawyers' jargon...

57
00:04:14,839 --> 00:04:17,933
For how yakuza skirt the law
to extort money.

58
00:04:18,809 --> 00:04:21,312
Call me if you need help.

59
00:04:21,312 --> 00:04:21,412
"MINBO OR THE GENTLE ART
OF JAPANESE EXTORTION"

60
00:04:21,412 --> 00:04:26,315
"MINBO OR THE GENTLE ART
OF JAPANESE EXTORTION"

61
00:05:47,965 --> 00:05:50,763
Good morning, Vice Minister.

62
00:05:50,868 --> 00:05:53,268
Go right in.

63
00:05:58,242 --> 00:05:59,106
Hi

64
00:05:59,677 --> 00:06:01,076
About the summit...

65
00:06:01,178 --> 00:06:01,940
Yes?

66
00:06:02,046 --> 00:06:04,844
The foreign Minister disqualified
your hotel.

67
00:06:04,949 --> 00:06:06,780
I did my best, but...

68
00:06:06,884 --> 00:06:08,613
But what?

69
00:06:08,719 --> 00:06:12,553
We spent millions on a new
'intelligent' convention center.

70
00:06:12,656 --> 00:06:14,146
$300 million.!

71
00:06:14,258 --> 00:06:17,193
Why can't we host the summit?

72
00:06:17,294 --> 00:06:18,124
Class.

73
00:06:18,229 --> 00:06:19,218
Class?

74
00:06:19,396 --> 00:06:21,921
You must host heads of state.

75
00:06:22,032 --> 00:06:23,727
We can't afford mistakes.

76
00:06:23,834 --> 00:06:26,029
Just look out there.

77
00:06:27,638 --> 00:06:30,368
The decision was that no hotel...

78
00:06:30,474 --> 00:06:33,034
which can't handle those people...

79
00:06:33,344 --> 00:06:35,312
can host a summit.

80
00:06:37,147 --> 00:06:41,584
We have a proud tradition! We must
get rid of the yakuza.

81
00:06:41,685 --> 00:06:43,778
The chairman ordered it.

82
00:06:44,154 --> 00:06:45,416
Reception Manager!

83
00:06:45,522 --> 00:06:46,318
Yes, sir.

84
00:06:46,423 --> 00:06:49,085
Form a team to evict the yakuza.

85
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:51,992
Whoever was in charge is fired!

86
00:06:52,229 --> 00:06:56,165
We're looking for a few good men.

87
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,631
The requirements are high.

88
00:07:00,237 --> 00:07:03,570
You must be brave...

89
00:07:03,941 --> 00:07:05,499
and diplomatic...

90
00:07:05,609 --> 00:07:06,803
and know the law.

91
00:07:06,911 --> 00:07:08,378
Have a quick mind...

92
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:09,912
and tenacity...

93
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,809
and decisiveness.

94
00:07:12,616 --> 00:07:14,607
So none of you qualify.

95
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:20,085
But if you do, you will have a key job.

96
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:22,590
If you are qualified, step forward.

97
00:07:25,663 --> 00:07:27,096
I'm impressed.

98
00:07:27,698 --> 00:07:30,189
Now, I will explain your duties.

99
00:07:30,301 --> 00:07:32,633
Your job will be...

100
00:07:33,437 --> 00:07:35,496
To get rid of the yakuza.

101
00:07:39,243 --> 00:07:40,676
What's wrong?

102
00:07:41,078 --> 00:07:44,844
Aren't you brave enough to protect
our hotel?

103
00:07:45,082 --> 00:07:46,879
Security Chief.

104
00:07:47,584 --> 00:07:49,677
You're the expert.

105
00:07:49,787 --> 00:07:51,152
Sorry, sir.

106
00:07:51,255 --> 00:07:54,452
If I were younger, I'd volunteer.

107
00:07:54,558 --> 00:07:58,221
But don't to want to get
hurt at my age.

108
00:07:58,329 --> 00:07:59,887
Forget it!

109
00:08:00,531 --> 00:08:02,328
Assistant Managers...

110
00:08:02,433 --> 00:08:04,799
It's your job anyway.

111
00:08:04,969 --> 00:08:06,834
I'm sorry, but I don't think...

112
00:08:06,937 --> 00:08:08,097
What?

113
00:08:08,205 --> 00:08:09,365
He's a newlywed.

114
00:08:09,473 --> 00:08:11,134
So what about you?

115
00:08:11,575 --> 00:08:14,806
I've got this home loan...

116
00:08:14,912 --> 00:08:17,881
I must talk to my wife first.

117
00:08:17,982 --> 00:08:18,914
Sir.

118
00:08:19,516 --> 00:08:21,643
I will volunteer.

119
00:08:21,752 --> 00:08:25,153
No.! You're too important.

120
00:08:25,255 --> 00:08:28,952
Prince Mutsu says you have
a million-dollar smile.

121
00:08:29,059 --> 00:08:30,083
You stay put.

122
00:08:30,194 --> 00:08:31,889
Excuse me.

123
00:08:31,996 --> 00:08:35,022
I'd be happy to volunteer.

124
00:08:35,132 --> 00:08:36,394
Oh, no.!

125
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:39,264
You know 2,000 customers by name.

126
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:40,234
And...

127
00:08:40,337 --> 00:08:42,567
Their social standing, cars...

128
00:08:42,673 --> 00:08:44,163
You're too valuable.

129
00:08:44,308 --> 00:08:46,902
You're the best doorman in Japan.

130
00:08:47,745 --> 00:08:49,940
That's not the way to recruit.

131
00:08:50,047 --> 00:08:52,675
It's tough.

132
00:08:53,317 --> 00:08:55,911
We can't transfer good people.

133
00:08:56,186 --> 00:08:58,916
We should hire professionals.

134
00:09:16,974 --> 00:09:19,408
Say, what's your name?

135
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:21,034
Wakasugi, sir.

136
00:09:21,345 --> 00:09:22,676
When did you start?

137
00:09:23,614 --> 00:09:25,047
Spring this year.

138
00:09:25,149 --> 00:09:27,242
You're good for a new employee.

139
00:09:28,018 --> 00:09:30,248
I once worked at a warehouse.

140
00:09:30,354 --> 00:09:31,286
Sports?

141
00:09:31,388 --> 00:09:32,184
Sorry...

142
00:09:32,289 --> 00:09:33,221
I wrestled Sumo.

143
00:09:33,323 --> 00:09:34,483
What were you best at?

144
00:09:34,591 --> 00:09:35,751
Pushing out.

145
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:38,824
Do you want to wrestle again?

146
00:09:38,929 --> 00:09:39,588
Sir?

147
00:09:39,696 --> 00:09:40,856
Push people out?

148
00:09:40,964 --> 00:09:41,726
What people?

149
00:09:41,832 --> 00:09:42,992
The yakuza.

150
00:09:45,836 --> 00:09:48,862
How much do we spend on yakuza?

151
00:09:48,972 --> 00:09:51,304
It varies each year.

152
00:09:51,408 --> 00:09:54,866
Usually around $300,000.

153
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:00,247
When the director had his
mistress problem...

154
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:03,114
It cost us $500,000.

155
00:10:05,255 --> 00:10:07,018
Say, Mr. Suzuki.

156
00:10:07,124 --> 00:10:10,719
Yes, sir... I'll be home at six, Mom.

157
00:10:11,061 --> 00:10:12,323
What's for dinner?

158
00:10:12,729 --> 00:10:14,026
Sushi?

159
00:10:14,364 --> 00:10:16,264
With eggs?

160
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:18,299
And sea eel, too?

161
00:10:18,535 --> 00:10:20,059
It sounds yummy.

162
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:21,296
Mr. Suzuki.!

163
00:10:21,872 --> 00:10:22,930
Got to go, Mom.

164
00:10:23,574 --> 00:10:24,666
Yes, sir.

165
00:10:24,808 --> 00:10:28,039
How do we handle yakuza expenses?

166
00:10:28,145 --> 00:10:29,305
What do you mean?

167
00:10:29,413 --> 00:10:31,472
As entertainment expenses?

168
00:10:31,582 --> 00:10:33,447
Of course not.

169
00:10:34,551 --> 00:10:38,112
That needs receipts. Yakuza
don't give receipts.

170
00:10:38,222 --> 00:10:40,156
So how do you enter them?

171
00:10:40,257 --> 00:10:40,916
Unaccountables.

172
00:10:41,024 --> 00:10:41,888
Not expenditures?

173
00:10:41,992 --> 00:10:43,391
That's right.

174
00:10:43,594 --> 00:10:45,755
Then we can't budget for it.

175
00:10:46,864 --> 00:10:50,732
When our people are threatened,
what do they do?

176
00:10:50,834 --> 00:10:52,096
About the money?

177
00:10:52,202 --> 00:10:54,727
They come here and beg.

178
00:10:55,372 --> 00:10:57,169
They shouldn't pay.

179
00:10:57,708 --> 00:10:59,903
The more we pay the more they want.

180
00:11:00,777 --> 00:11:03,302
But instead of refusing, they pay.

181
00:11:03,413 --> 00:11:06,246
Because it's not their own money.

182
00:11:06,483 --> 00:11:09,077
They just worry about themselves.

183
00:11:09,186 --> 00:11:11,746
And we clean up their messes.

184
00:11:12,055 --> 00:11:14,785
If they think like employees...

185
00:11:14,892 --> 00:11:16,883
we'll always be paying.

186
00:11:20,397 --> 00:11:21,159
Hey, Suzuki.

187
00:11:21,265 --> 00:11:21,731
Sir?

188
00:11:21,832 --> 00:11:22,491
You're it.

189
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:24,267
What?

190
00:11:24,368 --> 00:11:27,701
You're promoted to Yakuza Manager.

191
00:11:28,605 --> 00:11:31,870
But I'm just an accountant.

192
00:11:31,975 --> 00:11:33,840
They need me here.

193
00:11:33,944 --> 00:11:36,811
As a reward, you get a splendid title.

194
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:39,105
As my 'Special Aide'.

195
00:11:39,316 --> 00:11:42,251
Your mother will be so proud.

196
00:11:42,352 --> 00:11:43,910
You get an assistant.

197
00:11:44,021 --> 00:11:44,715
Who?

198
00:11:44,922 --> 00:11:48,085
Wakasugi, the bellboy.
He's a good man.

199
00:11:49,726 --> 00:11:51,250
And my budget?

200
00:11:51,562 --> 00:11:53,427
You said not to pay.

201
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:55,097
So, no budget.

202
00:12:14,117 --> 00:12:16,085
What do I know about yakuza?

203
00:12:16,253 --> 00:12:18,187
Well...

204
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:21,922
Let's ask a top yakuza.

205
00:12:22,426 --> 00:12:23,916
You know one?

206
00:12:24,027 --> 00:12:24,891
No.

207
00:12:24,995 --> 00:12:27,429
Then just shut up.!

208
00:12:28,498 --> 00:12:30,932
We could contact a politician.

209
00:12:31,034 --> 00:12:32,092
We can't.

210
00:12:32,369 --> 00:12:32,892
Why not?

211
00:12:33,003 --> 00:12:34,402
We have no budget.

212
00:12:39,843 --> 00:12:41,333
Some yakuza are causing
trouble in the lobby.

213
00:12:41,445 --> 00:12:44,437
Guests are complaining. Go stop it.

214
00:12:44,548 --> 00:12:45,674
Yes, sir.

215
00:12:45,983 --> 00:12:46,677
Right now.

216
00:12:46,783 --> 00:12:48,307
Right away, sir.

217
00:12:51,488 --> 00:12:52,978
You talk to them first.

218
00:12:53,090 --> 00:12:54,853
It's your job.

219
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:58,018
I'll let you do it for experience.

220
00:12:58,128 --> 00:12:59,561
No, thank you.

221
00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:01,022
Paper- scissors-stone?

222
00:13:01,231 --> 00:13:03,529
1 - 2 - 3...

223
00:13:03,934 --> 00:13:05,731
Once again.

224
00:13:06,603 --> 00:13:08,764
I a ways lose.

225
00:13:13,644 --> 00:13:14,201
What's wrong?

226
00:13:14,311 --> 00:13:14,936
I got to pee.

227
00:13:15,045 --> 00:13:15,875
Just hold it.

228
00:13:15,979 --> 00:13:18,004
Stress inflames my gall stone.

229
00:13:18,115 --> 00:13:19,013
You're kidding.

230
00:13:19,116 --> 00:13:21,050
It's true.

231
00:13:21,151 --> 00:13:23,483
Stress is the worst thing.

232
00:13:23,587 --> 00:13:24,519
Come on.

233
00:13:28,992 --> 00:13:30,926
You signed this fucking IOU?

234
00:13:31,028 --> 00:13:32,290
So now fucking pay.

235
00:13:32,429 --> 00:13:35,796
We want it today.

236
00:13:36,033 --> 00:13:37,193
Now, asshole!

237
00:13:41,038 --> 00:13:44,439
Shit, they're real yakuza.

238
00:13:44,708 --> 00:13:46,869
What do we do?

239
00:13:46,977 --> 00:13:48,774
You go first.

240
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:50,109
Please?

241
00:13:50,314 --> 00:13:50,712
What?

242
00:13:50,814 --> 00:13:52,509
Please. Please?

243
00:13:52,616 --> 00:13:54,550
For an ice-cream soda?

244
00:13:58,355 --> 00:13:59,117
With two scoops?

245
00:13:59,222 --> 00:14:00,280
OK, OK.

246
00:14:05,562 --> 00:14:07,553
Excuse me, sirs.

247
00:14:10,334 --> 00:14:12,268
I'm sorry to interrupt.

248
00:14:12,369 --> 00:14:15,600
Uh... um...

249
00:14:15,706 --> 00:14:19,836
Would you please talk more quietly.

250
00:14:22,512 --> 00:14:23,740
What?

251
00:14:24,214 --> 00:14:25,977
What did you say?

252
00:14:26,283 --> 00:14:27,443
Speak up, fucker.

253
00:14:27,551 --> 00:14:30,418
I, uh, I...

254
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:34,784
I only asked if you could
talk more quietly.

255
00:14:34,891 --> 00:14:39,487
Get lost. It's none of your business.

256
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:42,928
Don't order guests around.

257
00:14:43,033 --> 00:14:44,625
Motherfucker.

258
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:47,568
But other guests have complained.

259
00:14:47,671 --> 00:14:49,400
What other guests?

260
00:14:49,506 --> 00:14:50,564
Which ones?

261
00:14:52,142 --> 00:14:54,337
Bring them here!

262
00:14:54,444 --> 00:14:56,469
Have them complain to us.

263
00:14:57,614 --> 00:14:59,514
You hear me, idiot?

264
00:14:59,616 --> 00:15:00,878
I said go get them.!

265
00:15:00,984 --> 00:15:02,008
Bring them here!

266
00:15:02,119 --> 00:15:02,881
Now.!

267
00:15:02,986 --> 00:15:04,146
I'm not sure if...

268
00:15:04,254 --> 00:15:05,346
You can't?

269
00:15:05,455 --> 00:15:07,423
I'm sorry, I can't.

270
00:15:07,624 --> 00:15:09,421
You're sorry?

271
00:15:10,193 --> 00:15:13,822
If you are, get down your knees.

272
00:15:13,930 --> 00:15:15,659
And fucking apologize!

273
00:15:16,633 --> 00:15:17,998
You, too.!

274
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:25,869
We had a ca I that somebody
was causing trouble.

275
00:15:26,243 --> 00:15:27,505
Were you screaming?

276
00:15:27,611 --> 00:15:30,546
No, I wasn't hollering.

277
00:15:30,647 --> 00:15:31,807
Nonsense!

278
00:15:32,149 --> 00:15:33,810
He was just now!

279
00:15:34,084 --> 00:15:37,713
He's lying. He only stopped
when you arrived.

280
00:15:37,821 --> 00:15:39,083
Calm down.

281
00:15:39,189 --> 00:15:41,248
Tell me your story over here.

282
00:15:41,358 --> 00:15:44,691
Nobody can prove I was
causing trouble.

283
00:15:44,795 --> 00:15:46,592
Where's the evidence?

284
00:15:46,696 --> 00:15:49,790
You have a recording or something?

285
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:51,367
What were you doing?

286
00:15:51,468 --> 00:15:52,765
Educating them.

287
00:15:52,869 --> 00:15:53,893
Educating?

288
00:15:54,004 --> 00:15:54,834
Yeah.

289
00:15:54,938 --> 00:15:58,533
They don't know how to
treat their guests.

290
00:15:58,642 --> 00:16:03,045
So I was teaching them how to
treat guests correctly.

291
00:16:03,146 --> 00:16:06,206
You can't file a complaint.

292
00:16:06,316 --> 00:16:08,216
Were they violent?

293
00:16:08,318 --> 00:16:10,616
Well, no, they weren't but...

294
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,711
Then our hands are tied.

295
00:16:12,889 --> 00:16:18,259
The police can't interfere
in civil cases.

296
00:16:18,361 --> 00:16:19,487
What?

297
00:16:19,996 --> 00:16:22,829
But they threatened me.

298
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:26,000
Everybody heard them.

299
00:16:26,102 --> 00:16:28,002
Isn't that right?

300
00:16:28,672 --> 00:16:29,639
You heard.

301
00:16:31,875 --> 00:16:33,274
Didn't you?

302
00:16:34,478 --> 00:16:40,713
If you want to teach them, do it
quietly and don't bother anyone.

303
00:16:42,419 --> 00:16:46,913
If you need us again
we'll be right over.

304
00:16:47,224 --> 00:16:47,656
Good-by.

305
00:16:47,757 --> 00:16:49,384
But, officers...

306
00:16:55,732 --> 00:16:58,701
How dare you call the police?

307
00:16:59,169 --> 00:17:04,402
A guest tries to help educate you
and you call the police.

308
00:17:04,508 --> 00:17:06,840
Don't you respect your guests?

309
00:17:06,943 --> 00:17:08,171
Don't fuck with us.!

310
00:17:08,278 --> 00:17:09,836
Who called the cops?

311
00:17:09,946 --> 00:17:11,971
Let's settle this fair-and-square!

312
00:17:12,082 --> 00:17:13,743
Can we talk privately?

313
00:17:13,850 --> 00:17:16,216
What the fuck is this?

314
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:25,692
Thanks so much.

315
00:17:26,930 --> 00:17:31,367
You got some balls on you.

316
00:17:31,468 --> 00:17:36,201
I like you. So we'll leave
for today - for your sake.

317
00:17:36,306 --> 00:17:38,831
Call me if you ever need help.

318
00:17:39,643 --> 00:17:42,771
Excuse me.
Can I ask you one thing?

319
00:17:42,879 --> 00:17:49,375
Why do yakuza... I mean members
of your profession come here?

320
00:17:51,421 --> 00:17:56,222
Because we have a great
information network.

321
00:17:56,326 --> 00:17:59,124
Once we find a good hang-out...

322
00:17:59,229 --> 00:18:02,926
Our friends learn about it quickly.

323
00:18:03,567 --> 00:18:04,499
Oh...

324
00:18:04,701 --> 00:18:09,968
Look at it this way. It means you
are a well-loved hotel.

325
00:18:15,111 --> 00:18:17,511
A well-loved hotel!

326
00:18:31,127 --> 00:18:32,560
Hello, sir.

327
00:18:34,698 --> 00:18:36,598
How did you get rid of them?

328
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:38,565
I paid them 'taxi fare'.

329
00:18:38,668 --> 00:18:39,862
How much?

330
00:18:41,171 --> 00:18:42,195
$1,000.!

331
00:18:42,439 --> 00:18:44,339
I begged the accountants.

332
00:18:45,809 --> 00:18:46,935
Mr. Suzuki...

333
00:18:50,714 --> 00:18:53,478
You didn't handle that very well.

334
00:18:53,583 --> 00:18:56,313
Everyone in the lobby saw
what happened.

335
00:18:56,419 --> 00:18:58,910
It harmed our image.

336
00:18:59,089 --> 00:19:00,920
Be more tactful.

337
00:19:01,024 --> 00:19:02,218
You do it, then.

338
00:19:02,659 --> 00:19:05,526
What do you mean? It's your job.

339
00:19:05,629 --> 00:19:07,620
It's not a job I care for.

340
00:19:07,931 --> 00:19:10,900
We do it for the good of the hotel.

341
00:19:14,471 --> 00:19:15,529
Hello.

342
00:19:17,774 --> 00:19:19,605
Hold on, please.

343
00:19:21,444 --> 00:19:24,936
It's that yakuza. He wants
to talk to you.

344
00:19:33,356 --> 00:19:37,190
Hello. What can I do for you?

345
00:19:37,794 --> 00:19:39,523
Two double rooms?

346
00:19:39,629 --> 00:19:43,030
But I just gave you some money.

347
00:19:44,668 --> 00:19:47,432
All right. But no more education.

348
00:19:47,604 --> 00:19:49,504
And just this one time.

349
00:19:53,543 --> 00:19:56,137
Give them an inch...

350
00:20:08,191 --> 00:20:11,922
Let's have a look at that thing.

351
00:20:12,028 --> 00:20:12,960
Yes, Boss.

352
00:20:22,572 --> 00:20:23,903
You cooked it?

353
00:20:24,007 --> 00:20:28,774
Sure. For 5 minutes in boiling water.

354
00:20:28,878 --> 00:20:30,345
Take a bite of it.

355
00:20:31,081 --> 00:20:32,309
Bite this?

356
00:20:32,415 --> 00:20:35,248
Yeah. It will add some realism.

357
00:20:35,952 --> 00:20:37,044
Yes, Boss.

358
00:20:59,642 --> 00:21:01,940
Let's start this thing.

359
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:13,113
Anything wrong, sir?

360
00:21:13,890 --> 00:21:20,295
I don't know much about Italian food,
so I just wanted to ask you...

361
00:21:20,964 --> 00:21:24,559
about this unusual ingredient.

362
00:21:25,201 --> 00:21:27,726
Is this Italian seasoning?

363
00:21:27,837 --> 00:21:29,702
A cockroach.!

364
00:21:30,039 --> 00:21:32,906
What, a cockroach?

365
00:21:33,176 --> 00:21:36,168
I'm very sorry. I'll get a new serving.

366
00:21:36,279 --> 00:21:37,712
Wait a minute.

367
00:21:38,481 --> 00:21:42,440
You'll do a lot more than just
bring a new serving.

368
00:21:42,619 --> 00:21:45,747
I'm the manager.

369
00:21:45,855 --> 00:21:48,688
I was told you had a problem.

370
00:21:48,792 --> 00:21:50,259
I want to apologize.

371
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:54,990
There was a cockroach in
her lasagna.

372
00:21:55,498 --> 00:21:57,090
You must be mistaken.

373
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,430
The way we prepare our lasagna...

374
00:21:59,536 --> 00:22:02,369
that would be quite impossible.

375
00:22:02,472 --> 00:22:05,168
But there was one in my lasagna.!

376
00:22:05,275 --> 00:22:08,642
There was definitely a cockroach
in her food.

377
00:22:08,745 --> 00:22:10,576
And she bit into it.

378
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:12,648
So how can you say...

379
00:22:12,749 --> 00:22:17,846
That you think it is 'quite impossible'.

380
00:22:21,491 --> 00:22:23,322
You listening, asshole?

381
00:22:23,593 --> 00:22:24,423
I'm very sorry.

382
00:22:24,527 --> 00:22:25,824
Fuck you.

383
00:22:26,996 --> 00:22:28,520
You think you're too good for us?

384
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:32,393
You think you can insult us?

385
00:22:32,502 --> 00:22:33,730
You listening?

386
00:22:33,837 --> 00:22:37,204
I want to see the big boss.

387
00:22:37,373 --> 00:22:39,102
And have him apologize.!

388
00:22:39,209 --> 00:22:40,335
Got that?

389
00:22:40,443 --> 00:22:44,573
You start scrubbing your
kitchen right now.

390
00:22:44,848 --> 00:22:47,646
Or I'll go to the Health Bureau.

391
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:48,842
Say something.

392
00:22:48,952 --> 00:22:51,580
I don't want any half-ass apology.

393
00:22:51,688 --> 00:22:53,121
I'm terribly sorry...

394
00:22:53,223 --> 00:22:55,282
Our general manager is out.

395
00:22:55,391 --> 00:22:59,919
Can we see you tomorrow after
I discuss this with my superiors?

396
00:23:00,129 --> 00:23:04,532
All right. You can't make any
decision anyway, can you?

397
00:23:05,335 --> 00:23:06,768
I'll be waiting.

398
00:23:06,936 --> 00:23:10,531
Send somebody important by ten
in the morning.

399
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:11,766
To this address.

400
00:23:13,710 --> 00:23:17,771
I'm Ibagi of the Cobra Gang.

401
00:23:17,881 --> 00:23:18,813
Yes, sir.

402
00:23:19,148 --> 00:23:22,345
You'd better keep your promise.

403
00:23:55,018 --> 00:23:57,919
We're from the Hotel Europa.

404
00:24:16,572 --> 00:24:19,132
We're here to apologize.

405
00:24:20,043 --> 00:24:24,446
Please accept this humble present.

406
00:24:25,982 --> 00:24:29,110
And this $ 500 as a token
of our regret.

407
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:34,982
According to our regulations,
this is the proper amount.

408
00:24:38,127 --> 00:24:39,526
Give me a break!

409
00:24:39,896 --> 00:24:41,488
I apologize! Please.!

410
00:25:03,353 --> 00:25:07,517
One of my boys fucked up
and has to be punished.

411
00:25:08,391 --> 00:25:12,794
We never do a half-ass job of
punishing our mistakes.

412
00:25:13,696 --> 00:25:15,926
We are very thorough.

413
00:25:17,033 --> 00:25:20,833
Wait in the car and keep the
engine running to...

414
00:25:21,070 --> 00:25:22,537
rush him to a doctor.

415
00:25:22,638 --> 00:25:23,434
Yes, Boss.

416
00:25:27,810 --> 00:25:29,778
Say, Mr. Suzuki.

417
00:25:30,213 --> 00:25:34,673
I'm Ibagi of the Cobra Gang,
not some beggar.

418
00:25:35,752 --> 00:25:38,880
As a good customer of your money.

419
00:25:38,988 --> 00:25:41,980
I just want you to be more careful.

420
00:25:42,091 --> 00:25:44,218
I don't want your money.

421
00:25:45,028 --> 00:25:49,192
So how should we show
our sincere regret?

422
00:25:49,298 --> 00:25:50,287
Well...

423
00:25:50,867 --> 00:25:54,394
Admit your error in full-page
newspaper ads.

424
00:25:54,504 --> 00:25:59,305
Then close your restaurant for
a sanitation check.

425
00:25:59,409 --> 00:26:00,637
We can't do that.

426
00:26:17,627 --> 00:26:20,061
I had him cut his finger off.

427
00:26:20,163 --> 00:26:21,187
Right.

428
00:26:27,203 --> 00:26:29,034
Listen, Mr. Suzuki.

429
00:26:29,605 --> 00:26:35,168
One of us makes a mistake,
he loses a finger.

430
00:26:37,947 --> 00:26:40,074
You know how you do it?

431
00:26:40,783 --> 00:26:45,186
First you buy a sharp meat cleaver.

432
00:26:45,288 --> 00:26:49,918
Then you wind a string around your
little finger...

433
00:26:50,026 --> 00:26:51,960
and tie it very tightly.

434
00:26:52,061 --> 00:26:55,827
When your finger turns white
and numb...

435
00:26:55,932 --> 00:27:03,600
You place your hand on the table,
under the knife.

436
00:27:03,773 --> 00:27:08,870
Your palm can be either up or down.

437
00:27:08,978 --> 00:27:12,243
Most believe it's easier with
the palm up.

438
00:27:12,682 --> 00:27:16,948
Hold the knife like this, and
take a deep breath...

439
00:27:17,053 --> 00:27:19,283
Please stop. Please!

440
00:27:20,656 --> 00:27:22,055
I tell you what.

441
00:27:22,925 --> 00:27:28,022
Since you came all this way,
just write me a simple apology.

442
00:27:28,397 --> 00:27:30,331
That will satisfy me.

443
00:27:30,933 --> 00:27:34,869
I'll forget the whole thing.

444
00:27:35,071 --> 00:27:36,197
Yes...

445
00:27:46,082 --> 00:27:47,276
That's the Health Bureau.

446
00:27:50,319 --> 00:27:51,479
Damn bureaucrats.

447
00:27:51,654 --> 00:27:54,214
Your bureau sucks.

448
00:27:54,323 --> 00:27:58,487
Why do you let the Hotel Europa
serve cockroaches?

449
00:27:58,761 --> 00:28:01,628
You're guilty of gross negligence.

450
00:28:01,731 --> 00:28:03,562
Do you have proof?

451
00:28:03,933 --> 00:28:07,300
Just a written apology
signed by the...

452
00:28:07,403 --> 00:28:09,268
General Manager's Special Aide.

453
00:28:09,372 --> 00:28:13,809
He admits their food is infested
with roaches.

454
00:28:13,910 --> 00:28:15,969
What will you do?

455
00:28:16,078 --> 00:28:17,602
We'll, we...

456
00:28:17,713 --> 00:28:20,876
If food poisoning develops...

457
00:28:20,983 --> 00:28:22,678
You'll be liable.

458
00:28:22,785 --> 00:28:24,047
You got that?

459
00:28:24,387 --> 00:28:26,685
Say something.

460
00:28:26,789 --> 00:28:31,624
I'm not leaving until this is settled.

461
00:28:31,794 --> 00:28:33,523
Get some food.

462
00:28:34,363 --> 00:28:35,990
I'm staying all right.

463
00:28:39,602 --> 00:28:40,967
Come on!

464
00:28:41,537 --> 00:28:42,936
Say something!

465
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:45,737
Don't underestimate us.

466
00:28:46,542 --> 00:28:51,479
I can get a bureaucrat fired
anytime I want.

467
00:28:54,016 --> 00:28:55,779
Say something!

468
00:28:57,587 --> 00:29:00,613
I am terribly sorry, sir.

469
00:29:00,790 --> 00:29:03,554
What's wrong with your hotel?

470
00:29:03,793 --> 00:29:06,990
Can't you solve your own problems?

471
00:29:07,363 --> 00:29:12,995
Make sure they don't come back
to my office.

472
00:29:13,102 --> 00:29:14,831
Absolutely, sir.

473
00:29:15,071 --> 00:29:19,940
I'll personally insure they don't
bother you again, so could...

474
00:29:20,743 --> 00:29:22,301
Yes, yes...

475
00:29:23,512 --> 00:29:24,274
Yes...

476
00:29:25,815 --> 00:29:27,339
Good-by, sir.

477
00:29:28,751 --> 00:29:29,843
You idiot!

478
00:29:30,653 --> 00:29:32,450
The Bureau is furious.

479
00:29:32,555 --> 00:29:34,182
We must do something.

480
00:29:34,290 --> 00:29:36,656
Then pay them their blackmail.

481
00:29:36,759 --> 00:29:38,488
We can't involve the Bureau.

482
00:29:38,995 --> 00:29:42,761
They hushed up a real food
poisoning case once.

483
00:29:42,865 --> 00:29:44,423
So no more mistakes.

484
00:29:44,533 --> 00:29:45,022
But...

485
00:29:45,134 --> 00:29:46,829
It's all your fault.

486
00:29:46,936 --> 00:29:50,030
You wrote that stupid
letter of apology.

487
00:29:50,139 --> 00:29:50,605
But...

488
00:29:50,706 --> 00:29:53,573
Do something!
That's what you're paid for.!

489
00:29:58,114 --> 00:30:00,048
Hey, Mr. Suzuki.!

490
00:30:00,716 --> 00:30:02,650
Thanks for the rooms.

491
00:30:03,819 --> 00:30:04,751
Hello.

492
00:30:05,087 --> 00:30:07,885
You don't look good. What's wrong?

493
00:30:07,990 --> 00:30:09,787
Nothing.

494
00:30:09,892 --> 00:30:15,057
I hear you got problems.
The Cobra Gang has...

495
00:30:15,231 --> 00:30:20,533
some posters saying bad things
about your hotel.

496
00:30:20,636 --> 00:30:23,070
I'm worried about you.

497
00:30:23,172 --> 00:30:24,230
What will they do?

498
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:26,672
Paste them up all over.

499
00:30:26,776 --> 00:30:29,040
Send them to the media.

500
00:30:29,145 --> 00:30:30,578
Can we stop them?

501
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:33,080
Let's see...

502
00:30:33,416 --> 00:30:37,147
If you like I could talk to them.

503
00:30:37,253 --> 00:30:38,515
Would you really?

504
00:30:38,988 --> 00:30:45,917
Seeing you so miserable makes
me want to help.

505
00:30:46,329 --> 00:30:50,026
But I need $ 20,000 for expenses.

506
00:30:50,333 --> 00:30:51,265
Of course.

507
00:30:51,367 --> 00:30:53,665
I'll get it right away.

508
00:30:54,637 --> 00:30:56,468
Bring me Suzuki!

509
00:30:57,139 --> 00:30:59,869
The goddamn Special Aide.

510
00:30:59,975 --> 00:31:01,135
Right now!

511
00:31:01,877 --> 00:31:03,606
I'll go find him.

512
00:31:25,201 --> 00:31:28,432
The accountants said you'd be here.

513
00:31:37,813 --> 00:31:40,043
It's nice and quiet.

514
00:31:40,883 --> 00:31:43,181
They say it's your hideout.

515
00:31:50,292 --> 00:31:51,816
Ibagi is here.

516
00:31:52,061 --> 00:31:54,029
He's demanding to see you.

517
00:31:54,397 --> 00:31:55,728
I'm not going.

518
00:31:56,832 --> 00:31:58,959
Why do I have to do this?

519
00:31:59,402 --> 00:32:01,836
I'm not trained to deal with yakuza.

520
00:32:02,037 --> 00:32:05,131
Come on, Mr. Suzuki. Somebody
has to deal with them.

521
00:32:05,241 --> 00:32:07,232
But why me?

522
00:32:07,343 --> 00:32:07,968
I'm sorry.

523
00:32:08,077 --> 00:32:09,669
I'm from a good family.

524
00:32:09,779 --> 00:32:10,677
An only child.

525
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:12,805
My parents never yelled at me.

526
00:32:13,315 --> 00:32:15,283
So why should the yakuza?

527
00:32:21,624 --> 00:32:25,754
Sorry. I shouldn't take it out on you.

528
00:32:28,697 --> 00:32:32,531
I'd better find out how
'well-loved' I am.

529
00:32:36,839 --> 00:32:38,704
You hired a yakuza?

530
00:32:38,808 --> 00:32:40,173
Fucking fool!

531
00:32:40,276 --> 00:32:43,404
Some punk threatened me
to drop this matter.

532
00:32:43,512 --> 00:32:44,570
Asshole!

533
00:32:44,713 --> 00:32:48,581
You trying to set us against
each other?

534
00:32:48,984 --> 00:32:54,547
That could cause a war. Will you
take responsibility for a war?

535
00:32:54,657 --> 00:32:55,885
You fucking idiot!

536
00:32:55,991 --> 00:32:57,618
But I just asked him...

537
00:32:57,726 --> 00:32:58,886
Shut up!

538
00:32:59,261 --> 00:33:00,558
I can't stand it.

539
00:33:00,930 --> 00:33:03,660
I'm proud and you insulted me.

540
00:33:03,833 --> 00:33:05,528
You owe me.!

541
00:33:05,768 --> 00:33:06,928
You listening?

542
00:33:07,036 --> 00:33:07,525
But...

543
00:33:07,636 --> 00:33:12,403
I'm going to file a damage suit
against your hotel!

544
00:33:12,875 --> 00:33:14,308
And tell the press.

545
00:33:14,410 --> 00:33:17,743
The Tourist Bureau will
revoke your license!

546
00:33:18,514 --> 00:33:19,708
You want that?

547
00:33:21,584 --> 00:33:23,074
Should I do that?

548
00:33:23,185 --> 00:33:24,516
Fucking answer him!

549
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:27,180
I apologize for my mistake.

550
00:33:27,289 --> 00:33:29,416
So don't call the Bureau.

551
00:33:30,626 --> 00:33:31,718
All right.

552
00:33:32,695 --> 00:33:37,723
But then you got to show me your
hotel is sincerely sorry.

553
00:33:39,001 --> 00:33:40,025
Yes, sir.

554
00:33:54,283 --> 00:33:55,409
What's wrong?

555
00:33:57,086 --> 00:33:58,075
Look.!

556
00:33:59,889 --> 00:34:01,356
Bloody piss.

557
00:34:02,691 --> 00:34:03,919
It's the stress.

558
00:34:04,226 --> 00:34:07,252
The General Manager wants
a word with you.

559
00:34:07,363 --> 00:34:08,990
Sir, look.

560
00:34:10,833 --> 00:34:11,822
Yours?

561
00:34:12,101 --> 00:34:13,329
It's Mr. Suzuki's.

562
00:34:14,303 --> 00:34:15,895
What have you been up to?

563
00:34:16,238 --> 00:34:20,436
Hours after I appointed you,
we had to pay $1,000.

564
00:34:20,543 --> 00:34:22,033
$ 500 for a roach and then $ 20,000...

565
00:34:22,144 --> 00:34:24,908
And now $ 50,000 to Ibagi.

566
00:34:25,014 --> 00:34:27,073
What is wrong with you?

567
00:34:27,182 --> 00:34:31,141
But you ordered me to solve
it at any cost.

568
00:34:31,253 --> 00:34:34,279
I never said to pay that much.

569
00:34:41,430 --> 00:34:44,524
I didn't pay because I wanted to.

570
00:34:45,634 --> 00:34:48,228
I had to. To save this hotel!

571
00:34:49,572 --> 00:34:52,370
Why should we two take all the shit?

572
00:34:52,875 --> 00:34:54,240
They threaten you?

573
00:34:54,343 --> 00:34:54,866
No.

574
00:34:54,977 --> 00:34:57,537
Then you don't know how bad it is!

575
00:34:57,646 --> 00:35:01,980
You dump your shit on us and then
you bitch about the fucking cost.

576
00:35:02,885 --> 00:35:04,614
You fucking appointed us...

577
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:07,314
To evade your own fucking problems.

578
00:35:07,489 --> 00:35:11,755
Stop, Mr. Suzuki! You're sounding
like them now.

579
00:35:13,596 --> 00:35:14,688
I'm sorry.

580
00:35:16,165 --> 00:35:18,292
All I think about now is yakuza.

581
00:35:19,468 --> 00:35:22,733
Sir, I don't mean to tell you
what to do.

582
00:35:22,905 --> 00:35:28,468
Can't we just consider this
an expensive lesson?

583
00:35:29,311 --> 00:35:33,077
I'm sure they've learned a lot
in the last few days.

584
00:35:33,582 --> 00:35:37,348
Let's face it, we did give
them a dirty job.

585
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:42,118
All of us at reception should
have helped.

586
00:35:42,391 --> 00:35:45,383
Please give them a break.

587
00:35:45,494 --> 00:35:49,658
If you say so. I'll give them
one more chance.

588
00:35:50,299 --> 00:35:53,894
But I'm giving you some
professional help.

589
00:35:54,003 --> 00:35:57,097
Do exactly as you are told.

590
00:35:57,206 --> 00:36:02,269
Study hard and learn the tricks.

591
00:36:02,378 --> 00:36:04,005
Don't pay another cent.

592
00:36:12,021 --> 00:36:14,717
Why didn't he hire a pro earlier?

593
00:36:15,224 --> 00:36:17,283
Instead of appointing us.

594
00:36:17,393 --> 00:36:22,490
He was only giving us
a chance to develop.

595
00:36:23,399 --> 00:36:25,890
The pro might be worse than yakuza.

596
00:36:26,435 --> 00:36:28,903
I'll bet he's some drill-sergeant type.

597
00:36:32,241 --> 00:36:33,333
Who's there?

598
00:36:53,929 --> 00:36:55,863
Are you Suzuki and Wakasugi?

599
00:36:55,964 --> 00:36:57,693
You look pretty bad.

600
00:36:58,734 --> 00:37:01,294
I'm Mahiru Inoue, Attorney at Law.

601
00:37:01,403 --> 00:37:03,564
I'm your new baby-sitter.

602
00:37:06,341 --> 00:37:07,069
What's wrong?

603
00:37:08,277 --> 00:37:11,610
You're a woman!

604
00:37:11,947 --> 00:37:12,606
I certainly am.

605
00:37:12,915 --> 00:37:13,973
Women can't handle yakuza.

606
00:37:14,416 --> 00:37:16,384
I can. Minbo is my specialty.

607
00:37:17,219 --> 00:37:18,015
Minbo?

608
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:19,109
What is it?

609
00:37:19,221 --> 00:37:23,419
When yakuza get involved in
civil conflicts...

610
00:37:23,525 --> 00:37:26,494
and use fear to extort money.

611
00:37:26,595 --> 00:37:29,063
There's a long legal term.

612
00:37:29,164 --> 00:37:31,291
But we call it 'Minbo' for short.

613
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:35,803
It feels good here.

614
00:37:36,872 --> 00:37:38,237
I'm so tired...

615
00:37:38,741 --> 00:37:41,801
from evicting yakuza from a condo.

616
00:37:54,123 --> 00:37:57,092
Here's your first lesson.

617
00:37:57,359 --> 00:37:58,519
What is it?

618
00:38:01,163 --> 00:38:02,824
Don't fear the yakuza.

619
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:05,362
Impossible.

620
00:38:05,467 --> 00:38:07,867
We have reason to be afraid.

621
00:38:07,970 --> 00:38:10,734
I can see that...

622
00:38:10,839 --> 00:38:12,830
because you're good-natured.

623
00:38:12,941 --> 00:38:14,169
But bad-looking.

624
00:38:14,409 --> 00:38:15,706
You're bad-mouthed.

625
00:38:15,811 --> 00:38:18,177
But I'm good looking.

626
00:38:21,083 --> 00:38:23,176
Pretend he's making a scene.

627
00:38:23,552 --> 00:38:25,713
Stop him, Mr. Suzuki.

628
00:38:30,692 --> 00:38:32,250
May I start?

629
00:38:32,361 --> 00:38:34,625
Who the fuck are you?

630
00:38:34,930 --> 00:38:36,363
What the fuck you want?

631
00:38:39,268 --> 00:38:42,863
Excuse me, but you're bothering
our other guests.

632
00:38:42,971 --> 00:38:44,438
Please be quiet.

633
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:45,768
What the fuck?

634
00:38:45,874 --> 00:38:48,035
Don't tell guests to shut up.

635
00:38:48,143 --> 00:38:50,202
I'm... I'm not saying shut up.

636
00:38:50,312 --> 00:38:53,008
I'm... it's just that...

637
00:38:53,115 --> 00:38:55,174
Don't hurry.

638
00:38:55,284 --> 00:38:57,115
Just talk naturally.

639
00:38:59,354 --> 00:39:02,619
I'm not telling you to be quiet.

640
00:39:02,724 --> 00:39:05,386
For the sake of our other guests...

641
00:39:05,494 --> 00:39:08,292
Please just lower your voice.

642
00:39:08,397 --> 00:39:09,364
What?

643
00:39:09,464 --> 00:39:11,728
Who's being bothered?

644
00:39:11,834 --> 00:39:12,596
Bring him here!

645
00:39:12,701 --> 00:39:14,430
Don't be intimidated.

646
00:39:15,571 --> 00:39:19,632
Your behavior would bother anyone.

647
00:39:19,741 --> 00:39:20,901
Keep going.

648
00:39:21,009 --> 00:39:23,443
Don't insult me, asshole!

649
00:39:24,112 --> 00:39:25,545
What's your name?

650
00:39:25,981 --> 00:39:27,642
Get me your boss.

651
00:39:28,083 --> 00:39:28,640
He is...

652
00:39:28,750 --> 00:39:30,183
Can't you hear?

653
00:39:30,285 --> 00:39:32,310
I want your boss.

654
00:39:33,355 --> 00:39:36,882
He is in a meeting, so please
talk to me.

655
00:39:36,992 --> 00:39:38,425
Just a minute.

656
00:39:38,527 --> 00:39:41,655
That's one of their usual tricks.

657
00:39:41,763 --> 00:39:43,628
Don't be intimidated.

658
00:39:43,732 --> 00:39:45,393
If you get nervous...

659
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:48,492
They just press harder.

660
00:39:48,604 --> 00:39:51,072
Fuck his meeting.

661
00:39:51,573 --> 00:39:53,837
Do you know who I am?

662
00:39:54,209 --> 00:39:57,303
You know what I'll do if you
don't get him?

663
00:39:57,613 --> 00:39:58,705
Don't weaken.

664
00:40:00,249 --> 00:40:02,547
Are you going to get him?

665
00:40:03,085 --> 00:40:05,110
There's no reason to.

666
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:06,244
'Implied Violence'.

667
00:40:06,355 --> 00:40:08,755
Your shouting implies violence.

668
00:40:09,057 --> 00:40:12,686
You're talking big for a little guy.!

669
00:40:12,995 --> 00:40:14,929
You want to get hurt?

670
00:40:15,197 --> 00:40:16,960
I'll crush your skull.

671
00:40:17,065 --> 00:40:19,329
All right, that's enough!

672
00:40:20,469 --> 00:40:21,800
That's it.

673
00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:23,364
Do you understand?

674
00:40:23,805 --> 00:40:26,535
'I'll crush your skull' is
a criminal threat.

675
00:40:27,609 --> 00:40:28,974
It is?

676
00:40:29,878 --> 00:40:34,042
Be glad if they threaten you
or use violence.

677
00:40:34,149 --> 00:40:36,549
Because then the police can act.

678
00:40:36,885 --> 00:40:38,045
I see.

679
00:40:38,153 --> 00:40:39,518
This is hard work.

680
00:40:41,056 --> 00:40:45,186
It's none of my business but...

681
00:40:45,694 --> 00:40:48,959
If your colleagues knew you were
helping us...

682
00:40:49,064 --> 00:40:51,032
Wouldn't you be in trouble?

683
00:40:51,133 --> 00:40:52,361
My colleagues?

684
00:40:52,901 --> 00:40:53,890
Huh?

685
00:41:02,277 --> 00:41:06,236
What are you thinking, you fool?

686
00:41:06,348 --> 00:41:09,715
This is Police Detective Akechi.

687
00:41:10,385 --> 00:41:12,478
Nice meeting you.

688
00:41:17,192 --> 00:41:19,683
From now on, meet yakuza here.

689
00:41:20,128 --> 00:41:23,529
This will be called the 'VIP Room'.

690
00:41:24,433 --> 00:41:28,267
In here, you must act like
real executives.

691
00:41:28,437 --> 00:41:31,702
Yakuza are vain. Treat them politely.

692
00:41:34,509 --> 00:41:35,669
Hi

693
00:41:38,513 --> 00:41:40,310
Hello.

694
00:41:51,693 --> 00:41:53,490
Hide a camera there.

695
00:41:54,663 --> 00:41:56,563
And one behind that tree.

696
00:41:59,267 --> 00:42:03,169
Place another camera here
right in the open.

697
00:42:04,006 --> 00:42:06,236
Replace that glass-topped table.

698
00:42:06,341 --> 00:42:08,707
Remove this crystal ashtray.

699
00:42:09,878 --> 00:42:13,644
That could even crush Suzuki's skull.

700
00:42:16,718 --> 00:42:17,776
Hi

701
00:42:20,422 --> 00:42:23,858
Monitors will let us watch
what's happening.

702
00:42:23,959 --> 00:42:27,895
If the police come,
let them in this way, and...

703
00:42:30,599 --> 00:42:32,226
Have them wait here.

704
00:42:33,168 --> 00:42:37,468
From now, this is out turf.

705
00:42:38,140 --> 00:42:41,906
Always meet yakuza on
your own turf.

706
00:42:42,144 --> 00:42:45,409
Never go to their office again.

707
00:42:46,114 --> 00:42:47,103
All right?

708
00:42:47,883 --> 00:42:49,111
Yes.

709
00:43:00,429 --> 00:43:01,157
Let's go.

710
00:43:01,263 --> 00:43:02,161
Yes.

711
00:43:23,485 --> 00:43:29,185
My name is Hanaoka and I stayed
in Room 629 last night.

712
00:43:29,291 --> 00:43:33,625
I'm afraid I left my bag in the room.

713
00:43:33,728 --> 00:43:35,195
Can you check?

714
00:43:35,964 --> 00:43:37,829
Yes, a bag?

715
00:43:38,066 --> 00:43:41,502
Can you describe it, please?

716
00:43:41,736 --> 00:43:43,761
Yes, green... two handles...

717
00:43:43,872 --> 00:43:45,737
And a gold lock...

718
00:43:46,007 --> 00:43:48,305
We have it right here.

719
00:43:48,477 --> 00:43:50,206
Oh, good.

720
00:43:50,312 --> 00:43:53,338
I'll be right over to pick it up.

721
00:43:53,615 --> 00:43:56,106
My name is Hanaoka.

722
00:43:57,586 --> 00:43:58,382
Go get it.

723
00:43:58,487 --> 00:43:59,511
Yes, Boss.

724
00:44:06,161 --> 00:44:06,991
Good morning.

725
00:44:07,095 --> 00:44:09,256
I'm Hanaoka who forgot his bag.

726
00:44:09,364 --> 00:44:10,729
A green one.

727
00:44:10,832 --> 00:44:13,960
I called and asked if I could
pick it up here.

728
00:44:14,069 --> 00:44:15,627
One moment, please.

729
00:44:17,906 --> 00:44:19,396
Is this it?

730
00:44:19,508 --> 00:44:20,770
That's it.

731
00:44:20,876 --> 00:44:24,505
Mr. Hanaoka from Room 629.
Here you are.

732
00:44:24,613 --> 00:44:25,477
Thanks very much.

733
00:44:25,580 --> 00:44:26,410
Thank you, sir.

734
00:44:26,515 --> 00:44:27,846
Thank you.

735
00:44:38,527 --> 00:44:39,221
Good morning.

736
00:44:39,327 --> 00:44:42,160
I'm Hanaoka. I left my bag
in Room 629.

737
00:44:42,264 --> 00:44:44,789
You're supposed to have it here.

738
00:44:44,900 --> 00:44:48,131
Just a moment, please.

739
00:44:52,774 --> 00:44:57,370
Mr. Hanaoka has already picked
up his bag.

740
00:44:57,479 --> 00:44:59,276
What do you mean?

741
00:44:59,381 --> 00:45:02,976
How could that be? I'm Mr. Hanaoka.

742
00:45:03,084 --> 00:45:05,052
But he said he was.

743
00:45:05,153 --> 00:45:09,180
What is this all about?
I am Mr. Hanaoka.

744
00:45:11,193 --> 00:45:12,956
Then, who was he...

745
00:45:13,061 --> 00:45:14,585
How should I know?

746
00:45:14,696 --> 00:45:16,994
I just want my bag back.

747
00:45:17,098 --> 00:45:19,999
But the other gentleman took it.

748
00:45:20,101 --> 00:45:21,625
My bag?

749
00:45:22,037 --> 00:45:23,664
He came right after he called.

750
00:45:23,772 --> 00:45:26,070
He gave his name and room.

751
00:45:26,174 --> 00:45:28,540
Did you ask for identification?

752
00:45:28,643 --> 00:45:29,974
No, I'm so sorry.

753
00:45:30,345 --> 00:45:34,679
Your apology don't solve nothing.
You got a big problem.

754
00:45:34,783 --> 00:45:37,115
You know what you did?

755
00:45:37,219 --> 00:45:42,316
That bag contained $ 500,000
in promissory notes.

756
00:45:42,424 --> 00:45:43,356
What?

757
00:45:43,458 --> 00:45:47,121
We shouldn't discuss this here.

758
00:45:47,229 --> 00:45:50,824
Please come to the VIP Room.

759
00:45:51,433 --> 00:45:53,424
This way, please.

760
00:46:13,388 --> 00:46:14,548
How many?

761
00:46:14,656 --> 00:46:15,748
Four of them.

762
00:46:15,857 --> 00:46:18,155
Let's make it six of us.

763
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:21,295
Remember, never meet
yakuza alone.

764
00:46:21,396 --> 00:46:23,626
And always outnumber them.

765
00:46:24,332 --> 00:46:26,664
Excuse me, everybody.

766
00:46:26,768 --> 00:46:28,963
I need to borrow three bodies.

767
00:46:29,204 --> 00:46:30,762
I need mean-looking ones.

768
00:46:31,773 --> 00:46:32,432
You.

769
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:34,201
And you, too.

770
00:46:34,309 --> 00:46:35,401
And you.

771
00:46:38,713 --> 00:46:40,647
A pretty good team.

772
00:46:43,485 --> 00:46:45,077
What's that mean?

773
00:46:49,858 --> 00:46:51,792
What is your name, please?

774
00:46:52,260 --> 00:46:55,491
How many times do I have to
tell you? Hanaoka.

775
00:46:55,597 --> 00:46:57,030
Your full name?

776
00:46:57,132 --> 00:46:58,531
Hey.!

777
00:46:59,534 --> 00:47:02,128
Why you need his full name?

778
00:47:02,237 --> 00:47:05,934
With money involved we must be
sure of everything.

779
00:47:06,107 --> 00:47:11,409
And as the hotel's representative,
I must make a full report.

780
00:47:11,946 --> 00:47:16,076
My full name is Mahiru Inoue.

781
00:47:16,718 --> 00:47:18,515
What is yours?

782
00:47:18,687 --> 00:47:20,484
Stop this bullshit!

783
00:47:21,456 --> 00:47:24,823
What you going to do about
the $ 500,000?

784
00:47:24,993 --> 00:47:30,693
You know all guests must deposit
valuables in our safe.

785
00:47:31,032 --> 00:47:32,829
Why didn't you?

786
00:47:32,967 --> 00:47:34,059
Fuck you!

787
00:47:34,402 --> 00:47:35,767
You fucked up!

788
00:47:35,870 --> 00:47:37,997
Stop bullshitting, bitch.

789
00:47:38,173 --> 00:47:39,435
Our promissory notes...

790
00:47:39,874 --> 00:47:41,535
Serial numbers, please?

791
00:47:41,743 --> 00:47:42,767
You idiot!

792
00:47:42,877 --> 00:47:44,902
That's confidential information.

793
00:47:45,013 --> 00:47:46,503
That's strange.

794
00:47:46,614 --> 00:47:49,947
With serial numbers we can
halt payment.

795
00:47:50,118 --> 00:47:52,245
Why the fuck 'strange'?

796
00:47:52,487 --> 00:47:55,012
You calling him a liar?

797
00:47:55,123 --> 00:47:57,887
You say we're pulling a scam?

798
00:47:58,226 --> 00:48:00,524
No bitch can accuse us!

799
00:48:00,628 --> 00:48:01,890
Hey, easy.

800
00:48:01,996 --> 00:48:02,985
But, boss...

801
00:48:03,098 --> 00:48:04,793
I said stop!

802
00:48:04,899 --> 00:48:07,697
We act polite and she'll understand.

803
00:48:07,869 --> 00:48:09,200
Say, Miss Inoue.

804
00:48:10,538 --> 00:48:12,301
Here is my business card.

805
00:48:13,742 --> 00:48:17,610
I'm in a tough spot because
you lost my bag.

806
00:48:17,712 --> 00:48:19,577
You understand?

807
00:48:19,881 --> 00:48:26,013
It was our fault we didn't check
his identification.

808
00:48:26,121 --> 00:48:30,455
And we will apologize for that
particular error.

809
00:48:30,925 --> 00:48:35,953
Right, I knew you would understand.

810
00:48:36,398 --> 00:48:40,858
So what about the promissory notes
that were in my bag?

811
00:48:41,102 --> 00:48:45,869
You'll be happier if you solve it
while I'm still polite.

812
00:48:46,107 --> 00:48:48,405
Accept some friendly advice...

813
00:48:48,510 --> 00:48:53,140
Some of my men will do anything
to see that justice is done.

814
00:48:53,248 --> 00:48:56,411
Even go to jail for the sake
of justice.

815
00:48:56,518 --> 00:48:59,453
They are real fine men.

816
00:48:59,721 --> 00:49:03,054
You have a husband and kids, right?

817
00:49:03,158 --> 00:49:04,352
I'm single.

818
00:49:08,596 --> 00:49:10,894
It's not safe to be living alone.

819
00:49:10,999 --> 00:49:12,364
So I suggest...

820
00:49:12,467 --> 00:49:15,300
You think this over carefully.

821
00:49:16,738 --> 00:49:19,969
Can I ask you a question?

822
00:49:20,408 --> 00:49:21,432
Of course.

823
00:49:21,876 --> 00:49:25,209
These young men who aren't
afraid of jail...

824
00:49:25,313 --> 00:49:27,338
What kind of men are they?

825
00:49:27,449 --> 00:49:28,347
Cut the crap.!

826
00:49:28,450 --> 00:49:29,246
Don't fuck around!

827
00:49:29,350 --> 00:49:30,339
If you want to say something...

828
00:49:30,452 --> 00:49:33,615
I'd better get your full names, too.

829
00:49:33,721 --> 00:49:34,380
Fuck you!

830
00:49:34,489 --> 00:49:35,922
Stop blabbering.

831
00:49:36,024 --> 00:49:38,083
Do I understand, Mr. Hanaoka...

832
00:49:38,526 --> 00:49:42,428
That your young men might
assault me.

833
00:49:42,630 --> 00:49:45,394
Is that what you mean?

834
00:49:46,434 --> 00:49:47,901
I'm not saying that.

835
00:49:48,069 --> 00:49:49,502
You'd better not be.

836
00:49:49,604 --> 00:49:52,164
Because it's a criminal threat.

837
00:49:52,273 --> 00:49:53,535
Shut up!

838
00:49:53,942 --> 00:49:56,137
Don't try our patience.

839
00:49:56,244 --> 00:49:58,508
What about the money you lost?

840
00:49:58,813 --> 00:50:03,978
Under the circumstances, we can
assume a thief stole it.

841
00:50:04,085 --> 00:50:07,953
Therefore, I think we should
notify the police.

842
00:50:08,523 --> 00:50:12,687
In fact, I have already called
the detectives.

843
00:50:12,994 --> 00:50:14,894
Mr. Akechi, please come in.

844
00:50:15,563 --> 00:50:18,657
Hey, Hanaoka. What's happening?

845
00:50:19,234 --> 00:50:24,831
I stayed at this hotel last night
and they lost my bag.

846
00:50:24,939 --> 00:50:26,099
You stayed here?

847
00:50:26,207 --> 00:50:27,504
Why here?

848
00:50:27,609 --> 00:50:31,375
I had to meet somebody to
collect some debts.

849
00:50:31,479 --> 00:50:34,380
So you're in the finance
business now?

850
00:50:34,482 --> 00:50:36,143
Just he ping a friend.

851
00:50:36,251 --> 00:50:39,186
You're good at collecting debts.

852
00:50:39,287 --> 00:50:41,050
Well, I guess so.

853
00:50:41,189 --> 00:50:44,420
But you're no lawyer, so you
broke the law.

854
00:50:44,826 --> 00:50:46,487
Give me a break.

855
00:50:46,594 --> 00:50:48,357
Take him to the station.

856
00:50:55,537 --> 00:50:56,731
What happens now?

857
00:50:56,838 --> 00:50:59,739
They were lying. So it's all over.

858
00:50:59,841 --> 00:51:03,902
But it was our fault we didn't ask
for identification.

859
00:51:04,012 --> 00:51:05,912
We will be more careful.

860
00:51:06,014 --> 00:51:07,572
I can't get over it.

861
00:51:07,682 --> 00:51:08,842
How did we do it?

862
00:51:08,950 --> 00:51:09,416
No idea.

863
00:51:09,517 --> 00:51:10,006
Surprised?

864
00:51:10,118 --> 00:51:11,278
You bet I am.

865
00:51:11,753 --> 00:51:14,449
You thought a woman
could never do it.

866
00:51:14,556 --> 00:51:15,488
Of course not...

867
00:51:16,057 --> 00:51:19,049
To be honest, I did. I'm sorry.

868
00:51:19,561 --> 00:51:21,119
Please tell us.

869
00:51:21,429 --> 00:51:22,987
How did you do it?

870
00:51:23,097 --> 00:51:25,861
That's just the way they are.

871
00:51:25,967 --> 00:51:29,061
Stand up to them, they become
cowards.

872
00:51:29,170 --> 00:51:31,035
You're so darling.

873
00:51:31,139 --> 00:51:33,937
You wouldn't flinch. Why?

874
00:51:34,042 --> 00:51:35,873
I didn't flinch because...

875
00:51:35,977 --> 00:51:39,344
I know they would never
hurt us.

876
00:51:39,447 --> 00:51:42,644
Yakuza wouldn't hurt us?
You're joking.

877
00:51:42,750 --> 00:51:43,944
But they didn't.

878
00:51:44,052 --> 00:51:47,579
They're always violent in movies.

879
00:51:47,689 --> 00:51:49,987
They only hurt each other.

880
00:51:50,091 --> 00:51:51,353
Nothing to do with us.

881
00:51:51,459 --> 00:51:53,825
But cutting off fingers?

882
00:51:53,928 --> 00:51:56,192
That's only among themselves.

883
00:51:56,297 --> 00:51:59,858
In cases like this, they
seldom use violence.

884
00:51:59,968 --> 00:52:02,027
If fact, they can't.

885
00:52:02,437 --> 00:52:03,563
Why not?

886
00:52:04,739 --> 00:52:06,400
They can't afford to.

887
00:52:06,507 --> 00:52:08,873
Violence can land them in jail.

888
00:52:08,977 --> 00:52:13,311
But they're always claiming
they're not afraid of prison.

889
00:52:13,414 --> 00:52:14,210
Mr. Wakasugi.

890
00:52:14,315 --> 00:52:15,043
Yes.

891
00:52:15,149 --> 00:52:16,673
Listen.

892
00:52:19,053 --> 00:52:20,884
Prison is expensive.

893
00:52:20,989 --> 00:52:21,648
Huh?

894
00:52:21,756 --> 00:52:24,657
Legal fees, bail, living expenses...

895
00:52:25,693 --> 00:52:27,354
Cost $ 200,000 a year.

896
00:52:27,462 --> 00:52:30,989
One punch can cost a
Yakuza $ 200,000!

897
00:52:31,099 --> 00:52:31,997
Right.

898
00:52:32,100 --> 00:52:34,068
Their hands are tied.

899
00:52:34,168 --> 00:52:37,228
Nobody spends $ 200,000
to earn $ 2,000.

900
00:52:37,338 --> 00:52:39,670
Are you still frightened now?

901
00:52:42,276 --> 00:52:44,540
Come to think of it, I'm not.

902
00:52:45,046 --> 00:52:47,537
All you need is to know your enemy.

903
00:52:47,882 --> 00:52:51,613
Let's tell the General Manager
the good news.

904
00:52:52,387 --> 00:52:55,550
I can't wait to see his face.

905
00:52:55,657 --> 00:52:59,058
He's out golfing.

906
00:53:02,597 --> 00:53:03,757
Excuse me.

907
00:53:04,332 --> 00:53:05,560
Sirs.

908
00:53:08,069 --> 00:53:12,301
This gentleman is on his own and...

909
00:53:12,407 --> 00:53:15,672
I wondered if he could join you.

910
00:53:15,777 --> 00:53:16,539
How about you?

911
00:53:16,644 --> 00:53:17,303
Fine with me.

912
00:53:17,412 --> 00:53:17,935
All right.

913
00:53:18,046 --> 00:53:22,142
Thanks. My name is Iriuchijima.

914
00:53:22,250 --> 00:53:23,046
Welcome.

915
00:53:23,885 --> 00:53:28,254
Maybe I shouldn't ask you,
since we just met.

916
00:53:28,356 --> 00:53:33,191
But how about a little bet to
spice things up?

917
00:53:33,428 --> 00:53:34,986
Fine with me.

918
00:53:35,096 --> 00:53:38,327
How about ten for each nine?

919
00:53:38,433 --> 00:53:39,957
That's not too much.

920
00:54:12,700 --> 00:54:16,602
Thanks again, I had a great time.

921
00:54:16,704 --> 00:54:17,363
My pleasure.

922
00:54:17,472 --> 00:54:18,837
Mr. Kobayashi...

923
00:54:25,346 --> 00:54:28,577
I don't have much cash
with me today.

924
00:54:28,683 --> 00:54:30,776
Can I wire it to you?

925
00:54:30,885 --> 00:54:33,877
Don't worry. Let's just forget it.

926
00:54:33,988 --> 00:54:36,422
Not at all. I always pay my debts.

927
00:54:36,524 --> 00:54:37,422
Forget it.

928
00:54:37,525 --> 00:54:39,618
But I insist on paying.

929
00:54:39,727 --> 00:54:41,752
A bet is a bet.

930
00:54:41,929 --> 00:54:46,298
I'll wire it to your account.
Give me your card.

931
00:54:46,801 --> 00:54:50,965
Well, if you insist...

932
00:54:51,572 --> 00:54:53,005
Here you are.

933
00:54:59,180 --> 00:55:01,876
The Yamaha Bank just called.

934
00:55:02,350 --> 00:55:07,982
A Mr. Iriuchijima wired
$ 20,000 to your account.

935
00:55:08,089 --> 00:55:08,885
$ 20,000?

936
00:55:08,990 --> 00:55:09,854
Yes, sir.

937
00:55:10,658 --> 00:55:12,182
Are you sure?

938
00:55:12,293 --> 00:55:15,729
Should I check again?

939
00:55:16,164 --> 00:55:17,563
Never mind.

940
00:55:42,390 --> 00:55:43,652
Mr. Kobayashi.

941
00:55:46,260 --> 00:55:49,855
Mr. Iriuchijima, I was
going to call you.

942
00:55:50,131 --> 00:55:52,531
Your bank made some mistake.

943
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:54,194
What do you mean?

944
00:55:54,302 --> 00:55:58,136
They put $ 20,000 in my account.

945
00:55:58,239 --> 00:56:00,139
That's right.

946
00:56:00,474 --> 00:56:01,338
Pardon?

947
00:56:01,442 --> 00:56:04,673
There's no mistake.
I did send $ 20,000,

948
00:56:04,846 --> 00:56:07,280
But you said ten per nine.

949
00:56:07,381 --> 00:56:09,747
In my circle ten means $10,000.

950
00:56:09,851 --> 00:56:11,546
That's ridiculous.

951
00:56:11,652 --> 00:56:14,212
Nobody bets $10,000 on nine holes.

952
00:56:14,322 --> 00:56:18,088
Hey, don't be so loud.

953
00:56:18,259 --> 00:56:21,319
Betting is against the law.

954
00:56:21,429 --> 00:56:22,555
What?

955
00:56:24,532 --> 00:56:27,365
Gambling is a criminal act.

956
00:56:27,835 --> 00:56:29,063
We're both guilty.

957
00:56:29,170 --> 00:56:33,004
Come on. Let's just forget
the whole thing.

958
00:56:33,107 --> 00:56:34,597
I'll refund it.

959
00:56:35,343 --> 00:56:37,174
I can't let you.

960
00:56:37,511 --> 00:56:41,311
I'm a man of honor. I always
pay my debts.

961
00:56:41,983 --> 00:56:43,917
You planned this.

962
00:56:44,318 --> 00:56:47,446
People might gossip.

963
00:56:47,889 --> 00:56:52,087
I get muckrakers visiting me
all the time.

964
00:56:53,995 --> 00:56:58,193
'Hotel Executive Arrested for
Gambling'...

965
00:56:58,299 --> 00:57:01,166
That would be a great story.

966
00:57:02,603 --> 00:57:04,662
Sir. They're here.

967
00:57:04,772 --> 00:57:05,898
OK.

968
00:57:06,007 --> 00:57:06,837
I have to run.

969
00:57:06,941 --> 00:57:08,067
Can we talk later?

970
00:57:08,175 --> 00:57:11,906
Sure. I'll be at this place tonight.

971
00:57:12,280 --> 00:57:13,872
It's a nightclub.

972
00:57:14,215 --> 00:57:18,379
But it's quiet. We can talk there.

973
00:57:23,925 --> 00:57:26,155
What should I do?

974
00:57:26,761 --> 00:57:28,854
We meet tonight.

975
00:57:29,730 --> 00:57:32,164
I'm in trouble.

976
00:57:32,366 --> 00:57:36,063
You really got trapped, didn't you?

977
00:57:36,837 --> 00:57:41,501
To let you off the hook they
usually ask for...

978
00:57:41,776 --> 00:57:44,643
Twice the amount they paid you.

979
00:58:06,200 --> 00:58:07,326
He's here.

980
00:58:07,435 --> 00:58:09,801
Good of you to come.

981
00:58:10,604 --> 00:58:13,630
Sit down and have a drink.

982
00:58:13,741 --> 00:58:15,675
I'm having champagne.

983
00:58:15,776 --> 00:58:16,743
Bring a glass.

984
00:58:16,844 --> 00:58:18,573
No thanks. I have to go.

985
00:58:18,679 --> 00:58:19,611
I just brought this.

986
00:58:19,714 --> 00:58:22,376
We'll talk business later.

987
00:58:22,483 --> 00:58:25,611
Let's just toast our new friendship.

988
00:58:25,720 --> 00:58:26,186
But...

989
00:58:26,287 --> 00:58:28,983
Come on. This is my turf.

990
00:58:29,090 --> 00:58:31,354
Don't make me lose face.

991
00:58:31,759 --> 00:58:34,922
To our friendship. Cheers.!

992
00:58:35,029 --> 00:58:37,020
Cheers!

993
00:58:42,970 --> 00:58:46,736
Get my guest a pair of scissors.

994
00:58:48,576 --> 00:58:50,840
Ask him, Akemi.

995
00:58:51,112 --> 00:58:51,669
What's this?

996
00:58:51,779 --> 00:58:54,213
It's her turn today.

997
00:58:54,749 --> 00:58:56,614
Which one first?

998
00:58:56,717 --> 00:58:59,709
You do the left one.

999
00:59:12,533 --> 00:59:14,194
It's your turn.

1000
00:59:14,301 --> 00:59:15,598
No, I'm all right...

1001
00:59:23,677 --> 00:59:25,338
Go ahead!

1002
00:59:28,816 --> 00:59:30,340
You're very good!

1003
00:59:43,798 --> 00:59:45,197
Let's drink.

1004
00:59:47,368 --> 00:59:49,165
Well, all right.

1005
01:00:07,288 --> 01:00:08,585
A great cut.

1006
01:00:11,192 --> 01:00:13,126
Another drink...

1007
01:00:13,394 --> 01:00:14,554
Cheers.

1008
01:00:28,576 --> 01:00:30,203
I'm feeling fine...

1009
01:01:09,275 --> 01:01:12,005
Looks like he's coming to.

1010
01:01:37,369 --> 01:01:39,929
You really made a fucking mess.

1011
01:01:40,039 --> 01:01:42,473
What you going to do about it?

1012
01:01:50,549 --> 01:01:52,414
You shouldn't drink so much.

1013
01:01:52,518 --> 01:01:55,487
We had hell of a time stopping you.

1014
01:01:56,121 --> 01:01:58,453
You're strong for an old man.

1015
01:01:58,557 --> 01:02:03,119
As soon as we stopped you wrecking
the place, you jumped Akemi.

1016
01:02:04,263 --> 01:02:07,289
You got a pretty good tool.

1017
01:02:07,399 --> 01:02:09,799
But it did bad things to Akemi.

1018
01:02:09,902 --> 01:02:13,030
So we're going to fix it.

1019
01:02:13,439 --> 01:02:15,930
Give me the razor.

1020
01:02:20,579 --> 01:02:22,809
Hold him down.

1021
01:02:27,753 --> 01:02:30,722
This might hurt a bit.

1022
01:02:35,995 --> 01:02:38,657
Shit.! It broke. Get some scissors.

1023
01:02:38,764 --> 01:02:40,163
Get the scissors!

1024
01:02:48,107 --> 01:02:49,267
Wait.

1025
01:02:49,975 --> 01:02:51,909
Maybe this is better.

1026
01:02:52,344 --> 01:02:56,246
Put his dick through the loop and
yank both ends.

1027
01:03:00,152 --> 01:03:01,710
Hold him down.

1028
01:03:04,123 --> 01:03:05,556
We do it on three.

1029
01:03:05,658 --> 01:03:08,559
Stop! I'll do anything!

1030
01:03:08,928 --> 01:03:09,587
Help me.!

1031
01:03:09,695 --> 01:03:13,495
Let's go. One two...

1032
01:03:16,602 --> 01:03:18,092
Ho d it.! Ho d it.!

1033
01:03:23,475 --> 01:03:27,502
What the fuck are you doing?
Let him go.

1034
01:03:30,349 --> 01:03:33,011
Mr. Iriuchijima!

1035
01:03:33,218 --> 01:03:35,448
Stop bothering my friend.

1036
01:03:38,724 --> 01:03:44,754
You're not a kid any more. You
shouldn't behave like this.

1037
01:03:45,998 --> 01:03:50,958
Poor Akemi. Did you know she is
only 18 years old?

1038
01:03:51,070 --> 01:03:53,800
This is bad.

1039
01:03:54,673 --> 01:04:00,771
You could be arrested for sexually
assaulting a minor.

1040
01:04:05,551 --> 01:04:07,178
Did I do all this?

1041
01:04:07,286 --> 01:04:08,844
You sure did.

1042
01:04:09,655 --> 01:04:12,249
We're in big trouble.

1043
01:04:14,193 --> 01:04:16,491
To tell you the truth...

1044
01:04:16,862 --> 01:04:21,765
This place belongs to the Boss of
the Black Swamp Gang.

1045
01:04:21,867 --> 01:04:24,199
His mistress runs it.

1046
01:04:24,737 --> 01:04:29,640
If things get bad,
I may have to chop my finger off.

1047
01:04:32,444 --> 01:04:34,344
What can we do?

1048
01:04:39,985 --> 01:04:43,614
$100,000.!

1049
01:04:44,823 --> 01:04:50,420
Can you hush this up for $100,000?

1050
01:04:50,863 --> 01:04:53,388
Please, Mr. Iriuchijima!

1051
01:04:57,302 --> 01:04:58,963
Don't pay $100,000.

1052
01:04:59,071 --> 01:05:01,699
Don't pay anything!

1053
01:05:04,610 --> 01:05:06,510
This may sound harsh.

1054
01:05:07,613 --> 01:05:11,606
You were insane ever to visit
their place alone.

1055
01:05:12,551 --> 01:05:15,952
A stupid mistake for a smart
executive.

1056
01:05:19,858 --> 01:05:23,851
But everybody makes mistakes.

1057
01:05:25,097 --> 01:05:28,589
Just be careful not to repeat him.

1058
01:05:29,435 --> 01:05:33,132
And paying $100,000 would
be repeating.

1059
01:05:33,238 --> 01:05:34,671
But I promised.

1060
01:05:34,773 --> 01:05:36,001
General Manager.

1061
01:05:38,010 --> 01:05:40,808
Leave everything to me.

1062
01:05:41,814 --> 01:05:43,577
I'll handle it.

1063
01:05:44,383 --> 01:05:47,477
Never meet them again.

1064
01:05:47,586 --> 01:05:49,713
Don't take their calls.

1065
01:05:52,458 --> 01:05:53,891
Understand?

1066
01:05:57,529 --> 01:05:59,622
I am Mahiru Inoue.

1067
01:06:00,966 --> 01:06:04,493
I'm Mr. Kobayashi's attorney.

1068
01:06:04,603 --> 01:06:05,900
What?

1069
01:06:06,405 --> 01:06:07,997
We don't want no lawyer.

1070
01:06:08,107 --> 01:06:09,233
We want Kobayashi.

1071
01:06:09,341 --> 01:06:10,433
Get lost!

1072
01:06:10,542 --> 01:06:11,770
We want him!

1073
01:06:11,877 --> 01:06:12,639
About this...

1074
01:06:12,744 --> 01:06:14,575
Why isn't he here?

1075
01:06:14,913 --> 01:06:17,211
He's got to keep his promise.

1076
01:06:17,316 --> 01:06:20,149
He gave me
full power-of-attorney.

1077
01:06:20,252 --> 01:06:22,846
You may not deal with him.

1078
01:06:23,489 --> 01:06:25,150
Say, Ms. Inoue.

1079
01:06:26,225 --> 01:06:30,958
Kobayashi got down on his knees
and promised to pay me.

1080
01:06:31,597 --> 01:06:34,862
So, I guess you brought the money.

1081
01:06:35,367 --> 01:06:36,425
Money?

1082
01:06:37,569 --> 01:06:39,093
I didn't bring any.

1083
01:06:39,204 --> 01:06:40,728
Then go get it.

1084
01:06:40,839 --> 01:06:42,534
He wants to pay.

1085
01:06:42,841 --> 01:06:45,366
No lawyer can deny that.

1086
01:06:45,644 --> 01:06:49,546
Or are you going to pay us
on his behalf?

1087
01:06:49,648 --> 01:06:53,607
I'm a lawyer. I don't do such things.

1088
01:06:55,420 --> 01:06:56,614
Why are you here?

1089
01:06:56,722 --> 01:06:57,882
I'm his attorney.

1090
01:06:57,990 --> 01:07:00,390
We don't want no lawyer.

1091
01:07:00,492 --> 01:07:02,551
Got that, bitch?

1092
01:07:03,061 --> 01:07:06,861
We want him to repay his
debt directly.

1093
01:07:06,965 --> 01:07:08,398
Repay what debt?

1094
01:07:08,734 --> 01:07:10,861
He never borrowed your money.

1095
01:07:11,503 --> 01:07:13,937
On what do you base your claim?

1096
01:07:14,072 --> 01:07:16,233
He said he would pay.

1097
01:07:16,575 --> 01:07:20,409
It's between me and him. It's none
of your business.

1098
01:07:20,712 --> 01:07:23,613
He says you threatened him.

1099
01:07:23,715 --> 01:07:25,580
Nobody threatened him.

1100
01:07:25,684 --> 01:07:27,208
Can you prove it?

1101
01:07:27,319 --> 01:07:31,915
Can you prove he owes money
to you?

1102
01:07:32,024 --> 01:07:33,889
We have witnesses.

1103
01:07:33,992 --> 01:07:35,289
We're all witnesses.

1104
01:07:35,394 --> 01:07:38,295
Then go ahead and file a suit.

1105
01:07:38,397 --> 01:07:41,195
If you feel he is liable, go to court.

1106
01:07:41,567 --> 01:07:43,125
I can't do that.

1107
01:07:43,569 --> 01:07:46,561
Lawsuits take too much money
and time.

1108
01:07:46,672 --> 01:07:49,470
Be reasonable with us.

1109
01:07:49,641 --> 01:07:50,869
Legally speaking...

1110
01:07:50,976 --> 01:07:53,843
He said he'd pay.

1111
01:07:54,012 --> 01:07:58,176
Not keeping a promise is
ethically wrong.

1112
01:07:58,283 --> 01:08:00,444
I'm talking about ethics.

1113
01:08:00,552 --> 01:08:02,179
Do you have an IOU?

1114
01:08:02,287 --> 01:08:06,155
No. It was a verbal promise
between gentlemen.

1115
01:08:06,258 --> 01:08:09,250
Will he welch on a verbal agreement?

1116
01:08:09,361 --> 01:08:11,693
I will never accept that.

1117
01:08:11,964 --> 01:08:15,195
I don't intend to do anything illegal.

1118
01:08:15,300 --> 01:08:17,530
So report it to the police.

1119
01:08:17,636 --> 01:08:21,595
If I do that, will you pay?

1120
01:08:21,707 --> 01:08:23,231
Of course not.

1121
01:08:23,342 --> 01:08:28,439
Then, you had better let me
talk to him directly.

1122
01:08:28,714 --> 01:08:32,980
If anybody breaks a promise
and run away...

1123
01:08:33,085 --> 01:08:36,111
I teach them a very hard lesson.

1124
01:08:36,321 --> 01:08:38,289
What you say is bullshit.

1125
01:08:38,490 --> 01:08:41,288
I can teach lawyers lessons, too.

1126
01:08:41,693 --> 01:08:43,422
Listen, lady lawyer.!

1127
01:08:44,162 --> 01:08:44,856
As I said...

1128
01:08:44,963 --> 01:08:47,193
Just bring me Kobayashi.

1129
01:08:48,166 --> 01:08:50,031
He is very afraid.

1130
01:08:50,235 --> 01:08:52,203
Of what?

1131
01:08:52,704 --> 01:08:55,366
This is a safe, law-abiding country.

1132
01:08:55,841 --> 01:08:58,935
I'll meet him in a nice, open place.

1133
01:08:59,211 --> 01:09:01,645
I'm not asking to meet in a dark alley.

1134
01:09:02,481 --> 01:09:03,675
But he's afraid.

1135
01:09:03,782 --> 01:09:06,080
You come along too, then.

1136
01:09:06,485 --> 01:09:10,148
If you're seeing me, you don't need
to be afraid.

1137
01:09:10,255 --> 01:09:13,850
But when you aren't seeing me...

1138
01:09:14,059 --> 01:09:15,117
What do you mean?

1139
01:09:15,227 --> 01:09:16,785
How do I know?

1140
01:09:16,895 --> 01:09:19,887
I just want to be paid back.

1141
01:09:19,998 --> 01:09:22,694
I live a fair-and-square life.

1142
01:09:22,801 --> 01:09:25,463
I just want him to keep his promise.

1143
01:09:25,671 --> 01:09:29,539
If he's sincere, I might compromise
with him.

1144
01:09:30,208 --> 01:09:33,041
But if he runs, I'll never forgive him.

1145
01:09:33,245 --> 01:09:36,009
In fact, I'll get angry. I'm that
type of man.

1146
01:09:36,348 --> 01:09:38,373
And when I'm angry, I act!

1147
01:09:39,451 --> 01:09:42,011
Let's solve this by cooperating.

1148
01:09:42,554 --> 01:09:45,022
He didn't accept the $ 20,000
you sent.

1149
01:09:45,123 --> 01:09:48,024
I put it in escrow and filed a writ.

1150
01:09:48,126 --> 01:09:49,787
It's still yours.

1151
01:09:49,895 --> 01:09:54,889
About your claim that he damaged
Club Scarab...

1152
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:58,265
and assaulted its employee Akemi...

1153
01:09:58,370 --> 01:10:03,364
He does not recall any of it, so
I'm afraid you must file a suit.

1154
01:10:03,475 --> 01:10:04,840
We'll see you in court.

1155
01:10:04,943 --> 01:10:07,571
But I don't want to go to court.

1156
01:10:07,979 --> 01:10:09,173
I want to see him.

1157
01:10:09,281 --> 01:10:10,680
For what reason?

1158
01:10:10,782 --> 01:10:12,716
To get my money back.

1159
01:10:13,318 --> 01:10:16,014
Do you think you lawyers...

1160
01:10:16,121 --> 01:10:17,554
can always protect him?

1161
01:10:17,656 --> 01:10:18,816
The police can.

1162
01:10:18,924 --> 01:10:19,856
Fuck you!

1163
01:10:19,958 --> 01:10:22,984
I'll get my money, police or no police.

1164
01:10:23,095 --> 01:10:23,891
Try to stop me!

1165
01:10:23,995 --> 01:10:26,486
I request that you do not see him.

1166
01:10:26,598 --> 01:10:29,533
I'll go to his house.

1167
01:10:29,768 --> 01:10:32,066
If you do, I will involve the police.

1168
01:10:32,170 --> 01:10:33,865
We don't care, bitch!

1169
01:10:33,972 --> 01:10:35,633
Go ahead.

1170
01:10:35,741 --> 01:10:40,940
You're in the wrong. Look at how
badly he wrecked this place.

1171
01:11:03,335 --> 01:11:05,997
I believe the owner is Mr. Kuronuma
of the Black Swamp Gang.

1172
01:11:06,104 --> 01:11:07,594
Yeah.

1173
01:11:09,040 --> 01:11:14,410
So if Kobayashi pays you,
the money goes to him?

1174
01:11:16,748 --> 01:11:20,081
So I'll call Mr. Kuronuma.

1175
01:11:20,552 --> 01:11:21,985
Wait a minute.

1176
01:11:23,221 --> 01:11:25,815
You're going to call the Boss of
the Black Swamp?

1177
01:11:25,924 --> 01:11:26,948
Of course.

1178
01:11:27,058 --> 01:11:28,320
It's his club.

1179
01:11:28,427 --> 01:11:29,826
Wait a minute.

1180
01:11:31,329 --> 01:11:34,628
Our profession has its own
proprieties.

1181
01:11:35,133 --> 01:11:39,263
If you call him it could cause
difficulties.

1182
01:11:39,371 --> 01:11:41,669
That's your problem.

1183
01:11:53,919 --> 01:11:55,409
Ms. Inoue.

1184
01:11:56,254 --> 01:11:57,243
Yes.

1185
01:11:58,457 --> 01:12:00,925
You've got as much guts as we do.

1186
01:12:02,461 --> 01:12:03,723
I'm honored.

1187
01:12:12,537 --> 01:12:13,970
Say, Mr. Iriuchijima.

1188
01:12:15,474 --> 01:12:18,034
I appreciated your compliment, but...

1189
01:12:18,710 --> 01:12:25,274
I still think it would be wise for
both of us to drop this matter.

1190
01:12:27,152 --> 01:12:32,488
If you are willing to forget
everything...

1191
01:12:33,425 --> 01:12:37,885
I won't involve Boss Kuronuma.

1192
01:12:49,574 --> 01:12:51,007
You win.

1193
01:12:51,643 --> 01:12:53,133
It's forgotten.

1194
01:13:02,153 --> 01:13:04,917
God, I was nervous.

1195
01:13:05,023 --> 01:13:07,048
What if they had filed a suit?

1196
01:13:07,158 --> 01:13:10,787
They would have had to submit
evidence.

1197
01:13:10,896 --> 01:13:15,560
And prove beyond a reasonable
doubt that he did those things.

1198
01:13:15,667 --> 01:13:17,157
And they can't.

1199
01:13:17,269 --> 01:13:20,363
So that's why you were claim.

1200
01:13:21,506 --> 01:13:24,407
Today, I told myself not to be scared.

1201
01:13:24,509 --> 01:13:25,203
And?

1202
01:13:25,310 --> 01:13:26,743
And I wasn't.

1203
01:13:26,845 --> 01:13:28,312
I wasn't either.

1204
01:13:28,413 --> 01:13:30,313
They used to terrify me.

1205
01:13:30,415 --> 01:13:34,442
Today, I was calm enough to admire
their art of shouting.

1206
01:13:34,719 --> 01:13:36,016
I learned a lot today.

1207
01:13:36,121 --> 01:13:38,521
I can't wait for the next
confrontation.

1208
01:13:38,623 --> 01:13:39,419
Can I handle it?

1209
01:13:39,524 --> 01:13:41,719
No. It's my turn next.

1210
01:13:52,938 --> 01:13:54,462
This arrived.

1211
01:14:29,274 --> 01:14:32,402
I got an appointment with Kobayashi.

1212
01:14:32,877 --> 01:14:35,141
I'm Iriuchijima.

1213
01:14:35,246 --> 01:14:36,474
Certainly, sir.

1214
01:14:41,453 --> 01:14:43,717
Is the General Manager in?

1215
01:14:45,090 --> 01:14:48,253
He's at the construction site?

1216
01:14:55,133 --> 01:14:57,624
Someone to see you.

1217
01:15:27,032 --> 01:15:30,024
I wanted to talk man-to-man.

1218
01:15:31,403 --> 01:15:33,735
You got a bad attitude.

1219
01:15:34,072 --> 01:15:39,806
It was a dangerous thing you did
involving that lady lawyer.

1220
01:15:41,212 --> 01:15:45,945
My boys do terrible things
when they get mad.

1221
01:15:48,787 --> 01:15:52,621
You shouldn't hang around
places like this.

1222
01:15:53,291 --> 01:15:57,022
A big steel beam could drop on you.

1223
01:15:57,862 --> 01:16:03,823
Or you could get accidentally
knocked over the edge.

1224
01:16:09,774 --> 01:16:13,039
You saw what I sent?

1225
01:16:16,181 --> 01:16:20,550
I'm stuck with a huge inventory
of the same stuff.

1226
01:16:21,352 --> 01:16:23,786
You want to buy it?

1227
01:16:27,859 --> 01:16:29,224
How much?

1228
01:16:33,098 --> 01:16:34,156
Ten million.

1229
01:16:34,733 --> 01:16:36,064
Ten million dollars!

1230
01:16:36,334 --> 01:16:38,393
That's ridiculous.

1231
01:16:38,737 --> 01:16:40,432
Not for the hotel.

1232
01:16:40,538 --> 01:16:41,835
Don't play stupid.

1233
01:16:42,073 --> 01:16:43,506
It... it's impossible.

1234
01:16:43,908 --> 01:16:45,500
The board would never...

1235
01:16:58,723 --> 01:17:01,590
Is this going to be the new wing?

1236
01:17:02,060 --> 01:17:03,288
Yes.

1237
01:17:04,095 --> 01:17:05,585
What's it costing?

1238
01:17:07,365 --> 01:17:08,832
$ 200 million.

1239
01:17:09,901 --> 01:17:12,734
You're behind schedule, I hear.

1240
01:17:13,304 --> 01:17:14,236
Yes.

1241
01:17:18,543 --> 01:17:21,444
All right. I'm leaving for now.

1242
01:17:22,313 --> 01:17:27,148
I'm going to make it easy for you
to get ten mil ion from the board.

1243
01:17:33,191 --> 01:17:34,283
How did it go?

1244
01:17:35,393 --> 01:17:38,055
He's scared.
One more push should do.

1245
01:17:38,730 --> 01:17:43,224
We got to give them a good excuse
for approving ten million.

1246
01:17:43,468 --> 01:17:44,935
What excuse?

1247
01:17:45,036 --> 01:17:46,298
Anything.

1248
01:17:46,538 --> 01:17:50,998
How about organizing a protest
against their construction?

1249
01:17:51,109 --> 01:17:52,576
Leave that to me.

1250
01:17:52,677 --> 01:17:57,580
I'm a local resident. I'll do that myself.

1251
01:18:07,425 --> 01:18:09,120
Stop this construction.

1252
01:18:09,227 --> 01:18:10,717
Or you' I be sorry.

1253
01:18:10,829 --> 01:18:13,491
You need our approval for
construction.

1254
01:18:13,598 --> 01:18:15,566
We can ruin you.

1255
01:18:16,501 --> 01:18:19,129
Do it while you still can!

1256
01:18:19,971 --> 01:18:21,302
As I was saying...

1257
01:18:21,606 --> 01:18:23,767
If you don't, we'll make you.

1258
01:18:23,875 --> 01:18:25,342
Say something, huh!

1259
01:18:26,878 --> 01:18:29,847
Let's all calm down.

1260
01:18:30,114 --> 01:18:31,138
Wakasugi.

1261
01:18:31,616 --> 01:18:34,608
You know how much you're polluting?

1262
01:18:34,719 --> 01:18:35,777
Got any idea?

1263
01:18:35,887 --> 01:18:38,117
What are you talking about?

1264
01:18:38,223 --> 01:18:39,247
There's the noise.

1265
01:18:39,357 --> 01:18:41,587
And vibration and dust.

1266
01:18:42,026 --> 01:18:43,994
Mud on the roads.

1267
01:18:44,262 --> 01:18:45,627
Toxic chemicals.

1268
01:18:45,964 --> 01:18:47,989
Do you have proof?

1269
01:18:48,199 --> 01:18:50,429
We got photographs.

1270
01:18:50,802 --> 01:18:52,963
And pictures don't lie.

1271
01:18:54,305 --> 01:18:55,567
See?

1272
01:18:55,673 --> 01:18:58,642
This shows dump trucks
soiling the road.

1273
01:18:59,010 --> 01:19:00,375
They're great pictures.

1274
01:19:00,478 --> 01:19:03,970
The tires are making the road
a muddy mess.

1275
01:19:04,082 --> 01:19:05,674
You got to stop it.

1276
01:19:05,783 --> 01:19:07,273
What will you do?

1277
01:19:08,219 --> 01:19:11,655
It looks like our vehicles
in those pictures.

1278
01:19:11,756 --> 01:19:12,450
We'll investigate.

1279
01:19:12,857 --> 01:19:14,950
That's no fucking answer.

1280
01:19:15,059 --> 01:19:16,856
We'll tell the government.

1281
01:19:16,961 --> 01:19:20,158
They will make you stop.

1282
01:19:20,265 --> 01:19:22,233
You want that?

1283
01:19:24,602 --> 01:19:26,194
Say something, asshole!

1284
01:19:26,304 --> 01:19:27,635
Answer me.

1285
01:19:27,739 --> 01:19:28,797
Speak up!

1286
01:19:31,943 --> 01:19:34,036
Thank you for your concern.

1287
01:19:34,145 --> 01:19:36,807
We appreciate learning your opinions.

1288
01:19:36,915 --> 01:19:37,574
What?

1289
01:19:38,249 --> 01:19:39,739
That's no answer.

1290
01:19:39,884 --> 01:19:42,318
What kind of attitude is that?

1291
01:19:42,787 --> 01:19:44,982
We will be more careful.

1292
01:19:45,089 --> 01:19:48,024
We'll contact the government
ourselves and...

1293
01:19:48,126 --> 01:19:50,492
Do whatever they say is necessary.

1294
01:19:50,962 --> 01:19:52,259
We thank you.

1295
01:19:52,363 --> 01:19:55,332
What the fuck is this? This ain't fair.

1296
01:19:55,633 --> 01:19:59,034
If you continue your construction...

1297
01:19:59,337 --> 01:20:05,833
We'll be watching everything for
the smallest infraction.

1298
01:20:06,210 --> 01:20:08,178
Got that?

1299
01:20:09,247 --> 01:20:11,147
You're being unfair.

1300
01:20:11,249 --> 01:20:14,218
You yakuza claim to help the weak.

1301
01:20:14,319 --> 01:20:15,911
So, stop troubling the weak.

1302
01:20:16,120 --> 01:20:17,712
What the fuck?

1303
01:20:17,822 --> 01:20:19,722
You're the ones troubling us!

1304
01:20:19,824 --> 01:20:21,121
Don't shift the blame.

1305
01:20:21,225 --> 01:20:22,522
It ain't right.

1306
01:20:22,827 --> 01:20:24,419
It ain't fucking right, at all.

1307
01:20:24,662 --> 01:20:26,220
May I remind you...

1308
01:20:26,331 --> 01:20:28,231
We're recording this.

1309
01:20:28,333 --> 01:20:29,823
What?

1310
01:20:30,635 --> 01:20:31,693
Hold it.

1311
01:20:43,381 --> 01:20:44,939
Is that a camera?

1312
01:20:45,049 --> 01:20:46,038
Yes.

1313
01:20:47,018 --> 01:20:51,045
You got microphones in here, too?

1314
01:20:54,659 --> 01:20:55,853
Let's go.

1315
01:20:56,694 --> 01:20:59,720
Sorry to bother you. We'll be in touch.

1316
01:21:11,042 --> 01:21:12,566
We did it!

1317
01:21:12,777 --> 01:21:14,472
We chased them away!

1318
01:21:16,481 --> 01:21:18,676
But why did they go so easily?

1319
01:21:18,783 --> 01:21:21,809
They have something in mind.

1320
01:21:22,453 --> 01:21:24,011
Something devilish.

1321
01:21:45,443 --> 01:21:50,403
Ladies and gentlemen staying
at the Hotel Europa.!

1322
01:21:51,616 --> 01:21:57,054
Did you know that you are being
spied upon?

1323
01:21:58,056 --> 01:22:05,258
The Hotel Europa employees are
watching your every move...

1324
01:22:05,596 --> 01:22:11,694
through hidden cameras and
microphones!

1325
01:22:14,038 --> 01:22:19,203
It may look like a first-class hotel.

1326
01:22:19,610 --> 01:22:22,545
But it's run by Peeping Toms.

1327
01:22:23,381 --> 01:22:27,317
The new wing that they are
constructing...

1328
01:22:27,919 --> 01:22:30,888
in an environmental nightmare.

1329
01:22:31,522 --> 01:22:37,620
It is polluting our drinking water and
creating lung-destroying dust.

1330
01:22:38,262 --> 01:22:45,031
Vibrations are causing miscarriages.
Our health is being ruined.

1331
01:22:45,536 --> 01:22:48,994
The Hotel Europa is a diabolical
menace to society.!

1332
01:22:51,042 --> 01:22:58,608
The Hotel Europa must be stopped
from polluting the city!

1333
01:22:59,350 --> 01:23:06,051
Stop your spying!
Stop your unethical conduct.

1334
01:23:06,324 --> 01:23:07,791
I'm very sorry.

1335
01:23:07,892 --> 01:23:11,328
We have asked the police to
stop them.

1336
01:23:11,429 --> 01:23:13,294
The noise gave your baby a fit?

1337
01:23:13,397 --> 01:23:15,991
We'll get you a doctor.

1338
01:23:16,100 --> 01:23:17,897
I'm very sorry, sir.

1339
01:23:18,202 --> 01:23:22,969
This spying things is absolutely
unfounded and...

1340
01:23:23,241 --> 01:23:24,868
We want the boss!

1341
01:23:25,276 --> 01:23:26,743
Please talk to me.

1342
01:23:26,844 --> 01:23:29,312
We want the General Manager!

1343
01:23:29,514 --> 01:23:30,640
You need an appointment.

1344
01:23:30,748 --> 01:23:32,375
We don't need one.

1345
01:23:32,850 --> 01:23:35,580
It's about your pollution.

1346
01:23:35,686 --> 01:23:37,381
It's his duty.

1347
01:23:37,755 --> 01:23:41,657
The General Manager sees no one
without an appointment.

1348
01:23:42,260 --> 01:23:43,386
What?

1349
01:23:43,561 --> 01:23:45,927
He won't talk to local residents?

1350
01:23:46,030 --> 01:23:47,258
Cut the crap.!

1351
01:23:47,365 --> 01:23:49,390
Say something!

1352
01:23:50,835 --> 01:23:52,268
There he is!

1353
01:23:52,370 --> 01:23:53,337
Hey you!

1354
01:23:53,437 --> 01:23:54,335
Stop.!

1355
01:23:54,438 --> 01:23:56,838
Stop, you scumbag!

1356
01:23:56,941 --> 01:23:58,340
We want to talk.

1357
01:24:30,841 --> 01:24:35,938
The bride and groom will now
cut their wedding cake.

1358
01:25:22,827 --> 01:25:24,920
Darling.! What is going on?

1359
01:25:25,730 --> 01:25:27,425
What...

1360
01:25:28,099 --> 01:25:30,294
What are you doing here?

1361
01:25:31,435 --> 01:25:32,459
Naoko.!

1362
01:25:36,307 --> 01:25:38,969
They're harassing your family too.

1363
01:25:39,210 --> 01:25:42,873
Look at this! What it this all about?

1364
01:25:44,282 --> 01:25:48,150
It was sent by courier! What's
happening?

1365
01:25:49,387 --> 01:25:53,289
Darling, what happened?
What have you done?

1366
01:25:53,858 --> 01:25:57,521
We've been getting strange
phone calls and...

1367
01:25:57,628 --> 01:25:59,823
Naoko was followed by a man.

1368
01:26:01,299 --> 01:26:05,463
This was thrown in our garden.

1369
01:26:05,569 --> 01:26:10,199
Meatballs with razor blade inside.

1370
01:26:11,776 --> 01:26:17,908
The dog didn't get it, thank god.
But it's driving me crazy.

1371
01:26:18,783 --> 01:26:22,446
And those awful trucks.

1372
01:26:23,554 --> 01:26:25,818
You've been cheating on me, too.

1373
01:26:28,959 --> 01:26:30,893
All this is just yakuza harassment.

1374
01:26:31,262 --> 01:26:35,164
Your husband is a victim.
Please trust him.

1375
01:26:35,466 --> 01:26:38,458
We'll stop them. Don't worry.

1376
01:26:40,037 --> 01:26:43,734
Come, fix your makeup.

1377
01:26:45,776 --> 01:26:46,708
Come on.

1378
01:27:19,944 --> 01:27:20,933
I'm sorry.

1379
01:27:25,316 --> 01:27:27,375
There's something else.

1380
01:28:04,288 --> 01:28:07,780
Thank you for confiding in me.

1381
01:28:10,294 --> 01:28:12,728
You must have suffered badly.

1382
01:28:24,742 --> 01:28:28,542
Will you help me fight them?

1383
01:28:34,084 --> 01:28:37,918
That's my job.

1384
01:28:44,061 --> 01:28:48,930
This is now a war and my generalship
is not good enough.

1385
01:28:49,733 --> 01:28:51,963
I'm asking the Chairman for orders.

1386
01:29:02,480 --> 01:29:03,037
Oh!

1387
01:29:06,917 --> 01:29:08,145
The grandpa!

1388
01:29:08,252 --> 01:29:09,241
He's the Chairman.

1389
01:29:09,420 --> 01:29:11,513
Goodness, excuse me.

1390
01:29:11,922 --> 01:29:13,617
You hired me?

1391
01:29:13,858 --> 01:29:17,589
I made the arrangements for you
to help us.

1392
01:29:18,062 --> 01:29:21,554
I fell in love with your courage.

1393
01:29:23,601 --> 01:29:26,229
I made a good choice.

1394
01:29:27,571 --> 01:29:31,337
Thanks to you, hosting a summit
is now possible.

1395
01:29:31,942 --> 01:29:35,400
We need advice about
a new problem.

1396
01:29:36,413 --> 01:29:40,281
I was careless and they are trying
to blackmail me.

1397
01:29:40,384 --> 01:29:41,681
I apologize.

1398
01:29:43,020 --> 01:29:45,955
Should I fight them on this?

1399
01:29:46,056 --> 01:29:49,457
Let me say something
before you answer.

1400
01:29:49,560 --> 01:29:51,687
Those photos are fake.

1401
01:29:51,795 --> 01:29:55,788
He met with them alone and
fell into a trap.

1402
01:29:55,900 --> 01:29:59,893
He is innocent of everything but
an honest mistake.

1403
01:30:01,138 --> 01:30:02,127
Thank you.

1404
01:30:02,973 --> 01:30:04,406
What should we do?

1405
01:30:06,043 --> 01:30:09,308
What happens if we don't fight?

1406
01:30:09,413 --> 01:30:11,176
We pay them $10 mil ion.

1407
01:30:11,916 --> 01:30:16,910
I believe in your innocence.

1408
01:30:17,821 --> 01:30:22,258
But we can't pay ten mil ion just
to save your reputation.

1409
01:30:22,359 --> 01:30:25,795
If we don't, we face a huge scandal.

1410
01:30:25,896 --> 01:30:29,832
Our General Manager sexually
assaulting a minor...

1411
01:30:29,934 --> 01:30:34,894
I'm sorry, but the public is all too
ready to believe dirt like that.

1412
01:30:35,005 --> 01:30:38,839
If those photos get out,
we're ruined.

1413
01:30:38,943 --> 01:30:41,343
We'll never host a summit.

1414
01:30:41,445 --> 01:30:43,811
They will never be distributed.

1415
01:30:43,914 --> 01:30:45,108
Why not?

1416
01:30:45,215 --> 01:30:47,308
Photos are like hostages.

1417
01:30:47,418 --> 01:30:51,184
You don't release hostages
before getting a ransom.

1418
01:30:52,122 --> 01:30:53,953
Don't pay anything.

1419
01:30:54,258 --> 01:30:56,886
Money might solve this problem.

1420
01:30:56,994 --> 01:31:00,953
But tomorrow the hotel would be
filled with yakuza.

1421
01:31:01,065 --> 01:31:03,499
And new troubles would start.

1422
01:31:03,601 --> 01:31:05,535
Do you want that?

1423
01:31:05,903 --> 01:31:10,363
We should stand up to the yakuza
from now on.

1424
01:31:10,474 --> 01:31:15,309
If they discover we will stand up
to them...

1425
01:31:15,412 --> 01:31:17,277
They will just fade away.

1426
01:31:17,381 --> 01:31:18,973
And we're almost there.

1427
01:31:19,083 --> 01:31:20,880
Let's keeping trying.

1428
01:31:21,085 --> 01:31:22,780
Continue to stand firm.

1429
01:31:22,886 --> 01:31:23,944
Don't yield.

1430
01:31:24,054 --> 01:31:26,045
Don't pay another cent.

1431
01:31:26,156 --> 01:31:29,683
As the board, you should make this
official policy.

1432
01:31:30,394 --> 01:31:31,725
Please!

1433
01:31:38,869 --> 01:31:41,201
What do you think?

1434
01:31:44,241 --> 01:31:46,539
I agree with Ms. Inoue.

1435
01:31:46,977 --> 01:31:48,911
Let us fight to the finish.

1436
01:31:49,580 --> 01:31:53,414
If it doesn't work, you can fire me.

1437
01:31:54,718 --> 01:31:57,186
Please let us fight.

1438
01:31:58,522 --> 01:32:01,491
I feel the same way.

1439
01:32:01,592 --> 01:32:04,720
Let us fight. Please.!

1440
01:32:08,699 --> 01:32:14,262
If we fail and the scandal
is about to surface...

1441
01:32:14,505 --> 01:32:19,568
Fire me and place the blame on me
to save the hotel.

1442
01:32:25,215 --> 01:32:29,015
I'll leave my resignation with you.

1443
01:32:34,224 --> 01:32:36,749
All right. Go ahead.

1444
01:32:37,928 --> 01:32:39,828
Thank you, sir.!

1445
01:32:41,265 --> 01:32:42,732
What the hell!

1446
01:32:42,833 --> 01:32:47,099
The yakuza taught you to be
skilled negotiators.

1447
01:33:05,856 --> 01:33:11,453
Ladies and gentlemen, yakuza are
attempting to extort money from us.

1448
01:33:12,162 --> 01:33:19,295
They think that proper citizens are
soft and easy to scare.

1449
01:33:19,403 --> 01:33:20,836
Well, we're not!

1450
01:33:21,438 --> 01:33:26,102
We will not pay a sing e cent to them.
We have no reason to.

1451
01:33:26,210 --> 01:33:29,611
If they want to kill somebody,
they can kill me.

1452
01:33:32,783 --> 01:33:37,516
This hotel is my child and I will
die to protect it.

1453
01:33:38,122 --> 01:33:40,750
This hotel is my life.

1454
01:33:41,291 --> 01:33:46,752
I intend to leave it in better shape
than it was when I started it.

1455
01:33:47,664 --> 01:33:53,159
I may be 82, but I want to tell you
filthy rogues...

1456
01:33:54,138 --> 01:33:56,971
I'm not senile and I'm not afraid.

1457
01:33:57,241 --> 01:34:02,201
I will never compromise this hotel or
its reputation.

1458
01:34:02,579 --> 01:34:09,075
When yakuza visit, we take them
to this room.

1459
01:34:09,253 --> 01:34:13,952
Since they only use vaguely
threatening words and gestures...

1460
01:34:14,424 --> 01:34:21,159
we record everything for use
in court.

1461
01:34:21,265 --> 01:34:25,167
This room is wired for both
sounds and pictures.

1462
01:34:25,435 --> 01:34:28,802
What they mean by 'spying' is...

1463
01:34:29,072 --> 01:34:32,599
the cameras and microphones
in this room.

1464
01:34:32,709 --> 01:34:35,109
What do you call this room?

1465
01:34:35,679 --> 01:34:37,579
The VIP Room.

1466
01:34:47,224 --> 01:34:47,883
Where to?

1467
01:34:47,991 --> 01:34:49,049
To court.

1468
01:34:49,159 --> 01:34:50,649
To stop the noise.

1469
01:34:51,361 --> 01:34:52,851
Can we do that?

1470
01:34:52,963 --> 01:34:55,523
I'll apply for an injunction.

1471
01:34:56,400 --> 01:34:57,867
What's that?

1472
01:34:57,968 --> 01:35:00,334
A preventive order.

1473
01:35:00,437 --> 01:35:03,668
In our case, preventing them from
contacting us.

1474
01:35:03,774 --> 01:35:06,641
And using speakers to slander us.

1475
01:35:06,743 --> 01:35:08,005
And threatening us.

1476
01:35:08,111 --> 01:35:11,808
And obstructing business.

1477
01:35:11,915 --> 01:35:13,678
Will they do it?

1478
01:35:13,784 --> 01:35:16,412
Our recording will help.

1479
01:35:16,520 --> 01:35:22,356
Fellow residents,
please listen to us.

1480
01:35:23,227 --> 01:35:26,663
Lawyer Inoue, did you know...

1481
01:35:26,897 --> 01:35:30,890
somebody wants to kill you?

1482
01:35:31,602 --> 01:35:35,265
You should be very careful.

1483
01:35:36,473 --> 01:35:39,704
Stop taking those fucking pictures.

1484
01:35:39,810 --> 01:35:42,711
Get out of here, you scumbag!

1485
01:35:44,615 --> 01:35:46,981
It's pretty awful.

1486
01:35:47,084 --> 01:35:49,416
I understand your situation.

1487
01:35:49,820 --> 01:35:54,223
I sympathize with you, but before
issuing an injunction...

1488
01:35:54,324 --> 01:35:57,191
We must summon the other party...

1489
01:35:57,294 --> 01:35:58,955
To hear their position.

1490
01:35:59,062 --> 01:36:01,530
But this is extremely urgent.

1491
01:36:01,632 --> 01:36:03,759
The situation is worsening.

1492
01:36:03,867 --> 01:36:05,391
Customers are leaving.

1493
01:36:05,502 --> 01:36:07,970
It's a question of survival.

1494
01:36:08,138 --> 01:36:10,072
The other party is a yakuza.

1495
01:36:12,709 --> 01:36:15,177
Call them on the phone.

1496
01:36:17,381 --> 01:36:18,313
Yes, sir.

1497
01:36:19,149 --> 01:36:22,550
We're fighting a mighty battle...

1498
01:36:22,653 --> 01:36:25,588
for the good of our community.

1499
01:36:26,523 --> 01:36:29,549
We got no time for any judge.

1500
01:36:29,760 --> 01:36:34,459
Our problem is with the hotel,
Not with any court.

1501
01:36:39,703 --> 01:36:43,264
Make a memo of that call
for the record.

1502
01:36:43,373 --> 01:36:44,704
Yes, sir.

1503
01:36:45,542 --> 01:36:47,237
I've decided.

1504
01:36:48,278 --> 01:36:54,774
I'll issue your injunction.

1505
01:36:55,519 --> 01:36:56,679
Thanks, Your Honor.

1506
01:36:58,755 --> 01:37:01,246
It's just a piece of paper.

1507
01:37:01,491 --> 01:37:03,550
They don't believe in paper.

1508
01:37:03,660 --> 01:37:05,389
They'll ignore it.

1509
01:37:05,495 --> 01:37:07,463
That's fine, too. You'll see.

1510
01:37:24,614 --> 01:37:25,911
I'm Ms. Inoue.

1511
01:37:26,016 --> 01:37:27,142
I'm the summons server.

1512
01:37:27,250 --> 01:37:30,413
They're yakuza, so I asked
for police help.

1513
01:37:30,520 --> 01:37:32,317
These are detective.

1514
01:37:32,756 --> 01:37:33,552
Hello.

1515
01:37:33,657 --> 01:37:34,783
That's it.

1516
01:37:49,206 --> 01:37:51,970
I'm from the court. Open up.

1517
01:37:55,445 --> 01:37:59,074
They think if they don't answer,
the injunction will vanish.

1518
01:38:00,984 --> 01:38:02,542
I know you're there!

1519
01:38:02,652 --> 01:38:03,710
Open up.!

1520
01:38:04,688 --> 01:38:06,952
If you don't, we'll break in!

1521
01:38:27,978 --> 01:38:30,071
Take it easy.

1522
01:38:35,218 --> 01:38:38,915
I hereby officially serve
this injunction.

1523
01:38:46,930 --> 01:38:47,988
Thanks so much.

1524
01:38:48,098 --> 01:38:49,292
Thank you, sir.

1525
01:38:50,934 --> 01:38:52,367
Thank you very much.

1526
01:39:11,254 --> 01:39:12,744
Hey, wait.

1527
01:39:13,457 --> 01:39:16,824
Hey, Wakasugi, I want to talk to you.

1528
01:39:17,094 --> 01:39:18,152
Come with me.

1529
01:39:18,261 --> 01:39:20,456
I'm the hotel's lawyer.

1530
01:39:20,564 --> 01:39:22,691
You may not speak to hotel
employees.

1531
01:39:22,799 --> 01:39:24,061
You must go through me.

1532
01:39:24,334 --> 01:39:25,358
What?

1533
01:39:25,469 --> 01:39:27,027
Why the fuck do that?

1534
01:39:27,137 --> 01:39:30,334
Hey, Wakasugi, did you hire
this fucking lawyer?

1535
01:39:30,607 --> 01:39:33,098
You trying to bust our balls?

1536
01:39:33,210 --> 01:39:34,336
Answer, punk!

1537
01:39:34,444 --> 01:39:37,641
You better apologize while
you still can.

1538
01:39:37,747 --> 01:39:41,478
Our boys are hotheaded.
Look at this one.

1539
01:39:41,651 --> 01:39:45,087
He doesn't mind doing time for me.

1540
01:39:46,056 --> 01:39:46,818
Don't!

1541
01:39:46,923 --> 01:39:48,584
Let me speak.

1542
01:39:50,127 --> 01:39:53,585
You're angry because you can't
handle a lawyer.

1543
01:39:53,697 --> 01:39:54,891
Well, too bad.

1544
01:39:54,998 --> 01:39:56,659
We already reported...

1545
01:39:56,766 --> 01:39:59,200
your complaints to the government.

1546
01:39:59,302 --> 01:40:01,293
If they fine us we'll pay them.

1547
01:40:01,404 --> 01:40:02,735
We'll never pay you.

1548
01:40:03,306 --> 01:40:05,206
If you come to our hotel...

1549
01:40:05,308 --> 01:40:07,276
you'll come in a herd, right?

1550
01:40:07,377 --> 01:40:10,005
Like the herd of steers you are.

1551
01:40:10,847 --> 01:40:11,939
Hold it.!

1552
01:40:14,718 --> 01:40:19,178
Wakasugi, you made me lose face.

1553
01:40:19,723 --> 01:40:21,918
We will meet again.

1554
01:40:31,168 --> 01:40:32,635
So that's the situation.

1555
01:40:32,736 --> 01:40:33,464
Now I understand.

1556
01:40:33,570 --> 01:40:36,095
Even through we got an injunction...

1557
01:40:36,206 --> 01:40:39,369
They'll ignore it and still barge in.

1558
01:40:39,476 --> 01:40:41,910
And then we can act.

1559
01:40:42,012 --> 01:40:42,910
Right?

1560
01:40:43,413 --> 01:40:47,372
Let us know when they
violate the injunction.

1561
01:40:47,484 --> 01:40:49,384
We're ready to pounce.

1562
01:40:49,486 --> 01:40:50,783
Thanks so much.

1563
01:40:56,159 --> 01:40:57,319
Now I see.

1564
01:40:57,527 --> 01:41:01,554
You got the in junction so
the police can act.

1565
01:41:01,665 --> 01:41:05,066
It should also keep them
away from us.

1566
01:41:05,702 --> 01:41:07,169
Is it over?

1567
01:41:07,837 --> 01:41:09,361
Let's hope so.

1568
01:41:13,276 --> 01:41:15,369
I've always wanted to ask...

1569
01:41:16,513 --> 01:41:19,880
Why aren't you afraid of yakuza?

1570
01:41:20,417 --> 01:41:21,475
Well...

1571
01:41:24,154 --> 01:41:28,147
Probably because I know them.

1572
01:41:31,628 --> 01:41:34,324
My father was a surgeon downtown.

1573
01:41:35,131 --> 01:41:39,295
Yakuza missing fingers or with stab
wounds often came to our clinic.

1574
01:41:40,437 --> 01:41:44,999
One big boss even used to
carry me piggyback.

1575
01:41:48,278 --> 01:41:53,147
One day he staggered in,
covered with blood.

1576
01:41:54,451 --> 01:41:56,351
Some family had shot him.

1577
01:41:57,621 --> 01:42:00,351
The shooters barged in and
demanded...

1578
01:42:01,791 --> 01:42:03,554
my father give his patient up.

1579
01:42:05,328 --> 01:42:07,888
Some carried swords or pistols.

1580
01:42:10,133 --> 01:42:12,328
My father refused.

1581
01:42:14,070 --> 01:42:16,538
He wouldn't surrender.

1582
01:42:20,577 --> 01:42:22,545
So, they shot him.

1583
01:42:26,283 --> 01:42:29,013
They took the boss to the beach.

1584
01:42:29,753 --> 01:42:33,655
They buried him alive in
the sand. Headfirst.

1585
01:42:37,260 --> 01:42:38,818
And your father?

1586
01:42:39,496 --> 01:42:41,396
An ambulance came.

1587
01:42:43,733 --> 01:42:47,066
But he was already dying.

1588
01:42:48,838 --> 01:42:50,567
I was bawling.

1589
01:42:53,043 --> 01:42:55,068
But he said:

1590
01:42:57,147 --> 01:42:59,445
Everybody dies sometime.

1591
01:43:00,917 --> 01:43:04,580
And it's better to die for your
beliefs than...

1592
01:43:05,722 --> 01:43:11,160
Live as a coward.
Remember that always.

1593
01:43:12,429 --> 01:43:17,867
After he said that, he raised
his hand...

1594
01:43:19,235 --> 01:43:23,831
Like this...

1595
01:43:26,543 --> 01:43:31,412
And died.

1596
01:43:34,984 --> 01:43:38,385
Few people are as strong
as he was.

1597
01:43:39,456 --> 01:43:41,651
Most people fear yakuza.

1598
01:43:42,525 --> 01:43:46,484
They're afraid to look at them,
let alone fight.

1599
01:43:47,831 --> 01:43:50,766
Yakuza trample people's pride.

1600
01:43:51,401 --> 01:43:53,528
They humiliate them.

1601
01:43:55,772 --> 01:43:58,206
I find that unforgivable.

1602
01:43:59,843 --> 01:44:02,141
They use fear...

1603
01:44:02,879 --> 01:44:06,178
To make people live like cowards.

1604
01:44:13,323 --> 01:44:13,914
Watch out!

1605
01:45:30,633 --> 01:45:31,964
Hang on!

1606
01:45:33,636 --> 01:45:35,763
I'll call an unbalance.

1607
01:45:57,894 --> 01:45:59,987
I'll get you next, Wakasugi!

1608
01:46:09,472 --> 01:46:11,667
Will she make it?

1609
01:46:14,043 --> 01:46:17,945
It missed the artery, but it's
still critical.

1610
01:46:18,448 --> 01:46:20,939
If an infection doesn't set in...

1611
01:46:22,585 --> 01:46:26,077
We'll know by later today
or tomorrow.

1612
01:46:31,594 --> 01:46:33,926
She got stabbed protecting me.

1613
01:46:34,030 --> 01:46:36,726
Because I tried to provoke them.

1614
01:46:37,300 --> 01:46:41,168
It's all my fault. It's all my fault...

1615
01:47:26,883 --> 01:47:28,544
Suzuki speaking.

1616
01:47:28,785 --> 01:47:31,049
They came back?

1617
01:47:31,788 --> 01:47:33,847
Yes, right away.

1618
01:47:43,733 --> 01:47:47,430
They're at the hotel.

1619
01:47:49,973 --> 01:47:50,962
Let's go!

1620
01:48:08,257 --> 01:48:09,417
Detective Akechi?

1621
01:48:10,026 --> 01:48:13,587
You can act at last.
They violated the injunction.

1622
01:48:13,863 --> 01:48:15,490
Right. How many?

1623
01:48:15,865 --> 01:48:18,663
Ibagi, Iriuchijima, and seven others.

1624
01:48:18,868 --> 01:48:19,857
Got it.

1625
01:48:20,269 --> 01:48:21,258
Let's go.

1626
01:48:34,217 --> 01:48:35,411
Do you want back-up?

1627
01:48:35,518 --> 01:48:36,712
No. Just ourselves.

1628
01:48:36,819 --> 01:48:37,911
I'll come too.

1629
01:48:38,021 --> 01:48:38,851
But, sir...

1630
01:48:38,955 --> 01:48:41,788
You act tough. I'll act weak.

1631
01:48:41,891 --> 01:48:43,950
Maybe we can trick them.

1632
01:49:04,013 --> 01:49:08,279
The court has forbidden you to
contact us.

1633
01:49:09,419 --> 01:49:17,451
It is illegal for you to enter this
building or speak to us.

1634
01:49:18,361 --> 01:49:22,422
We have nothing to discuss
with you.

1635
01:49:23,299 --> 01:49:23,993
Please leave.

1636
01:49:27,737 --> 01:49:30,001
We're local residents!

1637
01:49:30,373 --> 01:49:33,433
And we local residents aren't
satisfied.

1638
01:49:33,910 --> 01:49:37,744
One phone call and I'll have 2,000
men here.

1639
01:49:37,847 --> 01:49:39,974
And 20 trucks.

1640
01:49:40,083 --> 01:49:42,244
We can still stop the construction.

1641
01:49:43,686 --> 01:49:45,051
You got that?

1642
01:49:45,221 --> 01:49:46,813
So stop fucking around!

1643
01:49:46,923 --> 01:49:48,185
Got that?

1644
01:49:48,791 --> 01:49:50,782
I must remind you...

1645
01:49:51,294 --> 01:49:54,388
Everything you say or do
is being recorded.

1646
01:49:54,731 --> 01:49:55,993
What the fuck!

1647
01:49:56,099 --> 01:49:58,727
Who said you can record this?

1648
01:49:59,035 --> 01:50:01,003
Take it easy.

1649
01:50:01,704 --> 01:50:03,831
Our justice will prevail.

1650
01:50:03,940 --> 01:50:07,842
It's much nicer without that
lawyer cunt.

1651
01:50:07,944 --> 01:50:09,536
Is she sick?

1652
01:50:17,820 --> 01:50:21,517
So what's your answer?

1653
01:50:25,762 --> 01:50:26,922
Answer to what?

1654
01:50:27,363 --> 01:50:28,762
To the construction question.

1655
01:50:30,166 --> 01:50:31,656
Which construction question?

1656
01:50:32,068 --> 01:50:35,003
Our request to stop it.

1657
01:50:35,104 --> 01:50:37,595
You never got our approval.

1658
01:50:37,774 --> 01:50:39,173
You're insulting us!

1659
01:50:42,779 --> 01:50:44,838
Say something, huh!

1660
01:50:44,947 --> 01:50:46,539
Show your good faith!

1661
01:50:59,529 --> 01:51:02,362
Have they mentioned money?

1662
01:51:02,465 --> 01:51:04,023
No, not yet.

1663
01:51:06,302 --> 01:51:08,600
When they demand money,
we bust them.

1664
01:51:08,704 --> 01:51:09,636
Yes, sir.

1665
01:51:12,041 --> 01:51:15,067
Easy. Calm down.

1666
01:51:17,780 --> 01:51:19,748
Look, Mr. Suzuki.

1667
01:51:20,149 --> 01:51:21,980
This is a tough neighborhood.

1668
01:51:23,119 --> 01:51:26,020
You can't get
the residents' approval.

1669
01:51:26,689 --> 01:51:29,886
So leave it to us pros.

1670
01:51:29,992 --> 01:51:31,789
We'll settle everything for you.

1671
01:51:32,829 --> 01:51:35,627
Answer him! Say something!

1672
01:51:36,265 --> 01:51:38,426
What exactly are you saying?

1673
01:51:38,768 --> 01:51:41,828
Are you retarded? Or just
playing dumb?

1674
01:51:42,238 --> 01:51:44,798
I really don't understand.

1675
01:51:45,575 --> 01:51:49,841
What must we do to prove
our 'good faith' to you?

1676
01:51:50,079 --> 01:51:51,239
Fuck!

1677
01:51:51,581 --> 01:51:53,276
Figure it out yourself.

1678
01:51:53,516 --> 01:51:56,212
I'm sorry. I still can't figure it out.

1679
01:51:57,053 --> 01:52:02,218
Since the board must approve,
your requests must be specific.

1680
01:52:03,025 --> 01:52:05,459
Does 'good faith' mean money?

1681
01:52:06,762 --> 01:52:08,696
We just want you to be reasonable.

1682
01:52:09,465 --> 01:52:11,763
What do you mean by 'reasonable'?

1683
01:52:12,001 --> 01:52:15,994
By answering the complaints of
residents.

1684
01:52:16,339 --> 01:52:20,036
Will that involve paying the residents
money?

1685
01:52:20,409 --> 01:52:22,001
Should we pay you?

1686
01:52:22,912 --> 01:52:26,609
How much are you asking for?

1687
01:52:26,716 --> 01:52:29,378
I must give the board an
exact figure.

1688
01:52:30,553 --> 01:52:33,852
I'm talking to myself, understand?

1689
01:52:36,893 --> 01:52:43,492
Other companies usually pay about
zero-point-zero- five.

1690
01:52:44,400 --> 01:52:47,892
Does that mean five percent?

1691
01:52:48,504 --> 01:52:49,664
But five percent of what?

1692
01:52:49,972 --> 01:52:51,337
You stupid fucker!

1693
01:52:51,440 --> 01:52:53,840
Of your $200 million
construction cost.

1694
01:52:53,943 --> 01:52:56,503
There.! He mentioned an amount!

1695
01:52:56,812 --> 01:52:57,904
Can we bust them?

1696
01:52:59,115 --> 01:53:02,016
That's $10 million, isn't it?

1697
01:53:03,786 --> 01:53:06,812
There's no reason to pay you
anything.

1698
01:53:09,191 --> 01:53:10,783
The court can decide.

1699
01:53:12,962 --> 01:53:15,396
This is our final decision.

1700
01:53:15,865 --> 01:53:16,661
You may go.

1701
01:53:16,999 --> 01:53:18,864
Fuck the court!

1702
01:53:20,136 --> 01:53:22,866
We're the victims of your pollution.!

1703
01:53:22,972 --> 01:53:24,132
You know that?

1704
01:53:24,240 --> 01:53:27,505
Are you going to take your
victims to court?

1705
01:53:27,910 --> 01:53:29,502
Don't act innocent!

1706
01:53:29,612 --> 01:53:32,638
Now that's an obvious threat.

1707
01:53:32,748 --> 01:53:34,978
Hey, hold it!

1708
01:53:36,252 --> 01:53:37,412
Hold it.

1709
01:53:57,106 --> 01:53:58,971
Say, Mr. Kobayashi.

1710
01:53:59,675 --> 01:54:05,477
You're not going to be unreasonable
like them, are you?

1711
01:54:06,215 --> 01:54:08,683
What do you mean?

1712
01:54:09,719 --> 01:54:13,655
You know what happens
if you let us down.

1713
01:54:15,391 --> 01:54:17,018
I'm afraid so.

1714
01:54:17,960 --> 01:54:19,825
Then what's your answer?

1715
01:54:22,498 --> 01:54:27,663
If we pay you, will you promise
to give me the pictures?

1716
01:54:27,970 --> 01:54:29,562
Sure, I will.

1717
01:54:31,140 --> 01:54:33,074
And if we refuse?

1718
01:54:33,442 --> 01:54:36,969
I'll distribute them.

1719
01:54:37,780 --> 01:54:41,648
The scandal might force
your hotel to close.

1720
01:54:42,284 --> 01:54:44,184
You'll be fired.

1721
01:54:44,453 --> 01:54:45,818
If that's what you want...

1722
01:54:46,088 --> 01:54:47,112
You fool!

1723
01:54:47,523 --> 01:54:50,754
You just admitted to blackmail.!

1724
01:54:51,927 --> 01:54:53,895
We arrest you for extortion.!

1725
01:54:54,530 --> 01:54:56,657
Where's your warrant?

1726
01:54:57,500 --> 01:54:59,058
Show me the warrant!

1727
01:54:59,268 --> 01:55:01,532
We caught you red-handed.

1728
01:55:02,938 --> 01:55:03,927
Ibagi.!

1729
01:55:04,673 --> 01:55:05,662
Hey.!

1730
01:55:06,308 --> 01:55:08,970
One of your boys stabbed Ms. Inoue.

1731
01:55:09,078 --> 01:55:12,275
We caught him and he confessed
you ordered it.

1732
01:55:12,848 --> 01:55:14,475
You're an accomplice.

1733
01:55:15,051 --> 01:55:16,609
You'll get 20 years.

1734
01:56:42,004 --> 01:56:43,232
Welcome back.

1735
01:56:45,774 --> 01:56:46,832
Are you OK?

1736
01:56:47,009 --> 01:56:47,873
I'm fine.

1737
01:56:47,977 --> 01:56:48,909
Don't strain yourself.

1738
01:56:49,011 --> 01:56:51,036
Really, I'm fine.

1739
01:56:52,748 --> 01:56:53,680
Goodness!

1740
01:56:55,251 --> 01:56:58,049
They're completely disappeared.

1741
01:56:59,321 --> 01:57:01,016
Even their smell is gone.

1742
01:57:01,357 --> 01:57:02,756
Do you miss it?

1743
01:57:07,429 --> 01:57:08,760
Yakuza are coming.

1744
01:57:08,864 --> 01:57:10,126
With their bosses.

1745
01:57:10,232 --> 01:57:13,065
There's at least 20 of them.

1746
01:57:16,272 --> 01:57:17,830
Let's get ready.

1747
01:57:25,281 --> 01:57:27,181
Get out of our way!

1748
01:57:27,850 --> 01:57:29,647
Who the fuck are you?

1749
01:57:30,845 --> 01:57:32,145
An employee of this hotel.

1750
01:57:32,254 --> 01:57:33,846
What the fuck!

1751
01:57:34,223 --> 01:57:35,588
Out of our way!

1752
01:57:37,092 --> 01:57:40,220
In accordance with our regulations...

1753
01:57:40,930 --> 01:57:45,264
Members of your profession
may not use our facilities.

1754
01:57:47,236 --> 01:57:49,898
But if you come alone and act
discreetly...

1755
01:57:50,005 --> 01:57:51,870
You may use them.

1756
01:57:52,808 --> 01:57:54,503
However, we will not allow...

1757
01:57:54,710 --> 01:58:00,444
you to enter accompanied so
brazenly by this many others...

1758
01:58:01,150 --> 01:58:04,517
who are so obviously members of
your profession.

1759
01:58:09,158 --> 01:58:15,358
We host important government
officials from abroad and...

1760
01:58:16,131 --> 01:58:21,797
have been ordered by the
government to maintain...

1761
01:58:22,404 --> 01:58:25,635
a certain image and atmosphere.

1762
01:58:26,342 --> 01:58:30,802
I mean no disrespect. I am only
asking for your understanding.

1763
01:58:31,814 --> 01:58:37,377
We cannot let you enter our
premises today.

1764
01:58:37,920 --> 01:58:39,353
Shut the fuck up.!

1765
01:58:42,124 --> 01:58:43,489
Don't fuck with us.

1766
01:59:47,456 --> 01:59:48,582
We did it!
