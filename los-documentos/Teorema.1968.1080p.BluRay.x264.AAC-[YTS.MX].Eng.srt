2
00:00:16,583 --> 00:00:20,249
Your boss has given you this factory.
What do you think?

3
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,332
So he's the main character
in this story?

4
00:00:24,583 --> 00:00:28,124
Hasn't this blocked all chance of
a workers' revolution in the future?

5
00:00:28,833 --> 00:00:34,040
Is his act unique, or a general
modern world tendency?

6
00:00:34,166 --> 00:00:36,082
A general tendency, I think

7
00:00:36,416 --> 00:00:40,624
Can such acts, as symbols of
a new source of power…

8
00:00:40,875 --> 00:00:46,874
…herald the transformation of
all humanity into the bourgeoisie?

9
00:00:47,625 --> 00:00:51,957
The bourgeoisie will never turn
all humanity into bourgeoisie

10
00:00:52,583 --> 00:00:55,374
So the not very original answer is:

11
00:00:55,625 --> 00:00:58,915
No matter what he does, even giving
away a factory…

12
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:01,790
…a bourgeois is always wrong

13
00:01:02,041 --> 00:01:04,832
- Is that it?
- I don't want to reply

14
00:01:05,166 --> 00:01:07,374
This bourgeoisie is making
revolutionary changes…

15
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:09,415
…in our situation

16
00:01:09,666 --> 00:01:13,249
It's identifying all humanity
with the bourgeois class

17
00:01:13,583 --> 00:01:16,124
It no longer faces a class struggle…

18
00:01:16,458 --> 00:01:19,749
…using the army, the nation
or the church

19
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,332
Then it would fail; it would lose
its natural allies

20
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:28,582
You must answer the new questions
raised by the bourgeoisie

21
00:01:28,708 --> 00:01:30,499
Of course

22
00:01:30,625 --> 00:01:35,832
What are the answers to these
questions?

23
00:03:58,166 --> 00:04:02,165
God led the people about
through the way of the wilderness

24
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:14,082
ARRIVING TOMORROW

25
00:08:26,666 --> 00:08:28,499
Pietro, how about some music?

26
00:13:16,666 --> 00:13:20,832
Well, do you feel better?

27
00:13:22,166 --> 00:13:24,165
It was nothing

28
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:36,457
Sorry. I'm afraid it's all rather
makeshift

29
00:15:36,791 --> 00:15:38,540
It's fine

30
00:15:43,458 --> 00:15:45,457
It's been a real invasion

31
00:15:51,125 --> 00:15:53,957
I used to sleep in this room
when I was little

32
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:31,332
I'm here

33
00:23:56,541 --> 00:23:58,249
Sorry

34
00:25:45,375 --> 00:25:47,415
Your friends are calling you

35
00:25:54,625 --> 00:25:56,332
You're a serious player

36
00:26:12,458 --> 00:26:14,999
These are my friends

37
00:30:03,958 --> 00:30:05,624
What's the time?

38
00:30:06,333 --> 00:30:07,457
I don't know

39
00:30:07,958 --> 00:30:12,499
- What does it matter?
- It's six o'clock

40
00:31:21,291 --> 00:31:24,374
It's about a sick man like me

41
00:31:28,625 --> 00:31:33,540
Even in this disagreeable situation
Ivan Ilyich found comfort

42
00:31:33,833 --> 00:31:39,082
Gerasim came to wash him. Gerasim
was a clean, fresh peasant boy

43
00:33:56,541 --> 00:33:58,082
What are you reading?

44
00:33:58,625 --> 00:34:00,874
His life was his and his alone

45
00:34:01,208 --> 00:34:06,165
It would take longer to duplicate
his goodness than to create a star

46
00:34:07,083 --> 00:34:10,665
The godhead which had come
without my hoping for it…

47
00:34:10,916 --> 00:34:13,874
…has not returned, and will
never return again

48
00:37:27,791 --> 00:37:32,665
I like speeding. Now I'll show you
what the car can do

49
00:37:32,916 --> 00:37:35,874
I believe you, but I'm not young
any more

50
00:37:52,208 --> 00:37:54,082
You're not Gerasim…

51
00:37:54,375 --> 00:37:56,957
…it's difficult to face you

52
00:38:00,458 --> 00:38:04,957
There are two reasons
I must talk to you

53
00:38:05,375 --> 00:38:09,999
Firstly, there's my moral sense

54
00:38:11,291 --> 00:38:16,082
Then there's a sort of confusion
within me…

55
00:38:17,791 --> 00:38:23,207
…which maybe I can only clarify
by talking about it

56
00:40:31,125 --> 00:40:35,582
You have seduced me, Lord,
and I have let myself be seduced

57
00:40:36,166 --> 00:40:39,665
You have violated me
and you have prevailed

58
00:40:40,833 --> 00:40:46,415
I have become an object of daily
derision, everyone mocks me

59
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:53,124
For I heard the defaming of many,
terror on every side

60
00:40:53,708 --> 00:40:56,665
"Denounce him, and we will
denounce him"

61
00:40:58,166 --> 00:41:01,457
All my friends awaited my downfall,
saying:

62
00:41:02,125 --> 00:41:05,415
"Perhaps he will let himself be
seduced…

63
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,457
"…and we shall take our revenge
on him"

64
00:41:39,250 --> 00:41:42,874
What did you say? So you do talk!

65
00:42:19,666 --> 00:42:22,874
I must go. Tomorrow

66
00:42:31,958 --> 00:42:33,957
I don't know myself any more

67
00:42:34,333 --> 00:42:38,124
Because what made me the same
as others has been destroyed

68
00:42:38,416 --> 00:42:43,165
I was like all the others,
maybe with many faults

69
00:42:43,416 --> 00:42:48,207
You've made me different by taking
me from the natural order of things

70
00:42:48,458 --> 00:42:52,207
While you were near,
I didn't realise it

71
00:42:52,708 --> 00:42:55,749
Now I understand, you're leaving…

72
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:00,374
…and knowing I'm losing you
makes me aware of my difference

73
00:43:01,125 --> 00:43:03,790
What will become of me from now on?

74
00:43:03,916 --> 00:43:08,790
The future will be like living with
someone nothing to do with myself

75
00:43:09,291 --> 00:43:14,165
Maybe I must probe the depths of
this difference you have revealed…

76
00:43:14,416 --> 00:43:18,082
…which is the innermost anguish
of my being

77
00:43:18,333 --> 00:43:24,915
But whether I desire it or not, won't
this set me against everyone?

78
00:43:29,458 --> 00:43:32,665
I realise now that I've never had…

79
00:43:33,416 --> 00:43:37,082
…any real interest in anything

80
00:43:39,166 --> 00:43:42,415
I don't mean some special interest

81
00:43:42,541 --> 00:43:46,624
Not even ordinary interests,
like my husband's in his work…

82
00:43:46,750 --> 00:43:50,874
…or my son's in his studies,
or Odetta's domestic cult

83
00:43:52,875 --> 00:43:54,874
I had no interests

84
00:43:55,541 --> 00:43:59,999
I don't know how I could lead
such an empty life, but I did…

85
00:44:00,666 --> 00:44:07,124
If there was anything…
some instinctive love of life…

86
00:44:07,458 --> 00:44:12,249
…it dried up like a garden
where nobody goes

87
00:44:13,750 --> 00:44:19,165
That emptiness was filled
with false, mean values…

88
00:44:19,333 --> 00:44:23,082
…with a hideous load of false ideas

89
00:44:25,250 --> 00:44:30,999
Now I realise it, you've filled
my life with a total interest

90
00:44:32,791 --> 00:44:37,957
So, in parting, you're not destroying
anything I had before…

91
00:44:38,083 --> 00:44:42,540
…except perhaps my chaste bourgeois
reputation. What do I care?

92
00:44:44,250 --> 00:44:47,415
But what you yourself gave me…

93
00:44:47,875 --> 00:44:51,582
…love in my empty life…

94
00:44:52,583 --> 00:44:55,915
…by leaving me
you're destroying it completely

95
00:44:57,458 --> 00:45:00,374
By knowing me, you've made me
a normal girl

96
00:45:01,166 --> 00:45:04,374
You've made me find the right
solution for my life

97
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:09,165
Before, I didn't know men,
but I was afraid of them

98
00:45:09,666 --> 00:45:12,124
I loved only my father

99
00:45:13,250 --> 00:45:17,540
But now, in leaving me,
you're making me worse than before

100
00:45:19,166 --> 00:45:22,457
Did you want that? Now the pain
of losing you…

101
00:45:22,958 --> 00:45:28,749
…will cause a relapse more
dangerous than the sickness I had…

102
00:45:28,875 --> 00:45:32,999
…before this brief cure
that your presence brought

103
00:45:33,125 --> 00:45:36,540
Before, I didn't understand
this illness, but now I do

104
00:45:37,375 --> 00:45:41,540
Through the love you gave me
I've become aware of my illness

105
00:45:42,583 --> 00:45:47,165
Now how can I replace you?
Is there anyone who can?

106
00:45:47,291 --> 00:45:51,874
I don't think I can go on living

107
00:46:29,666 --> 00:46:32,874
You must have come here to destroy

108
00:46:34,250 --> 00:46:38,874
The destruction you've caused in me
couldn't be more complete

109
00:46:40,916 --> 00:46:45,124
You've simply destroyed the image
I always had of myself

110
00:46:45,708 --> 00:46:48,749
Now I can't see anything at all…

111
00:46:49,791 --> 00:46:52,749
…that can rebuild my identity

112
00:46:53,708 --> 00:46:55,707
What do you suggest?

113
00:46:57,083 --> 00:47:00,832
A scandal like death
in the eyes of society…

114
00:47:01,958 --> 00:47:03,874
…a complete loss of myself

115
00:47:04,791 --> 00:47:08,832
How can this be for a man
used to the idea of order…

116
00:47:08,958 --> 00:47:13,124
…of the future and, above all,
of ownership?

117
00:47:28,666 --> 00:47:31,540
- I'll carry it
- No, I'll carry it

118
00:47:32,333 --> 00:47:34,332
Then let's carry it together

119
00:55:10,583 --> 00:55:14,374
- Have you got a tape measure?
- At once, miss

120
00:58:55,750 --> 00:58:58,165
Time to eat, miss

121
00:59:57,458 --> 00:59:59,665
I can't help it. It's beyond my
expertise. Sorry

122
01:01:03,875 --> 01:01:05,874
Open your fist, miss, please

123
01:05:14,666 --> 01:05:18,374
How pathetic! I'm a real shit!

124
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:43,915
I'm not eating

125
01:05:46,125 --> 01:05:48,999
You must eat. It's good

126
01:05:50,166 --> 01:05:52,415
I don't want to

127
01:05:53,750 --> 01:05:56,165
Why don't you want to eat? It's good

128
01:05:59,416 --> 01:06:02,165
At least tell us what you want to eat

129
01:07:42,583 --> 01:07:46,832
We must try to invent new techniques,
unrecognisable…

130
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:52,540
…which are unlike any
previous method…

131
01:07:53,500 --> 01:07:56,707
…to avoid childishness, ridicule…

132
01:07:58,458 --> 01:08:03,790
…make our world unlike any other…

133
01:08:06,625 --> 01:08:10,249
…where previous standards
don't apply…

134
01:08:11,125 --> 01:08:13,915
…which must be new,
like the technique

135
01:08:16,166 --> 01:08:19,332
Nobody must realise that
the artist is worthless…

136
01:08:19,458 --> 01:08:22,874
…that he's an abnormal,
inferior being…

137
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:26,874
…who squirms and twists like a worm
to survive

138
01:08:30,166 --> 01:08:33,540
Nobody must ever catch him out
as naive

139
01:08:36,083 --> 01:08:38,624
Everything must be presented
as perfect…

140
01:08:40,750 --> 01:08:46,624
…based on unknown,
unquestionable rules…

141
01:08:47,041 --> 01:08:49,582
…like a madman, that's it

142
01:08:50,625 --> 01:08:54,790
Pane after pane, because I can't
correct anything…

143
01:08:56,166 --> 01:08:58,540
…and nobody must notice

144
01:09:00,125 --> 01:09:02,915
A sign painted on a pane…

145
01:09:03,833 --> 01:09:06,499
…corrects, without soiling it…

146
01:09:07,625 --> 01:09:10,540
…a sign painted earlier
on another pane

147
01:09:13,166 --> 01:09:16,624
But everyone must believe…

148
01:09:16,750 --> 01:09:21,874
…that it isn't the trick of an
untalented artist, impotent artist

149
01:09:23,500 --> 01:09:28,332
Not at all. It must look like
a sure decision…

150
01:09:28,458 --> 01:09:31,874
…fearless, lofty and
almost arrogant

151
01:09:35,166 --> 01:09:41,124
Nobody must know that a sign
succeeds by chance… is fragile

152
01:09:44,125 --> 01:09:48,624
That as soon as a sign appears
well made, by a miracle…

153
01:09:50,708 --> 01:09:55,832
…it must be protected,
looked after, as in a shrine

154
01:09:57,791 --> 01:10:00,832
But nobody must realise…

155
01:10:02,333 --> 01:10:06,415
…that the artist is a poor,
trembling idiot, second-rate…

156
01:10:06,541 --> 01:10:12,707
…living by chance and risk,
in disgrace like a child…

157
01:10:13,416 --> 01:10:16,999
…his life reduced to absurd
melancholy…

158
01:10:17,125 --> 01:10:23,749
…degraded by the feeling of
something lost for ever

159
01:11:18,083 --> 01:11:21,040
DOWN WITH ALL STATES

160
01:11:21,166 --> 01:11:24,415
DOWN WITH ALL CHURCHES

161
01:11:24,541 --> 01:11:27,415
UP WITH PAINTERS OF…

162
01:11:41,625 --> 01:11:43,915
Blue reminds me of him

163
01:11:44,041 --> 01:11:48,582
But obviously blue isn't enough,
it's only a part

164
01:11:48,708 --> 01:11:54,040
Who can permit me such mutilation,
what ideology can justify it?

165
01:11:54,666 --> 01:11:58,040
Weren't my first miserable attempts
at portraits better?

166
01:12:25,916 --> 01:12:32,040
Look at the state she's in,
eating nettles

167
01:12:32,166 --> 01:12:34,290
Lord, what a scandal

168
01:17:03,500 --> 01:17:04,790
I don't smoke

169
01:24:27,291 --> 01:24:29,165
Which is the road back to Milan?

170
01:24:31,625 --> 01:24:34,165
Turn left, then straight on

171
01:27:55,583 --> 01:27:57,749
What would happen to me if…

172
01:27:59,666 --> 01:28:03,665
…I stripped myself of everything,
gave my factory to the workers?

173
01:33:04,208 --> 01:33:05,832
Let's go

174
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:18,124
Don't be afraid, I didn't come to die,
but to weep

175
01:35:19,166 --> 01:35:20,749
Not tears of sorrow

176
01:35:21,416 --> 01:35:25,915
No, they will be a source…
but not a source of suffering

177
01:35:32,375 --> 01:35:34,332
Go away now

178
01:38:06,231 --> 01:38:11,231
