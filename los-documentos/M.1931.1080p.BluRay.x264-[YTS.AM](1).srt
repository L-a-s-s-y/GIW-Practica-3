3
00:00:39,728 --> 00:00:44,774
The man in black will soon be here

4
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:49,737
With his cleaver's blade so true

5
00:00:50,322 --> 00:00:54,033
He'll make mincemeat out of you!

6
00:00:54,285 --> 00:00:55,743
You're out.

7
00:01:16,974 --> 00:01:20,393
I told you to stop singing
that awful song!

8
00:01:21,312 --> 00:01:23,146
Didn't you hear me?

9
00:01:26,567 --> 00:01:28,776
That same cursed song over and over!

10
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:55,386
Dear me, that's heavy.

11
00:02:16,367 --> 00:02:17,825
What's the matter?

12
00:02:18,744 --> 00:02:21,954
I told those kids to stop
singing that awful song,

13
00:02:22,206 --> 00:02:24,582
but they sing it all day long.

14
00:02:24,833 --> 00:02:27,085
As if we haven't heard
enough of that murderer already.

15
00:02:27,252 --> 00:02:28,836
Ah, leave 'em alone.

16
00:02:29,088 --> 00:02:31,297
As long as we can hear 'em singing,

17
00:02:31,423 --> 00:02:33,758
at least we know
they're still there.

18
00:02:34,051 --> 00:02:37,136
Yes, I guess you're right.

"Little Kurt Klawitzky and his sister Klara
have been missing since June 11th.

22
00:04:18,363 --> 00:04:21,199
Evidence leads us to believe
the children were victims of a crime

23
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:24,744
similar to that committed
last fall against the Doering siblings."

24

Elsie Beckmann.

27

Didn't Elsie come with you?

28

No, she didn't.

Thank you.

31
00:05:59,464 --> 00:06:02,633
A thrilling new chapter, Mrs. Beckmann.
Passionate and moving.

32
00:06:04,386 --> 00:06:06,387
Just a moment, Mr. Gehrke.

33
00:06:09,141 --> 00:06:10,808
Tell me, Mr. Gehrke.

34
00:06:11,935 --> 00:06:13,853
Have you seen little Elsie?

35
00:06:14,104 --> 00:06:17,106
No. Didn't she just
come up the stairs?

36
00:06:17,482 --> 00:06:20,318
No, she's not home yet.

37
00:06:20,485 --> 00:06:23,195
She won't be long now.
Good-bye.

38

it is likely to assume.

63
00:10:04,376 --> 00:10:07,503
A little candy, a toy, or an apple

64
00:10:07,921 --> 00:10:12,049
can suffice to lure a child
to his or her doom."

65
00:10:12,509 --> 00:10:14,385
Very true!

66

- You know very well.

78

Me, or a man who chases little girls?

Searching a man's house
based on an anonymous letter!

95
00:11:53,109 --> 00:11:57,988
Mr. Jäger, please calm down.
We're only doing our job.

96
00:11:58,323 --> 00:12:02,159
As if it weren't enough
that we're in constant fear for our kids!

97
00:12:02,369 --> 00:12:06,497
You see? That's why the police
must follow up every lead.

98
00:12:06,957 --> 00:12:09,708
Any man on the street
could be the murderer.

99
00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:14,338
Can you please tell me
what time it is?

100
00:12:14,506 --> 00:12:16,006
Yes, my child.

101
00:12:22,555 --> 00:12:26,684
Now you must hurry home.
Where do you live?

102

What's it to you
where the kid lives?

103
00:12:32,357 --> 00:12:33,315
Excuse me?

104
00:12:33,441 --> 00:12:35,192
What do you want with that kid?

105
00:12:36,319 --> 00:12:38,862
Absolutely nothing!

106
00:12:39,072 --> 00:12:41,282
What do you want with me?

107
00:12:41,533 --> 00:12:43,158
I'll show you what I want!

108
00:12:43,368 --> 00:12:46,870
Let me go!
This is an outrage!

109
00:12:47,122 --> 00:12:49,039
- What's going on?
- This is an outrage!

110
00:12:49,249 --> 00:12:51,959
- What does Four-Eyes want?
- Don't get so excited.

111
00:12:52,127 --> 00:12:55,170
First chatting up children...
- Punch him in the face!

112
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:56,797
then acting like a big shot!

113
00:12:56,923 --> 00:13:00,884
Will you let me go!
I didn't even speak to the child!

114
00:13:01,052 --> 00:13:03,929
- Get her alone, eh?
- And kill her like the others, right?

115
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:07,182
- He's the murderer!
- Hold him!

116
00:13:07,392 --> 00:13:08,642
Call the police!

117
00:13:08,893 --> 00:13:12,980
- Never around when you need 'em!
- Officer!

118
00:13:15,692 --> 00:13:19,111
Make way, gentlemen.
Let us through.

119
00:13:19,362 --> 00:13:23,907
Sure, you can catch pickpockets!
Why don't you catch the murderer instead!

120
00:13:24,034 --> 00:13:26,201
What? ls he the murderer?

121
00:13:27,954 --> 00:13:29,455
Break it up!
Come on, move along!

122
00:13:29,706 --> 00:13:31,874
- The murderer!
- The monster!

123
00:13:33,209 --> 00:13:34,752
Get him!

124
00:13:36,421 --> 00:13:38,422
Tackle him!

This is a terrible scandal!

Imagine the effect such a note
will have on the public, Commissioner!

133
00:14:11,623 --> 00:14:14,792
This is simply irresponsible!

134

Mr. Secretary, we cannot stop the murderer
from writing to whomever he wishes!

135

This severely pathological man
probably takes great pleasure

136

in seeing his crimes
covered in the press.

137
00:14:29,891 --> 00:14:32,601
We immediately got in touch
with the newspaper

138
00:14:32,727 --> 00:14:35,104
and had them send us
the original letter.

You got that?
- Yes.

The partially disrupted and uneven style

00:16:08,198 --> 00:16:10,240
But we need results!

161
00:16:10,492 --> 00:16:12,075
Results!

162
00:16:15,413 --> 00:16:19,458
Mr. Secretary, my men haven't gotten
12 hours' sleep in an entire week!

163
00:16:20,001 --> 00:16:23,795
<i>My riot squads
don't get a moment's peace.</i>

164
00:16:24,005 --> 00:16:29,134
<i>They report for duty almost more fatigued
than when they were dismissed,</i>

165
00:16:29,636 --> 00:16:33,931
<i>because the painstaking nature
of their work wears on the nerves,</i>

166
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:38,852
<i>and 80% - if not 90% -
of our leads are false.</i>

167
00:16:39,187 --> 00:16:42,272
<i>The homicide squad doesn't even
get time to change clothes.</i>

168
00:16:42,524 --> 00:16:46,777
<i>They're constantly on call,
always tense and alert,</i>

169
00:16:47,111 --> 00:16:49,404
<i>ever ready to spring into action,</i>

170
00:16:49,531 --> 00:16:52,407
<i>to follow even the slightest lead,</i>

171
00:16:52,617 --> 00:16:55,285
<i>as it just might be
the one that solves the case.</i>

172
00:16:55,578 --> 00:16:59,122
<i>Mr. Secretary, just consider
the search of the crime scene.</i>

173
00:17:00,625 --> 00:17:02,751
<i>To give you an example:</i>

174
00:17:02,919 --> 00:17:07,714
<i>In the bushes
just behind a picket fence,</i>

175
00:17:08,174 --> 00:17:14,179
<i>a small, white, crumpled
paper wrapping was found.</i>

176
00:17:15,306 --> 00:17:17,975
<i>It apparently once contained
inexpensive sweets.</i>

177
00:17:18,851 --> 00:17:21,019
<i>In the outermost corner</i>

178
00:17:21,145 --> 00:17:24,147
<i>were found traces of fruit drops</i>

179
00:17:24,399 --> 00:17:27,484
<i>and particles of powdered sugar.</i>

180
00:17:28,611 --> 00:17:30,821
<i>We've tried to trace the origin
of this wrapper</i>

181
00:17:30,947 --> 00:17:36,451
<i>in every candy shop and grocery store
within a radius of a mile and a half,</i>

182
00:17:37,287 --> 00:17:38,954
<i>but all to no avail.</i>

183
00:17:40,081 --> 00:17:43,166
<i>With each passing day
we expand the area searched.</i>

184
00:17:46,504 --> 00:17:50,424
<i>But, of course,
after such a long time,</i>

185
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:54,678
<i>no one remembers anything
that could serve as a lead.</i>

186
00:17:55,847 --> 00:17:59,016
<i>Despite all these setbacks,</i>

187
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:03,729
<i>we're forced to press on
in our investigation,</i>

188
00:18:03,855 --> 00:18:05,480
<i>always in uncertainty,</i>

189
00:18:05,607 --> 00:18:08,692
<i>and with little chance of success</i>

190
00:18:08,901 --> 00:18:12,779
<i>in bringing the case
even one step closer to its conclusion.</i>

191
00:18:12,905 --> 00:18:14,197
<i>Our men are doing everyth...</i>

192
00:18:14,365 --> 00:18:16,742
What good is all this?

193
00:18:16,993 --> 00:18:20,078
Commissioner,
I'm aware you're not dawdling,

194
00:18:20,204 --> 00:18:24,082
but that doesn't change the fact
that an unknown killer

195
00:18:24,334 --> 00:18:28,045
is terrorizing 4 1/2 million people!

196
00:18:28,171 --> 00:18:30,130
And the police are getting nowhere!

197
00:18:32,467 --> 00:18:35,761
Mr. Secretary, you don't seem
to have a clear picture

198
00:18:35,887 --> 00:18:40,557
of the enormous obstacles
confronting our forces.

199
00:18:41,225 --> 00:18:42,893
Do you realize, for example,

200
00:18:43,061 --> 00:18:47,439
regarding the route
the child took home,

201
00:18:47,815 --> 00:18:52,986
that there are 15 conflicting
eyewitness accounts alone?

202
00:18:53,154 --> 00:18:55,697
Let me give you a random example:

203
00:18:55,948 --> 00:18:59,826
"Testimony 1,478
in the Beckmann murder case..."

204
00:18:59,952 --> 00:19:01,995
- You've got no clue.
- More than you, mister!

205
00:19:02,121 --> 00:19:04,706
Gentlemen!

206
00:19:04,832 --> 00:19:08,877
You must at least know the color
of the cap the little girl wore

207
00:19:09,003 --> 00:19:11,755
whom you say you saw
with the stranger!

208
00:19:11,881 --> 00:19:13,757
Of course, Inspector.
It was red!

209
00:19:13,925 --> 00:19:16,885
- It was green!
- Red!

210
00:19:20,932 --> 00:19:23,934
Stop! This is pointless!

211
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:27,354
Thank you, gentlemen.
- You're welcome!

212
00:19:27,939 --> 00:19:29,439
Next witness.

213
00:19:29,774 --> 00:19:33,151
If you rely
on a color-blind man for clues,

214
00:19:33,277 --> 00:19:35,654
don't be surprised
if you get nowhere!

215
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:38,615
In their hunt
for this unknown killer,

216
00:19:38,866 --> 00:19:43,286
the police have tracked down
more than 1,500 detailed leads.

217
00:19:43,705 --> 00:19:47,582
The files in this case
fill 60 thick volumes.

218
00:19:47,917 --> 00:19:49,626
We've dispatched all our forces

219
00:19:49,794 --> 00:19:52,421
<i>to systematically comb
the area adjoining the city.</i>

220
00:19:52,964 --> 00:19:56,133
<i>Every piece of undergrowth is scoured,
every thicket searched,</i>

221
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:58,051
<i>every bush examined,</i>

222
00:19:58,177 --> 00:20:01,471
<i>since any bush or hollow
could harbor some object</i>

223
00:20:01,597 --> 00:20:03,932
<i>that could finally set us
on the right track.</i>

224
00:20:04,892 --> 00:20:06,727
<i>We called in police dogs.</i>

225
00:20:06,853 --> 00:20:09,604
<i>We set the best trackers
on the faintest of traces,</i>

226
00:20:09,731 --> 00:20:11,273
<i>but they lost the scent</i>

227
00:20:11,399 --> 00:20:13,650
<i>and failed to pick it up again
despite all efforts.</i>

228
00:20:14,318 --> 00:20:15,736
<i>Since the first murders,</i>

229
00:20:15,862 --> 00:20:19,531
<i>the police have searched
homeless shelters night after night,</i>

230
00:20:19,782 --> 00:20:22,492
<i>subjecting everyone in them
to thorough scrutiny.</i>

231
00:20:23,035 --> 00:20:26,246
<i>This does not, of course,
make the police very popular,</i>

232
00:20:26,372 --> 00:20:28,665
<i>nor does it reduce
the general public's anxiety.</i>

233
00:20:29,125 --> 00:20:33,795
<i>Railway stations are kept
under surveillance around the clock.</i>

234
00:20:34,005 --> 00:20:38,008
<i>Still, the investigation has not yet
yielded the slightest results,</i>

235
00:20:38,176 --> 00:20:42,220
<i>nor have nightly raids
in the criminal districts.</i>

236
00:22:14,105 --> 00:22:15,605
The cops!

237
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:32,122
<i>Get back!</i>

238
00:22:33,082 --> 00:22:35,250
<i>Back!
- This is the police!</i>

239
00:22:43,885 --> 00:22:46,177
<i>Let me go, you dirty bastard!</i>

240
00:22:46,512 --> 00:22:49,222
<i>Let me go, you son of a bitch!</i>

241
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:52,809
Goddamn bastard!

242
00:22:54,270 --> 00:22:56,354
Put me down!

243
00:22:56,689 --> 00:22:58,481
Let me go!

244
00:22:58,649 --> 00:23:00,483
Let her go, you filthy pig!

245
00:23:03,571 --> 00:23:05,405
Quiet!

246
00:23:05,531 --> 00:23:06,781
Move back!

247
00:23:06,908 --> 00:23:08,909
The top fuzz!

248
00:23:10,077 --> 00:23:11,912
Quiet!

249
00:23:12,038 --> 00:23:13,997
Police orders:

250
00:23:14,123 --> 00:23:17,334
Nobody is to leave this establishment.
Get your papers ready.

251
00:23:27,011 --> 00:23:28,511
Please!

252
00:23:32,183 --> 00:23:35,143
Come now, children,
stop this foolishness.

253
00:23:35,811 --> 00:23:38,188
Well, if it isn't Tubby Lohmann!

254
00:23:49,784 --> 00:23:52,160
Quiet!

255
00:23:53,746 --> 00:23:55,246
That'll get you nowhere.

256
00:23:55,373 --> 00:23:58,208
- Go after the murderer instead!
- Right!

257
00:24:02,505 --> 00:24:03,546
Quiet!

258
00:24:04,548 --> 00:24:08,051
Be reasonable now!
Step back!

259
00:24:08,803 --> 00:24:10,720
You hear me? Step back!

260
00:24:10,888 --> 00:24:14,391
Let's go!
Come on, let's see those papers!

261
00:24:14,558 --> 00:24:17,477
<i>- I haven't got any.
- Let's see your papers.</i>

262
00:24:17,687 --> 00:24:19,896
<i>Please let me go, Inspector!</i>

263
00:24:20,147 --> 00:24:23,066
<i>The two guys who tried to escape
were caught on the Krangasse.</i>

264
00:24:23,317 --> 00:24:25,402
<i>- Leave those chairs alone!
- Shut up!</i>

265
00:24:25,569 --> 00:24:26,945
<i>Have your papers ready!</i>

266
00:24:27,113 --> 00:24:28,613
<i>Haven't we met before?
- Yeah. So?</i>

267
00:24:29,699 --> 00:24:31,324
<i>Off to the precinct again!</i>

268
00:24:31,575 --> 00:24:33,702
<i>Haven't even made a buck tonight!</i>

269
00:24:36,455 --> 00:24:39,416
<i>Anyone without papers
goes down to the precinct!</i>

270
00:24:39,583 --> 00:24:43,586
<i>I tell you, I'm innocent, really!</i>

271
00:24:43,713 --> 00:24:44,963
<i>Stop talking nonsense!</i>

272
00:24:45,214 --> 00:24:46,923
<i>- Let's get moving!
- Kiss my ass!</i>

273
00:24:47,049 --> 00:24:50,176
<i>- Show your papers!
- Where's the paddy wagon?</i>

274
00:24:50,302 --> 00:24:51,970
<i>Don't push.</i>

275
00:24:52,263 --> 00:24:54,097
<i>Everyone will get their turn.</i>

276
00:24:54,265 --> 00:24:56,474
<i>- Silence!
- Cool it, kids!</i>

277
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:57,892
<i>Have your papers ready!</i>

278
00:24:59,103 --> 00:25:00,145
Your papers.

279
00:25:00,271 --> 00:25:03,356
Inspector, I can't carry my birth
certificate around with me everywhere!

280
00:25:03,482 --> 00:25:06,109
- Quit your bellyaching, child.
- I really can't, Inspector!

281
00:25:06,235 --> 00:25:07,736
The precinct for you!

282
00:25:07,987 --> 00:25:09,612
You make me puke!

283
00:25:58,329 --> 00:26:01,164
Shoddy work, my friend.

284
00:26:01,791 --> 00:26:03,833
You've been had.

285
00:26:04,502 --> 00:26:07,003
Precinct.
- See you, Willy. Ta-ta!

286
00:26:07,213 --> 00:26:09,589
Ah, lay off!

287
00:26:09,715 --> 00:26:10,882
Next.

288
00:26:13,344 --> 00:26:14,844
Stuck-up snob.

289
00:26:31,904 --> 00:26:33,530
What's wrong?

290
00:26:33,739 --> 00:26:36,699
- Papa Lohmann...
- ...nabbed him!

291
00:26:40,371 --> 00:26:43,206
UNSOLVED BURGLARY AT FURRIER'S

292
00:26:46,544 --> 00:26:48,753
We'd better take you
down to the precinct too.

293
00:26:48,879 --> 00:26:52,715
What do you mean?
My papers are in order.

294
00:26:52,842 --> 00:26:53,925
Move on.

295
00:26:54,135 --> 00:26:55,176
Move on!

296
00:26:55,302 --> 00:26:56,511
Ah, tough luck!

297
00:26:56,637 --> 00:26:58,012
Next.

298
00:27:01,183 --> 00:27:03,434
Papers.
- Don't got none.

299
00:27:03,561 --> 00:27:04,894
To the precinct.

300
00:27:05,062 --> 00:27:06,771
Just my luck.

301
00:27:07,022 --> 00:27:08,773
Next, come on.

302
00:28:23,015 --> 00:28:24,641
You're ruining my business, Sarge.

303
00:28:24,892 --> 00:28:26,726
These raids every night.

304
00:28:27,186 --> 00:28:30,313
No one can get a moment's peace!
They're human beings too.

305
00:28:30,564 --> 00:28:32,273
You think...

306
00:28:32,650 --> 00:28:36,653
we stay up all night
just for the hell of it?

307
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:37,904
No.

308
00:28:38,030 --> 00:28:39,822
But you're drivin' away my clientele,

309
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:42,742
and you won't find the guy
you're lookin' for here anyway.

310
00:28:44,161 --> 00:28:47,830
If you knew how steamed they are

311
00:28:48,082 --> 00:28:50,083
at the guy who's causing these raids.

312
00:28:50,376 --> 00:28:52,043
Especially the girls.

313
00:28:52,169 --> 00:28:54,879
Sure, they solicit.
Business is business.

314
00:28:55,422 --> 00:28:58,216
But believe me,

315
00:28:58,550 --> 00:29:01,636
in every one of them
beats a mother's heart!

316
00:29:01,845 --> 00:29:04,013
I know a lot of toughs

317
00:29:04,181 --> 00:29:07,976
who get all teary-eyed
just seein' the little ones at play.

318
00:29:08,435 --> 00:29:12,522
If they ever get their hands
on that monster,

319
00:29:12,648 --> 00:29:14,524
they'll make toothpicks out of him!

320
00:29:15,067 --> 00:29:16,985
Ready to leave, Sergeant.

321
00:29:17,111 --> 00:29:18,486
So long.

322
00:29:28,998 --> 00:29:31,499
They hit the Crocodile Club today.

323
00:29:32,710 --> 00:29:34,377
Two paddy wagons.

324
00:29:40,217 --> 00:29:42,552
What's keeping Safecracker?

325
00:29:44,930 --> 00:29:47,724
Is it 3:00 yet?

326
00:29:47,891 --> 00:29:49,600
I'll find out.

327
00:29:55,149 --> 00:29:57,233
The exact time, please, miss.

328
00:29:58,277 --> 00:30:00,778
2:58. Thank you.

329
00:30:18,714 --> 00:30:22,258
2:58.

330
00:30:50,746 --> 00:30:53,998
The cops are crawling
the streets like ants again.

331
00:30:55,793 --> 00:30:57,543
Green coats wherever you spit.

332
00:30:57,669 --> 00:31:00,171
They're on your back
even if you're with a broad.

333
00:31:00,297 --> 00:31:03,216
They've gone nuts...
got this murderer on the brain.

334
00:31:03,759 --> 00:31:07,678
My old lady has a little six-year-old girl,
and every night I have to check

335
00:31:07,805 --> 00:31:11,599
under the bed to see
if the murderer's hiding there.

336
00:31:12,142 --> 00:31:15,561
You can't do business anymore
for tripping over cops everywhere.

337
00:31:15,771 --> 00:31:19,649
There's no privacy anymore.
I'm fed up with it.

338
00:31:20,526 --> 00:31:22,443
What else is new?

339
00:31:28,283 --> 00:31:31,619
- Where the heck is Safecracker?
- Think they might have nabbed him?

340
00:31:32,079 --> 00:31:34,330
That guy? Come on.

341
00:31:34,498 --> 00:31:39,669
Scotland Yard laid a trap for him once
on a bank job he pulled in London.

342
00:31:39,837 --> 00:31:43,339
There he was, hands up,
back to the wall,

343
00:31:43,632 --> 00:31:46,759
cops all around him.

344
00:31:47,428 --> 00:31:49,846
Seconds later there were
three men dead on the ground,

345
00:31:50,013 --> 00:31:51,931
but he wasn't one of 'em!

346
00:31:52,057 --> 00:31:54,642
No one better
from Berlin to San Francisco.

347
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:58,312
They've been after him six years
and they've yet to get him.

348
00:31:58,439 --> 00:32:01,065
Not yet. But put enough dogs
on the fox's tail...

349
00:32:01,316 --> 00:32:03,025
Can it!

350
00:32:11,618 --> 00:32:12,785
Damn it!

351
00:32:14,746 --> 00:32:16,456
I can't take this!

352
00:32:17,624 --> 00:32:19,792
He was always right on time before.

353
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,881
- Thank God!
- Finally.

354
00:32:26,967 --> 00:32:28,634
Morning!

355
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:31,095
Are you nuts?
Close those blinds!

356
00:32:54,161 --> 00:32:56,954
Gentlemen,
I hereby open this meeting.

357
00:32:57,080 --> 00:33:01,417
I declare all division leaders
of this organization present.

358
00:33:02,336 --> 00:33:04,420
I assume you're authorized
to make binding decisions

359
00:33:04,546 --> 00:33:07,256
for your divisions.

360
00:33:08,759 --> 00:33:11,260
Good. We'll dispense
with the preliminaries,

361
00:33:11,386 --> 00:33:13,804
as we all know why we're here.

362
00:33:14,890 --> 00:33:18,935
An outsider is ruining
our business and our reputation.

363
00:33:19,895 --> 00:33:21,646
Measures taken by the police

364
00:33:21,772 --> 00:33:26,234
and the daily raids
to catch this child murderer

365
00:33:26,610 --> 00:33:30,071
are hampering our activities
to an almost unbearable degree.

366
00:33:30,948 --> 00:33:32,949
We can no longer tolerate the fact

367
00:33:33,116 --> 00:33:38,162
that we're not safe now in any hotel,
bar, café or even private home

368
00:33:38,288 --> 00:33:40,790
from the clutches of the police.

369
00:33:40,916 --> 00:33:41,999
Very true.

370
00:33:42,125 --> 00:33:44,252
This state of affairs must end.

371
00:33:44,378 --> 00:33:48,047
Things must return to normal
or we'll go under.

372
00:33:49,216 --> 00:33:51,801
Our coffers will soon be depleted.

373
00:33:52,302 --> 00:33:55,388
If we can't get funds to support
the wives of those members

374
00:33:56,223 --> 00:33:59,141
who currently enjoy
room and board at state expense,

375
00:33:59,601 --> 00:34:04,939
I don't know where we'll find
the money to carry out our plans.

376
00:34:05,107 --> 00:34:07,149
Our reputation is suffering as well.

377
00:34:07,317 --> 00:34:10,152
The police seek
the murderer in our fold.

378
00:34:11,488 --> 00:34:14,532
Gentlemen, when I run head-on
into an officer from the squad,

379
00:34:14,658 --> 00:34:17,201
he knows the potential risks,
and so do l.

380
00:34:17,494 --> 00:34:20,663
If either dies in the line of duty, fine.
Occupational hazard.

381
00:34:21,081 --> 00:34:24,667
But we must draw a firm line
between ourselves

382
00:34:24,793 --> 00:34:27,545
and this man they're looking for!

383
00:34:27,671 --> 00:34:29,839
We conduct our business
in order to survive,

384
00:34:29,965 --> 00:34:32,300
but this monster
has no right to survive!

385
00:34:32,426 --> 00:34:34,552
He must be killed,
eliminated, exterminated!

386
00:34:34,678 --> 00:34:36,971
Without mercy or compassion!

387
00:34:40,851 --> 00:34:42,643
Gentlemen,

388
00:34:43,353 --> 00:34:46,355
our members must be able
to go about their business again

389
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:51,986
without frantic cops
in their way at every turn.

390
00:34:52,362 --> 00:34:53,487
I invite...

391
00:34:55,073 --> 00:34:58,200
...your views, gentlemen.

392
00:35:00,537 --> 00:35:04,415
Step up ID checks,
comb the entire city,

393
00:35:04,541 --> 00:35:09,045
and raids...
relentless, ever tougher raids!

394
00:35:09,838 --> 00:35:12,214
We need informers!

395
00:35:12,382 --> 00:35:15,551
We must know the police's plans
almost before they do themselves!

396
00:35:15,677 --> 00:35:17,678
The girls gotta work the cops more!

397
00:35:18,055 --> 00:35:22,266
How often has one of us been nabbed
'cause his gal ratted on him to the cops?

398
00:35:22,726 --> 00:35:24,352
Now they can rat on the cops!

399
00:35:24,478 --> 00:35:28,648
Every resident, every landlord,

400
00:35:29,066 --> 00:35:32,652
every property owner

401
00:35:32,944 --> 00:35:38,574
must be forced to consent
to meticulous searches of his property

402
00:35:38,784 --> 00:35:42,078
for the slightest of clues.

403
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:46,457
What if we...
We have our connections.

404
00:35:47,626 --> 00:35:51,962
What if we put
an article in the papers

405
00:35:52,589 --> 00:35:56,926
that our syndicates...
I mean, our organization...

406
00:35:57,427 --> 00:36:01,055
doesn't wish to be lumped in
together with this pig,

407
00:36:01,181 --> 00:36:04,100
and that the cops should look
for this guy somewhere else.

408
00:36:04,267 --> 00:36:05,810
He's not even a real crook!

409
00:36:06,103 --> 00:36:08,562
This man may well be...

410
00:36:09,272 --> 00:36:13,067
when not engaged
in the actual act of killing...

411
00:36:14,111 --> 00:36:18,030
a harmless, upstanding citizen

412
00:36:18,156 --> 00:36:19,657
who wouldn't hurt a fly.

413
00:36:19,783 --> 00:36:23,452
In his right mind, perhaps he plays
marbles with his landlady's kids

414
00:36:23,578 --> 00:36:25,788
or plays cards with friends.

415
00:36:25,914 --> 00:36:29,667
Without what I'll call

416
00:36:29,835 --> 00:36:32,670
the innocuousness
of these murderers' private lives,

417
00:36:32,796 --> 00:36:37,299
it's inconceivable that someone
like Grossmann or Haarmann

418
00:36:37,426 --> 00:36:41,637
could have lived right next door
to their neighbors for years

419
00:36:41,972 --> 00:36:45,641
without arousing
the faintest trace of suspicion!

420
00:36:45,809 --> 00:36:48,811
This is where we must focus
the public's attention.

421
00:36:48,937 --> 00:36:51,147
The public must cooperate.

422
00:36:51,565 --> 00:36:54,692
I'll tell you about public cooperation!

423
00:36:55,110 --> 00:36:57,945
Just thinking of it makes me puke.

424
00:36:59,197 --> 00:37:00,948
I beg your pardon, Commissioner.

425
00:37:01,074 --> 00:37:04,410
But ain't it the truth?

426
00:37:05,370 --> 00:37:08,831
What the devil has public cooperation
gotten us so far?

427
00:37:11,251 --> 00:37:14,003
Piles of letters
full of the most outrageous slander!

428
00:37:14,129 --> 00:37:15,504
Very true.

429
00:37:15,672 --> 00:37:18,758
They alert homicide
whenever a chimney sweep walks by.

430
00:37:18,884 --> 00:37:20,217
That's right.

431
00:37:20,343 --> 00:37:23,304
But when you really want
reliable information from them,

432
00:37:24,139 --> 00:37:26,056
then they suddenly haven't got a clue.

433
00:37:26,433 --> 00:37:29,894
Why, they just can't seem
to remember a thing.

434
00:37:31,396 --> 00:37:34,356
There's your public cooperation
for you!

435
00:37:35,442 --> 00:37:38,360
I believe you're exaggerating a bit,
Lohmann.

436
00:37:39,362 --> 00:37:41,822
It can't really be that bad, can it?

437
00:37:42,324 --> 00:37:44,867
But it is, Commissioner!

438
00:37:45,368 --> 00:37:49,205
Most of the public
still takes the position,

439
00:37:49,414 --> 00:37:51,415
"How does this concern me?"

440
00:37:52,250 --> 00:37:56,295
The idea that
each individual is responsible

441
00:37:56,421 --> 00:38:00,382
for what happens to the poorest,
most anonymous child on the street

442
00:38:00,550 --> 00:38:04,345
hasn't even dawned
on the public at large!

443
00:38:07,724 --> 00:38:09,350
I've got another idea.

444
00:38:09,476 --> 00:38:11,393
There was this magician.

445
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:15,064
Te... Tele...
I can't remember what you call it.

446
00:38:15,357 --> 00:38:18,442
Anyway, he could conjure up
hidden pennies out of handkerchiefs.

447
00:38:18,568 --> 00:38:21,612
The reward is still
far too little money.

448
00:38:23,406 --> 00:38:28,244
The man who leads us
to the murderer should get a fortune.

449
00:38:28,411 --> 00:38:30,788
None of this is anything new.

450
00:38:30,914 --> 00:38:32,706
This is all leading nowhere.

451
00:38:33,208 --> 00:38:37,086
So we just wait for the police
to catch the guy instead?

452
00:38:40,090 --> 00:38:43,926
The difficulties
in solving crimes of this nature

453
00:38:44,052 --> 00:38:47,388
are, in my experience,
often insurmountable,

454
00:38:47,931 --> 00:38:50,224
since perpetrator and victim

455
00:38:50,350 --> 00:38:54,019
are often brought together
by mere chance.

456
00:38:54,312 --> 00:38:57,857
The instincts of the moment
drive the murderer's actions.

457
00:38:58,108 --> 00:39:01,735
The victim is found and identified,

458
00:39:02,112 --> 00:39:04,280
his or her last known whereabouts
are determined,

459
00:39:04,447 --> 00:39:06,156
and then...

460
00:39:07,409 --> 00:39:10,619
then comes the big question mark.

461
00:39:12,289 --> 00:39:15,040
These children vanish
without a trace.

462
00:39:17,752 --> 00:39:20,212
And when they're found...

463
00:39:23,925 --> 00:39:28,679
Well, we all know the state
in which we've found them.

464
00:39:31,308 --> 00:39:33,350
And the perpetrator...

465
00:39:35,645 --> 00:39:37,605
It's a fact well-known to all of us

466
00:39:37,731 --> 00:39:41,734
that murderers like this
rarely leave a clue behind.

467
00:39:42,193 --> 00:39:46,155
That's what makes our work so hard,
our successes so few.

468
00:39:46,281 --> 00:39:49,867
The police have been after
this murderer for eight months now.

469
00:39:51,453 --> 00:39:54,705
They'll only get him by accident now.
- We can't wait for that.

470
00:39:54,873 --> 00:39:57,333
No, we'll go broke by then.

471
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:58,626
What, then?

472
00:40:16,061 --> 00:40:17,937
We have to catch him...

473
00:40:19,147 --> 00:40:20,689
ourselves.

474
00:40:25,403 --> 00:40:27,905
Yes, that's what we must do.

475
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:33,619
There is perhaps one other way.

476
00:40:34,162 --> 00:40:37,247
I'm quite certain that information
on the individual in question

477
00:40:37,374 --> 00:40:42,878
must already exist somewhere.

478
00:40:43,088 --> 00:40:47,049
Being the severely pathological case
that he is,

479
00:40:47,217 --> 00:40:51,720
he has no doubt already had some kind
of contact with the authorities.

480
00:40:52,931 --> 00:40:56,308
That's why all health care facilities,

481
00:40:56,643 --> 00:41:00,229
prisons, clinics and insane asylums

482
00:41:00,563 --> 00:41:04,316
must be encouraged
to cooperate with us unequivocally.

483
00:41:05,026 --> 00:41:08,070
We specifically need information

484
00:41:08,238 --> 00:41:12,658
on those released after being deemed
harmless to society

485
00:41:12,993 --> 00:41:16,328
but who, due to their inclinations,

486
00:41:16,746 --> 00:41:19,415
could be the murderer.

487
00:41:19,582 --> 00:41:22,793
We must cover the city
with a net of informers.

488
00:41:24,254 --> 00:41:27,923
Every square mile must be
under constant surveillance.

489
00:41:28,174 --> 00:41:31,677
No child in this city must take
a single step without us knowing it.

490
00:41:31,803 --> 00:41:34,179
- Fine, but how?
- And who?

491
00:41:34,305 --> 00:41:38,017
lt must be people who can go
anywhere without causing a stir,

492
00:41:38,143 --> 00:41:41,270
follow anyone
without attracting attention,

493
00:41:41,438 --> 00:41:45,441
follow any child to any house
without arousing suspicion.

494
00:41:45,775 --> 00:41:49,945
In short, people whom the killer
would never suspect.

495
00:41:50,071 --> 00:41:52,281
- But who?
- There are no such people!

496
00:41:52,449 --> 00:41:54,450
- Who could do that?
- Who?

497
00:41:58,747 --> 00:41:59,997
The beggars.

498
00:42:00,498 --> 00:42:02,750
The organization of beggars!

499
00:42:32,947 --> 00:42:35,449
MR. CREDIT IS DEAD AND BURIED -
THE MANAGEMENT

500
00:42:41,998 --> 00:42:43,957
Blood pudding's on the upswing.

501
00:42:46,503 --> 00:42:49,004
God, this cheese stinks so good.

502
00:42:55,678 --> 00:42:57,679
Take that, you sons of bitches!

503
00:43:07,482 --> 00:43:10,776
Hey, stop snoring.
You'll wake up the lice.

504
00:43:20,370 --> 00:43:21,870
Two, four, six...

505
00:43:23,957 --> 00:43:26,333
NO BEGGARS OR PEDDLERS

506
00:43:29,546 --> 00:43:32,422
SANDWICHES

507
00:43:41,057 --> 00:43:43,433
Bread-and-butter sandwich,
lukewarm response.

508
00:43:45,937 --> 00:43:49,106
Black Friday for roast beef.

509
00:44:09,127 --> 00:44:11,628
All right.
Now come the courtyards.

510
00:44:12,422 --> 00:44:16,592
Yes, from number 1 to 88.

511
00:44:19,971 --> 00:44:21,513
Next.

512
00:44:26,769 --> 00:44:30,397
You're responsible for the courtyards
on Hauptstrasse from 1 to 88.

513
00:44:30,523 --> 00:44:32,065
Got it.

514
00:44:32,192 --> 00:44:33,609
What's next?

515
00:44:33,735 --> 00:44:37,112
Hauptstrasse, from number 89...

516
00:44:38,406 --> 00:44:39,698
to 196.

517
00:44:39,824 --> 00:44:41,909
Hauptstrasse,

518
00:44:42,243 --> 00:44:46,455
number 89 to 196.

519
00:44:47,081 --> 00:44:51,293
Member number?
- 3795. Emil Dustermann.

520
00:45:07,644 --> 00:45:10,270
Well, Emil, maybe
you'll win the 15,000.

521
00:45:10,396 --> 00:45:12,814
I've got my fingers crossed.

522
00:45:13,274 --> 00:45:14,650
Knock on wood.

523
00:45:56,693 --> 00:45:59,236
My heartfelt thanks,
ladies and gentlemen.

524
00:46:01,656 --> 00:46:03,657
Thank you.

525
00:46:55,585 --> 00:46:58,628
"In searching homes,
be on the lookout for any clue

526
00:46:59,130 --> 00:47:02,591
which could establish the origin
of the murderer's letter to the Courier.

527
00:47:03,051 --> 00:47:04,760
Be on the lookout as well

528
00:47:05,053 --> 00:47:08,055
for an old wooden table..."

529
00:47:09,223 --> 00:47:10,682
Idiot!

530
00:47:16,272 --> 00:47:17,939
"...or red pencil..."

531
00:47:18,983 --> 00:47:20,359
Come in.

532
00:47:21,402 --> 00:47:25,113
"... or writing paper
of the type used by the killer."

533
00:47:26,115 --> 00:47:30,952
Inspector, here are reports on mental
patients who've been released as cured

534
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:33,997
or deemed harmless
over the last five years.

535
00:47:34,123 --> 00:47:36,333
Reports from every
private and public institute,

536
00:47:36,459 --> 00:47:39,669
as well as from
municipal hospitals and asylums.

537
00:47:51,933 --> 00:47:56,103
And here's a list
of their present addresses.

538
00:48:32,014 --> 00:48:35,016
Good day.
Does a Mr. Beckert live here?

539
00:48:35,143 --> 00:48:36,351
Pardon me?

540
00:48:36,561 --> 00:48:39,062
Does a Mr. Beckert live here?

541
00:48:39,272 --> 00:48:42,357
I'm afraid I don't understand.
I'm a bit hard of hearing.

542
00:48:42,525 --> 00:48:44,234
You don't say.

543
00:48:44,569 --> 00:48:47,154
Does a Mr. Beckert live here?

544
00:48:47,447 --> 00:48:51,950
Mr. Beckert... yes, he does.
But he just stepped out.

545
00:48:52,201 --> 00:48:55,328
I had hoped to speak with him.

546
00:48:56,122 --> 00:48:58,498
I'm from the tax office.

547
00:48:58,708 --> 00:49:01,001
The tax office. Oh, my Lord!

548
00:49:01,210 --> 00:49:03,837
Perhaps you'd like to wait for him...

549
00:49:03,963 --> 00:49:05,714
Yes, thank you.

550
00:49:13,556 --> 00:49:16,808
- Please have a seat.
- Thank you.

551
00:49:29,739 --> 00:49:33,283
- Perhaps you'd like something to read.
- Thank you. Most kind.

552
00:49:33,409 --> 00:49:36,286
THE GENERAL GAZETTE

553
00:49:36,662 --> 00:49:38,121
Tell me, Mrs. Winkler,

554
00:49:38,623 --> 00:49:41,041
does Mr. Beckert
subscribe to any newspapers?

555
00:49:41,417 --> 00:49:44,920
Mr. Beckert?
No, he always borrows mine.

556
00:49:45,338 --> 00:49:47,631
I see. Thank you.

557
00:53:00,825 --> 00:53:04,327
Mommy!
I wanted to meet you halfway!

558
00:53:04,578 --> 00:53:07,122
Child, you mustn't do that.

559
00:53:07,498 --> 00:53:09,040
You know why.

560
00:53:53,794 --> 00:53:55,670
Good day.
What would you like?

561
00:53:55,880 --> 00:53:57,380
Coffee.

562
00:53:58,048 --> 00:54:01,217
No, a vermouth.
No, a cognac.

563
00:54:27,036 --> 00:54:28,536
Here you are.

564
00:54:34,335 --> 00:54:35,752
Another.

565
00:55:09,829 --> 00:55:11,412
Check.

566
00:55:11,747 --> 00:55:14,541
Two cognacs...
that's 1.65, please.

567
00:55:17,461 --> 00:55:18,920
Thank you very much.

568
00:55:25,094 --> 00:55:28,847
Number 24: Beckert.
Doesn't take the Courier.

569
00:55:28,973 --> 00:55:31,599
Table: polished mahogany,
with tablecloth.

570
00:55:31,767 --> 00:55:35,436
No traces of red pencil.
In fact, no writing materials of any kind.

571
00:55:35,771 --> 00:55:37,313
Printed matter found in wastebasket:

572
00:55:37,439 --> 00:55:39,482
cigar ad and a postcard

573
00:55:40,109 --> 00:55:41,818
with flowers
and "Regards, Paul" on it,

574
00:55:41,944 --> 00:55:43,778
but no address of sender.

575
00:55:43,904 --> 00:55:47,282
An empty cigarette pack, Ariston brand,
a bag of candy...

576
00:55:51,036 --> 00:55:52,871
Just a moment.

577
00:55:56,292 --> 00:55:58,293
Ariston?

578
00:56:09,513 --> 00:56:11,556
What was that?

579
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:27,280
I'd like the file
on the Marga Perl murder case.

580
00:56:29,533 --> 00:56:31,326
Thank you very much.

581
00:56:39,293 --> 00:56:41,044
That's odd.

582
00:56:42,296 --> 00:56:44,964
I've heard that before.

583
00:56:48,010 --> 00:56:49,594
It was...

584
00:56:52,431 --> 00:56:54,057
It was...

585
00:57:14,036 --> 00:57:15,912
<i>Hey, Heinrich!</i>

586
00:57:21,418 --> 00:57:23,294
What is it?

587
00:57:24,964 --> 00:57:28,758
What's wrong?
- Listen. Someone's whistling.

588
00:57:30,052 --> 00:57:31,761
Can't you hear it?

589
00:57:32,054 --> 00:57:33,346
There.

590
00:57:35,933 --> 00:57:37,475
Now he's stopped.

591
00:57:39,061 --> 00:57:41,479
Did you see
the guy who was whistling?

592
00:57:41,605 --> 00:57:43,940
Yes, I can still see him.

593
00:57:44,066 --> 00:57:49,696
Heinrich, he's talking to a little girl
and walking her down the street.

594
00:57:49,905 --> 00:57:53,825
- After him, quick, and don't lose him!
- Why?

595
00:57:54,076 --> 00:57:58,329
The day little Elsie Beckmann
was killed,

596
00:57:58,455 --> 00:58:01,165
a man bought a balloon from me.

597
00:58:01,291 --> 00:58:04,335
He was with a little girl...

598
00:58:08,090 --> 00:58:13,261
and he whistled just like that!

599
00:59:42,184 --> 00:59:43,643
Damn it, man!

600
00:59:43,852 --> 00:59:46,813
Are you crazy,
throwing orange peels on the ground?

601
00:59:46,939 --> 00:59:49,190
A man could slip and break his neck!
Unbelievable!

602
00:59:49,316 --> 00:59:51,567
I should report you to the police!

603
00:59:51,819 --> 00:59:54,320
Outrageous behavior!

604
00:59:56,240 --> 00:59:57,740
Hey, mister.

605
01:00:11,046 --> 01:00:12,797
Aha! Here it is.

606
01:00:13,048 --> 01:00:18,928
"In a 150-foot radius
of the crime scene,

607
01:00:19,054 --> 01:00:22,306
three cigarette butts of the Ariston brand
were found." There you have it.

608
01:00:23,016 --> 01:00:25,977
Yes, it may be
the same brand of cigarettes,

609
01:00:27,020 --> 01:00:29,564
but there was no old wooden table.

610
01:00:30,566 --> 01:00:36,070
Of course, he could have written
that letter somewhere else.

611
01:00:40,784 --> 01:00:42,493
Good God!

612
01:00:43,912 --> 01:00:45,371
<i>The window ledge!</i>

613
01:00:58,719 --> 01:01:00,344
You're right.

614
01:01:02,431 --> 01:01:04,348
Just a minute.

615
01:01:11,899 --> 01:01:13,065
Red pencil.

616
01:01:16,278 --> 01:01:18,029
My God, finally!

617
01:01:19,448 --> 01:01:21,908
We're finally on his trail.

618
01:01:24,661 --> 01:01:25,912
What?

619
01:01:26,705 --> 01:01:28,623
They're on his trail?

620
01:01:29,791 --> 01:01:32,543
<i>- Did they find him?</i>
- The beggars found him.

621
01:01:32,794 --> 01:01:35,129
- His whistling gave him away.
- They put a mark on him.

622
01:01:35,255 --> 01:01:36,672
Shut up!

623
01:01:37,132 --> 01:01:38,758
What did you say?

624
01:01:38,884 --> 01:01:42,970
They're following the mark.
He isn't out of sight for a second.

625
01:01:44,640 --> 01:01:47,141
<i>His every move is being watched.</i>

626
01:02:54,626 --> 01:02:56,419
- Mister.
- What is it?

627
01:02:56,545 --> 01:02:59,380
- You got some white stuff on your coat.
- Where?

628
01:02:59,965 --> 01:03:01,757
On your shoulder.

629
01:03:06,555 --> 01:03:08,764
Here, I'll wipe it off.

630
01:03:15,564 --> 01:03:18,357
- What's the matter?
- Come on. We're leaving.

631
01:04:50,450 --> 01:04:52,993
He didn't come out this way.
We would've seen him.

632
01:04:53,161 --> 01:04:54,286
Out of the question!

633
01:04:54,413 --> 01:04:58,416
- Well, he didn't turn back.
- He has to be somewhere, damn it!

634
01:05:02,671 --> 01:05:05,840
Maybe he's hiding
inside the building.

635
01:05:26,278 --> 01:05:27,528
Closing time!

636
01:05:27,654 --> 01:05:31,824
We can't let him get away in the crowd!
If he slips through now...

637
01:05:32,159 --> 01:05:33,534
They're starting to come out!

638
01:05:33,660 --> 01:05:36,036
Out in the street,
and keep your eyes peeled!

639
01:05:44,754 --> 01:05:46,714
Excuse me, may I ask you a question?

640
01:05:48,133 --> 01:05:50,551
My trip is tomorrow.
I start in Königsberg...

641
01:05:52,429 --> 01:05:55,264
No, in my condition
I can't eat anything like that...

642
01:05:55,515 --> 01:05:58,392
The boss came to my office today...

643
01:06:00,687 --> 01:06:02,521
Turn off the light.

644
01:06:02,647 --> 01:06:05,941
He'll get suspicious
if he comes home and sees it on.

645
01:06:10,655 --> 01:06:12,531
What time is it, anyway?

646
01:06:14,159 --> 01:06:15,951
Almost 6:30.

647
01:06:33,762 --> 01:06:36,222
He's gotta still be inside!

648
01:06:36,348 --> 01:06:39,600
He definitely didn't come out
with the office crowd.

649
01:06:47,442 --> 01:06:49,151
No, just a moment.

650
01:06:50,153 --> 01:06:52,988
The beggars have called for backup
and surrounded the whole building.

651
01:06:53,114 --> 01:06:55,908
They figure the guy's hiding
in the building.

652
01:07:01,373 --> 01:07:03,207
What sort of building is it?

653
01:07:04,834 --> 01:07:07,002
What sort of building is it?

654
01:07:07,128 --> 01:07:09,713
Nothing but offices.

655
01:07:11,091 --> 01:07:13,133
I don't know what's in the basement.

656
01:07:13,802 --> 01:07:16,762
There's a branch of the local
savings bank on the ground floor,

657
01:07:17,097 --> 01:07:21,308
and the second to sixth floors
are nothing but offices.

658
01:07:21,434 --> 01:07:23,018
Above that is the attic space.

659
01:07:28,817 --> 01:07:30,651
This is unbelievable.

660
01:07:32,445 --> 01:07:34,113
Anyone still in there?

661
01:07:42,038 --> 01:07:43,664
Anyone still in here?

662
01:08:02,684 --> 01:08:04,268
What the devil!

663
01:08:05,020 --> 01:08:06,687
Anybody still in here?

664
01:08:16,698 --> 01:08:18,907
Damn carelessness!

665
01:08:22,162 --> 01:08:23,621
All that trouble for one door.

666
01:08:46,603 --> 01:08:48,479
Seems the guy's cornered now.

667
01:08:48,730 --> 01:08:51,398
I think we should tip
the cops off right away.

668
01:08:51,524 --> 01:08:53,609
- I agree.
- Let's not waste time!

669
01:08:55,070 --> 01:08:59,114
Stay by the phone
and call back in a few minutes.

670
01:08:59,366 --> 01:09:00,699
What is it?

671
01:09:00,867 --> 01:09:03,202
Are you crazy or something?
The police?

672
01:09:03,536 --> 01:09:06,205
No! We're gonna get
this guy ourselves!

673
01:09:06,414 --> 01:09:08,082
Listen, the time now is...

674
01:09:09,584 --> 01:09:10,459
8:00.

675
01:09:10,585 --> 01:09:14,880
All right. 9:00... 10:00...

676
01:09:15,131 --> 01:09:16,256
At 11:00!

677
01:09:40,407 --> 01:09:44,076
Evening. Did you know
your gate isn't closed?

678
01:09:44,202 --> 01:09:46,829
What? That's impossible!

679
01:09:47,455 --> 01:09:50,499
Why I just... Wait, it is!

680
01:09:53,294 --> 01:09:55,963
Open up, quick!
And not a sound!

681
01:09:56,089 --> 01:09:58,298
Come on! Move it!

682
01:09:58,633 --> 01:10:00,718
Let's go!

683
01:10:00,844 --> 01:10:02,761
Come on, move it!

684
01:10:30,665 --> 01:10:33,125
How many other watchmen
are in the building?

685
01:10:36,087 --> 01:10:38,213
Don't want to answer, eh?

686
01:10:39,841 --> 01:10:41,467
Very well.

687
01:11:15,168 --> 01:11:17,211
There are still two watchmen
on their rounds.

688
01:11:40,860 --> 01:11:42,736
Goddamn it!

689
01:11:42,904 --> 01:11:45,697
Damn piece of crap!

690
01:11:52,497 --> 01:11:54,581
Goddamned lock!

691
01:12:08,429 --> 01:12:10,514
Damn it to hell!

692
01:12:10,807 --> 01:12:12,266
Shit!

693
01:13:07,488 --> 01:13:10,157
Careful where you shine those lights!

694
01:13:10,408 --> 01:13:13,035
And don't stomp around
like elephants!

695
01:13:13,161 --> 01:13:14,953
He's not in the basement.

696
01:13:15,079 --> 01:13:17,289
We went through it all
and found nothing.

697
01:13:18,166 --> 01:13:20,834
Two men are still going
through the boiler room.

698
01:13:21,419 --> 01:13:22,628
Hold it!

699
01:13:22,754 --> 01:13:24,338
This is the last one.

700
01:13:24,589 --> 01:13:27,174
Go up and join Emil.
He needs help.

701
01:13:34,807 --> 01:13:36,350
Safecracker sent me.

702
01:13:36,601 --> 01:13:37,684
All right.

703
01:13:38,561 --> 01:13:39,853
Listen carefully.

704
01:13:40,355 --> 01:13:44,650
This is a new type of time clock.

705
01:13:45,443 --> 01:13:47,694
Here's a general diagram.

706
01:13:47,946 --> 01:13:50,322
If they're not set
at exactly the right minute,

707
01:13:50,448 --> 01:13:54,493
an alarm automatically goes off
at the nearest police station. Get it?

708
01:13:57,288 --> 01:13:58,830
You got it?

709
01:13:58,957 --> 01:14:01,708
- I'm not an idiot!
- Well...

710
01:14:03,503 --> 01:14:07,172
He's not in the boiler room
or the coal room.

711
01:14:07,298 --> 01:14:09,424
We turned over every piece of coal.

712
01:14:12,679 --> 01:14:13,845
Hey!

713
01:14:14,222 --> 01:14:16,765
Are you nuts?

714
01:14:16,891 --> 01:14:21,728
What if the doors are wired?
You want the police here in five minutes?

715
01:14:23,272 --> 01:14:26,942
We gotta get in if we're gonna
search the whole place!

716
01:14:27,193 --> 01:14:29,403
But not through the door, you idiot!

717
01:14:29,570 --> 01:14:31,780
Go through the ceiling
of the office above!

718
01:14:38,413 --> 01:14:39,705
Nothing.

719
01:15:15,867 --> 01:15:17,909
All right. Down we go.

720
01:16:08,461 --> 01:16:10,504
Hey, what's up?

721
01:16:11,005 --> 01:16:12,506
Hey! What is it?

722
01:16:12,632 --> 01:16:14,883
Wait a minute!
Answer me, damn it!

723
01:16:15,009 --> 01:16:17,511
What's going on?
- I heard some banging!

724
01:16:18,805 --> 01:16:22,057
- Where are you off to?
- Why are you running?

725
01:16:26,729 --> 01:16:28,647
<i>Wait, damn it!</i>

726
01:16:29,982 --> 01:16:31,858
I've gotta see Safecracker!

727
01:16:32,026 --> 01:16:36,279
He's in the attic, I tell you!
I heard him knocking!

728
01:16:53,297 --> 01:16:54,381
Quiet!

729
01:17:43,764 --> 01:17:46,266
Go on! He has to be in there!

730
01:17:47,310 --> 01:17:49,102
Here's the light switch.

731
01:17:51,105 --> 01:17:52,898
Force the locks.

732
01:17:53,357 --> 01:17:54,774
Come on. Hurry up!

733
01:18:06,454 --> 01:18:09,998
Got him! I found the guy!
He's in the attic!

734
01:18:10,124 --> 01:18:12,626
I heard someone banging,
and I told Safecracker.

735
01:18:12,793 --> 01:18:15,795
He's up there with eight men.
They'll get him any moment now.

736
01:18:15,922 --> 01:18:18,089
Just came down to fill you in.

737
01:18:18,216 --> 01:18:21,176
If I hadn't been alert,
we could've looked for him for hours!

738
01:18:21,302 --> 01:18:22,469
The watchman!

739
01:18:27,767 --> 01:18:30,435
Three... one... four.

740
01:18:30,811 --> 01:18:32,312
314.

741
01:18:44,450 --> 01:18:46,826
- Everybody out!
- What?

742
01:18:46,994 --> 01:18:50,997
- The cops'll be here in five minutes.
- Damn it! Who called 'em?

743
01:18:51,123 --> 01:18:53,333
- The watchman rang the alarm.
- Let's scram!

744
01:18:53,668 --> 01:18:54,918
Hold it!

745
01:18:55,169 --> 01:18:56,628
Quiet down!

746
01:18:57,505 --> 01:19:00,131
Five more minutes,
six more storage sheds.

747
01:19:00,258 --> 01:19:02,509
Move it! Get going!

748
01:19:02,802 --> 01:19:05,220
Not like that!
Out of the way!

749
01:19:13,187 --> 01:19:15,230
<i>- He's not in here.
- Next door!</i>

750
01:19:15,940 --> 01:19:17,565
<i>Come on! Faster!</i>

751
01:19:22,321 --> 01:19:25,031
<i>- He's not here either.
- Move on! Next door!</i>

752
01:19:31,539 --> 01:19:34,708
<i>Quickly! We've only got
three minutes left!</i>

753
01:19:36,127 --> 01:19:38,128
<i>No padlock on this one...
he must be here!</i>

754
01:19:38,212 --> 01:19:39,296
<i>Open it!</i>

755
01:19:39,422 --> 01:19:41,339
<i>- Something's jammed inside.
- Let me do it!</i>

756
01:19:41,465 --> 01:19:43,591
<i>Hurry! Only one minute left!</i>

757
01:19:47,930 --> 01:19:50,432
<i>There he is, the dog!</i>

758
01:19:51,100 --> 01:19:53,685
Come on! Move it!

759
01:19:55,730 --> 01:19:57,147
Everybody out!

760
01:19:58,065 --> 01:20:00,108
Get out while you can, damn it!

761
01:20:00,318 --> 01:20:02,193
Move it!

762
01:20:04,113 --> 01:20:06,364
For Christ's sake, get going!

763
01:20:07,825 --> 01:20:09,743
What's keeping the others?
- They're coming!

764
01:20:09,910 --> 01:20:14,247
If not, they might as well stay here,
with or without the guy!

765
01:20:15,082 --> 01:20:17,876
What in the hell is keeping them?

766
01:20:18,127 --> 01:20:20,086
Finally! Thank God!

767
01:20:20,629 --> 01:20:25,300
Quick now! Go!
Make it snappy!

768
01:20:59,377 --> 01:21:01,252
<i>He's not down here.</i>

769
01:21:02,797 --> 01:21:06,299
<i>Hey! Who pulled up the rope?</i>

770
01:21:07,468 --> 01:21:11,054
Hey, who pulled up the rope?

771
01:21:13,307 --> 01:21:14,641
Bunch of morons!

772
01:21:29,657 --> 01:21:31,032
Hello there.

773
01:21:31,158 --> 01:21:32,534
<i>Hands up!</i>

774
01:21:32,868 --> 01:21:36,621
How can I put my hands up
when I'm holding on to the rope?

775
01:21:36,747 --> 01:21:37,956
<i>Come out of there!</i>

776
01:21:48,384 --> 01:21:50,218
I'm really innocent this time...

777
01:21:51,387 --> 01:21:53,054
...like a newborn babe.

778
01:21:57,518 --> 01:22:00,061
This may surprise you, Franz...

779
01:22:01,605 --> 01:22:03,022
but I believe you.

780
01:22:06,777 --> 01:22:09,696
Then everything's in order,

781
01:22:09,864 --> 01:22:11,322
and I can go now, right?

782
01:22:11,532 --> 01:22:13,408
Just a moment.

783
01:22:16,203 --> 01:22:17,370
Cigarette?

784
01:22:17,538 --> 01:22:19,038
Uh-oh.

785
01:22:31,260 --> 01:22:33,511
I'll take your word for it, Franz...

786
01:22:34,889 --> 01:22:36,973
provided...

787
01:22:37,892 --> 01:22:41,603
you can tell me...

788
01:22:43,022 --> 01:22:47,150
who the man was
that you were looking for

789
01:22:47,276 --> 01:22:50,236
and that you found in that building.

790
01:22:50,738 --> 01:22:52,405
I don't understand, Inspector.

791
01:22:53,657 --> 01:22:55,783
A man, you say?

792
01:22:57,286 --> 01:23:01,831
I know nothing about that.
There must be some mistake.

793
01:23:02,833 --> 01:23:04,918
I know nothing.

794
01:23:05,044 --> 01:23:06,920
Nothing at all.

795
01:23:07,671 --> 01:23:09,297
Of course.

796
01:23:10,257 --> 01:23:12,091
There's just one thing I don't get:

797
01:23:12,259 --> 01:23:14,052
why you're covering up

798
01:23:14,261 --> 01:23:16,596
for the gang
who left you in the lurch.

799
01:23:18,432 --> 01:23:21,601
Fine friends, running off
when things heat up,

800
01:23:21,727 --> 01:23:23,645
leaving you right in the fire.

801
01:23:24,522 --> 01:23:26,064
Phooey!

802
01:23:28,275 --> 01:23:32,403
That ploy won't work with me,
Inspector.

803
01:23:59,223 --> 01:24:00,723
Listen...

804
01:24:06,438 --> 01:24:08,606
What can happen to me anyway?

805
01:24:09,191 --> 01:24:11,859
<i>Maybe a little property damage...
so what?</i>

806
01:24:12,778 --> 01:24:14,195
<i>Nothing was pinched!</i>

807
01:24:14,321 --> 01:24:16,322
But something <i>was</i> pinched,
my friend!

808
01:24:16,949 --> 01:24:18,157
In fact, a good deal.

809
01:24:18,284 --> 01:24:20,910
What? Something got pinched?

810
01:24:22,788 --> 01:24:24,372
How much?

811
01:24:24,498 --> 01:24:27,917
Tell me what you know
and I'll do the same.

812
01:24:28,377 --> 01:24:31,087
I already told you.
I know nothing.

813
01:24:33,632 --> 01:24:35,133
Very well.

814
01:24:38,387 --> 01:24:40,680
Give it some thought, Franz.

815
01:24:41,807 --> 01:24:48,021
Leave a man alone
for a couple hours...

816
01:24:49,023 --> 01:24:54,068
and a lot comes back to him
that he couldn't remember before.

817
01:24:56,405 --> 01:24:57,864
Take him away.

818
01:25:13,881 --> 01:25:15,715
Send the night watchman in.

819
01:25:19,053 --> 01:25:20,887
Mr. Damowatz.

820
01:25:27,853 --> 01:25:29,354
Please sit down.

821
01:25:31,732 --> 01:25:35,568
Now then, you said
in your statement...

822
01:25:36,362 --> 01:25:40,239
Listen carefully, in case
you have to testify under oath later.

823
01:25:43,577 --> 01:25:48,373
You clearly heard one of the burglars
say to the guy guarding you,

824
01:25:48,832 --> 01:25:52,669
"We got him. I found the guy.
He's in the attic."

825
01:25:52,795 --> 01:25:55,755
ls that correct?
- Yes, Inspector.

826
01:25:57,383 --> 01:26:03,596
Yes, I'll swear to that anytime.

827
01:26:04,765 --> 01:26:05,890
Good.

828
01:26:06,016 --> 01:26:08,518
Go home now
and recover from your ordeal.

829
01:26:08,811 --> 01:26:11,729
But please remain available
for further questioning.

830
01:26:11,897 --> 01:26:14,107
Of course, Inspector.

831
01:26:16,527 --> 01:26:18,194
Good morning, Inspector.

832
01:26:18,320 --> 01:26:19,696
Morning.

833
01:26:33,419 --> 01:26:36,838
Tell me, is Inspector Lohmann
in the building?

834
01:26:38,048 --> 01:26:40,925
He's talking to someone?
No, it doesn't matter.

835
01:26:41,301 --> 01:26:43,803
I'll come over myself.

836
01:26:46,724 --> 01:26:49,058
What? I see.

837
01:26:49,893 --> 01:26:52,311
Hasn't come home yet, eh?

838
01:26:53,564 --> 01:26:56,274
Did you keep an eye
on the old Winkler woman too?

839
01:26:56,525 --> 01:26:57,900
Come in.

840
01:26:58,652 --> 01:26:59,986
Come in!

841
01:27:01,321 --> 01:27:03,614
<i>- Am I disturbing you?</i>
- No, come in.

842
01:27:05,075 --> 01:27:07,827
Listen, the whole block
is surrounded.

843
01:27:08,036 --> 01:27:11,497
If he decides to go home,
he has to run into us.

844
01:27:11,999 --> 01:27:14,208
So just keep on waiting.

845
01:27:15,002 --> 01:27:17,712
If anything happens,
I'll be here at the precinct.

846
01:27:22,134 --> 01:27:23,509
Damn it!

847
01:27:30,142 --> 01:27:31,642
What do you want?

848
01:27:32,060 --> 01:27:34,187
I wanted...

849
01:27:35,606 --> 01:27:37,523
to ask a favor of you.

850
01:27:40,861 --> 01:27:42,695
Dishwater again!

851
01:27:43,030 --> 01:27:45,031
I wanted to ask you...

852
01:27:46,033 --> 01:27:48,701
Read this first.

853
01:27:55,125 --> 01:27:56,876
- A statement?
- Yeah.

854
01:27:57,711 --> 01:27:59,712
An office building was broken into.

855
01:28:07,137 --> 01:28:08,679
Bennostrasse?

856
01:28:09,223 --> 01:28:10,932
<i>That's a respectable part of town.</i>

857
01:28:12,976 --> 01:28:15,144
<i>Perhaps not that respectable after all.</i>

858
01:28:16,855 --> 01:28:18,272
<i>Hell, this is getting serious!</i>

859
01:28:27,324 --> 01:28:29,784
<i>What the... Did they mean to empty
the whole joint?</i>

860
01:28:31,745 --> 01:28:35,039
<i>What could they have been
looking for in the coal?</i>

861
01:28:36,416 --> 01:28:39,043
<i>Incredible! Unbelievable!</i>

862
01:28:42,422 --> 01:28:43,881
<i>I'll be damned!</i>

863
01:28:47,803 --> 01:28:49,595
<i>This is madness!</i>

864
01:28:52,766 --> 01:28:56,143
<i>Ah, so they were after
the savings bank!</i>

865
01:28:57,521 --> 01:28:59,605
<i>Good God!
What could this mean?</i>

866
01:29:01,275 --> 01:29:03,609
<i>I don't understand at all.</i>

867
01:29:03,944 --> 01:29:06,070
<i>They didn't even touch it?</i>

868
01:29:06,280 --> 01:29:09,490
<i>Must've been a bunch of real idiots!</i>

869
01:29:12,035 --> 01:29:14,036
I'll be damned!

870
01:29:14,204 --> 01:29:16,497
Isn't that something?

871
01:29:16,748 --> 01:29:19,750
Nothing stolen,
but a man was carried off.

872
01:29:19,960 --> 01:29:21,878
God knows where they took him.

873
01:29:22,129 --> 01:29:23,796
That's just great.

874
01:29:24,131 --> 01:29:27,049
And Franz isn't talking.

875
01:29:27,175 --> 01:29:28,634
He's afraid, of course.

876
01:29:29,303 --> 01:29:33,848
I know him well. Guy like him would
rather jump out the fifth-floor window

877
01:29:33,974 --> 01:29:35,933
than be mixed up in a murder rap.

878
01:29:37,895 --> 01:29:43,399
What if we could
get at him from that angle?

879
01:29:44,401 --> 01:29:47,987
Lohmann, if you'd be willing
to help me out...

880
01:29:51,408 --> 01:29:53,284
Very clever.

881
01:29:53,785 --> 01:29:55,745
I see the wheels turning.

882
01:29:57,497 --> 01:30:00,458
Let's send for this Franz.

883
01:30:04,588 --> 01:30:06,213
You're wanted for questioning.

884
01:30:07,549 --> 01:30:10,551
What? They sent four guys for me?

885
01:30:10,844 --> 01:30:13,304
What's this about?
- Move it!

886
01:30:36,745 --> 01:30:39,413
"Homicide squad.

887
01:30:40,165 --> 01:30:43,834
Inspector Karl Lohmann."

888
01:30:49,299 --> 01:30:51,425
What do you want with me?

889
01:30:51,843 --> 01:30:54,762
What have I got to do
with the homicide squad?

890
01:31:05,732 --> 01:31:07,566
Yes, young man...

891
01:31:08,652 --> 01:31:10,903
your case has been turned over to me.

892
01:31:14,866 --> 01:31:16,575
But why?

893
01:31:19,287 --> 01:31:20,538
Why?

894
01:31:22,416 --> 01:31:26,252
You boys did your work
a little too well.

895
01:31:32,926 --> 01:31:34,802
<i>One of the watchmen...</i>

896
01:31:44,438 --> 01:31:45,521
Dead?

897
01:31:50,777 --> 01:31:52,695
Accessory to murder.

898
01:31:54,406 --> 01:31:55,906
Nasty business.

899
01:31:56,033 --> 01:31:59,076
Inspector, I've had enough!

900
01:31:59,202 --> 01:32:01,245
I want no part of this!

901
01:32:01,371 --> 01:32:04,206
I'll tell you everything I know!

902
01:32:05,250 --> 01:32:07,626
Very sensible,
but, unfortunately, too late.

903
01:32:07,836 --> 01:32:10,504
It can't be too late!

904
01:32:10,630 --> 01:32:13,007
It can't be!

905
01:32:13,550 --> 01:32:15,676
I'll tell you everything!

906
01:32:16,470 --> 01:32:19,889
Even what we were looking for
in that damn building.

907
01:32:20,140 --> 01:32:21,515
Well...

908
01:32:22,809 --> 01:32:24,602
The child murderer!

909
01:32:35,238 --> 01:32:36,530
What?

910
01:32:37,449 --> 01:32:38,741
Who?

911
01:32:39,159 --> 01:32:41,368
The child murderer, Inspector.

912
01:32:47,667 --> 01:32:49,335
Just a moment.

913
01:33:07,479 --> 01:33:09,939
This had to happen to me!

914
01:33:13,401 --> 01:33:16,153
Me, of all people.

915
01:33:23,703 --> 01:33:25,579
Come sit down, my boy.

916
01:33:29,793 --> 01:33:33,921
We're gonna level
with each other, got it?

917
01:33:34,464 --> 01:33:35,714
Certainly, Inspector.

918
01:33:35,924 --> 01:33:38,676
And God help you
if you pull something.

919
01:33:39,719 --> 01:33:41,220
Now then...

920
01:33:41,471 --> 01:33:43,889
what have you boys got to do
with the murderer,

921
01:33:44,307 --> 01:33:46,934
and where was the guy taken?

922
01:33:49,396 --> 01:33:52,314
Well, Inspector...

923
01:33:53,733 --> 01:33:58,070
you know the old
Kuntz & Levy distillery?

924
01:33:58,655 --> 01:34:01,407
<i>The one that went belly-up
in the Depression?</i>

925
01:34:01,533 --> 01:34:03,951
<i>That's the one.</i>

926
01:34:04,077 --> 01:34:07,371
<i>Since then, the building's stood empty,
and no one gives a damn about it.</i>

927
01:34:27,601 --> 01:34:29,935
Get out here! Move it!

928
01:34:32,772 --> 01:34:34,607
Let me go!

929
01:34:43,450 --> 01:34:45,451
What have I done to you?

930
01:34:45,577 --> 01:34:46,660
You swine!

931
01:34:46,786 --> 01:34:50,080
Let go of me!

932
01:34:52,459 --> 01:34:55,211
Bastards!

933
01:34:56,004 --> 01:34:58,714
Swine!
What do you want from me?

934
01:34:59,049 --> 01:35:00,799
What do you want...

935
01:35:30,830 --> 01:35:32,081
Help!

936
01:35:32,207 --> 01:35:36,126
Help! Let me out of here!

937
01:35:36,503 --> 01:35:38,671
I want out!

938
01:35:38,880 --> 01:35:40,923
Let me out of here!

939
01:35:41,049 --> 01:35:44,009
You'll never get out of here.

940
01:35:45,262 --> 01:35:47,680
Gentlemen, I beg of you!

941
01:35:48,098 --> 01:35:51,016
I don't even know
what you want with me.

942
01:35:51,268 --> 01:35:53,477
I beg you, let me go.

943
01:35:53,687 --> 01:35:57,022
This whole thing must be a mistake!

944
01:35:58,233 --> 01:35:59,692
A mis...

945
01:36:01,653 --> 01:36:03,237
No.

946
01:36:03,822 --> 01:36:06,615
No mistake.
Out of the question.

947
01:36:07,242 --> 01:36:09,493
This is no mistake.

948
01:36:15,208 --> 01:36:16,875
No.

949
01:36:17,585 --> 01:36:19,336
No mistake.

950
01:36:23,466 --> 01:36:25,134
You recognize this?

951
01:36:25,385 --> 01:36:30,097
You bought a balloon just like this
for little Elsie Beckmann.

952
01:36:30,223 --> 01:36:31,932
Just like this one.

953
01:36:37,647 --> 01:36:39,565
No!

954
01:36:40,734 --> 01:36:43,819
Where did you bury
little Marga Perl, you bastard?

955
01:36:48,742 --> 01:36:50,784
But I never...

956
01:36:51,619 --> 01:36:53,912
I never even met her!

957
01:36:56,750 --> 01:36:58,751
You never even met her!

958
01:37:01,254 --> 01:37:03,464
I suppose you never
met her either, huh?

959
01:37:05,342 --> 01:37:06,550
Or her?

960
01:37:09,429 --> 01:37:11,263
You never met her either, huh?

961
01:37:12,265 --> 01:37:13,932
- Stop him!
- Grab him!

962
01:37:14,059 --> 01:37:16,101
- Stop him!
- Don't let him escape!

963
01:37:16,269 --> 01:37:18,020
Watch out! The door!

964
01:37:18,938 --> 01:37:21,440
- Let me out!
- Punch him in the face!

965
01:37:21,608 --> 01:37:24,360
Let go of me!

966
01:37:46,383 --> 01:37:50,135
- You have no right to treat me this way!
- We'll show you we do!

967
01:37:50,345 --> 01:37:52,930
You have no right to hold me here!

968
01:37:53,139 --> 01:37:56,600
Right? There's only one thing
right for a man like you... death!

969
01:37:56,810 --> 01:37:58,852
- Right! Kill him!
- Kill the rabid dog!

970
01:37:58,978 --> 01:38:00,854
- Ice him!
- Let him have it!

971
01:38:01,106 --> 01:38:02,606
Quiet!

972
01:38:02,816 --> 01:38:04,483
Kill him!

973
01:38:13,868 --> 01:38:16,495
You spoke of "right" just now.

974
01:38:17,664 --> 01:38:19,790
We will be your right.

975
01:38:21,167 --> 01:38:24,670
Everyone sitting here
is an expert in the rule of law!

976
01:38:27,632 --> 01:38:29,883
From six weeks in Tegel prison...

977
01:38:30,301 --> 01:38:32,845
to 15 years in Brandenburg.

978
01:38:36,141 --> 01:38:39,309
They'll make sure
you get your rights.

979
01:38:40,520 --> 01:38:42,479
You'll even have defense counsel.

980
01:38:43,773 --> 01:38:45,899
Everything according
to the letter of the law.

981
01:38:46,359 --> 01:38:48,193
Defense counsel?

982
01:38:48,361 --> 01:38:51,321
I need no defense counsel!
Who's gonna prosecute me?

983
01:38:51,614 --> 01:38:53,407
You, perhaps?

984
01:38:56,035 --> 01:38:56,910
Hey, you.

985
01:38:57,162 --> 01:39:01,206
If I were you,
I wouldn't make big speeches.

986
01:39:01,374 --> 01:39:05,169
Your head's at stake here,
in case you hadn't noticed.

987
01:39:06,087 --> 01:39:08,464
And just who are you?

988
01:39:10,550 --> 01:39:15,596
I have the dubious pleasure
of serving as your defense.

989
01:39:16,514 --> 01:39:18,932
Though I'm afraid
it won't do you much good.

990
01:39:20,977 --> 01:39:25,147
Do you all want to kill me?
You want to just wipe me out?

991
01:39:25,732 --> 01:39:29,359
We simply want to put you
out of commission.

992
01:39:30,361 --> 01:39:32,779
And we'll only be sure
of that when you're dead.

993
01:39:32,906 --> 01:39:35,949
But you can't murder me
just like that!

994
01:39:38,661 --> 01:39:42,247
I demand to be handed over
to the police!

995
01:39:45,585 --> 01:39:50,380
I demand to be brought
before a real court of law!

996
01:39:51,633 --> 01:39:53,383
That's a good one!

997
01:39:53,510 --> 01:39:56,053
- You'd like that, wouldn't you?
- Look who's talking!

998
01:39:56,262 --> 01:39:59,223
So you can plead insanity

999
01:39:59,390 --> 01:40:02,518
and spend the rest of your life
being cared for by the state.

1000
01:40:02,727 --> 01:40:06,480
And then you break out of the asylum
or receive a pardon,

1001
01:40:06,856 --> 01:40:10,234
and you're happy as can be,
free to kill with impunity,

1002
01:40:10,777 --> 01:40:14,321
protected by law
on grounds of insanity...

1003
01:40:14,697 --> 01:40:18,659
and you're back to chasing little children!
No, no more of that!

1004
01:40:19,202 --> 01:40:21,787
You must be taken out of action!
You must go!

1005
01:40:22,789 --> 01:40:25,707
But I can't help it!

1006
01:40:30,964 --> 01:40:32,297
I can't...

1007
01:40:32,632 --> 01:40:37,844
I really can't... help it!

1008
01:40:40,265 --> 01:40:41,682
We know that one!

1009
01:40:42,308 --> 01:40:44,643
Before the judge,
we all "can't help it."

1010
01:40:51,526 --> 01:40:53,402
What would you know?

1011
01:40:53,695 --> 01:40:55,696
What are you talking about?

1012
01:40:56,114 --> 01:40:58,448
Who are you anyway?

1013
01:40:59,325 --> 01:41:00,867
Who are you?

1014
01:41:01,286 --> 01:41:03,245
All of you.

1015
01:41:03,580 --> 01:41:05,247
Criminals.

1016
01:41:06,374 --> 01:41:09,084
Probably proud of it, too...

1017
01:41:09,419 --> 01:41:11,503
proud you can crack a safe

1018
01:41:11,671 --> 01:41:14,631
or sneak into houses
or cheat at cards.

1019
01:41:14,882 --> 01:41:18,844
All of which it seems to me
you could just as easily give up

1020
01:41:19,220 --> 01:41:21,597
if you had learned something useful,

1021
01:41:21,723 --> 01:41:23,682
or if you had jobs

1022
01:41:23,891 --> 01:41:26,435
or if you weren't such lazy pigs.

1023
01:41:27,895 --> 01:41:29,521
But me?

1024
01:41:29,856 --> 01:41:32,858
Can I do anything about it?

1025
01:41:34,027 --> 01:41:38,030
Don't I have
this cursed thing inside me?

1026
01:41:39,032 --> 01:41:42,200
This fire, this voice, this agony?

1027
01:41:45,997 --> 01:41:48,373
So you mean to say...

1028
01:41:49,250 --> 01:41:51,293
you <i>have</i> to kill?

1029
01:41:56,090 --> 01:41:59,301
I have to roam the streets endlessly,

1030
01:41:59,927 --> 01:42:01,970
always sensing

1031
01:42:02,430 --> 01:42:05,140
that someone's following me.

1032
01:42:05,266 --> 01:42:06,892
It's me!

1033
01:42:07,268 --> 01:42:09,227
I'm shadowing myself!

1034
01:42:10,563 --> 01:42:12,397
Silently...

1035
01:42:12,899 --> 01:42:14,900
but I still hear it!

1036
01:42:15,318 --> 01:42:19,655
Yes, sometimes I feel

1037
01:42:19,781 --> 01:42:21,782
like I'm tracking myself down.

1038
01:42:22,492 --> 01:42:25,577
I want to run...
run away from myself!

1039
01:42:25,995 --> 01:42:28,413
But I can't!
I can't escape from myself!

1040
01:42:29,248 --> 01:42:32,417
I must take the path
that it's driving me down

1041
01:42:32,585 --> 01:42:37,339
and run and run
down endless streets!

1042
01:42:37,590 --> 01:42:39,675
I want off!

1043
01:42:41,427 --> 01:42:44,721
And with me run the ghosts

1044
01:42:45,098 --> 01:42:48,517
of the mothers and children.

1045
01:42:48,643 --> 01:42:52,396
They never go away.
They're always there!

1046
01:42:52,605 --> 01:42:54,106
Always!

1047
01:42:54,232 --> 01:42:55,941
Always!

1048
01:42:57,110 --> 01:42:58,694
Except...

1049
01:42:59,278 --> 01:43:01,279
when I'm doing it...

1050
01:43:02,156 --> 01:43:04,533
when I...

1051
01:43:11,708 --> 01:43:14,334
Then I don't remember a thing.

1052
01:43:15,294 --> 01:43:19,715
Then I'm standing before a poster,

1053
01:43:19,841 --> 01:43:22,384
reading what I've done.

1054
01:43:22,635 --> 01:43:24,678
I read and read...

1055
01:43:25,430 --> 01:43:27,347
I did <i>that</i>?

1056
01:43:27,974 --> 01:43:30,100
I don't remember a thing!

1057
01:43:31,227 --> 01:43:33,145
But who will believe me?

1058
01:43:33,312 --> 01:43:36,314
Who knows what it's like inside me?

1059
01:43:36,441 --> 01:43:41,319
How it screams and cries out
inside me when I have to do it!

1060
01:43:41,988 --> 01:43:43,655
Don't want to! Must!

1061
01:43:43,990 --> 01:43:46,283
Don't want to! Must!

1062
01:43:46,993 --> 01:43:49,953
And then a voice cries out,

1063
01:43:50,079 --> 01:43:52,497
and I can't listen anymore!

1064
01:43:52,790 --> 01:43:55,709
Help! I can't!

1065
01:43:56,002 --> 01:43:59,337
I can't!

1066
01:44:04,719 --> 01:44:06,928
The accused has stated

1067
01:44:07,346 --> 01:44:09,431
that he can't help himself.

1068
01:44:09,932 --> 01:44:13,727
In other words,
he <i>must</i> commit murder.

1069
01:44:15,897 --> 01:44:18,690
With that he has pronounced
his own death sentence.

1070
01:44:18,858 --> 01:44:20,192
Right!

1071
01:44:20,359 --> 01:44:22,652
A man who claims

1072
01:44:23,446 --> 01:44:26,740
that he's compelled
to destroy the lives of others...

1073
01:44:27,200 --> 01:44:30,952
such a man must be
extinguished like a bonfire!

1074
01:44:31,120 --> 01:44:33,163
Such a man must be obliterated!

1075
01:44:33,331 --> 01:44:34,873
Wiped out!

1076
01:44:44,050 --> 01:44:46,259
May I address the court?

1077
01:44:46,636 --> 01:44:48,678
Counsel for the defense
has the floor.

1078
01:44:51,098 --> 01:44:55,060
My learned colleague
who just spoke...

1079
01:44:56,395 --> 01:44:58,730
who is, if I'm not mistaken,

1080
01:44:58,981 --> 01:45:01,858
wanted by the police
on three counts of manslaughter...

1081
01:45:01,984 --> 01:45:04,194
That's irrelevant here.

1082
01:45:04,403 --> 01:45:05,904
has claimed

1083
01:45:06,197 --> 01:45:09,324
that the fact that my client
was acting compulsively

1084
01:45:09,450 --> 01:45:11,243
warrants the death sentence.

1085
01:45:11,494 --> 01:45:13,328
That's right!

1086
01:45:13,913 --> 01:45:15,288
He is mistaken,

1087
01:45:15,623 --> 01:45:19,584
because the very nature of compulsion
warrants an acquittal!

1088
01:45:19,752 --> 01:45:21,294
Get outta here, will ya?

1089
01:45:22,213 --> 01:45:23,463
Are you nuts, or plastered?

1090
01:45:23,589 --> 01:45:25,382
lt is precisely
the nature of compulsion

1091
01:45:25,508 --> 01:45:29,094
that relieves him
of responsibility for his actions!

1092
01:45:29,512 --> 01:45:33,056
And a man cannot be punished for that

1093
01:45:33,182 --> 01:45:34,641
for which he is not responsible!

1094
01:45:34,767 --> 01:45:39,312
- Ridiculous!
- You mean this monster should go free?

1095
01:45:39,438 --> 01:45:41,106
That he should live?

1096
01:45:41,232 --> 01:45:44,609
I'm saying that this man is sick,

1097
01:45:44,735 --> 01:45:48,697
and you turn a sick man
over to a doctor, not an executioner.

1098
01:45:48,823 --> 01:45:52,951
- Will you guarantee his cure?
- What does the state build asylums for?

1099
01:45:53,119 --> 01:45:56,955
- What if he breaks out?
- Or he's declared cured and released?

1100
01:45:57,081 --> 01:45:59,499
And one fine day
the killing starts all over?

1101
01:46:00,167 --> 01:46:01,960
Another month-long manhunt!

1102
01:46:02,086 --> 01:46:04,045
Once again the insanity clause,
once again the asylum!

1103
01:46:04,171 --> 01:46:07,632
Another breakout or possible release!
And again... "must kill"!

1104
01:46:08,342 --> 01:46:11,219
Is this supposed
to go on indefinitely?

1105
01:46:11,387 --> 01:46:16,725
No one has the right to kill a man

1106
01:46:16,851 --> 01:46:18,852
who cannot be held
responsible for his crimes!

1107
01:46:19,103 --> 01:46:20,687
Not even the state,

1108
01:46:20,980 --> 01:46:23,773
and all of you least of all!

1109
01:46:24,734 --> 01:46:29,613
The state must ensure
that this man is rendered harmless

1110
01:46:29,947 --> 01:46:34,492
so that he ceases to be
a danger to society!

1111
01:46:38,205 --> 01:46:40,498
You never had kids, did ya?

1112
01:46:40,625 --> 01:46:42,709
Then you never lost any either.

1113
01:46:44,337 --> 01:46:46,880
But if you wanna know what it's like

1114
01:46:47,006 --> 01:46:50,008
when a little child is taken from you,

1115
01:46:50,134 --> 01:46:53,428
just ask the parents
whose kids he took away!

1116
01:46:54,180 --> 01:46:59,225
Ask 'em about the days and nights
not knowing what had happened,

1117
01:46:59,977 --> 01:47:02,646
and later,
when they finally found out...

1118
01:47:04,315 --> 01:47:06,775
Why don't you ask the mothers?

1119
01:47:06,943 --> 01:47:09,235
You should ask the mothers!

1120
01:47:09,528 --> 01:47:11,571
Think you'd get mercy
from any of them

1121
01:47:11,697 --> 01:47:13,865
for murdering their kids?

1122
01:47:14,033 --> 01:47:15,742
- The woman's right!
- Absolutely!

1123
01:47:15,868 --> 01:47:17,869
No mercy for the killer!

1124
01:47:17,995 --> 01:47:19,704
- Let him have it!
- Slaughter the bastard!

1125
01:47:19,830 --> 01:47:22,707
- Kill the monster!
- Kill him!

1126
01:47:22,875 --> 01:47:24,876
- Put the animal to death!
- Rub him out!

1127
01:47:25,044 --> 01:47:26,920
- Kill him!
- Waste him!

1128
01:47:27,046 --> 01:47:30,882
- Get rid of him!
- Annihilate the monster!

1129
01:47:32,051 --> 01:47:35,387
I will not let you shout me down!

1130
01:47:38,975 --> 01:47:45,563
I will not allow a murder
to be committed in my presence.

1131
01:47:45,898 --> 01:47:48,817
I demand that this human being...

1132
01:47:49,068 --> 01:47:50,360
That's not a human being!

1133
01:47:50,486 --> 01:47:53,780
that this human being be afforded
the same protection under the law

1134
01:47:54,031 --> 01:47:55,699
rendered the common criminal!

1135
01:47:55,908 --> 01:47:57,409
Not a chance!

1136
01:47:57,576 --> 01:48:01,079
I demand that he be
handed over to the police!

1137
01:48:01,205 --> 01:48:04,416
The police!
Of all the dumb...

1138
01:48:31,444 --> 01:48:33,278
In the name of the law...

1139
01:48:56,969 --> 01:48:58,636
In the name of the people...

1140
01:48:58,804 --> 01:49:03,391
This will not bring
our children back.

1141
01:49:08,439 --> 01:49:10,398
One has to...

1142
01:49:11,067 --> 01:49:12,901
keep closer watch...

1143
01:49:14,320 --> 01:49:16,988
over the children!

1144
01:49:18,991 --> 01:49:20,492
<i>All of you!</i>

1145
01:49:21,305 --> 01:49:27,468
