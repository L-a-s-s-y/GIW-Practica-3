1
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,320
<i>My son, our family owes
a lot to the cyclo taxi.</i>

2
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:39,320
<i>We work hard, day and night.</i>

3
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:43,080
<i>Eating and sleeping in the street.
Pedalling all the time.</i>

4
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,200
<i>Some mornings, the backaches</i>

5
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,000
<i>nail you to the bed.</i>

6
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:54,800
<i>I don't know where it all leads.</i>

7
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,720
<i>This has been my life.</i>

8
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:01,960
<i>When I die,
I'll have nothing to leave you.</i>

9
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:05,520
<i>If you can,
see if you can find</i>

10
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:08,720
<i>something more worthy.</i>

11
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,400
You're late!

12
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,840
Look again
and see if I'm right.

13
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:22,400
"The People's Committee
makes loans

14
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,360
"in line with the policy

15
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,120
"of fighting poverty. "

16
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:30,000
Where is it? Show me!

17
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,600
How old are you?

18
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,520
Eighteen.

19
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,480
Parents' occupation?

20
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,160
We're very poor.

21
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,400
Answer me, your parents?

22
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:36,840
My mother died in childbirth.

23
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:39,640
My father too, an accident...

24
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,040
How did he die?

25
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:46,920
A truck... he died instantly,
with two passengers.

26
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:51,640
At Hang Xanh intersection, right?

27
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,000
Yes.

28
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,320
Who's left?

29
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,440
My grandfather, my sisters.

30
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:08,000
They study in the morning
and work in the afternoon.

31
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,120
What do they do?

32
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:16,560
The eldest delivers water to the
market, the little one shines shoes.

33
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,000
And your grandfather?

34
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:22,280
He repairs tires.

35
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,280
Who rents you
the cyclo taxi?

36
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,560
The boss lady in Cholon.

37
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:29,680
Her name?

38
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,200
I don't know

39
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,120
How much per day?

40
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,440
5,000 dongs.

41
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,600
And the deposit?

42
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:42,320
200,000 dongs.

43
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:48,880
Okay, we'll consider your file.

44
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,440
We'll let you know.

45
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,400
Yes.

46
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,240
These days it hurts

47
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,520
when I piss.
What about you?

48
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,360
Me too. It burns.

49
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:28,120
You've got to drink, it helps.

50
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,160
It makes you sweat, wears you out.

51
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:36,880
A doctor warned me,
take anything to build muscles,

52
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,240
you end up impotent.

53
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:41,760
Yeah, right!
Who can afford a doctor?

54
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:44,400
Better to see a butcher.

55
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:50,120
Shoe shine, sir, shoe shine?

56
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,880
You free, kid?

57
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:05,840
Cyclo!

58
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:18,120
Number 8, Le Loi Street.

59
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,320
How dare you steal our clients?

60
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:31,160
It's her...

61
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:33,600
This is our turf.
If you want to live, get lost!

62
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,000
Beat it, you're on our turf!

63
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,520
Yes, you're my little fish.

64
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,560
So, how much?

65
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:58,640
It's a good day.
26,000.

66
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,640
5,000 for you,
21,000 for me.

67
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,640
No problem?

68
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:08,120
The thugs
took a passenger from me.

69
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:12,440
Careful, each turf has its gang.

70
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,920
You hungry?

71
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,160
Want to eat?

72
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,760
Wash him,
give him something to eat.

73
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,320
Go with him.

74
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:57,160
He was born that way,
he must be your age.

75
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,720
Take care of your tooth.

76
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:27,440
You see, I told you.

77
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:30,400
Okay, that's enough, get out.

78
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:17,640
Come on Grandpa, it's late.

79
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:18,960
Yes, let's go home.

80
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:19,000
Bring tobacco for grandfather.

81
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,160
Is your shoulder better?

82
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,360
It gets worse every day.

83
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:29,000
Do you have any balm left?

84
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,000
Hardly any.

85
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,960
I'll bring some back for you.

86
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,520
Grandfather, take the scale

87
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:15,560
they sent us by mistake

88
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:18,840
and change jobs, it'll be easier.

89
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:21,240
See how it's done.

90
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:24,640
Someone comes, you wipe.

91
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:28,120
You invite him to try,
1000 dongs per person.

92
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:31,520
We shouldn't.
The scale isn't ours.

93
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:34,160
Yes we can,
we've waited long enough.

94
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,800
No one has claimed it.

95
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:40,680
Your shoulder's hurting.

96
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:43,000
You can't keep pumping tires.

97
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,280
Let's wait awhile.

98
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:56,840
<i>On the old riverbanks.
Leaves and flowers fade.</i>

99
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:05,440
<i>The sun dies, icy, shuddering.</i>

100
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:15,200
<i>Hesitant, I cross the hamlet.</i>

101
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:22,080
<i>My childhood, I remember you.</i>

102
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:31,680
<i>I remember your graceful silhouette.</i>

103
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:40,160
<i>You gazed at me, radiant, tender.</i>

104
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:49,000
<i>I remember the sun was setting.</i>

105
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:57,040
<i>On your ivory cheeks
your rippling hair.</i>

106
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,560
Put him to bed.

107
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:06,240
Tomorrow, I'll come see
if you're dead or not.

108
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,360
Get up, little brother.

109
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,000
Go wash up!

110
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:35,360
<i>If I, the Heron,
die by boiling.</i>

111
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:40,040
<i>May it be in clear water.</i>

112
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:47,640
<i>To ease my children's suffering.</i>

113
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:01,960
Follow them!

114
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:05,280
And not a word to anyone.

115
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:12,160
<i>Bom has a fan
made of palm leaves.</i>

116
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:16,160
<i>The Rich Man says, I'll trade you.</i>

117
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:23,840
<i>Three cows and nine buffalo.</i>

118
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:30,160
<i>I don't want your buffalo.</i>

119
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:34,920
<i>I'll give you</i>

120
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:41,160
<i>a pond full of fish.</i>

121
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:47,320
<i>I don't want your fish.</i>

122
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:51,520
<i>I'll give you</i>

123
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:58,400
<i>a raft of precious wood.</i>

124
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:04,160
<i>I don't want your wood.</i>

125
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:08,680
<i>I'll give you</i>

126
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:12,480
<i>a bird...</i>

127
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:17,400
Tomorrow, come to the icehouse.

128
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:19,320
I'll tell you what to do.

129
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:43,200
Go now and be discreet.

130
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,720
What's the matter?

131
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,040
Who is it?

132
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,600
Why?

133
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:12,120
He stole my cyclo.

134
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:15,360
Don't be stupid,
he works for the boss lady.

135
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:17,480
Let's go!

136
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:55,600
Wait here!

137
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,440
Don't go out.

138
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:04,160
Except to eat

139
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:12,760
and don't lock the door.

140
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,800
Close your mouth, it stinks.

141
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:38,520
Do you have any money?

142
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:40,120
No!

143
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,120
We stayed up all night again.

144
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,560
Let's go to sleep.

145
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:33,440
Can I sleep here?

146
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,800
Another time.

147
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,160
I don't want to do it.

148
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:18,240
I came

149
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:20,840
because you wanted me to.

150
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,680
I called, no one answered.

151
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:35,640
Can I come in?

152
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:38,280
Don't touch her.

153
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:41,880
It's her first time.

154
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:54,440
Would you like to pee?

155
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:06,040
You want to piss?

156
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:13,480
Peepee, you get it?

157
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:16,000
Understand?

158
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:18,680
Go on, pee!

159
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:30,920
Drink... go on, drink!

160
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:34,840
Drink and pee.

161
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:37,720
Pee, please!

162
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:40,400
Drink again!

163
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:58,960
Again, drink up!

164
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,400
That's enough! Piss!

165
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,400
And do it standing up!

166
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,040
I brought you two friends.

167
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:43,200
People
are singing your praises.

168
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:46,240
You're a Samaritan.

169
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:52,800
You tried to save a drowning man?

170
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,800
The boss is happy.

171
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:58,560
She sent you this reward.

172
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:11,880
Damn, you're disgusting.

173
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:16,840
She wants to see you,
for another job.

174
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,840
What?
What did you say?

175
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,520
I don't dare.

176
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:23,520
I didn't ask your opinion!

177
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:24,760
You dare refuse?

178
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:28,840
What does he want?
Say it again!

179
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:54,720
Open your mouth!

180
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:55,960
Open it!

181
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:22,120
This is a taste.

182
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:25,000
Next time it'll be straight.

183
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:26,480
Sabotage!

184
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:28,560
250 tons of mouldy rice.

185
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:30,480
Do you know who did it?

186
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:33,840
Imagine yourself in the headlines?

187
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,840
That's a life sentence!

188
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:03,720
<i>Nameless river.</i>

189
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,600
<i>I was born sobbing.</i>

190
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:12,320
<i>Blue sky, vast earth.</i>

191
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:19,440
<i>Black stream water.</i>

192
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:25,600
<i>I grow with the months,
the years.</i>

193
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:30,120
<i>With no one to watch over me.</i>

194
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:32,840
<i>Nameless is man.</i>

195
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:37,000
<i>Nameless is the river.</i>

196
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:41,720
<i>Colorless the flower.</i>

197
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:44,320
<i>Perfume.</i>

198
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:48,280
<i>Without a voice.</i>

199
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:51,160
<i>O, river! O, passer-by!</i>

200
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:54,080
<i>In the closed cycle.</i>

201
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:57,160
<i>Of the months, the years.</i>

202
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:03,840
<i>I can't forget
my debt to my roots.</i>

203
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:07,320
<i>And I wander.</i>

204
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:09,120
<i>Through worlds.</i>

205
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:13,920
<i>Towards my land...</i>

206
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:17,360
His father won't let me work.

207
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:19,160
I'm bored.

208
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:20,800
I'm going round in circles.

209
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:23,480
So I busy myself

210
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:26,040
with small tasks.

211
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:28,480
Is Papa well?

212
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:30,880
He just came home.

213
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:34,480
When he leaves, I feel so alone.

214
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:37,320
You're thin.

215
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:41,840
When he was little, his nose bled.

216
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:45,120
Does it still happen?

217
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:48,840
Yes. Sometimes.

218
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:52,920
I'll show you a photo.

219
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:05,400
What are you looking for?

220
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:07,280
He's still here?

221
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:09,120
He's our son.

222
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:12,120
Please, speak to him.

223
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:15,880
He came with his whore?

224
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:16,760
Please!

225
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:20,120
What are you looking for?

226
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:31,720
He was five years old.

227
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:41,760
Stay and eat with us.

228
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:45,440
- Mama...
- No, he won't let me.

229
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:42,560
We were starving...

230
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:47,280
No rice...

231
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:49,680
People dying everywhere...

232
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,080
We loved each other deeply.

233
00:46:57,520 --> 00:46:59,600
At 16, or 17.

234
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:03,280
We drank alcohol

235
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:08,760
to forget our hunger.

236
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:15,120
A bit of shrimp paste...

237
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:20,280
on the end of a nail...

238
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:21,680
and we drank...

239
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:51,200
It lasted a year...

240
00:47:52,040 --> 00:47:53,880
Then the child was born.

241
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:00,800
He came out backwards.

242
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:04,640
Too late... almost dead.

243
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:10,960
The doctor said "Abnormal. "

244
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:26,080
Coward. He was a coward.

245
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:29,800
The father left us.

246
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:34,480
Why coward?

247
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:40,120
He was only 17.

248
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:44,680
Younger than his son is now.

249
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:49,360
And then...

250
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:03,320
How much for a bottle of gasoline?

251
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:04,640
5,000.

252
00:49:11,360 --> 00:49:12,760
And this?

253
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:15,560
10,000.

254
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:20,080
Not bad! And all alone!
You're a real pro!

255
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:23,560
No cop can catch me.

256
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:25,960
I know all the shortcuts.

257
00:55:26,120 --> 00:55:28,880
Sure, you're a cyclo driver.

258
00:55:56,560 --> 00:55:58,240
You like skirts?

259
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:00,720
Women's underwear?

260
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:01,920
That's all there was.

261
00:56:02,080 --> 00:56:05,480
You sure you're a guy?
Show me!

262
00:56:44,680 --> 00:56:48,840
That's my gift. Take it. For real.

263
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:53,160
I want to join the gang.

264
00:57:03,240 --> 00:57:04,480
What did he say?

265
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:05,600
What did you just say?

266
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:07,320
I got a shock, too.

267
00:57:07,480 --> 00:57:09,240
Which gang were you talking about?

268
00:57:09,640 --> 00:57:11,360
I want to be like you.

269
00:57:55,880 --> 00:57:57,360
Take him to Mr. Lullaby!

270
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:43,000
Look at my hands? See?

271
00:58:43,640 --> 00:58:45,680
In 1956

272
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:50,400
I was 17
a bullet cut the nerve

273
00:58:50,680 --> 00:58:53,520
my hand stiffened up.

274
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:56,320
And look at this...

275
00:58:57,560 --> 00:59:00,680
A bullet, through the neck.

276
00:59:01,160 --> 00:59:04,200
It came out the back.

277
00:59:06,080 --> 00:59:09,760
Guess which hole is bigger?

278
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:20,080
And then this

279
00:59:20,920 --> 00:59:22,080
here

280
00:59:23,880 --> 00:59:26,120
in 57, a bullet

281
00:59:26,600 --> 00:59:28,320
shattered my shin.

282
00:59:31,080 --> 00:59:35,480
You know why
I'm telling you all this?

283
00:59:35,640 --> 00:59:40,200
I know what you're thinking
faced with death.

284
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:44,040
I understand you so well.

285
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:50,680
<i>Autumn wind blows.</i>

286
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:55,080
<i>Sleep my child, sleep.</i>

287
00:59:55,240 --> 00:59:58,240
<i>The night is long.</i>

288
00:59:58,480 --> 01:00:01,560
<i>I'll watch over you.</i>

289
01:00:01,720 --> 01:00:06,240
<i>Until the night is over
I'll watch over you.</i>

290
01:00:07,560 --> 01:00:09,000
Listen carefully to

291
01:00:09,720 --> 01:00:11,720
the art of syncopation.

292
01:00:11,880 --> 01:00:16,920
<i>Sleep, my child, my beloved.</i>

293
01:00:17,080 --> 01:00:19,520
<i>My little one.</i>

294
01:00:57,680 --> 01:00:59,040
Keep it as a souvenir.

295
01:01:01,120 --> 01:01:02,440
Take it!

296
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,320
Ah, for an iced tea!

297
01:01:12,840 --> 01:01:14,280
Waiter! An iced tea!

298
01:04:51,280 --> 01:04:53,920
Why don't you love me
as much as them?

299
01:06:19,240 --> 01:06:20,720
Let's go!

300
01:06:22,120 --> 01:06:25,480
Stay here. He'll be back.

301
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:00,200
Come in!

302
01:07:07,520 --> 01:07:08,960
Have a seat.

303
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:11,960
I just stopped by.

304
01:07:12,240 --> 01:07:16,200
They were wondering
where you were.

305
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,120
I've had it a long time.

306
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:26,920
Now I have to sell it.

307
01:07:34,640 --> 01:07:36,480
Do you know what this is?

308
01:07:43,040 --> 01:07:44,760
It's the AK-47.

309
01:07:44,920 --> 01:07:47,480
A famous singer.

310
01:07:54,720 --> 01:07:56,200
Have you heard her songs?

311
01:07:56,360 --> 01:07:57,560
No!

312
01:07:58,560 --> 01:07:59,720
Then listen.

313
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:01,400
Basic notes.

314
01:08:01,560 --> 01:08:02,840
And here's her song.

315
01:08:21,640 --> 01:08:24,960
<i>Little sister, Hanoi, old streets.</i>

316
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:29,760
<i>You're all that's left me,
orchid scent.</i>

317
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:31,840
<i>You're all that's left me,</i>

318
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:35,440
<i>alstonia flower.</i>

319
01:08:38,320 --> 01:08:42,520
<i>Rain whispering down
deserted streets.</i>

320
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:50,000
<i>Waiting for a woman,
windswept hair, tender shoulders.</i>

321
01:08:52,440 --> 01:08:57,200
<i>You're all that's left me,
winter tree.</i>

322
01:08:59,520 --> 01:09:04,560
<i>You're all that's left me,
icy abandoned street.</i>

323
01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:08,960
<i>Slip of winter moon.</i>

324
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:15,400
<i>Old abode
where the voice of a piano echoes.</i>

325
01:09:17,720 --> 01:09:23,040
<i>Late into the night
a bell still chimes.</i>

326
01:09:24,600 --> 01:09:29,640
<i>You're all that's left me,
color of time.</i>

327
01:09:30,160 --> 01:09:33,800
<i>The evening fades,
your hair flutters.</i>

328
01:09:33,960 --> 01:09:37,720
<i>Evanescent.</i>

329
01:09:39,120 --> 01:09:44,400
<i>The poet wanders in vain
through the streets.</i>

330
01:09:45,880 --> 01:09:51,080
<i>Suddenly realizing
he has lost his way.</i>

331
01:09:52,760 --> 01:09:58,240
<i>You're all that's left me,
old streets covered in moss.</i>

332
01:09:58,400 --> 01:10:02,040
<i>Every creaky old rooftop.</i>

333
01:10:02,200 --> 01:10:05,520
<i>In my topsy-turvy memory.</i>

334
01:10:07,320 --> 01:10:12,040
<i>Floating
over the waves of West Lake.</i>

335
01:10:14,040 --> 01:10:19,320
<i>Suddenly twilight has fallen.
When it fell, I don't know.</i>

336
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:06,200
<i>You're all that's left me,
orphaned winter tree.</i>

337
01:11:47,480 --> 01:11:49,400
Stop or I'll break the vase.

338
01:12:36,760 --> 01:12:38,440
I think I'm pregnant.

339
01:12:41,560 --> 01:12:42,640
Who's the father?

340
01:13:07,480 --> 01:13:10,120
Is that a betel palm flower?

341
01:13:13,440 --> 01:13:15,160
What's inside?

342
01:13:16,960 --> 01:13:18,160
I don't know.

343
01:13:18,480 --> 01:13:20,040
It's the first time.

344
01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:23,480
But you looked for it all day.

345
01:14:45,760 --> 01:14:48,200
Will you take me
to the countryside?

346
01:17:09,680 --> 01:17:10,840
What are you carrying?

347
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:12,520
Pork.

348
01:17:16,920 --> 01:17:18,280
Take that off.

349
01:17:24,960 --> 01:17:26,640
Where does this come from?

350
01:17:26,800 --> 01:17:29,280
From Slaughterhouse 43.

351
01:17:35,400 --> 01:17:39,040
Listen carefully.
I'm going to pierce the skin.

352
01:17:39,200 --> 01:17:40,400
If I find nothing,

353
01:17:40,560 --> 01:17:43,160
I'll give you a pass.

354
01:18:35,120 --> 01:18:36,040
Father!

355
01:19:02,800 --> 01:19:06,320
<i>I dreamt about your death, Father.</i>

356
01:19:07,240 --> 01:19:09,720
<i>You died a second time,
to save me.</i>

357
01:19:10,840 --> 01:19:14,160
<i>This morning,
I feel strangely calm</i>

358
01:19:14,680 --> 01:19:18,040
<i>as if I'm living in your body</i>

359
01:19:19,160 --> 01:19:23,360
<i>in your silhouette
your walk, your gestures.</i>

360
01:19:24,040 --> 01:19:27,440
<i>These bony fingers
this rough hand.</i>

361
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:31,000
<i>Is it yours or mine?</i>

362
01:19:31,880 --> 01:19:37,480
<i>I feel your muscles
flex in my arms.</i>

363
01:19:38,320 --> 01:19:42,320
<i>This skin, it's yours
burnt, toughened</i>

364
01:19:42,480 --> 01:19:46,880
<i>defying the heat,
the cold, the years.</i>

365
01:19:47,600 --> 01:19:50,840
<i>These veins, you called them
the paths of life.</i>

366
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:53,040
<i>Now, I understand.</i>

367
01:22:42,160 --> 01:22:45,480
I need to ask a favor.

368
01:22:49,040 --> 01:22:52,280
I've always obeyed you.

369
01:22:55,360 --> 01:22:57,120
Now I'm afraid.

370
01:22:59,560 --> 01:23:02,360
Here's the money you gave me.

371
01:23:05,280 --> 01:23:07,720
If it's not enough.

372
01:23:08,200 --> 01:23:11,280
Let me take another cyclo.

373
01:23:13,440 --> 01:23:15,560
I'll pay you back bit by bit.

374
01:23:17,280 --> 01:23:18,560
Old man, where are you?

375
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,720
What did I say about the paint?

376
01:23:27,480 --> 01:23:29,440
Remember,
you old bastard?

377
01:23:36,880 --> 01:23:38,040
This is a pistol.

378
01:23:38,400 --> 01:23:40,040
Here's the safety catch.

379
01:23:40,360 --> 01:23:41,720
Now you can shoot.

380
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:43,520
Now it's locked.

381
01:23:44,440 --> 01:23:46,160
You just load and shoot!

382
01:23:46,960 --> 01:23:48,320
From behind

383
01:23:48,680 --> 01:23:49,840
like this.

384
01:23:54,640 --> 01:23:56,880
From the side, like that.

385
01:24:02,240 --> 01:24:04,320
Always two shots. Understand?

386
01:24:08,920 --> 01:24:11,920
Don't throw away the gun.
No one will come near you.

387
01:24:12,080 --> 01:24:15,120
Leave slowly,
once you're outside, run

388
01:24:15,280 --> 01:24:17,040
toward your gun hand.

389
01:24:17,200 --> 01:24:18,880
At the bridge

390
01:24:19,040 --> 01:24:23,680
throw the gun in the stream
and disappear into the crowd.

391
01:24:24,840 --> 01:24:27,680
Don't worry,
it's worse with a knife.

392
01:24:28,280 --> 01:24:30,640
If you're nervous, take these pills.

393
01:24:30,800 --> 01:24:34,080
Here's two. Try one.

394
01:24:34,240 --> 01:24:38,040
It's great!
You won't be afraid of anybody.

395
01:24:38,200 --> 01:24:40,280
Take the second,
before you go to work.

396
01:24:40,440 --> 01:24:44,360
Just one at a time
or you flip out. Understand?

397
01:26:01,160 --> 01:26:04,640
<i>Dawn in my soul.</i>

398
01:26:05,480 --> 01:26:08,480
<i>A bit of sun for each home.</i>

399
01:26:08,920 --> 01:26:12,040
<i>A bit of light for everyone.</i>

400
01:26:12,920 --> 01:26:16,080
<i>Under the canopy, a leaf trembles.</i>

401
01:26:16,840 --> 01:26:20,360
<i>And the dew remembers the clouds.</i>

402
01:26:21,200 --> 01:26:24,440
<i>And the earth exhales a huge wind.</i>

403
01:26:25,240 --> 01:26:29,200
<i>And life shivers, shivers.</i>

404
01:26:30,720 --> 01:26:33,920
<i>Kite of my childhood.</i>

405
01:26:34,200 --> 01:26:37,760
<i>Fragile hope hanging in the sky.</i>

406
01:26:38,480 --> 01:26:42,120
<i>Hearts open, human abodes.</i>

407
01:26:42,800 --> 01:26:46,000
<i>In a world
where no one is excluded.</i>

408
01:26:46,160 --> 01:26:48,000
No, don't break it!

409
01:31:39,040 --> 01:31:40,400
Bastard! She was a virgin!

410
01:31:48,120 --> 01:31:49,760
He said he didn't know.

411
01:31:50,320 --> 01:31:52,400
He suggests
we forget about it.

412
01:31:52,680 --> 01:31:54,240
He shelled out 600 dollars.

413
01:31:54,800 --> 01:31:57,240
That's more than for a virgin.

414
01:31:57,800 --> 01:32:00,920
He said the cuts weren't his fault.

415
01:39:27,520 --> 01:39:29,040
<i>A taste of dust</i>

416
01:39:29,760 --> 01:39:31,360
<i>longan peel</i>

417
01:39:32,560 --> 01:39:34,080
<i>stolen.</i>

418
01:39:39,480 --> 01:39:41,000
<i>A hand</i>

419
01:39:41,680 --> 01:39:43,280
<i>warm</i>

420
01:39:43,760 --> 01:39:45,480
<i>washes my face.</i>

421
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:47,520
<i>Papa.</i>

422
01:39:56,240 --> 01:39:57,960
<i>Green glow</i>

423
01:39:58,680 --> 01:40:00,200
<i>of live shrimp.</i>

424
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:02,480
<i>The market closes</i>

425
01:40:03,400 --> 01:40:04,880
<i>mama comes home.</i>

426
01:40:13,120 --> 01:40:14,720
<i>Cold rice</i>

427
01:40:15,240 --> 01:40:16,600
<i>punished...</i>

428
01:40:17,200 --> 01:40:18,720
<i>in secret, at night.</i>

429
01:40:19,120 --> 01:40:20,560
<i>Mama feeds me.</i>

430
01:40:31,600 --> 01:40:33,120
<i>Stifling heat</i>

431
01:40:33,520 --> 01:40:35,160
<i>of searing afternoons</i>

432
01:40:35,520 --> 01:40:37,080
<i>stench of rotten starfruit.</i>

433
01:40:48,680 --> 01:40:50,200
<i>In the rain.</i>

434
01:40:50,360 --> 01:40:51,600
<i>I shiver</i>

435
01:40:51,760 --> 01:40:53,240
<i>fried fish</i>

436
01:40:53,840 --> 01:40:55,280
<i>rice gruel.</i>

437
01:41:12,760 --> 01:41:14,240
<i>Lemon leaves</i>

438
01:41:15,280 --> 01:41:16,480
<i>grapefruit rind</i>

439
01:41:17,160 --> 01:41:18,720
<i>ivory-colored water</i>

440
01:41:19,480 --> 01:41:21,240
<i>my brown skin.</i>

441
01:42:17,440 --> 01:42:19,080
Fish face!

442
01:44:36,480 --> 01:44:38,360
What did I say?

443
01:44:38,720 --> 01:44:40,920
Why do you love paint so much?

444
01:44:42,520 --> 01:44:44,200
Where did you find this color?

445
01:44:44,800 --> 01:44:47,600
Our family doesn't use it.

446
01:53:59,560 --> 01:54:01,160
Come and eat!

447
01:54:19,520 --> 01:54:21,320
Invite the lady to eat with us.

448
01:55:24,520 --> 01:55:26,800
Wake up! Are you awake?

449
01:55:27,160 --> 01:55:28,000
Listen...

450
01:55:29,120 --> 01:55:31,880
Yesterday, you screwed up.

451
01:55:32,480 --> 01:55:35,000
Mr. Lullaby
should have rocked you.

452
01:55:35,480 --> 01:55:37,480
But someone up there spared you.

453
01:55:43,960 --> 01:55:46,640
It's sticky, I'll help you.

454
01:55:56,600 --> 01:55:58,760
The year of the Pig
begins today.

455
01:55:59,160 --> 01:56:01,160
I wish you peace

456
01:56:01,440 --> 01:56:02,720
health

457
01:56:02,880 --> 01:56:05,440
a normal life, like everyone else.

458
01:56:06,560 --> 01:56:08,360
We won't meet again.

459
01:56:09,680 --> 01:56:12,000
When you go, leave the door open.

460
01:57:26,800 --> 01:57:28,960
My little one... he's dead.

461
01:57:29,360 --> 01:57:31,440
Oh, God!

462
01:57:33,160 --> 01:57:34,640
Why?

463
01:58:54,240 --> 01:58:56,120
<i>Yesterday, the cat came back.</i>

464
01:58:57,200 --> 01:58:59,640
<i>We thought he was dead.</i>

465
01:59:00,080 --> 01:59:03,080
<i>He's even more handsome
than before</i>

466
01:59:03,240 --> 01:59:06,360
<i>so handsome,
nobody recognized him.</i>

467
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:10,920
<i>I remember my father
right before he died.</i>

468
01:59:11,120 --> 01:59:12,920
<i>It was a Sunday</i>

469
01:59:13,920 --> 01:59:18,560
<i>the only day
he took a nap at home.</i>

470
01:59:18,760 --> 01:59:22,840
<i>The cat was sleeping in the sun.</i>

471
01:59:23,280 --> 01:59:26,880
<i>A gash across his face.</i>

472
01:59:27,400 --> 01:59:30,600
<i>My father slept</i>

473
01:59:31,240 --> 01:59:34,920
<i>swinging his leg.</i>

474
01:59:35,960 --> 01:59:37,040
<i>I was a child.</i>

475
01:59:37,200 --> 01:59:40,520
I remember watching
my father's knee, for a long time.
