a TAKESHI KITANO film

6
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:11,154
We are ready.

7
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:18,703
It's time. Here goes.

8
00:01:26,462 --> 00:01:36,554
"I beg you. Calm thyself.
Rashness will come to no good."

9
00:01:36,722 --> 00:01:42,351
"Thou hast become enslaved

10
00:01:42,686 --> 00:01:55,073
to such a miserable state of mind."

11
00:02:06,293 --> 00:02:10,421
"Who hast led thee to such a state?"

12
00:02:10,714 --> 00:02:16,886
"God have mercy. It is none other than I."

13
00:02:17,179 --> 00:02:24,519
"I, Umekawa, is all to be blamed."

14
00:02:25,604 --> 00:02:33,111
"Shall I be thankful to thee?"

15
00:02:33,445 --> 00:02:41,285
"Or shall I pity thee?"

16
00:03:01,348 --> 00:03:08,104
"Read thou my heart."
She beguiled him.

17
00:03:08,397 --> 00:03:19,323
The tears she shed
fell on the gold coins.

18
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:27,623
And her tears shone like globeflowers

19
00:03:28,167 --> 00:03:30,334
covered by dew.

20
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:37,758
It was indeed a sight,
which drew forth

21
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:55,151
pity from one's heart.

22
00:04:15,047 --> 00:04:18,090
All the gold Chubei spent

23
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:21,010
was not his to possess.

24
00:04:21,303 --> 00:04:25,556
Thus, glory was ephemeral.

25
00:04:25,849 --> 00:04:27,475
Away they fled

26
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:46,953
to yonder and beyond
where their feet gulded them.

The bound beggars.

35
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:24,795
Bound beggars!

36
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:12,051
Well, hello.

37
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:13,219
Hi.

38
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:17,389
So, Matsumoto's bride isn't Sawako.

39
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:19,808
Evidently not.

40
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:24,772
When I got the invitation,
I thought they finally got hitched

41
00:09:25,524 --> 00:09:26,649
but I was wrong.

42
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:31,612
He's marrying
our company president's daughter.

43
00:09:33,031 --> 00:09:33,989
You're kidding.

44
00:09:34,366 --> 00:09:36,033
The family seems to like him.

45
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:40,412
So, he's a Cinderella boy.

46
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:45,251
He's now a way ahead of us.

47
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:51,966
Whatever happened to Sawako?

48
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,386
Must have broken up nicely.

49
00:09:56,555 --> 00:09:59,056
Never thought Matsumoto was such a guy.

50
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:01,767
Why not take the opportunity?

51
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:06,105
Yeah, the shortcut to success.

52
00:10:07,524 --> 00:10:10,776
In 2 years, we'll have to
speak politely to him.

53
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:14,697
The president is kind enough to...

54
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:16,907
I'm already engaged.

55
00:10:17,075 --> 00:10:19,785
Forget her. You're not married yet.

56
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:21,620
Think about your life.

57
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:23,414
Your father worked hard,

58
00:10:23,582 --> 00:10:27,418
but with little success,
because he's not a college graduate.

59
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:30,421
Why do you think
he made you go to college?

60
00:10:30,714 --> 00:10:32,131
Think it over.

61
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:33,882
It's about your life.

62
00:10:34,092 --> 00:10:36,051
This is a great opportunity.

63
00:10:36,219 --> 00:10:37,970
You must know that.

64
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:39,680
I can't leave her.

65
00:10:39,848 --> 00:10:42,099
We'll go and apologize to her.

66
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:44,727
We'll beg her... do anything.

67
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:51,317
What?

68
00:10:53,612 --> 00:10:54,612
Congratulations.

69
00:10:57,699 --> 00:10:58,991
I'm happy for you.

70
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:26,018
Excuse me, sir.

71
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:30,022
You have a visitor.
She says she's Sawako's friend.

72
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:39,990
Hey.

73
00:11:43,912 --> 00:11:44,870
What's up?

74
00:11:45,664 --> 00:11:47,081
An old friend's here.

75
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:49,416
Forgot to invite him.

76
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:51,502
I see.

77
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:11,897
So, you chose success?

78
00:12:14,484 --> 00:12:15,609
Sawako chose suicide.

79
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:18,153
She died?

80
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,323
No, she survived, but not completely.

81
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:24,243
She lost her sanity.

82
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:26,412
Doesn't even recognise me.

83
00:12:27,247 --> 00:12:28,372
She's as good as dead.

84
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:32,084
Where is she now?

85
00:12:33,503 --> 00:12:34,461
Hospital.

86
00:12:35,505 --> 00:12:36,463
Which one?

87
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:39,258
She won't recognise you.

88
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:17,272
Sawako chose suicide.

89
00:14:24,239 --> 00:14:25,739
She won't recognise you.

90
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:43,507
It's delicious.

91
00:15:07,574 --> 00:15:08,782
You can have more.

92
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:05,005
Whatever happened to him?

93
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:08,759
Heard he took off.

94
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:12,804
What about the wedding?

95
00:16:14,057 --> 00:16:16,058
I guess it'll be cancelled.

96
00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:14,825
Okay, collect the trash.

97
00:17:16,327 --> 00:17:19,621
Put the trash in here. Okay.

98
00:17:20,415 --> 00:17:22,082
Still some over there.

99
00:21:07,475 --> 00:21:11,686
Why the hell did you
take off from the wedding?

100
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:18,443
The bride was in tears,
and the president was furious.

101
00:21:26,202 --> 00:21:27,494
Can you lend me money?

102
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:31,539
What are you...

103
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:33,458
Whatever you have now.

104
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:41,591
What do you plan to do?

105
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:44,719
Better apologize quickly
or you'll be doomed.

106
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:47,013
Thanks a million.

107
00:21:48,182 --> 00:21:49,557
I'll get in touch with you soon.

108
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:51,559
Hey, Matsumoto.

109
00:22:06,033 --> 00:22:07,784
Where did you come from?

110
00:22:10,413 --> 00:22:11,955
What's your name?

111
00:22:36,856 --> 00:22:39,274
Sir... Your lady seems to be...

112
00:23:15,978 --> 00:23:17,771
Don't leave the room by yourself.

113
00:23:21,359 --> 00:23:23,568
You'll cause the hotel trouble.

114
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:31,576
I'll take care of everything.

115
00:24:18,707 --> 00:24:19,666
Hello.

116
00:24:21,836 --> 00:24:25,422
Yes... I understand...

117
00:25:01,542 --> 00:25:02,584
Sorry, sorry.

118
00:25:03,544 --> 00:25:04,586
Give them to me.

119
00:25:13,596 --> 00:25:14,554
Yeah...

120
00:25:17,766 --> 00:25:18,725
I know...

121
00:25:23,856 --> 00:25:26,232
...But Sawako
isn't feeling so great.

122
00:25:27,109 --> 00:25:28,067
I heard.

123
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:31,696
They say she's lost her mind.

124
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:33,323
Is it true?

125
00:25:42,249 --> 00:25:45,084
Hello?... Hello?

126
00:25:46,962 --> 00:25:47,921
Hello?

127
00:25:50,299 --> 00:25:51,925
Hey, Matsumoto.

128
00:25:59,225 --> 00:26:00,808
Are you from around here?

129
00:26:03,812 --> 00:26:04,896
Where do you live?

130
00:26:05,439 --> 00:26:07,065
Is anything the matter?

131
00:26:08,192 --> 00:26:09,192
You know her?

132
00:26:09,443 --> 00:26:10,401
Yes.

133
00:26:11,445 --> 00:26:13,404
Can you pay for them?

134
00:26:17,368 --> 00:26:18,326
Let me...

135
00:26:19,245 --> 00:26:20,203
Come on...

136
00:26:23,749 --> 00:26:24,707
Let me see them.

137
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:40,640
Do you want to try that out?

138
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:46,104
Go ahead.
Open it and try it.

139
00:26:55,948 --> 00:26:57,031
Wait... Let me.

140
00:27:17,886 --> 00:27:18,845
Like this.

141
00:27:35,738 --> 00:27:40,366
Let me.
You blow it... Like this.

142
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:19,447
It's cold. Let's go in.

143
00:28:22,701 --> 00:28:23,868
You'll catch cold.

144
00:28:27,873 --> 00:28:28,831
Here.

145
00:30:17,316 --> 00:30:19,776
Watch out, you morons.
What's wrong with you?

146
00:30:38,754 --> 00:30:40,338
I'll buy you a new one.

147
00:36:13,922 --> 00:36:14,880
Forgive me.

148
00:36:18,969 --> 00:36:20,427
Boss, it's done.

149
00:36:20,762 --> 00:36:22,888
We've finished loading.

150
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:25,015
Thank you very much.

151
00:36:25,517 --> 00:36:26,976
We appreciate it.

152
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:29,353
We'll be off then.

153
00:36:53,712 --> 00:36:54,795
It was his choice.

154
00:38:57,294 --> 00:38:58,252
Boss.

155
00:38:58,962 --> 00:39:00,546
He'll be guarding you.

156
00:39:01,923 --> 00:39:04,675
I'm Ikeuchi, sir.
I'm starting today.

157
00:39:24,654 --> 00:39:26,196
Is your mother well?

158
00:39:26,406 --> 00:39:27,364
Yeah.

159
00:39:27,574 --> 00:39:28,532
I see.

160
00:39:40,295 --> 00:39:41,337
Yeah... Hey.

161
00:39:43,048 --> 00:39:43,964
Thank you.

162
00:39:46,968 --> 00:39:48,886
- Say hello to her.
- Sure.

163
00:40:01,149 --> 00:40:03,192
That's my (yakuza) brother's son.

164
00:40:39,896 --> 00:40:42,064
What's with those guys?
Some weirdos.

165
00:41:03,962 --> 00:41:04,920
Excuse me.

166
00:41:16,349 --> 00:41:19,560
Where did you say you came from?

167
00:41:21,187 --> 00:41:22,688
The Takigawa Family, sir.

168
00:41:22,981 --> 00:41:26,984
Oh, yeah... In Hiroshima, right?

169
00:41:28,611 --> 00:41:30,446
How long have you been with us?

170
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:32,489
2 years, sir.

171
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:33,699
Is that right?

172
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:37,619
Not easy, is it?

173
00:41:40,165 --> 00:41:42,541
Why did you become a yakuza?

174
00:41:44,461 --> 00:41:47,463
When I was a kid,
I used to fight all the time.

175
00:41:47,464 --> 00:41:50,716
Became a yakuza,
because I was bad.

176
00:41:50,925 --> 00:41:54,761
Being strong in fights
doesn't mean anything nowadays.

177
00:41:55,805 --> 00:41:57,222
Better use your head.

178
00:42:02,812 --> 00:42:08,192
Being tough did mean something
...in the good ol' days.

179
00:42:55,114 --> 00:42:58,659
After you ice him,
stay away from my place.

180
00:42:59,953 --> 00:43:04,498
You have to kill even
your (yakuza) brother at times.

181
00:43:26,312 --> 00:43:27,521
Go ahead.

182
00:45:15,630 --> 00:45:19,049
Brother, you're killing me, too?

183
00:45:20,218 --> 00:45:21,510
Sorry about it.

184
00:45:25,556 --> 00:45:26,556
Do it.

185
00:45:34,357 --> 00:45:37,192
Too bad... We were really close.

186
00:45:42,323 --> 00:45:43,281
The doctor's here.

187
00:45:43,491 --> 00:45:44,533
Oh, okay.

188
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:23,697
Damn quack. I can't tell
whether I'm getting better or worse.

189
00:46:25,908 --> 00:46:28,160
He never says anything straight.

190
00:46:31,456 --> 00:46:36,168
Maybe I haven't got
much time ahead of me.

191
00:46:40,339 --> 00:46:41,298
Are you single?

192
00:46:43,009 --> 00:46:44,134
No woman?

193
00:46:44,761 --> 00:46:46,094
Not now.

194
00:46:46,095 --> 00:46:47,095
How come?

195
00:46:47,972 --> 00:46:50,474
Because women get in our way.

196
00:46:51,058 --> 00:46:55,645
So you're an old fashioned chap, huh?

197
00:46:56,564 --> 00:46:57,522
Am I?

198
00:46:59,525 --> 00:47:01,026
I used to be like you.

199
00:47:05,531 --> 00:47:06,948
- It's me.
- You surprised me.

200
00:47:07,950 --> 00:47:09,701
Here. I made lunch for you, too.

201
00:47:13,456 --> 00:47:16,291
Wow. This is terrific.

202
00:47:16,751 --> 00:47:18,043
Will you eat it?

203
00:47:18,044 --> 00:47:19,002
I will.

204
00:47:20,129 --> 00:47:21,421
- Here.
- Thank you.

205
00:47:24,634 --> 00:47:25,801
It certainly looks good.

206
00:47:32,809 --> 00:47:34,810
- How is it?
- It's delicious.

207
00:47:35,061 --> 00:47:36,019
I'm glad.

208
00:47:48,574 --> 00:47:51,117
- I'm going out...
- Yes, sir.

209
00:47:51,494 --> 00:47:53,703
- Take me to Saitama.
- Sir?

210
00:47:54,413 --> 00:47:56,039
Today's Saturday, right?

211
00:47:56,958 --> 00:47:57,916
Yes.

212
00:48:12,306 --> 00:48:13,598
Brought them from the shop.

213
00:48:14,517 --> 00:48:15,892
Won't they be angry?

214
00:48:16,102 --> 00:48:17,602
No, these were left over.

215
00:48:18,271 --> 00:48:20,772
Next Saturday, I'll make the lunches.

216
00:48:27,154 --> 00:48:30,949
I might not be able to come next week.

217
00:48:32,243 --> 00:48:33,243
Are you busy?

218
00:48:33,452 --> 00:48:35,996
Yes... Well, no...

219
00:48:38,082 --> 00:48:39,666
I'm thinking of quitting work.

220
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:49,050
Not much work at the factory
and it may go bankrupt.

221
00:48:51,095 --> 00:48:55,390
I think I'll do the owner
a favour by quitting early.

222
00:48:55,933 --> 00:48:59,311
He's a great guy,
and can't tell me to quit.

223
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:03,440
I see.

224
00:49:12,617 --> 00:49:15,785
I'll find a more worthwhile job.

225
00:49:19,874 --> 00:49:24,377
The way I am now,
I can't make you happy.

226
00:49:28,341 --> 00:49:32,177
Being half-assed isn't good,
so it might be better...

227
00:49:35,723 --> 00:49:38,516
to be alone for a while.

228
00:49:42,438 --> 00:49:45,440
So, don't care about me, Ryoko,
and go your own way.

229
00:50:00,581 --> 00:50:03,124
I'll come see you when I'm ready.

230
00:50:03,876 --> 00:50:08,254
When I come I'll be dressed well, too.

231
00:50:09,882 --> 00:50:13,093
You'll be surprised that
I've made something of myself.

232
00:50:24,230 --> 00:50:26,356
Well, I'll be going.

233
00:50:33,531 --> 00:50:34,698
See you.

234
00:50:57,138 --> 00:50:58,096
Hiro!

235
00:51:00,641 --> 00:51:02,058
I'll wait for you.

236
00:51:03,436 --> 00:51:06,688
I'll make lunch,
and be here every Saturday.

237
00:51:08,190 --> 00:51:09,941
I'll make lunch and wait for you.

238
00:51:15,823 --> 00:51:19,534
I'll make lunch,
and be here every Saturday.

239
00:51:21,787 --> 00:51:23,538
I'll make lunch and wait for you.

240
00:51:50,107 --> 00:51:51,107
Wait here.

241
00:51:51,567 --> 00:51:52,525
Yes, sir.

242
00:51:59,575 --> 00:52:00,950
What is this place?

243
00:52:02,328 --> 00:52:04,496
Don't ask me such things.

244
00:52:04,872 --> 00:52:05,830
Sorry.

245
00:54:14,293 --> 00:54:15,543
The woman in question.

246
00:54:16,086 --> 00:54:17,045
Who?

247
00:54:17,296 --> 00:54:19,964
She comes here every Saturday
at noon with 2 box-lunches

248
00:54:20,966 --> 00:54:22,508
and waits for her beau.

249
00:54:37,983 --> 00:54:40,443
Excuse me. May we sit here?

250
00:54:41,237 --> 00:54:48,076
I'm sorry. I promised to eat lunch
with my boyfriend here.

251
00:54:50,162 --> 00:54:51,788
Can you keep it vacant?

252
00:54:55,251 --> 00:54:56,376
Thank you.

253
00:55:44,675 --> 00:55:47,510
Hey, there hasn't been any bites.

254
00:55:48,012 --> 00:55:48,970
Sorry, sir.

255
00:55:49,179 --> 00:55:52,390
How come there's no bites here?

256
00:55:53,017 --> 00:55:55,184
- Sorry, sir.
- Forget the sorry, sir

257
00:55:55,436 --> 00:55:58,229
Hey, did you put bait on my line?

258
00:55:59,023 --> 00:56:00,148
Yes, tangerine.

259
00:56:00,482 --> 00:56:01,941
- Tangerine?
- Yes, sir.

260
00:56:01,942 --> 00:56:02,984
Tangerine as bait?

261
00:56:03,152 --> 00:56:04,110
Yes, sir.

262
00:56:04,403 --> 00:56:05,862
- For fish?
- Yes, sir.

263
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:09,324
How can you catch fish
with tangerine, you moron?

264
00:56:09,908 --> 00:56:11,868
This is ridiculous. Let's go.

265
01:02:54,146 --> 01:02:56,981
Hey. It flew away.

266
01:03:08,243 --> 01:03:09,285
Got you.

267
01:03:44,696 --> 01:03:47,239
Fans often come here.

268
01:03:48,909 --> 01:03:51,702
A Mr.Aoki came
to see her the other day.

269
01:03:52,496 --> 01:03:55,498
She refused.
She doesn't want to show her face.

270
01:03:56,792 --> 01:03:59,710
No offense. You're blind
so she won't mind you.

271
01:04:00,712 --> 01:04:05,299
You'd be satisfied
hearing her voice, wouldn't you?

272
01:05:40,896 --> 01:05:45,441
"They say girls become pretty,
when they're in love

273
01:05:46,985 --> 01:05:51,363
Is it really so?
I hope it's true

274
01:05:52,949 --> 01:05:57,369
You can be shy
You can be bashful

275
01:05:58,914 --> 01:06:03,292
But when you're in love
Your eyes sparkle

276
01:06:04,461 --> 01:06:10,007
Eyes meet and ignite the fire
That's when love begins

277
01:06:10,425 --> 01:06:16,096
Glancing each other
That's when the beam flashes

278
01:06:16,514 --> 01:06:22,061
Ma-me-mi-mu-me-mo
Magical beam

279
01:06:22,479 --> 01:06:27,983
Ma-me-mi-mu-me-mo
Magical beam

280

Eyes meet and ignite the fire
That's when love begins

281
01:06:34,491 --> 01:06:40,162
Glancing each other
That's when the beam flashes

282
01:06:40,497 --> 01:06:46,126
Ma-me-mi-mu-me-mo
Magical beam

283
01:06:46,461 --> 01:06:52,174
Ma-me-mi-mu-me-mo
Magical beam"

284
01:07:58,867 --> 01:08:01,535
The one who was running...
Was that Nukui?

285
01:08:02,287 --> 01:08:03,787
He's the oldest groupie, right?

286
01:08:04,581 --> 01:08:05,539
For how long?

287
01:08:05,749 --> 01:08:08,917
About 4 years...
So is the kid in red.

288
01:08:09,419 --> 01:08:15,632
Kid in red? They're grown ups.
Well, we should be grateful to them.

289
01:08:17,469 --> 01:08:20,054
But be careful. They can be dangerous.

290
01:08:44,370 --> 01:08:47,915
The Tokyo Stock Market
witnessed continual falls in...

291
01:08:48,291 --> 01:08:53,253
The Garden Hotel's liabilities
prove to be...

292
01:09:08,394 --> 01:09:11,647
Hey, are you watching the traffic?

293
01:09:13,483 --> 01:09:15,734
Don't put this crap on your uniform.

294
01:09:16,653 --> 01:09:18,695
Watch carefully, you jerk.

295
01:09:47,684 --> 01:09:52,771

01:10:30,685 --> 01:10:34,313
If you don't mind,
this box-lunch was left over,

301
01:10:36,191 --> 01:10:38,525
so please eat it.

302
01:10:38,818 --> 01:10:41,028
Thanks as always.
I'd be happy to.

303
01:11:05,220 --> 01:11:06,136
Here...

304
01:11:06,137 --> 01:11:08,722
Thank you very much.
My pleasure.

305
01:11:16,105 --> 01:11:18,690
- Here.
- Thanks. This is for you.

306
01:11:18,691 --> 01:11:19,942
Thank you.

307
01:11:19,943 --> 01:11:21,526
I wish you luck.

Thank you.

01:11:34,540 --> 01:11:36,500
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

312
01:11:40,171 --> 01:11:41,421
Can you address it to me?

313
01:11:41,673 --> 01:11:43,257
Sure. Mr.Aoki, right?

314
01:11:43,258 --> 01:11:45,550
- Yes!
- Thanks for your support.

315
01:11:54,477 --> 01:11:56,061
- Here.
- This is for you.

316
01:12:18,084 --> 01:12:19,543
Can you address it to me?

01:12:19,544 --> 01:12:21,211
Sure. Mr.Aoki, right?

involved in a car accident...

324
01:14:12,532 --> 01:14:14,157
Will she live?

325
01:14:14,450 --> 01:14:16,201
I just got here.

326
01:14:16,577 --> 01:14:18,787
- What's the cause?
- You've seen her?

327
01:14:18,996 --> 01:14:21,039
- No, not yet.
- No visitors allowed?

328
01:14:21,332 --> 01:14:23,041
- Pardon?
- No visitors allowed?

329
01:14:23,042 --> 01:14:24,626
I don't know.

330
01:14:24,836 --> 01:14:27,629
I'll tell you all I know at present.

331
01:14:27,839 --> 01:14:33,135
At about 11:20 last night,
on the way from Odaiba

332
01:14:33,386 --> 01:14:34,886
avoiding another car

333
01:14:35,096 --> 01:14:37,764
her car crashed into a power terminal.

334
01:14:37,765 --> 01:14:39,349
Who was driving the car?

335
01:14:39,559 --> 01:14:40,892
Will she return to work?

336
01:14:41,436 --> 01:14:43,353
- When is it?
- Don't know.

337
01:14:43,354 --> 01:14:44,354
A press conference?

338
01:14:44,564 --> 01:14:47,023
There are other patients here, too.

339
01:14:47,233 --> 01:14:48,400
When's the P.C.?

340
01:14:48,609 --> 01:14:49,901
This is a hospital.

341
01:14:50,111 --> 01:14:51,361
Message to her fans.

342
01:14:51,571 --> 01:14:54,072
Please leave. This is a hospital.

343
01:14:54,449 --> 01:14:57,200
As I told you earlier, I don't know.

344
01:14:57,994 --> 01:14:59,744
Please leave for now.

345
01:15:04,709 --> 01:15:06,543
I'll tell you when I know.

346
01:15:06,544 --> 01:15:07,502
You haven't...?

347
01:16:07,396 --> 01:16:10,106
My daughter's not home.

348
01:16:11,067 --> 01:16:14,361
She's retired.
I don't think she'll see anyone.

349
01:16:15,404 --> 01:16:17,113
Can't I write her a note?

350
01:16:19,992 --> 01:16:22,494
Well... I guess so... Wait a minute.

351
01:16:31,671 --> 01:16:32,629
Here.

352
01:16:33,297 --> 01:16:34,256
Thank you.

353
01:17:14,088 --> 01:17:17,173
- Can you address it to me?
- Sure. Mr.Aoki, right?

354
01:17:17,174 --> 01:17:19,384
- Yes.
- Thanks for your support.

355
01:18:43,886 --> 01:18:46,846
Wait here.
She's right there.

356
01:18:47,056 --> 01:18:47,972
Yes, ma'am.

357
01:19:00,486 --> 01:19:01,486
Haruna.

358
01:19:04,031 --> 01:19:07,200
Your fan from Tokyo
has come to visit you.

359
01:19:09,245 --> 01:19:11,579
I told you I'm not seeing any fans.

360
01:19:14,125 --> 01:19:16,543
I don't want fans to see this face.

361
01:19:16,711 --> 01:19:19,087
But this person is blind.

362
01:19:20,756 --> 01:19:21,715
What?

363
01:19:36,021 --> 01:19:37,105
Okay?

364
01:20:07,261 --> 01:20:09,137
She's in front of you.

365
01:20:12,600 --> 01:20:14,517
You're Mr. Nukui, right?

366
01:20:16,437 --> 01:20:17,437
Yes.

367
01:20:19,607 --> 01:20:21,483
What happened to your eyes?

368
01:20:22,651 --> 01:20:26,321
I thought it would be better
if I hadn't been able to see.

369
01:21:52,241 --> 01:21:56,619
I think my boyfriend will soon be here.

370
01:21:58,330 --> 01:22:00,206
When he comes, please leave.

371
01:22:01,166 --> 01:22:02,166
I will.

372
01:22:03,210 --> 01:22:04,669
Sorry for the trouble.

373
01:24:52,588 --> 01:24:53,838
Smells good.

374
01:24:55,674 --> 01:24:57,300
Roses are in full bloom.

375
01:24:57,593 --> 01:24:59,218
Ah... I see.

376
01:25:21,200 --> 01:25:24,160
Your boyfriend...
He still hasn't come.

377
01:25:27,581 --> 01:25:28,956
He's not coming.

378
01:25:31,543 --> 01:25:33,044
So he isn't.

379
01:25:35,255 --> 01:25:37,715
But it doesn't matter anymore

380
01:25:39,384 --> 01:25:44,263
because recently...
you come here instead.

381
01:25:47,559 --> 01:25:50,478
Maybe I'll stop waiting for him.

382
01:26:01,406 --> 01:26:02,490
Would you join me?

383
01:26:05,410 --> 01:26:06,410
Thank you.

384
01:28:03,403 --> 01:28:07,823
"They say girls become pretty
When they're in love

385
01:28:08,742 --> 01:28:15,039
Is it really so?
I hope it's true

386
01:28:16,250 --> 01:28:22,713
You can be shy
You can be bashful

387
01:28:23,882 --> 01:28:25,383
But when you're..."

388
01:31:08,839 --> 01:31:11,340
I roasted some cod roe today.

389
01:31:12,509 --> 01:31:13,676
Dislike it?

390
01:31:13,885 --> 01:31:15,678
No, it's my favorite.

391
01:31:16,930 --> 01:31:18,097
Glad to hear that.

392
01:31:19,141 --> 01:31:23,394
Come to think of it
cod roe was his favorite, too.

393
01:34:01,636 --> 01:34:05,723
Boss. Boss...

394
01:34:06,641 --> 01:34:07,725
Hey, you try.

395
01:34:07,976 --> 01:34:10,185
- Boss.
- Darn. Shout louder.

396
01:34:10,478 --> 01:34:11,645
Boss.

397
01:34:12,105 --> 01:34:13,647
- Again.
- Boss.

398
01:34:13,940 --> 01:34:16,066
Boss... Boss.

399
01:34:17,235 --> 01:34:19,153
He must be out. Let's go.

400
01:37:28,384 --> 01:37:29,843
Give me a break.

401
01:37:30,053 --> 01:37:32,221
Take a pose... like models.

402
01:37:41,231 --> 01:37:43,690
What the hell is that?

403
01:37:43,858 --> 01:37:45,984
Shut up. Hurry up and shoot.

404
01:37:46,486 --> 01:37:49,363
Getting married, right?
Gonna tell everyone.

405
01:37:49,781 --> 01:37:54,326
Hey, don't tell anyone.
You'd better not tell anyone.

406
01:37:54,494 --> 01:37:56,036
All right. Stop it.

407
01:37:56,037 --> 01:37:57,704
Stop it. It's dangerous.

408
01:37:57,872 --> 01:37:58,914
Hey, stop it.

409
01:38:00,542 --> 01:38:01,500
Stop it.

410
01:38:05,839 --> 01:38:06,964
It's really dangerous.

411
01:38:07,423 --> 01:38:08,882
Watch out. It's dangerous.

412
01:44:01,444 --> 01:44:03,236
Everyone, listen up.

413
01:44:04,739 --> 01:44:06,364
I have big news.

414
01:44:07,491 --> 01:44:10,577
Matsumoto and Sawako
are getting married.

415
01:44:13,372 --> 01:44:15,916
- Getting married!
- No kidding? Really?

416
01:44:21,339 --> 01:44:23,423
- Had a crush on her?
- I didn't.

417
01:44:23,674 --> 01:44:25,508
- What a surprise!
- Congratulations.

418
01:44:26,719 --> 01:44:27,719
Thank you.

419
01:44:31,807 --> 01:44:33,516
You should buy her a ring.

420
01:44:33,809 --> 01:44:35,644
I couldn't afford it.

421
01:44:42,318 --> 01:44:43,276
I'm sorry.

422
01:44:54,580 --> 01:44:55,705
Thank you.

423
01:47:22,645 --> 01:47:24,020
What're you doing here?

424
01:47:25,189 --> 01:47:26,606
You could start a fire.

425
01:47:28,275 --> 01:47:29,442
Come on, beat it.

426
01:47:30,945 --> 01:47:32,612
