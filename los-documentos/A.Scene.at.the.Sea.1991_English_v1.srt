1
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:49,735
Get to work, will ya?

2
00:02:20,724 --> 00:02:24,519
You'd better do your work.
Don't be lazy!

3
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:25,872
Get out of here.

4
00:04:30,437 --> 00:04:31,437
A date?

5
00:04:56,379 --> 00:04:58,840
Surfing? Take care.

6
00:05:44,886 --> 00:05:46,638
It looks like it's gonna rain.

7
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:50,642
Don't worry.

8
00:05:50,809 --> 00:05:54,688
The old lady at the tobacco shop
predicted it.

9
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:01,987
Look! Is that shigeru?

10
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:04,865
It's him.

11
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:08,618
He started surfing.

12
00:06:10,579 --> 00:06:12,247
Hey! Shigeru!

13
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:14,958
No use. He's deaf.

14
00:06:21,298 --> 00:06:23,008
What if it hits him?

15
00:06:27,178 --> 00:06:28,513
He won't be mad.

16
00:10:50,525 --> 00:10:52,819
- He's gone.
- Where is he?

17
00:10:55,822 --> 00:10:57,532
That one?

18
00:10:58,283 --> 00:10:59,492
That's him!

19
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:13,024
Let's go. He'll get mad.

20
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:18,046
Watch out!

21
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:05,279
He doesn't have a wetsuit!

22
00:15:06,114 --> 00:15:08,533
- It's cold.
- Isn't he cold?

23
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:10,952
Rather dangerous.

24
00:15:11,953 --> 00:15:18,793
- He almost got it.
- He's not good at all.

25
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:18,101
Too bad!

26
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:20,813
He's trying hard.

27
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:32,533
It's broken.

28
00:16:57,975 --> 00:16:59,644
Poor boy!

29
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:06,317
- He's not good enough.
- Of course not!

30
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:10,947
He's dumb!

31
00:20:07,665 --> 00:20:08,665
What is it?

32
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:12,461
She wants a 25% discount.

33
00:20:12,837 --> 00:20:14,004
What?

34
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:15,840
Not that much.

35
00:21:40,883 --> 00:21:42,009
Come on!

36
00:22:37,773 --> 00:22:40,317
Here's your pay!

37
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:43,571
Buy me a drink.

38
00:22:44,154 --> 00:22:45,489
What?

39
00:22:46,323 --> 00:22:47,575
You're a bachelor.

40
00:22:48,117 --> 00:22:52,496
I have three kids to feed.
I can't afford four.

41
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:55,082
Shigeru!

42
00:23:00,838 --> 00:23:01,881
Yamato!

43
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:04,216
Treat me.

44
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:05,759
Thank you.

45
00:24:14,745 --> 00:24:16,413
Free of charge.

46
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:37,184
Thank you very much.

47
00:24:45,234 --> 00:24:47,403
They came here before.

48
00:24:49,613 --> 00:24:51,532
I could've given him a better price.

49
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:55,035
At Akira's shop,
they sell for 98,000 yen.

50
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,477
4,200 yen in all.

51
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,354
Give me a discount.

52
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:24,732
Wholesale prices.

53
00:25:25,149 --> 00:25:27,901
- 4,200 yen.
- Akira sells them cheaper.

54
00:25:28,819 --> 00:25:31,155
Then buy from him.

55
00:25:31,488 --> 00:25:33,782
Not again!

56
00:25:34,742 --> 00:25:37,911
Come to the sea
to coach us sometimes.

57
00:25:38,954 --> 00:25:39,954
I'm busy.

58
00:25:46,754 --> 00:25:47,754
Thank you!

59
00:26:22,289 --> 00:26:24,416
You can't bring your surfboard.

60
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:29,379
No surfboards when it's crowded.

61
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:19,883
Sit down, young lady.

62
00:32:21,731 --> 00:32:25,026
They're going to surf again.

63
00:32:26,862 --> 00:32:28,488
Looks like it.

64
00:32:30,115 --> 00:32:32,367
What's so great about it?

65
00:33:14,034 --> 00:33:15,327
What's this for?

66
00:33:16,786 --> 00:33:18,455
It goes around your ankle.

67
00:33:18,705 --> 00:33:19,705
Ankle?

68
00:33:26,254 --> 00:33:27,464
I'm going.

69
00:33:33,136 --> 00:33:34,137
Idiot!

70
00:34:47,127 --> 00:34:48,253
Have some juice.

71
00:36:05,872 --> 00:36:07,499
98,000 yen?

72
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:14,506
I'll ask him.

73
00:36:23,348 --> 00:36:24,891
Excuse me.

74
00:36:26,810 --> 00:36:29,688
Can we get that one
with i0,000 yen?

75
00:36:31,731 --> 00:36:33,942
It's a 98,000-yen surfboard.

76
00:36:35,443 --> 00:36:36,945
What joke is that?

77
00:38:27,764 --> 00:38:28,764
9,000 yen!

78
00:38:29,098 --> 00:38:31,184
- We can buy it!
- Trash!

79
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:32,977
You got any?

80
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:35,772
Five grand.

81
00:38:49,577 --> 00:38:51,246
I got it!

82
00:38:51,913 --> 00:38:55,041
But it's trash.

83
00:38:56,251 --> 00:38:58,127
Good for a start.

84
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:07,762
I don't have a cent left.

85
00:39:10,306 --> 00:39:11,474
I'm broke, too.

86
00:39:12,517 --> 00:39:13,977
How'il we get home?

87
00:39:15,144 --> 00:39:16,813
You should've kept the bus fare!

88
00:39:43,673 --> 00:39:45,091
This is all?

89
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:47,802
No one else?

90
00:39:48,970 --> 00:39:50,138
Where's kimura?

91
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:51,973
Who knows?

92
00:39:52,515 --> 00:39:53,683
They'll be late.

93
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:15,079
I'm at the back like a girl!
Change positions.

94
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:27,717
That girl was pretty hot...

95
00:40:29,469 --> 00:40:30,803
What happened...

96
00:40:31,012 --> 00:40:32,305
After that...

97
00:40:43,608 --> 00:40:45,777
It's crowded.

98
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:50,573
Let's go there.

99
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:09,133
It's boring without waves.

100
00:41:09,384 --> 00:41:10,677
Sure is.

101
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:13,346
Here he comes!

102
00:41:14,681 --> 00:41:17,225
He's laughing.

103
00:41:19,268 --> 00:41:20,603
Cheers.

104
00:41:21,229 --> 00:41:22,312
How's business?

105
00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:24,857
Dull. Because you aren't buying.

106
00:41:25,566 --> 00:41:27,651
Too high prices.

107
00:41:27,652 --> 00:41:29,737
Don't blame us.

108
00:41:31,406 --> 00:41:32,490
The waves?

109
00:41:32,699 --> 00:41:35,618
The worst.

110
00:41:35,785 --> 00:41:38,871
We are bored.

111
00:41:42,542 --> 00:41:43,584
How is he?

112
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:45,586
He comes every day.

113
00:41:46,045 --> 00:41:47,630
He's getting much better.

114
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:50,133
He's trying hard.

115
00:41:51,259 --> 00:41:53,386
He needs a wetsuit.

116
00:41:53,553 --> 00:41:56,305
- He must be cold.
- Got guts.

117
00:41:56,472 --> 00:42:00,309
He sure has guts.
He's improving his skills.

118
00:42:02,645 --> 00:42:03,896
He must be cold.

119
00:42:04,647 --> 00:42:05,647
Of course.

120
00:42:05,815 --> 00:42:08,609
- Very cold.
- He's almost naked.

121
00:42:13,448 --> 00:42:15,616
Bye then.

122
00:42:21,497 --> 00:42:24,208
- Cold?
- Very cold.

123
00:42:24,959 --> 00:42:27,086
But it's fun.

124
00:42:27,295 --> 00:42:28,545
Really?

125
00:42:28,546 --> 00:42:30,422
But you didn't ride.

126
00:42:30,423 --> 00:42:31,507
Still it was fun.

127
00:42:31,758 --> 00:42:34,135
- I'm tempted.
- Try.

128
00:42:38,389 --> 00:42:40,891
- It's just great.
- Really?

129
00:42:40,892 --> 00:42:44,062
- You'll see.
- It looks cold.

130
00:42:55,948 --> 00:42:57,116
Oh, so cold.

131
00:43:00,453 --> 00:43:03,289
Hi! Use this.

132
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:06,500
Use this.

133
00:43:10,421 --> 00:43:11,421
Look...

134
00:43:14,258 --> 00:43:17,136
There's a contest at chiba.
Take part in it.

135
00:47:51,619 --> 00:47:54,789
Can't the three of us ride together?

136
00:47:55,164 --> 00:47:58,667
That's the law.
Your driver's license.

137
00:48:00,211 --> 00:48:01,879
Why not let us pass?

138
00:48:02,421 --> 00:48:03,547
Your license!

139
00:48:06,967 --> 00:48:08,051
Give it to me!

140
00:48:08,052 --> 00:48:09,719
I am in a bloody rush.
You bastards.

141
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:11,597
I'll take you to the police station.

142
00:48:11,806 --> 00:48:14,517
What the hell's wrong with you.

143
00:49:12,908 --> 00:49:14,618
- What heat?
- Second.

144
00:49:15,286 --> 00:49:17,580
- Against who?
- Ishikawa.

145
00:49:19,498 --> 00:49:20,833
I'm in the third.

146
00:49:21,917 --> 00:49:23,169
With okada and nitta.

147
00:49:23,461 --> 00:49:24,544
Crap.

148
00:49:24,545 --> 00:49:25,546
That's tough.

149
00:49:48,402 --> 00:49:49,403
Paddle in.

150
00:49:49,945 --> 00:49:51,030
Don't ride.

151
00:49:56,952 --> 00:50:00,331
The first heat surfers are coming.

152
00:50:00,623 --> 00:50:02,665
Didn't they ride well?

153
00:50:02,666 --> 00:50:04,752
They're coming back.

154
00:50:05,419 --> 00:50:08,589
The results will be announced later.

155
00:50:30,069 --> 00:50:31,445
Uh! Almost.

156
00:50:32,530 --> 00:50:34,323
He did it again!

157
00:50:37,409 --> 00:50:41,747
I should at least
get to the semi-final.

158
00:50:44,083 --> 00:50:45,084
Clumsy.

159
00:50:45,543 --> 00:50:48,671
You can see
who the good surfers are.

160
00:50:54,385 --> 00:50:56,553
Nine minutes gone.

161
00:50:56,554 --> 00:50:58,430
Three minutes to go.

162
00:50:58,681 --> 00:51:00,516
Here's the yellow flag!

163
00:51:08,107 --> 00:51:09,984
- How was it?
- No good.

164
00:51:10,150 --> 00:51:11,359
Why's that?

165
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:14,363
The waves weren't good at all.

166
00:51:14,655 --> 00:51:17,700
The white surfer was much better.

167
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:20,160
I wish I was more consistent.

168
00:51:20,578 --> 00:51:22,788
Bad riding from the start.

169
00:51:24,290 --> 00:51:25,749
You give up too soon.

170
00:51:27,376 --> 00:51:28,877
Hang in there.

171
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:32,256
That was all I could do.

172
00:51:39,346 --> 00:51:41,431
There's some time left.

173
00:51:41,432 --> 00:51:45,144
The surfers can ride again.
Here's the countdown.

174
00:51:57,156 --> 00:51:58,490
Time's up.

175
00:52:21,096 --> 00:52:24,600
- I'll be going.
- Good luck!

176
00:52:25,309 --> 00:52:26,769
Stay on board.

177
00:52:27,019 --> 00:52:28,937
I'm better than you.

178
00:52:29,605 --> 00:52:32,607
Who's talking? He means it!

179
00:52:32,608 --> 00:52:34,109
Prove it.

180
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:35,944
Good luck!

181
00:52:36,445 --> 00:52:37,445
You wait and see!

182
00:52:40,699 --> 00:52:43,077
Judge at pointa, stand by.

183
00:52:43,285 --> 00:52:44,328
Okay?

184
00:52:44,578 --> 00:52:46,372
Judge at point b?

185
00:52:46,830 --> 00:52:47,830
Okay?

186
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:50,918
Stand by for the next heat.

187
00:52:51,168 --> 00:52:54,963
Here we go!

188
00:53:03,722 --> 00:53:07,685
He's giving us
a real demonstration of how to ride!

189
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:09,853
Roller-coaster.

190
00:53:10,187 --> 00:53:12,690
He can really ride the white water.

191
00:53:16,944 --> 00:53:19,655
He's doing really great!

192
00:53:20,197 --> 00:53:21,365
You're first up.

193
00:53:22,700 --> 00:53:25,953
You're the best.

194
00:53:27,871 --> 00:53:31,458
Riding up the wave curve.
Kicking up spray.

195
00:53:31,959 --> 00:53:35,462
He's trimming to the inside.

196
00:53:35,838 --> 00:53:38,132
Now he sinks into the wave.

197
00:53:39,091 --> 00:53:40,718
I wish him success.

198
00:53:44,138 --> 00:53:46,181
Some fine surfers today!

199
00:53:46,348 --> 00:53:50,144
Look at how fast
the white surfer's going!

200
00:53:50,519 --> 00:53:54,064
Flip and then into a roller coaster.

201
00:53:55,149 --> 00:53:58,318
That was superb.
He's bound to get good marks.

202
00:54:09,037 --> 00:54:11,039
Hello.

203
00:54:11,915 --> 00:54:14,877
You're late.
The contest is over.

204
00:54:15,669 --> 00:54:17,880
- How was it?
- I came in second.

205
00:54:20,799 --> 00:54:24,052
Was he here? The deaf boy?

206
00:54:25,137 --> 00:54:26,180
Yes, but...

207
00:54:26,346 --> 00:54:28,974
He didn't hear his name called.

208
00:54:29,349 --> 00:54:30,809
He missed it.

209
00:54:31,018 --> 00:54:33,854
Why didn't you take care of him?

210
00:58:34,428 --> 00:58:39,141
Peel it for me.

211
00:58:57,534 --> 00:58:58,702
Thank you.

212
01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:19,134
Shigeru doesn't
come to work anymore.

213
01:01:26,433 --> 01:01:27,809
He's crazy about surfing.

214
01:01:29,352 --> 01:01:32,480
Tell him to come back.
It's his job.

215
01:01:34,399 --> 01:01:35,400
I'm sorry.

216
01:01:36,151 --> 01:01:37,360
Or he'll be fired.

217
01:02:27,994 --> 01:02:28,994
Lower your waist.

218
01:02:32,707 --> 01:02:34,960
Very good.

219
01:02:42,759 --> 01:02:43,759
Isn't she coming?

220
01:08:11,921 --> 01:08:12,921
What are you doing?

221
01:08:15,466 --> 01:08:19,304
Please stop it.
Really I said stop it!

222
01:08:19,470 --> 01:08:25,143
Shigeru!

223
01:08:37,530 --> 01:08:38,573
Idiot!

224
01:08:38,990 --> 01:08:40,783
Don't lose your job!

225
01:08:42,660 --> 01:08:43,786
Let's go.

226
01:08:45,079 --> 01:08:46,079
Come on!

227
01:10:44,532 --> 01:10:46,868
I bought the surfboard.

228
01:10:47,493 --> 01:10:50,121
Get real. Hey.Hey.

229
01:10:51,038 --> 01:10:52,038
Rock, paper, scissors.

230
01:10:52,290 --> 01:10:53,583
Let me wear it.

231
01:10:53,791 --> 01:10:55,418
No it's my turn.

232
01:10:56,169 --> 01:10:59,046
Only for a moment.

233
01:10:59,922 --> 01:11:01,424
You're selfish.

234
01:11:02,425 --> 01:11:04,218
Wait, wait, wait...

235
01:11:04,552 --> 01:11:07,013
Get real, I said.

236
01:11:07,305 --> 01:11:11,349
- I'm wearing it.
- I'm cold. Please let me wear it.

237
01:11:11,350 --> 01:11:12,560
Ouch... cramp.

238
01:11:23,029 --> 01:11:24,906
It's not comfortable.

239
01:11:25,114 --> 01:11:26,240
It's back to front.

240
01:11:26,449 --> 01:11:29,035
Never mind. See you.

241
01:11:34,832 --> 01:11:36,375
- Chief.
- Yes.

242
01:11:37,251 --> 01:11:40,713
Let shigeru take
a day off tomorrow.

243
01:11:41,714 --> 01:11:42,715
Why?

244
01:11:45,176 --> 01:11:47,470
There's a surfing contest.

245
01:11:48,888 --> 01:11:51,140
You'll have no assistant.

246
01:11:53,935 --> 01:11:54,935
Is it okay?

247
01:11:55,603 --> 01:11:57,063
I can do it alone.

248
01:11:58,856 --> 01:12:01,609
If it's okay with you...
Is it okay?

249
01:13:07,884 --> 01:13:09,927
Here he comes. He won last time.

250
01:13:11,012 --> 01:13:13,556
So he'll probably win again today.

251
01:13:13,764 --> 01:13:14,807
No problem I will win.

252
01:13:15,641 --> 01:13:16,934
All of you.

253
01:13:17,602 --> 01:13:18,811
You idiot.

254
01:13:19,395 --> 01:13:20,396
He's too good.

255
01:13:39,498 --> 01:13:41,083
I can't find my name.

256
01:13:41,918 --> 01:13:43,169
We didn't apply.

257
01:13:43,961 --> 01:13:45,838
Why are we here, then?

258
01:14:00,770 --> 01:14:05,274
We have
200 participants here today.

259
01:14:05,691 --> 01:14:07,860
So it'll be a fine contest.

260
01:14:08,277 --> 01:14:12,865
Let's hope there won't be
any accidents...

261
01:14:13,240 --> 01:14:16,577
And that everybody
enjoys themselves.

262
01:14:16,911 --> 01:14:18,454
Good luck to you all!

263
01:14:19,830 --> 01:14:21,415
Thank you very much.

264
01:14:22,541 --> 01:14:25,461
Now the president of the jury
will speak.

265
01:14:26,170 --> 01:14:30,716
President ito
will explain the rules.

266
01:14:30,883 --> 01:14:36,722
Good morning, everyone.
The weather conditions are not bad.

267
01:14:36,931 --> 01:14:40,935
But there might be
some problems with the wind.

268
01:14:41,602 --> 01:14:45,523
Nevertheless, I hope
you'll give us a good show.

269
01:14:45,815 --> 01:14:51,112
The judges are all
authorised judges.

270
01:14:51,487 --> 01:14:56,075
And we will be sticking to
NSA rules.

271
01:15:01,038 --> 01:15:05,668
Chikura surf classics '9i.
Second heat now beginning.

272
01:15:06,585 --> 01:15:07,962
Point a, ready?

273
01:15:08,337 --> 01:15:10,631
Point b, ready? Okay.

274
01:15:11,007 --> 01:15:13,592
Point c, ready? Okay.

275
01:15:24,520 --> 01:15:29,942
Pointa is for special class.
The experts compete here.

276
01:15:30,151 --> 01:15:33,487
Point b is for class a.

277
01:15:33,863 --> 01:15:37,324
And point c is for class b.

278
01:15:37,533 --> 01:15:43,247
Surfers at pointa
are the most impressive to watch.

279
01:15:43,581 --> 01:15:48,502
It's a real pleasure to have a
surfing contest in such fine weather.

280
01:15:49,378 --> 01:15:52,798
The waves are good, too.

281
01:15:53,090 --> 01:15:56,469
Everything is perfect for surfing!

282
01:15:57,511 --> 01:16:00,222
Can we apply now?

283
01:16:00,514 --> 01:16:01,932
Impossible.

284
01:16:08,981 --> 01:16:11,442
- How was it?
- Lousy.

285
01:16:11,609 --> 01:16:12,818
You were terrible.

286
01:16:13,277 --> 01:16:15,071
That bad?

287
01:16:15,279 --> 01:16:17,156
You weren't riding at all.

288
01:16:17,573 --> 01:16:19,492
I fell off. What a drag!

289
01:16:20,201 --> 01:16:21,786
Losen

290
01:16:22,870 --> 01:16:29,335
shigeru! It's your turn!

291
01:16:33,297 --> 01:16:34,548
You could've told him!

292
01:16:45,309 --> 01:16:47,186
He's good.

293
01:16:47,394 --> 01:16:53,317
- He is better than you.
- Thanks for pointing that out.

294
01:16:53,526 --> 01:16:56,278
He's really good...

295
01:16:56,904 --> 01:16:59,365
- But he's way better than me.
- Maybe you'll win.

296
01:16:59,740 --> 01:17:02,743
- I can.
- Don't talk rubbish.

297
01:17:19,593 --> 01:17:20,928
Shigeru.

298
01:17:22,138 --> 01:17:23,139
Shigeru.

299
01:17:23,931 --> 01:17:24,974
You did it!

300
01:17:28,811 --> 01:17:29,937
And us?

301
01:17:30,146 --> 01:17:32,148
You, too.

302
01:17:32,314 --> 01:17:33,858
Oh, of course.

303
01:17:35,151 --> 01:17:37,194
- Well done.
- And you.

304
01:17:40,197 --> 01:17:42,366
You failed.

305
01:17:46,453 --> 01:17:48,205
I'm way off.

306
01:17:57,298 --> 01:17:59,633
There are six judges.

307
01:17:59,925 --> 01:18:04,597
The head judge and two others
marked you down for obstruction.

308
01:18:04,847 --> 01:18:07,600
So you lost points.

309
01:18:07,975 --> 01:18:10,477
I was faster.

310
01:18:10,644 --> 01:18:13,897
You saw them on the water.

311
01:18:13,898 --> 01:18:16,775
We saw you from our base.

312
01:18:22,907 --> 01:18:25,242
Now, class b finals!

313
01:18:25,492 --> 01:18:28,579
Stand up
for your final performance!

314
01:18:29,955 --> 01:18:31,332
Ride hard!

315
01:18:31,624 --> 01:18:33,417
Judges, stand by.

316
01:18:33,709 --> 01:18:37,004
Class b final heat!

317
01:18:45,429 --> 01:18:51,352
Class b final heat!
Look at that superb roller-coaster.

318
01:18:51,894 --> 01:18:54,063
It's okay.

319
01:18:54,772 --> 01:18:58,859
Yellow tabard begins his run.

320
01:18:59,485 --> 01:19:03,864
His cut back is not good enough. If
he could only stay calm he'll score well.

321
01:19:04,615 --> 01:19:09,161
Let's see what
the next surfers can do!

322
01:19:09,787 --> 01:19:13,916
He succeed the blow.
Class b final heat.

323
01:19:16,252 --> 01:19:19,213
So now the green tabard turns.
Oh great.

324
01:19:20,047 --> 01:19:21,382
Keel down.

325
01:19:22,132 --> 01:19:27,972
I hope he succeeds with the last
roller coaster. What will be the result?

326
01:19:29,265 --> 01:19:32,643
They're not bad at all
for class b surfers!

327
01:19:33,894 --> 01:19:37,022
The waves keep coming.
Who's next?

328
01:19:37,898 --> 01:19:41,986
Now the red tabard comes from the rear.
Takes off down the wave.

329
01:19:42,653 --> 01:19:46,073
He performed well.

330
01:19:46,657 --> 01:19:48,617
Good riding red tabard.

331
01:19:49,451 --> 01:19:54,163
Again he goes for it.
He finishes on a roller coaster.

332
01:19:54,164 --> 01:19:55,749
I wish him success.

333
01:19:58,460 --> 01:20:02,256
Oh wow the green tabard
makes a break for it.

334
01:21:22,378 --> 01:21:23,378
Take off.

335
01:21:33,806 --> 01:21:35,224
Ok the last wave.

336
01:21:48,153 --> 01:21:49,153
Red take off.

337
01:22:49,006 --> 01:22:52,050
Next time, make sure we apply.

338
01:22:52,885 --> 01:22:54,553
I'll buy a surfboard, too.

339
01:23:13,947 --> 01:23:16,617
Contenders in the class b finals!

340
01:23:16,992 --> 01:23:18,368
A big hand for them!

341
01:23:18,702 --> 01:23:19,912
Congratulations!

342
01:23:20,871 --> 01:23:26,877
Next, class a finalists,
step up on the platform.

343
01:23:31,215 --> 01:23:36,803
Next, special class finalists,
step up on the platform.

344
01:23:37,721 --> 01:23:39,556
A big hand for them.

345
01:23:47,606 --> 01:23:50,192
Fourth, tatsuya matsumoto!

346
01:23:53,195 --> 01:23:57,741
Third, kaku sawai.

347
01:23:58,450 --> 01:23:59,743
A big hand!

348
01:24:01,703 --> 01:24:04,665
There's your trophy and souvenir.

349
01:24:07,834 --> 01:24:10,754
Two more. Who will be the winner?

350
01:24:11,171 --> 01:24:15,467
Second, toshimitsu kamijo!
A big hand for him.

351
01:24:17,844 --> 01:24:21,765
Take the trophy and souvenir.

352
01:24:22,808 --> 01:24:27,938
The special class winner
is kazuyuki chiba!

353
01:24:28,814 --> 01:24:31,024
A big hand for him!

354
01:24:32,818 --> 01:24:35,653
Four special class finalists!

355
01:24:35,654 --> 01:24:37,614
A big hand once again!

356
01:24:38,991 --> 01:24:40,033
Thank you.

357
01:24:50,085 --> 01:24:51,628
Say cheese!

358
01:30:25,879 --> 01:30:28,006
Eat up. Let's go.

359
01:37:20,418 --> 01:37:28,418
