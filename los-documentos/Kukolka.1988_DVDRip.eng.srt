1
00:00:22,615 --> 00:00:24,685
A LITTLE DOLL

2
00:02:19,398 --> 00:02:21,233
Go, faster, strive.

3
00:03:10,063 --> 00:03:12,217
Your children have
passed the preselection.

4
00:03:12,561 --> 00:03:14,843
They all have been taken in.

5
00:03:33,178 --> 00:03:34,430
Come here!

6
00:03:36,013 --> 00:03:39,441
Come here!
They think that they choose genius!

7
00:03:39,963 --> 00:03:41,464
They don't need us.

8
00:03:41,484 --> 00:03:43,308
It's we don't need them.

9
00:03:43,328 --> 00:03:45,264
Don't cry I said.

10
00:03:45,608 --> 00:03:46,993
Let's go.

11
00:03:51,812 --> 00:03:53,010
Tell me please

12
00:03:53,776 --> 00:03:56,340
how old were you when
you started to do gymnastics?

13
00:03:57,075 --> 00:03:58,245
Seven.

14
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:00,977
Was your group large?

15
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:08,055
Normal. I'm sure there were
15 persons at the beginning.

16
00:04:08,807 --> 00:04:09,979
How many of them left?

17
00:04:10,428 --> 00:04:13,168
Some of them were
weeded out in a year.

18
00:04:13,847 --> 00:04:18,129
And then... there were six
persons in the group I trained in.

19
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:20,027
There were six of us.

20
00:04:21,205 --> 00:04:23,161
And all of them became sportsmen?

21
00:04:25,665 --> 00:04:27,054
No.

22
00:04:30,063 --> 00:04:34,854
It was only me who got into
USSR team from this group. Only one.

23
00:05:47,791 --> 00:05:49,972
The coach worked with
you individually, didn't he?

24
00:05:50,602 --> 00:05:54,042
When they called for meetings
he would take only me.

25
00:05:55,088 --> 00:05:57,973
Other girls stayed
here with another coach.

26
00:05:57,993 --> 00:05:59,329
Do these meetings occur often?

27
00:06:01,434 --> 00:06:02,858
It depends on how they call us.

28
00:06:02,878 --> 00:06:04,995
Well, how many times
per year approximately?

29
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:07,430
I think five or six times per year.

30
00:06:08,641 --> 00:06:11,266
And what is the
duration of one meeting?

31
00:06:12,075 --> 00:06:13,362
One month.

32
00:06:14,855 --> 00:06:17,505
Tell me please how do you
spend the day on the meeting.

33
00:06:21,123 --> 00:06:24,740
Well you wake up at 8 o'clock
and then you do morning exercises.

34
00:06:27,002 --> 00:06:29,258
Then goes breakfast at 8:30.

35
00:06:30,144 --> 00:06:34,058
You have some rest after the breakfast
and then go training. Four apparatuses.

36
00:06:34,857 --> 00:06:37,963
Then goes dinner, one
hour and half for learning,

37
00:06:38,288 --> 00:06:40,165
naptime and second training.

38
00:06:41,043 --> 00:06:44,320
After evening's training you have
supper and then again... cross race.

39
00:06:45,665 --> 00:06:46,916
Then...

40
00:06:47,838 --> 00:06:51,266
we have free two-three
hours before going to sleep.

41
00:06:52,864 --> 00:06:54,958
How long each work-out lasts?

42
00:06:57,592 --> 00:07:00,726
The first work-out is
four hours long I think.

43
00:07:02,066 --> 00:07:03,539
The second one is three hours long.

44
00:08:27,644 --> 00:08:31,399
Tell me please... people who are
not in sports often ask

45
00:08:31,419 --> 00:08:34,218
why gymnasts have so little height?

46
00:08:34,238 --> 00:08:36,162
This is often being discussed.

47
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:39,309
I don't know what's being
said about gymnasts' height

48
00:08:39,863 --> 00:08:42,166
but first of all they
are not all small.

49
00:08:42,186 --> 00:08:45,152
There're very small gymnasts,
but there're medium height gymnasts.

50
00:08:45,675 --> 00:08:50,327
But the small gymnasts
are the specific selection

51
00:08:50,347 --> 00:08:51,724
that is being held by the gymnasium.

52
00:08:52,194 --> 00:08:54,335
Modern gymnastics is so complex

53
00:08:54,685 --> 00:08:57,660
and the requirements for
complex exercises are so high

54
00:08:58,023 --> 00:08:59,441
that we choose girls

55
00:08:59,461 --> 00:09:02,594
by knowing in advance about their
potential chances in the future.

56
00:09:10,242 --> 00:09:12,547
Put your hands a little higher...
and the belly too... Yes.

57
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:15,956
Well done!
Good girl.

58
00:09:17,035 --> 00:09:19,167
- What's your name dolly?
- Katya.

59
00:09:19,766 --> 00:09:20,934
Katya...

60
00:09:23,056 --> 00:09:24,057
Oops-a-daisy!

61
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:26,075
How old are you?

62
00:09:27,597 --> 00:09:29,642
- Uh?
- Six.

63
00:09:29,866 --> 00:09:31,174
Six...

64
00:09:50,511 --> 00:09:52,504
Do you have time to read books?

65
00:09:55,232 --> 00:09:58,040
Yes, we can read
before going to sleep.

66
00:09:59,303 --> 00:10:01,452
Do you really have time
for it or just "can" read?

67
00:10:02,233 --> 00:10:03,315
I have time.

68
00:10:25,174 --> 00:10:26,518
Tell me how do you eat?

69
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:31,969
It's normal. The breakfast consists of
half a cup of coffee and sandwich.

70
00:10:33,123 --> 00:10:37,567
For the dinner we
have meat without garnish

71
00:10:40,029 --> 00:10:42,257
and something to drink
like fruit compote.

72
00:10:42,855 --> 00:10:46,042
And the supper usually consists of bread
and butter with tea or just a curds.

73
00:10:47,013 --> 00:10:48,892
It all depends on the weight.

74
00:10:49,174 --> 00:10:51,015
Is it easy to keep the weight?

75
00:10:55,469 --> 00:10:56,841
It's different from person to person.

76
00:10:56,861 --> 00:10:59,155
For example it's easy for me.

77
00:11:16,805 --> 00:11:19,081
- How old are you?
- Now?

78
00:11:19,101 --> 00:11:20,909
- Yes.
- Sixteen.

79
00:11:24,772 --> 00:11:27,347
Tell me please...
it's an awkward question...

80
00:11:27,367 --> 00:11:28,716
If you don't want to answer, don't

81
00:11:29,738 --> 00:11:34,180
The relationships are
being started at this age

82
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:38,723
the interest in friendship
with the boys is growing...

83
00:11:42,569 --> 00:11:44,840
I don't know.
I feel nothing.

84
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:46,552
Maybe I don't have time for it.

85
00:11:47,804 --> 00:11:49,318
And what about your friends?

86
00:11:50,163 --> 00:11:51,354
I don't know.

87
00:11:53,467 --> 00:11:56,033
Maybe somebody hides it but
for the most part I don't think

88
00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:00,423
that sombody takes interest in boys.

89
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:08,931
How long have you
been in the museum?

90
00:12:11,336 --> 00:12:14,335
Well, last year I went to Armouries.

91
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:19,748
In general we don't have time
for the museums or cinema.

92
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,705
Do you like cinema?

93
00:12:26,726 --> 00:12:28,255
I think normal about cinema.

94
00:12:31,135 --> 00:12:32,918
I will go to watch it if I invited.

95
00:12:33,854 --> 00:12:35,999
How long have you been to the cinema?

96
00:12:36,883 --> 00:12:38,493
Yes, it was long ago.

97
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:42,250
Which film remained in your memory?

98
00:12:43,108 --> 00:12:44,495
From the last ones...

99
00:12:44,784 --> 00:12:46,551
One flew over the cuckoo's nest.

100
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:50,061
I liked it very much.

101
00:12:52,993 --> 00:12:54,596
And any Russian movie?

102
00:12:59,203 --> 00:13:03,422
I don't know... maybe 'The diamond
Arm' and 'A cruel romance'.

103
00:13:07,459 --> 00:13:08,491
Thank you.

104
00:13:10,026 --> 00:13:11,251
You're welcome.

105
00:13:56,501 --> 00:13:59,873
THE DOLLY

106
00:13:59,893 --> 00:14:02,909
THE DOLLY
Two series

107
00:16:32,412 --> 00:16:34,914
Harder. You need to work harder.

108
00:16:35,406 --> 00:16:36,549
Go.

109
00:17:07,545 --> 00:17:08,648
What happened?

110
00:17:10,608 --> 00:17:12,191
The twinge in my back...

111
00:17:22,722 --> 00:17:23,736
Go have some rest.

112
00:17:30,116 --> 00:17:31,338
USSR

113
00:18:26,026 --> 00:18:28,128
Vadim Nikolaevich!
I feel pain in my back.

114
00:18:29,585 --> 00:18:32,503
- So what?
- It hurts me to jump.

115
00:18:33,633 --> 00:18:34,949
Your proposal?

116
00:18:36,032 --> 00:18:37,569
I won't be able to perform.

117
00:18:39,736 --> 00:18:42,547
So, my dear... It'a a
commercial competition.

118
00:18:43,218 --> 00:18:44,979
Our country's being
paid in currency for it

119
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:46,897
that is spent to buy clothes,

120
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:49,606
jogging shoes and apparatus
for your training.

121
00:18:49,626 --> 00:18:51,078
So you have to endure it.

122
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:53,350
- I won't!
- You will!

123
00:18:53,548 --> 00:18:56,254
Nobody asks you to win
but your name is on poster.

124
00:18:56,455 --> 00:18:57,455
So be so kind...

125
00:19:09,773 --> 00:19:12,327
Tanya! Please stop it!
I can't sleep.

126
00:19:12,528 --> 00:19:15,350
If I don't sleep enough
I won't be able to work tomorrow.

127
00:21:33,064 --> 00:21:34,961
Tatyana Serebryakova

128
00:24:08,706 --> 00:24:09,877
Don't move.

129
00:24:14,136 --> 00:24:16,108
Her spine is in bad condition.

130
00:24:17,061 --> 00:24:19,598
Any physical loads
are completely forbidden.

131
00:24:25,035 --> 00:24:27,595
Listen, it's the fourth case
in your practice.

132
00:24:28,263 --> 00:24:29,585
Among other things.

133
00:24:30,391 --> 00:24:31,625
Aren't you afraid?

134
00:24:32,955 --> 00:24:34,856
In our country
'Success is never blamed'.

135
00:24:36,837 --> 00:24:40,103
Listen, is there any way
to win in a different way?

136
00:24:41,076 --> 00:24:42,426
Do you want some tea?

137
00:24:44,857 --> 00:24:46,264
In a different way?!

138
00:24:46,968 --> 00:24:51,300
There's a way but it needs
the real science which doesn't exists.

139
00:24:51,761 --> 00:24:54,107
And the theory that
also doesn't exist.

140
00:24:55,388 --> 00:24:57,940
It needs money and apparatus.

141
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:02,331
It needs the food and not
the one sold in the shops.

142
00:25:02,351 --> 00:25:05,284
Come on, you are all clever
in other people's business.

143
00:25:07,231 --> 00:25:09,208
I understood that you don't want tea.

144
00:25:09,228 --> 00:25:13,548
Listen you, doctor! When you prescribe
a recipe what do you write out?

145
00:25:13,942 --> 00:25:16,968
Something that patient really needs or
something that's available in pharmacy?

146
00:25:17,197 --> 00:25:18,577
- Me?
- Yes.

147
00:25:18,887 --> 00:25:20,460
I don't prescribe anything at all.

148
00:25:21,989 --> 00:25:24,185
- I make X-ray photos.
- Exactly.

149
00:25:25,786 --> 00:25:28,535
You know, Elena Kulakova
has separated her husband.

150
00:25:28,555 --> 00:25:30,334
- Oh, come on.
- Really and trully!

151
00:25:30,854 --> 00:25:33,635
- How many years they were together?
- Probably 16 years.

152
00:25:33,655 --> 00:25:37,533
No, much more. Wait... They
got married in 1969...

153
00:25:40,373 --> 00:25:41,712
What did doctor say?

154
00:25:44,025 --> 00:25:45,528
What did the doctor say?

155
00:25:47,271 --> 00:25:49,473
Ah, nothing special.

156
00:25:50,298 --> 00:25:52,561
He said that you need a break.

157
00:25:52,874 --> 00:25:56,055
- What break?
- A little one.

158
00:25:56,855 --> 00:25:58,080
Why?

159
00:25:58,906 --> 00:26:02,399
Well you can have some
rest and visit your mom.

160
00:26:03,256 --> 00:26:04,716
You'll get enough sleep at last.

161
00:26:05,995 --> 00:26:07,375
You will study at school...

162
00:26:12,888 --> 00:26:15,462
Why are you so nervous?
It's not for the whole life.

163
00:26:16,037 --> 00:26:18,275
- You will go back in a year.
- In a year?

164
00:26:21,518 --> 00:26:23,771
In a year or in a six months.
We'll see.

165
00:26:24,353 --> 00:26:25,755
I will lose my physical form.

166
00:26:26,266 --> 00:26:27,501
Well...

167
00:26:29,213 --> 00:26:32,072
The physical form is the
thing that'll come with time.

168
00:26:32,414 --> 00:26:33,824
And what about Cup of USSR?

169
00:26:35,138 --> 00:26:37,508
This time Vinokurova will
go for the Cup of USSR.

170
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:40,359
- Who?
- Vinokurova.

171
00:26:40,858 --> 00:26:42,796
Vinokurova? Well, thanks.

172
00:26:43,251 --> 00:26:45,034
- So I'm no longer needed?
- Wait...

173
00:26:47,161 --> 00:26:48,426
Come here now!

174
00:26:51,028 --> 00:26:52,179
Come here!

175
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:55,325
Come here I said.

176
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,516
Idiot.

177
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,339
It's a present.

178
00:27:13,967 --> 00:27:15,009
Bye-bye!

179
00:27:35,806 --> 00:27:38,910
My dear! Take off your clothes.
Oh god, how I missed you!

180
00:27:38,930 --> 00:27:40,376
It's great that you came back!

181
00:27:40,396 --> 00:27:42,814
Oh god, your bags are so heavy.

182
00:27:43,032 --> 00:27:47,414
Forgive me for not meeting you but I
hardly obtained leave from my boss.

183
00:27:47,663 --> 00:27:48,964
No problem I got a cab.

184
00:27:50,546 --> 00:27:51,795
Where did you get this mirror?

185
00:27:53,201 --> 00:27:54,823
- What?
- Where's this mirror from?

186
00:27:57,629 --> 00:28:01,367
Well it's a present from a work.

187
00:28:17,305 --> 00:28:21,406
Why are you standing still Tanya?
Oh god I'm so glad of your arrival!

188
00:28:21,426 --> 00:28:23,079
I missed you so much!
Let's go.

189
00:28:23,428 --> 00:28:25,465
I arranged a special place for you.

190
00:28:25,655 --> 00:28:28,331
I've got a folding screen.
Look! It's beautiful.

191
00:28:28,742 --> 00:28:30,892
You can put it here
and screen off from me.

192
00:28:30,912 --> 00:28:32,161
It's your private space.

193
00:28:32,354 --> 00:28:35,348
- Will I sleep here?
- Yes. On grandmother's bed.

194
00:28:36,738 --> 00:28:39,543
Hey I dragged aunt Zina's table.

195
00:28:39,563 --> 00:28:42,971
Do you remember her? Her son Kolya
went to the army. It was his table.

196
00:28:42,991 --> 00:28:45,459
She said that she no longer
needed it. And I took it.

197
00:28:50,674 --> 00:28:53,008
Here's all your music.

198
00:28:53,028 --> 00:28:54,375
I haven't touched anything.

199
00:28:54,542 --> 00:28:58,003
Uncle Slava wanted to open it
and listen to it but I didn't allow.

200
00:28:58,023 --> 00:29:00,282
Was I right?
And here's the TV set.

201
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:02,340
Who is 'uncle' Slava?

202
00:29:07,586 --> 00:29:10,265
He's... from... my job.

203
00:29:11,754 --> 00:29:13,760
So Sergey Ivanovich never came?

204
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:15,122
Did he run away?

205
00:29:22,667 --> 00:29:23,984
How are you?

206
00:29:26,113 --> 00:29:29,383
Nothing in particular.

207
00:29:29,993 --> 00:29:32,717
Do you still work at
the cashier's office?

208
00:29:32,729 --> 00:29:34,674
No, I now work at the bakery.

209
00:29:35,149 --> 00:29:38,431
There are 4 offices, coffee room
where you can drink a cup of coffee.

210
00:29:38,451 --> 00:29:40,442
And no smell of the fish.
You see?

211
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,418
Do you often drink?

212
00:29:53,890 --> 00:29:57,412
Gosh! It was gathered
during the winter.

213
00:29:57,432 --> 00:29:59,049
And I have no time to deliver them.

214
00:30:05,268 --> 00:30:06,608
Don't you like it?

215
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:16,979
Here...
Some patties.

216
00:30:16,999 --> 00:30:19,216
I baked them myself.
They are grandma's favourites.

217
00:30:19,236 --> 00:30:20,334
Eat.

218
00:30:21,178 --> 00:30:22,178
I'm not allowed.

219
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:24,130
- Why?
- I will put on the weight.

220
00:30:24,739 --> 00:30:27,130
- So that's good.
- I need to keep my shape.

221
00:30:27,563 --> 00:30:29,257
Why?
Why now?

222
00:30:30,154 --> 00:30:32,323
So that the heart does not burst.

223
00:30:47,354 --> 00:30:49,314
Tanya. What's wrong with you?

224
00:30:49,334 --> 00:30:52,010
What's wrong with you, Tanya?
Don't think...

225
00:30:52,307 --> 00:30:54,571
Don't...
Don't care for...

226
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:57,697
Anything can happen in this life...

227
00:30:57,911 --> 00:31:00,568
You know... the life is long...

228
00:31:01,263 --> 00:31:02,927
long...

229
00:31:08,797 --> 00:31:11,173
What a beauty!

230
00:31:17,818 --> 00:31:18,993
England.

231
00:31:55,665 --> 00:31:57,012
Comrades!

232
00:31:57,487 --> 00:32:01,143
Many people say that I

233
00:32:01,601 --> 00:32:05,643
read the plates,
the plates.

234
00:32:06,075 --> 00:32:07,701
the plates,

235
00:32:07,721 --> 00:32:09,300
the plates.

236
00:32:09,478 --> 00:32:11,505
So what? I read correctly.

237
00:32:13,048 --> 00:32:16,379
Hey, you!
How about catching it hot?

238
00:32:17,977 --> 00:32:20,163
- What form is it?
- Ninth.

239
00:32:20,183 --> 00:32:22,513
- A or B?
- B.

240
00:33:27,773 --> 00:33:29,803
Go away or your teeth will fall out.

241
00:34:22,035 --> 00:34:25,213
Hey, sweethart, set free
the reserved seat.

242
00:34:25,233 --> 00:34:26,489
It's my seat.

243
00:34:27,605 --> 00:34:29,593
- Is it all yours.
- All is mine.

244
00:34:30,907 --> 00:34:33,140
Isn't that much for you?
D'you wanna jam on it?

245
00:34:34,537 --> 00:34:37,667
- Hey who is she?
- I don't know.

246
00:34:38,806 --> 00:34:39,958
- Freebie!
- What?

247
00:34:39,978 --> 00:34:41,290
Come here.

248
00:34:43,196 --> 00:34:45,342
- Well...
- Get out this silly from here!

249
00:34:46,198 --> 00:34:49,441
- Why?
- She stuck her ass and don't come off.

250
00:34:51,676 --> 00:34:53,215
Hey you! Scram!

251
00:34:53,529 --> 00:34:56,871
- Did the sheep stick in yo'r ear?
- Get your hooks off me!

252
00:34:56,891 --> 00:34:58,136
What?!

253
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:02,532
Let me go.
It hurts so much.

254
00:35:09,641 --> 00:35:11,253
OK, you live until break.

255
00:35:24,962 --> 00:35:26,553
I won't do it anymore.
I'm sorry!

256
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:43,357
Sit down.

257
00:35:44,150 --> 00:35:45,554
I'm here for a minute.

258
00:35:46,681 --> 00:35:49,999
Dear friends!
I have good news for you.

259
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:53,021
Ah! There you are!

260
00:35:54,082 --> 00:35:57,485
Let me present to you
Tatiana Serebryakova.

261
00:35:58,127 --> 00:36:00,057
Your new comrade,

262
00:36:01,074 --> 00:36:04,063
Master of Sport, International Class,

263
00:36:04,083 --> 00:36:07,410
ex-champion of the world in
rhythmic gymnastics.

264
00:36:07,430 --> 00:36:09,057
Quiet! Quiet!

265
00:36:09,077 --> 00:36:10,988
On behalf of the teacher's council,

266
00:36:12,335 --> 00:36:14,443
the directorate and myself

267
00:36:14,944 --> 00:36:20,372
I do hope that even in everyday life
you won't discredit you high rank.

268
00:36:21,442 --> 00:36:25,063
And I think that you, my dears,
will make friends with Tanya

269
00:36:25,461 --> 00:36:30,871
and will help her to become
a worthy part of your group.

270
00:36:30,891 --> 00:36:32,274
We shall.

271
00:36:32,294 --> 00:36:33,568
- That's good.
- I'm sorry...

272
00:36:34,546 --> 00:36:37,867
- Is Panov allowed to be late?
- He's allowed to do anything.

273
00:36:37,887 --> 00:36:39,754
- You can enter quietly.
- I'm sorry.

274
00:36:40,995 --> 00:36:42,229
That's all.

275
00:36:44,728 --> 00:36:46,750
Elena Mikhailovna, you can begin.

276
00:36:50,551 --> 00:36:53,017
I consider that the
official event is over.

277
00:36:53,982 --> 00:36:55,629
Good morning to all of you.

278
00:36:55,709 --> 00:36:56,709
Good morning.

279
00:36:56,729 --> 00:36:59,913
Did you hear? She's the world's champion.
And you told to throw her out of here.

280
00:37:00,487 --> 00:37:03,666
Come on, world's champion.
She's a lump!

281
00:37:36,415 --> 00:37:38,421
- Who's on duty?
- Me.

282
00:37:39,022 --> 00:37:40,570
Who's ill or absent?

283
00:37:40,590 --> 00:37:41,604
None.

284
00:37:41,902 --> 00:37:43,573
Who doesn't want to
go to the black board?

285
00:37:43,585 --> 00:37:44,146
Me.

286
00:37:44,831 --> 00:37:48,618
Pyatnov! It's a 4th
time you don't want it.

287
00:37:49,054 --> 00:37:50,345
You surely will be next.

288
00:37:50,365 --> 00:37:53,220
- It's not 4th but 3rd.
- Don't lie. I noted it down.

289
00:37:53,776 --> 00:37:56,199
So who want to go
to the blackboard.

290
00:38:00,566 --> 00:38:02,816
- Freebie?
- What?

291
00:38:03,245 --> 00:38:05,607
- Freebie?
- Yes, yes.

292
00:38:05,871 --> 00:38:07,009
Come on.

293
00:38:07,843 --> 00:38:12,263
Why me? You don't have right.
Have no right.

294
00:38:13,383 --> 00:38:14,828
For what?

295
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,818
The definition of derivative.

296
00:38:22,083 --> 00:38:23,951
The rule of calculation
of the derivation.

297
00:38:24,281 --> 00:38:25,749
Again me, yes?

298
00:38:29,569 --> 00:38:32,603
Lutikova? What do you have for a suit?

299
00:38:32,821 --> 00:38:35,929
- What? It's usual suit.
- Really?

300
00:38:36,185 --> 00:38:38,046
- Was it specially made for you?
- Why?

301
00:38:38,066 --> 00:38:40,604
It was bought in the
shop's 5th section.

302
00:38:42,165 --> 00:38:45,469
- It's an expremintal model.
- What? What model?

303
00:38:45,903 --> 00:38:47,626
Experimental.

304
00:38:49,811 --> 00:38:51,160
Well, sit down.

305
00:39:03,876 --> 00:39:07,412
My name is Elena Mikhailovna.
I'm your form-master.

306
00:39:08,764 --> 00:39:11,034
Our group is good and friendly.

307
00:39:11,672 --> 00:39:13,983
Get into the way and
get acquainted with it.

308
00:39:14,619 --> 00:39:16,125
I'm telling you a secret:

309
00:39:16,145 --> 00:39:20,724
our girls don't wear jeans at school.

310
00:39:22,877 --> 00:39:24,854
And what do your
girls wear at school?

311
00:39:24,874 --> 00:39:27,906
Our girls wear uniform suits,

312
00:39:28,546 --> 00:39:31,570
try to be more feminine
and tidy.

313
00:39:31,979 --> 00:39:34,302
Feminine?
In this militia's uniform?

314
00:39:36,428 --> 00:39:38,271
We I think we
understood each other.

315
00:39:49,772 --> 00:39:53,094
Elena Mikhailovna, maybe
I'd better repair a locker?

316
00:39:56,011 --> 00:39:58,678
Hey, wait.
Do you know where the next lesson is?

317
00:39:59,611 --> 00:40:00,935
Let me accompany you.

318
00:40:05,825 --> 00:40:07,294
My name is Lida.

319
00:40:09,238 --> 00:40:11,709
Listen, are you really a champion?

320
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:15,489
Why don't you answer?

321
00:40:15,794 --> 00:40:20,765
- What should I tell you about?
- You think you're so menacing?

322
00:40:20,785 --> 00:40:22,299
Here.

323
00:40:26,368 --> 00:40:29,158
- What a thirst for knowledge!
- Have a rest for 5 minutes.

324
00:40:29,178 --> 00:40:30,295
Lida!

325
00:40:42,169 --> 00:40:44,327
two ...three

326
00:40:47,269 --> 00:40:49,143
- Come here!
- I won't.

327
00:40:49,436 --> 00:40:51,488
I said come here or it'll get worse.

328
00:40:56,538 --> 00:40:57,836
It's for the mother.

329
00:40:57,856 --> 00:41:00,103
This is for the father
and this is from me.

330
00:41:00,123 --> 00:41:01,791
Wanna mess with me, billy-goat?

331
00:41:01,811 --> 00:41:03,987
Hey, Mr. Tall Guy! Is all your
strength went into your height?

332
00:41:04,007 --> 00:41:05,647
Or the blood can't reach the brain?

333
00:41:06,649 --> 00:41:08,905
Watch out, sportsgirl!
You can once get it...

334
00:41:09,742 --> 00:41:12,260
Didn't you understand?
Piss off...

335
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:13,980
while I'm in good mood.

336
00:41:26,294 --> 00:41:27,996
Get your hands
off me, little midge!

337
00:42:10,534 --> 00:42:12,224
Did anybody ask you?

338
00:42:12,244 --> 00:42:14,936
- This is Alex 'FiveFloors'.
- So what?

339
00:42:14,956 --> 00:42:17,331
He won't let us out
off school for this..

340
00:42:28,868 --> 00:42:30,796
- Can you run fast?
- Yeah.

341
00:42:30,816 --> 00:42:33,012
If you run to the right
they won't be able to get you.

342
00:42:33,394 --> 00:42:35,910
- Who are they?
- You see 'FiveFloors' with his buddies?

343
00:42:35,930 --> 00:42:38,213
They are from TVET.

344
00:42:40,707 --> 00:42:43,870
Damn, I wish I could
call Panov for help.

345
00:42:43,890 --> 00:42:46,583
- Why didn't you call him?
- He's forbidden to fight.

346
00:42:46,603 --> 00:42:49,714
- Why?
- He & his pals were stealing passers' caps

347
00:42:49,734 --> 00:42:51,799
and the got caught on stealing of tobacco.

348
00:42:52,403 --> 00:42:54,571
And Helen helped him
to get off the hook.

349
00:42:54,591 --> 00:42:55,793
How is it 'get off the hook'?

350
00:42:56,857 --> 00:42:58,720
She put up bail for him.

351
00:42:58,740 --> 00:43:00,103
OK. Let's go.

352
00:43:01,148 --> 00:43:03,267
- I won't...
- Don't cry!

353
00:43:03,287 --> 00:43:05,079
Are you gonna spend the night here?

354
00:43:51,267 --> 00:43:55,606
If anybody of you ever touch him again

355
00:43:55,626 --> 00:43:58,657
I will go to my sport-school
and bring my guys here.

356
00:43:58,677 --> 00:44:01,182
They'll drub you so hard... you alone!
Understand?

357
00:44:03,114 --> 00:44:04,339
Oh, come on!

358
00:44:04,898 --> 00:44:07,538
My deed is to warn you
and then think youself.

359
00:44:07,558 --> 00:44:09,516
Well how's your health Freebie?

360
00:44:23,850 --> 00:44:25,348
Wow!

361
00:44:25,980 --> 00:44:27,558
- Is it made of gold?
- Yes.

362
00:44:29,132 --> 00:44:32,308
- Pure gold?
- No, a gilted silver.

363
00:44:34,130 --> 00:44:35,536
Can I look closely?

364
00:44:35,556 --> 00:44:36,854
Try.

365
00:45:00,353 --> 00:45:02,005
Cool!

366
00:45:02,025 --> 00:45:04,908
- Where did you get it from?
- From there... from there...

367
00:45:04,928 --> 00:45:07,439
- And this one too?
- Yes, this one too.

368
00:45:09,456 --> 00:45:11,076
Have you been to the USA?

369
00:45:11,972 --> 00:45:16,757
No, but I was in Canada, Japan,
Romania and the UK.

370
00:45:18,219 --> 00:45:20,909
Do you have ordinary name by the way?

371
00:45:20,929 --> 00:45:22,985
Yes, Fedya.

372
00:45:23,957 --> 00:45:25,929
Sit on the sofa,
there's not need to crawl there.

373
00:45:27,151 --> 00:45:29,643
- Can I look at it?
- Help yourself.

374
00:45:41,026 --> 00:45:43,323
Did the nickname 'Freebie' was
given to you by FiveFloors?

375
00:45:43,343 --> 00:45:44,944
No, by Cherpakov.

376
00:45:44,964 --> 00:45:49,511
- The most clever one?
- Yeah, the local nerd.

377
00:45:50,907 --> 00:45:53,279
- Do you have any cassettes?
- Yes.

378
00:45:53,634 --> 00:45:55,979
- Could you let me listen to them?
- Next time.

379
00:45:56,353 --> 00:45:59,598
- Maria has one like this too.
- Where did she get it from?

380
00:45:59,618 --> 00:46:01,665
Her father brought it from abroad.

381
00:46:04,333 --> 00:46:05,461
Have you seen it?

382
00:46:05,481 --> 00:46:10,284
No, she invites only
several girls to her place.

383
00:46:15,378 --> 00:46:16,996
Hey Fedya, let me cut your hair?

384
00:46:17,016 --> 00:46:18,477
What?

385
00:46:18,497 --> 00:46:20,163
Let's make you look more solid.

386
00:46:20,869 --> 00:46:21,943
Well, no.

387
00:46:21,963 --> 00:46:24,535
Don't be afraid, I know how to do it.
You'll look like this.

388
00:46:24,555 --> 00:46:26,532
You were great when
you knocked him out.

389
00:46:27,754 --> 00:46:29,053
How did you do it?

390
00:46:31,461 --> 00:46:33,617
Our masseur showed me one point.

391
00:46:34,033 --> 00:46:35,320
Poke the finger there
and that's all.

392
00:46:35,340 --> 00:46:37,285
- Let me show you?
- No, no need for it.

393
00:46:37,305 --> 00:46:40,232
- So, let's go.
- Maybe it's better not?

394
00:46:40,252 --> 00:46:41,405
You ought to, Fedya, you ought too.
(citing Operatsiya 'Y' movie)

395
00:46:41,425 --> 00:46:43,653
OK, but don't put your hands on me.

396
00:46:48,304 --> 00:46:51,282
and she cut his head down to heels.

397
00:46:52,528 --> 00:46:54,319
Calm down, client.

398
00:47:46,601 --> 00:47:49,195
That's all. My mother will kill me.

399
00:47:50,126 --> 00:47:53,858
- She won't.
- Then I will be expelled from school.

400
00:47:57,114 --> 00:47:59,148
We'll see. Maybe they won't do it.

401
00:48:23,631 --> 00:48:25,398
Hey, don't touch me. Carefully!

402
00:48:25,418 --> 00:48:27,260
Why are you gripping my haircut?

403
00:48:27,659 --> 00:48:30,125
Did you wash your hands?
Stay away!

404
00:48:30,694 --> 00:48:31,972
What do you want?

405
00:48:31,992 --> 00:48:33,113
What?

406
00:48:33,850 --> 00:48:35,497
Hi...
It's OK. It's OK.

407
00:48:35,517 --> 00:48:37,051
Where are you crawling your hand?

408
00:48:58,697 --> 00:49:01,263
- Hello!
- Hello!!!

409
00:49:01,936 --> 00:49:03,004
Sit down.

410
00:49:04,551 --> 00:49:06,008
Who's on duty?

411
00:49:06,028 --> 00:49:07,137
Halikov.

412
00:49:08,813 --> 00:49:10,872
There're no ansent of ill persons.

413
00:49:13,109 --> 00:49:14,433
There're no 'whom'?

414
00:49:14,453 --> 00:49:16,003
Ill persons.

415
00:49:17,198 --> 00:49:19,722
- What's on your head?
- Hair.

416
00:49:21,658 --> 00:49:23,089
What is the rag for?

417
00:49:23,109 --> 00:49:24,820
It's not a rag but 'ring'.

418
00:49:24,840 --> 00:49:26,819
It helps to compact the knowledge.

419
00:49:29,384 --> 00:49:30,758
I understand.

420
00:49:35,198 --> 00:49:36,683
You've got into a mess nerd!

421
00:49:40,662 --> 00:49:42,894
- Did your father saw it?
- No.

422
00:49:42,914 --> 00:49:44,519
He's on a business trip.

423
00:49:45,190 --> 00:49:47,339
- When does he return?
- Tomorrow.

424
00:49:49,087 --> 00:49:50,227
OK.

425
00:49:51,489 --> 00:49:55,177
Elena Mikhailovna! Why can't he have
the haircut he likes?

426
00:49:55,197 --> 00:49:57,738
- Are you again in trousers?
- So what?

427
00:49:57,932 --> 00:50:00,075
I thought that we came to
an agreement upon it yesterday?

428
00:50:00,095 --> 00:50:02,275
I agreed with you upon nothing.

429
00:50:02,295 --> 00:50:04,779
You didn't explain me why
I can't go to school in trousers.

430
00:50:04,799 --> 00:50:06,277
She's right.
Why not?

431
00:50:07,863 --> 00:50:09,075
Silence!

432
00:50:09,361 --> 00:50:10,361
Silence!

433
00:50:10,892 --> 00:50:12,941
Silence!!!

434
00:50:13,527 --> 00:50:16,395
School is not a disco or debating-society!

435
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:30,070
I don't know why it's not allowed.

436
00:50:30,090 --> 00:50:31,953
But it's prohibited and that's all.

437
00:50:35,506 --> 00:50:37,382
And it's not a subject for discussion.

438
00:50:41,223 --> 00:50:43,286
Tanya will go home now

439
00:50:45,032 --> 00:50:46,458
and change her clothes.

440
00:50:46,777 --> 00:50:47,946
I won't.

441
00:50:47,966 --> 00:50:49,832
I'm not ordering you but begging.

442
00:50:51,089 --> 00:50:52,417
I won't go.

443
00:50:53,615 --> 00:50:55,021
Why?

444
00:50:56,275 --> 00:50:58,421
Because this uniform doesn't fit me.

445
00:51:12,963 --> 00:51:15,154
In this case I can't start the lesson.

446
00:51:19,928 --> 00:51:22,646
If my trousers hinder you
I can go away.

447
00:51:24,535 --> 00:51:25,934
Good-bye.

448
00:51:37,185 --> 00:51:40,576
Stop!
Stand on the spot!

449
00:51:41,678 --> 00:51:43,185
Turn around!

450
00:51:44,732 --> 00:51:46,833
Mark time, march!

451
00:51:48,522 --> 00:51:50,954
Platoon!
Go to the left! [inaudible]

452
00:51:56,642 --> 00:52:00,379
Platoon!
On the spot! Stop!

453
00:52:00,998 --> 00:52:02,570
To the right!

454
00:52:03,181 --> 00:52:05,444
Comrade Head of the
teaching department!

455
00:52:05,464 --> 00:52:09,406
The ninth form is making
elementary military training.

456
00:52:09,426 --> 00:52:12,236
The supervisor of training is Lubavkin.

457
00:52:12,256 --> 00:52:13,867
- Continue.
- Yes, ma'am.

458
00:52:13,887 --> 00:52:16,873
To the right!
March!

459
00:52:20,208 --> 00:52:21,805
Hello, Tanya!

460
00:52:21,825 --> 00:52:23,825
Why are you here?
Have you been late?

461
00:52:24,210 --> 00:52:26,545
Hello, Valentina Nikolaevna!
I was dismissed.

462
00:52:26,565 --> 00:52:29,247
- By whom?
- Elena Mikhailovna.

463
00:52:29,565 --> 00:52:30,729
Why?

464
00:52:30,749 --> 00:52:32,811
She says that it's forbidden
to wear trousers at school.

465
00:52:32,831 --> 00:52:35,045
But that's correct.

466
00:52:36,194 --> 00:52:37,753
You know, Valentina Nikolaevna,

467
00:52:37,773 --> 00:52:40,902
we gymnasts have particular
vestibular apparatus.

468
00:52:41,622 --> 00:52:45,324
In order not to get ill we
have to do this exercise every hour.

469
00:52:53,975 --> 00:52:55,885
My god!
You'll hurt yourself badly.

470
00:53:02,866 --> 00:53:06,008
You see? We have to do it
every hour during the year.

471
00:53:06,028 --> 00:53:07,907
How can I do it in a skirt?

472
00:53:09,016 --> 00:53:10,740
I understand.

473
00:53:12,341 --> 00:53:13,931
Understand.

474
00:53:14,682 --> 00:53:17,437
Elena Mikhailovna!
Just a second, sorry.

475
00:53:17,457 --> 00:53:19,436
Tanya go to your place.

476
00:53:19,456 --> 00:53:22,002
I know about it and
we have agreed on everything.

477
00:53:22,022 --> 00:53:23,180
So allow her...

478
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:26,334
Wait! I warned her yesterday
so today it's out of question.

479
00:53:26,354 --> 00:53:29,165
I'm aware of it and
we have agreed on everything.

480
00:53:29,185 --> 00:53:30,489
Go to your place.

481
00:53:33,317 --> 00:53:34,807
Good-bye.

482
00:53:35,284 --> 00:53:37,242
Sit down and continue your studies.

483
00:53:39,296 --> 00:53:43,122
By the way Elena, I wait
you in my office on a big break.

484
00:53:52,019 --> 00:53:55,263
Well...
Let's continue.

485
00:53:57,279 --> 00:53:58,469
Next time...

486
00:54:13,363 --> 00:54:15,642
Alexey do you know
what's the next lesson?

487
00:54:15,662 --> 00:54:16,755
I don't know.

488
00:54:18,987 --> 00:54:21,139
Would you like to listen to the music?
I have a player.

489
00:54:21,159 --> 00:54:22,851
I don't care about your player.

490
00:54:34,678 --> 00:54:36,064
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.

491
00:54:38,627 --> 00:54:40,065
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.

492
00:54:47,363 --> 00:54:49,868
[inaudible]
I don't know what to do... [maybe]

493
00:54:54,224 --> 00:54:56,102
- What do you want Serebryakova?
- Nothing.

494
00:54:57,632 --> 00:54:59,143
Oh! Oh!

495
00:54:59,163 --> 00:55:04,701
Your Serebryakova will soon
get out off her skin in order to show off.

496
00:55:04,721 --> 00:55:06,535
Oh come on Maria!
She's a normal girl.

497
00:55:06,555 --> 00:55:09,852
Shitikova you just envy her and that's all.

498
00:55:09,872 --> 00:55:11,691
Me? What?

499
00:55:11,711 --> 00:55:14,654
A champion! A title-holder!

500
00:55:14,674 --> 00:55:19,354
She's showing her off
because she's a big zero now.

501
00:55:19,675 --> 00:55:24,121
She was expelled from the
gymnastics and what's left?

502
00:55:24,141 --> 00:55:26,110
She's no feast for the eyes.

503
00:55:26,394 --> 00:55:29,901
With such face she should
always carry a gasmask

504
00:55:29,921 --> 00:55:31,970
in order not to scare people.

505
00:55:48,465 --> 00:55:50,064
Give me some fire.

506
00:55:51,014 --> 00:55:53,938
It's harmful to smoke by the way!

507
00:55:55,015 --> 00:55:56,553
You are also a boor!

508
00:56:08,506 --> 00:56:09,956
What do you want?

509
00:56:09,976 --> 00:56:11,324
What? Who's bearding here?

510
00:56:11,344 --> 00:56:13,216
They are provoking you Alexey!
You mustn't!

511
00:56:13,236 --> 00:56:15,716
Go away! Go away guys!
Go away!

512
00:56:15,990 --> 00:56:17,079
Calm down Alex!

513
00:56:18,159 --> 00:56:19,803
It's my business.
I will deal with it myself.

514
00:56:19,823 --> 00:56:21,069
Have a rest.

515
00:56:23,168 --> 00:56:24,492
Serebryakova!

516
00:56:24,512 --> 00:56:26,080
What's happening here?

517
00:56:27,500 --> 00:56:29,250
Tanya don't get offended

518
00:56:30,154 --> 00:56:32,793
but the jeans and the player...

519
00:56:33,411 --> 00:56:35,985
No, I have nothing against,
live as you like...

520
00:56:37,501 --> 00:56:40,329
but for you it's like

521
00:56:40,917 --> 00:56:43,156
a cause for standing out...

522
00:56:43,176 --> 00:56:44,304
Why?

523
00:56:44,690 --> 00:56:48,005
To my mind you has already
been stood out by life itself.

524
00:56:48,781 --> 00:56:50,299
Aren't you ashamed
for the eavesdropping?

525
00:56:50,836 --> 00:56:53,138
- No. Why?
- Piss of from here!

526
00:56:53,807 --> 00:56:55,300
Who are you?!

527
00:56:56,185 --> 00:56:58,105
Who are you to teach me?!

528
00:57:02,909 --> 00:57:04,515
Why are you addressing
on a first name basis?

529
00:57:04,623 --> 00:57:06,650
Why are you doing the same?

530
00:57:11,777 --> 00:57:15,121
Well... I'm elder...

531
00:57:15,912 --> 00:57:18,656
And it's my direct duty to teach you.

532
00:57:18,923 --> 00:57:20,466
So teach me.

533
00:57:23,362 --> 00:57:25,453
I want you to become humans.

534
00:57:26,153 --> 00:57:28,117
So I'm not a human yet?

535
00:57:29,116 --> 00:57:30,771
Who's a 'human'?
Shitikova?

536
00:57:31,150 --> 00:57:33,279
Shlepakov? Halikov?

537
00:57:33,867 --> 00:57:35,629
Or maybe Alex FiveFloors?

538
00:57:36,113 --> 00:57:38,708
For that matter I'm in my 16

539
00:57:38,728 --> 00:57:41,857
did such things,
received such things from life...

540
00:57:41,877 --> 00:57:44,687
which you Elena Mikhailovna
won't see until retirement!

541
00:57:45,225 --> 00:57:47,867
You'll sit in a secondary school
for average-minded.

542
00:57:48,307 --> 00:57:50,198
You think I don't understand
why are you so angry?

543
00:57:50,218 --> 00:57:52,048
I impede to rule the herd!

544
00:57:52,459 --> 00:57:54,027
Because I'm not average-minded!

545
00:57:54,047 --> 00:57:56,505
Not from the herd!
Of course it's easy with the herd!

546
00:57:56,525 --> 00:57:59,017
Everybody is in militia's uniform.
Everybody is equal.

547
00:57:59,208 --> 00:58:00,670
Anyone like everybody.

548
00:58:00,954 --> 00:58:03,513
But I've never been like
everybody and won't ever be.

549
00:58:04,105 --> 00:58:05,535
So that is.

550
00:58:05,555 --> 00:58:09,281
So Serebryakova, I see that
it's useless to speak with you.

551
00:58:10,246 --> 00:58:12,641
I... wanted to help you.

552
00:58:13,963 --> 00:58:18,400
I really pitied for you
from the bottom of my heart!

553
00:58:19,022 --> 00:58:20,289
But...

554
00:58:21,952 --> 00:58:23,952
Are you gonna to drag me
to the head-mistress?

555
00:58:25,382 --> 00:58:27,150
Or invite my mother to school?

556
00:58:27,757 --> 00:58:28,939
No.

557
00:58:32,472 --> 00:58:34,010
You know...

558
00:58:34,918 --> 00:58:38,427
you'll regret yourself soon.

559
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:40,506
- Good-bye.
- Let's go off here. [behind the door]

560
00:58:40,526 --> 00:58:42,093
Look you could regret yourself!

561
00:58:43,412 --> 00:58:46,159
Are you threatening me?

562
00:58:46,179 --> 00:58:47,496
I'm not threatening.

563
00:58:47,819 --> 00:58:49,720
You wanted to make
humans from them

564
00:58:49,740 --> 00:58:52,471
but there're no humans in the herd.
Don't you understand?

565
00:59:35,183 --> 00:59:37,731
Strict discipline!

566
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,462
It's the acid on the desks!

567
00:59:43,447 --> 00:59:45,777
Maximum attention!

568
00:59:45,797 --> 00:59:48,103
Stop talking!

569
00:59:48,457 --> 00:59:50,540
Panov! I'll dismiss you!

570
00:59:51,423 --> 00:59:53,558
It's not a joke!

571
00:59:53,578 --> 00:59:56,573
It's the A-C-I-D!

572
00:59:59,054 --> 01:00:04,177
Take measuring glass with
the acid in the right hand!

573
01:00:04,197 --> 01:00:06,396
In the right! In the right!!!

574
01:00:06,416 --> 01:00:10,279
And slowly bring it on elongated...

575
01:00:10,299 --> 01:00:12,270
On elongated hand!

576
01:00:12,715 --> 01:00:15,240
If you want I can pour everything
from this jar on your face.

577
01:00:15,260 --> 01:00:16,951
You'll become worse than me.

578
01:00:17,321 --> 01:00:20,321
I'll tell it was an accident and
you try to prove the opposite.

579
01:00:20,999 --> 01:00:22,517
Serebryakova!

580
01:00:22,537 --> 01:00:23,798
What are you talking about?!

581
01:00:27,037 --> 01:00:28,838
Nadezhda Semenovna, I have a question.

582
01:00:29,590 --> 01:00:32,026
For example there's a brainless doll,

583
01:00:32,046 --> 01:00:33,419
father's daughter,

584
01:00:33,866 --> 01:00:35,749
and she's very proud of her snoot.

585
01:00:36,148 --> 01:00:37,833
And the snoot is a temporary thing.

586
01:00:38,224 --> 01:00:40,505
And what will she do
if anything happens to her father?

587
01:00:40,997 --> 01:00:42,406
Are you out of your mind?!

588
01:00:42,928 --> 01:00:44,903
Put the measuring glass into place now!

589
01:00:44,923 --> 01:00:47,856
What are you thinking about
with the acid in your hands?!

590
01:00:48,498 --> 01:00:50,416
That's the point, it's the acid.

591
01:00:56,146 --> 01:01:00,881
Oh god! When can I finally retire
and rest from these criminals?!

592
01:02:09,886 --> 01:02:11,056
Tanya.

593
01:02:11,076 --> 01:02:12,798
Are you in love?

594
01:02:13,680 --> 01:02:15,064
Are you out of your mind?

595
01:02:31,240 --> 01:02:33,674
Nicolai, sorry, I always wanted to ask you.

596
01:02:34,020 --> 01:02:35,930
Why do you allow
everybody to copy from you?

597
01:02:35,942 --> 01:02:36,582
So why?

598
01:02:36,602 --> 01:02:38,689
Nothing. It's just the
time to stop spoiling them.

599
01:02:38,709 --> 01:02:42,055
You can allow Freebie as he has not
enough oil in the head. Maybe FiveFloors...

600
01:02:42,075 --> 01:02:43,212
But for the others - there's no point.

601
01:02:43,232 --> 01:02:46,015
They do nothing, fool around
and then succeed at your own.

602
01:02:49,746 --> 01:02:52,702
Stop working on them.
It's high time to start 'perestroika'.

603
01:02:52,722 --> 01:02:54,085
They will take offense.

604
01:02:54,580 --> 01:02:58,248
Don't worry! Tell them that I asked you.
All complaints - to me.

605
01:02:59,076 --> 01:03:01,356
- So what do you say?
- I'll think about it.

606
01:03:03,328 --> 01:03:06,418
By the way you're quick-witted.
Help me to look into this device.

607
01:03:10,541 --> 01:03:11,850
Wow, it's Japanese.

608
01:03:12,978 --> 01:03:14,585
Square root, logarithms...

609
01:03:14,605 --> 01:03:18,523
Here's manual in English and Japanese.
I don't know any of them.

610
01:03:18,892 --> 01:03:21,100
- Translate if you can.
- I'll try.

611
01:03:21,520 --> 01:03:23,150
Well, let's go or we'll be late.

612
01:03:23,605 --> 01:03:26,800
If you want you can keep it for youself.
I don't need it and you're clever.

613
01:03:26,846 --> 01:03:28,343
Thank you.

614
01:03:50,084 --> 01:03:51,598
There was little dicrepancy...

615
01:03:52,070 --> 01:03:53,728
My father returned from the voyage...

616
01:03:56,178 --> 01:03:59,550
Oh...
Shame on you!

617
01:04:07,494 --> 01:04:09,972
Freebie, are you gonna
change your haircut every day?

618
01:04:09,992 --> 01:04:12,254
Go away! Go away!
If not Elena...

619
01:04:12,274 --> 01:04:14,638
you would have such
haircut much earlier than me.

620
01:04:25,640 --> 01:04:28,590
Oh, a little discrepancy...

621
01:04:35,080 --> 01:04:37,463
- Thank you.
- For nothing.

622
01:04:46,518 --> 01:04:48,320
This girl, right?

623
01:05:31,217 --> 01:05:34,136
- Halikov.
- Me!

624
01:05:34,156 --> 01:05:36,113
Draw the curtains please.

625
01:05:36,133 --> 01:05:39,185
- Why?
- Do it! No questions.

626
01:05:39,635 --> 01:05:41,931
- It will be dark.
- You won't get lost.

627
01:05:44,043 --> 01:05:45,667
Well?

628
01:05:45,687 --> 01:05:48,305
Sorry, Elena Mikhailovna,
I lost my memory.

629
01:05:49,027 --> 01:05:52,103
I remembered the half of the theorem
and can't do anything about the rest.

630
01:05:52,123 --> 01:05:53,941
Your agony was so brief!

631
01:05:54,956 --> 01:05:57,537
Since we won't see each other tomorrow

632
01:05:58,608 --> 01:06:00,070
there's little information.

633
01:06:01,296 --> 01:06:05,095
As usual I invite all of you
to my Birthday party.

634
01:06:06,299 --> 01:06:08,112
The gathering will take
place at 7 o'clock.

635
01:06:08,945 --> 01:06:10,316
It's better not to be late.

636
01:06:10,336 --> 01:06:12,716
- Morning or evening?
- It's not a school we won't be late.

637
01:06:12,736 --> 01:06:14,957
I guarantee the tea
and traditional pie.

638
01:06:14,977 --> 01:06:17,794
I won't let in anyone with the present.

639
01:06:19,654 --> 01:06:21,399
Do you invite me too?

640
01:06:23,100 --> 01:06:24,403
Well... Why not?

641
01:06:25,668 --> 01:06:28,250
I would like to come
but there's one discrepancy.

642
01:06:28,270 --> 01:06:30,023
I have my Birthday tomorrow too.

643
01:06:30,043 --> 01:06:32,137
And I wanted to invite guys to my place.

644
01:06:32,157 --> 01:06:33,409
- Wow!
- I should say!

645
01:06:33,429 --> 01:06:36,514
No problem, no problem!
We will carouse!

646
01:06:38,924 --> 01:06:40,249
Maybe...

647
01:06:45,632 --> 01:06:48,116
Maybe you will invite
guys on another day?

648
01:06:49,260 --> 01:06:53,566
I would love to, Elena Mikhailovna,
but I can't.

649
01:06:53,865 --> 01:06:56,034
My mother is preparing patties
in the morning. I feel sorry for her.

650
01:06:57,643 --> 01:07:00,447
Well you can invite them at 5 o'clock.

651
01:07:00,467 --> 01:07:03,250
And I'll be waiting for them
by half past seven.

652
01:07:05,062 --> 01:07:07,946
- Is it OK for you?
- Yes.

653
01:07:11,919 --> 01:07:13,325
That's good.

654
01:07:18,375 --> 01:07:20,517
Alex do you think they
will all come tomorrow?

655
01:07:20,537 --> 01:07:21,848
You bet!

656
01:07:23,458 --> 01:07:24,773
And if not?

657
01:07:24,793 --> 01:07:27,779
Maybe Panov, Nechaev
and 2-3 goats won't come.

658
01:07:30,292 --> 01:07:33,534
Listen, what can we do
to make them come too?

659
01:07:33,960 --> 01:07:35,547
It's like shooting fish in a barrel.

660
01:07:39,911 --> 01:07:42,761
Nechaev!
Come here!

661
01:07:42,781 --> 01:07:45,430
- What do you want?
- How are you talking to me?

662
01:07:49,341 --> 01:07:51,398
- What time is it?
- 2:15 PM.

663
01:07:51,841 --> 01:07:53,139
So...

664
01:07:55,666 --> 01:07:57,538
- Show it to me.
- What are you... Alex.

665
01:08:00,711 --> 01:08:02,464
- Valuable thing.
- Yes, normal.

666
01:08:02,786 --> 01:08:03,908
Let me wear it?

667
01:08:03,928 --> 01:08:05,782
No, if mother finds out she will howl.

668
01:08:05,802 --> 01:08:08,690
I'll give it back to you tomorrow
when you come to Serebryakova.

669
01:08:08,710 --> 01:08:12,031
- Why?
- You wanna argue?

670
01:08:14,114 --> 01:08:16,521
We won't argue. Au revoir.

671
01:08:17,896 --> 01:08:19,009
That's all.

672
01:09:29,158 --> 01:09:31,909
Hello!
Did you iron your shirt?

673
01:09:33,035 --> 01:09:35,682
And a trousers too? Good boy.

674
01:09:37,096 --> 01:09:41,278
Don't slip on the staircase.
I guess you put on your new shoes.

675
01:09:41,551 --> 01:09:43,069
Yes.

676
01:09:46,718 --> 01:09:48,409
He hung up. Asshole.

677
01:09:57,433 --> 01:09:59,539
- Yes.
- How are you there? Are you ready?

678
01:09:59,559 --> 01:10:01,597
- Yes, mom.
- Is everything ok?

679
01:10:01,617 --> 01:10:02,617
Yes.

680
01:10:02,637 --> 01:10:06,326
OK. I'm free from work now.
If anything, I'll be at Lyuba's.

681
01:10:06,346 --> 01:10:07,701
- I'll be late.
- OK.

682
01:10:08,449 --> 01:10:11,590
Don't make much noise and
finish your party until 23:00.

683
01:10:11,610 --> 01:10:12,673
OK.

684
01:10:13,455 --> 01:10:16,486
By the way I forgot to ask
what's the reason for the party?

685
01:10:17,632 --> 01:10:19,000
A Birthday.

686
01:10:19,626 --> 01:10:21,481
- Whose Birthday?
- Our grade's.

687
01:10:21,501 --> 01:10:24,323
You're inventive souls!
So long, kisses.

688
01:10:24,648 --> 01:10:26,044
Bye.

689
01:10:30,300 --> 01:10:33,586
Freebie-San has arrived!
Freebie-San has arrived!

690
01:10:33,915 --> 01:10:37,120
Freebie-San has arrived!
Freebie-San has arrived!

691
01:10:39,338 --> 01:10:42,311
Girls are dancing there!
Masha Shitikova is like...

692
01:10:45,496 --> 01:10:46,946
Masha...

693
01:12:00,968 --> 01:12:03,174
- How are they doing?
- They're having fun.

694
01:12:06,205 --> 01:12:07,490
What time is it?

695
01:12:12,644 --> 01:12:15,572
19:00? It's OK.

696
01:12:24,608 --> 01:12:26,257
That's all.
It's time to go to Helena.

697
01:12:26,277 --> 01:12:28,417
- No!
- Why?

698
01:12:29,549 --> 01:12:31,510
Let's watch a little more
to see how it ends.

699
01:12:31,530 --> 01:12:33,167
It's embarrassing!
Helena is waiting for us.

700
01:12:33,187 --> 01:12:36,079
What for? Boring conversations
and apple cake? Turn it on.

701
01:12:36,099 --> 01:12:38,584
- How much time is left?
- Forty minutes.

702
01:12:38,819 --> 01:12:42,988
Only 40 minutes? Let's call Helena
and tell that we're late. Turn it on.

703
01:12:43,817 --> 01:12:45,094
It's embarrassing to call.

704
01:12:46,210 --> 01:12:48,718
It's better me and Shurik
to go and tell her. It's not far.

705
01:12:48,738 --> 01:12:51,987
- Yes, you're right.
- Do it.

706
01:12:54,340 --> 01:12:55,742
Hurray!

707
01:14:01,122 --> 01:14:04,782
Hi!
I invite you personally.

708
01:14:06,311 --> 01:14:09,909
- I won't go.
- And what if I ask you very nicely?

709
01:14:16,993 --> 01:14:19,748
Alexey, I understand you. Helena has
got you off the juvenile colony.

710
01:14:20,034 --> 01:14:22,602
So, are you gonna be her
gofer for the rest of your life?

711
01:14:28,808 --> 01:14:30,268
You're not going there.

712
01:14:32,020 --> 01:14:33,924
- Get your hoof out of my way!
- Try to punch me!

713
01:14:34,564 --> 01:14:36,206
Punch me or it's too much for you?

714
01:14:38,129 --> 01:14:39,322
Do it!

715
01:14:39,918 --> 01:14:41,165
Do it!

716
01:14:41,723 --> 01:14:43,745
Get out in the street now!
I need to talk to Panov.

717
01:14:45,285 --> 01:14:46,612
I have nothing to discuss with you.

718
01:14:53,518 --> 01:14:57,714
- Get out now! Hurry!
- As you wish...

719
01:15:15,901 --> 01:15:17,032
Let me through.

720
01:15:26,701 --> 01:15:28,047
Wait...

721
01:15:29,345 --> 01:15:32,056
Wait! I want to talk to you.

722
01:15:48,100 --> 01:15:50,140
Let me go, you fool!
I love you.

723
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:56,460
Say it again.

724
01:16:00,177 --> 01:16:01,472
I love you.

725
01:16:07,109 --> 01:16:08,589
So what?

726
01:16:23,252 --> 01:16:27,160
You're skunk! Cad! Anyway you'll
crawl to me on your knees!

727
01:16:29,771 --> 01:16:32,550
Alexey, I asked you not to bring presents.
Where did you get the money from?

728
01:16:32,570 --> 01:16:34,035
- I earned it.
- Where?

729
01:16:34,902 --> 01:16:37,654
- I unloaded the wagons.
- Thank you.

730
01:16:37,833 --> 01:16:38,998
My pleasure.

731
01:16:39,018 --> 01:16:40,983
Oh God, what a misfortune!

732
01:16:41,174 --> 01:16:44,051
The lights went out and I bake
the cakes with a flashlight.

733
01:16:44,859 --> 01:16:47,988
And eveything that could be
broken in this flat is broken now.

734
01:16:48,715 --> 01:16:51,669
The water tap is leaking, the lock
doesn't work, the window doesn't open.

735
01:16:51,689 --> 01:16:56,017
I'm tired of it all and I'd like to
marry an electrician or a plumber.

736
01:16:57,075 --> 01:16:58,736
- Don't marry an electrician.
- Why?

737
01:17:01,011 --> 01:17:03,067
- I can fix it.
- You really can?

738
01:17:04,061 --> 01:17:06,969
What's wrong with that?
Where do you keep the tools?

739
01:17:06,989 --> 01:17:08,167
One moment.

740
01:17:08,187 --> 01:17:10,000
Don't touch anything without me.

741
01:17:14,700 --> 01:17:15,880
Thank you.

742
01:17:16,561 --> 01:17:20,492
- Where are the guys?
- I think they won't come.

743
01:17:20,753 --> 01:17:21,902
Why?

744
01:17:23,609 --> 01:17:25,389
The're watching movies
at Serebryakova's flat.

745
01:17:27,269 --> 01:17:28,420
Really?

746
01:17:29,642 --> 01:17:32,430
- Strange...
- I can't see anything.

747
01:17:33,049 --> 01:17:34,205
Ah, I'm sorry.

748
01:17:37,791 --> 01:17:42,098
It seemed to me that
we are nice to each other.

749
01:17:43,058 --> 01:17:44,898
It's you who are nice to us.

750
01:17:46,042 --> 01:17:47,755
And transfer your feelings to us.

751
01:17:48,892 --> 01:17:51,195
A common mistake
of an intelligent person.

752
01:17:52,037 --> 01:17:54,748
- And what about guys..?
- They don't care.

753
01:17:54,768 --> 01:17:57,299
- All of them?
- All of them.

754
01:17:58,504 --> 01:18:00,881
You are certain type of person,
we're absolutely different persons.

755
01:18:01,185 --> 01:18:03,791
Frankly there can't be
any friendship between us.

756
01:18:05,689 --> 01:18:07,615
We have a barrier
even with the parents.

757
01:18:13,399 --> 01:18:16,441
But... Why did you come?

758
01:18:18,529 --> 01:18:19,667
I love you.

759
01:18:31,135 --> 01:18:32,467
What did you say?

760
01:18:35,908 --> 01:18:37,117
I love you.

761
01:18:41,768 --> 01:18:42,913
Well...

762
01:18:43,449 --> 01:18:45,456
Panov... how so..?

763
01:18:48,144 --> 01:18:49,944
It's strange, isn't it?

764
01:18:51,302 --> 01:18:54,118
- And there's no light.
- There's light.

765
01:19:11,333 --> 01:19:12,806
Frankly I...

766
01:19:16,344 --> 01:19:17,918
I don't know what to do.

767
01:19:20,225 --> 01:19:21,480
Me too.

768
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:25,650
What's that? Did you fight again?

769
01:19:42,446 --> 01:19:44,406
Get in the car, my friend!
I give you a drive.

770
01:19:46,653 --> 01:19:48,041
Well... How was it?

771
01:19:51,882 --> 01:19:52,894
Normally.

772
01:20:01,218 --> 01:20:03,657
'Tis a pity she lives on high floor.
It's impossible to peep.

773
01:20:03,956 --> 01:20:05,473
Where are her windows?

774
01:20:06,229 --> 01:20:08,967
There... Two on the
left of the third floor.

775
01:20:10,038 --> 01:20:11,744
Look, they switched off the light.

776
01:20:14,420 --> 01:20:16,662
- Nestro and me...
- Let's go.

777
01:20:17,729 --> 01:20:19,224
Oh, they switched it on again.

778
01:20:31,349 --> 01:20:34,448
Is it obligatory to tell the guys
that they switched on the light?

779
01:20:36,136 --> 01:20:37,963
Yes, I do.

780
01:24:52,444 --> 01:24:53,560
Hi.

781
01:24:53,580 --> 01:24:55,404
How are you?
Fine?

782
01:24:55,424 --> 01:24:58,924
Undress yourself.
Let go check your weight.

783
01:25:00,671 --> 01:25:03,934
Wow!
+500g in just one night!

784
01:25:03,954 --> 01:25:06,581
Are you out of your mind?
I can't see your ears 'cause of cheeks.

785
01:25:06,745 --> 01:25:08,117
OK. You're free to go.

786
01:25:12,442 --> 01:25:13,790
What does it mean "I'm sorry"?

787
01:25:15,178 --> 01:25:17,203
Oh well, let's do some acrobatics.

788
01:25:17,383 --> 01:25:19,426
Don't even dare to train badly.

789
01:25:19,744 --> 01:25:20,961
Somersault!

790
01:25:22,092 --> 01:25:23,564
Good! One more time.

791
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:25,195
On the rigid legs!

792
01:25:26,016 --> 01:25:27,146
Like this.

793
01:25:27,166 --> 01:25:29,712
Let's do it slowly.
Throwback.

794
01:25:32,593 --> 01:25:33,708
One.

795
01:25:35,441 --> 01:25:37,168
Stretch your toes!
Watch your knees.

796
01:25:37,796 --> 01:25:40,076
You don't do the splits.
I'll stop helping you.

797
01:25:42,139 --> 01:25:43,652
Bad.
Sit down.

798
01:25:47,158 --> 01:25:48,370
Well...

799
01:25:50,552 --> 01:25:51,827
Pull on the sock.

800
01:25:55,053 --> 01:25:56,107
That's it.

801
01:25:59,154 --> 01:26:00,664
Well, forget it.

802
01:26:01,881 --> 01:26:04,965
You won't have a supper today
and a breakfast tomorrow.

803
01:26:04,985 --> 01:26:06,221
Only half of the cup of tea.

804
01:26:06,556 --> 01:26:07,604
Did you got it?

805
01:26:07,624 --> 01:26:09,116
Come tomorrow by 10:00.
Ciao.

806
01:27:33,438 --> 01:27:34,626
Well...

807
01:27:36,073 --> 01:27:37,909
We know each othe for 4 years.

808
01:27:38,902 --> 01:27:42,535
Perhaps... you've changed
during this time.

809
01:27:42,555 --> 01:27:43,701
You grew up.

810
01:27:44,483 --> 01:27:46,700
Your interests have changed.
I understand.

811
01:27:50,733 --> 01:27:51,962
However...

812
01:27:53,062 --> 01:27:55,907
if people are invited
and they can't come...

813
01:27:59,440 --> 01:28:02,485
they tell about it.

814
01:28:03,138 --> 01:28:04,447
At least by phone.

815
01:28:06,475 --> 01:28:10,634
At least for the sake of not being
awaited and worried about.

816
01:28:12,788 --> 01:28:14,600
Did something happen to you?

817
01:28:17,525 --> 01:28:18,878
You didn't do that...

818
01:28:20,488 --> 01:28:22,781
And it seems to me... on purpose.

819
01:28:25,391 --> 01:28:27,532
Maybe I've also changed
during these 4 years.

820
01:28:29,213 --> 01:28:34,363
In any case I consider your yesterday's
absence as an act of distrust.

821
01:28:36,352 --> 01:28:38,761
Well then... you're adults and
you have right to choose.

822
01:28:40,155 --> 01:28:44,289
They talk a lot about democratization,
self-government and openness nowadays.

823
01:28:46,921 --> 01:28:50,292
I don't want any things
went unsaid between us.

824
01:28:51,987 --> 01:28:54,008
It's OK, you're adults...

825
01:28:56,729 --> 01:28:58,445
Maybe you need someone else.

826
01:28:58,465 --> 01:29:03,039
I'm ready to nominate my candidature for
voting if you need another form-master.

827
01:29:04,406 --> 01:29:07,903
I personally have nothing against it.
Evseeva, as Komsomol leader you start.

828
01:29:09,232 --> 01:29:10,468
What should I tell?

829
01:29:11,324 --> 01:29:15,450
Start voting if you want
me as your form-master.

830
01:29:16,371 --> 01:29:17,486
Let's do it frankly.

831
01:29:17,506 --> 01:29:19,363
Who's for me to stay?
And who's against it?

832
01:29:20,160 --> 01:29:21,348
Vote.

833
01:29:32,814 --> 01:29:34,099
So...

834
01:29:34,353 --> 01:29:39,859
Who's for Elena Mikhailovna
to stay our form-master?

835
01:29:39,879 --> 01:29:41,333
Raise your hands.

836
01:29:41,507 --> 01:29:42,969
Who's for?

837
01:30:17,023 --> 01:30:19,076
Elena Mikhailovna.
It's unanimously for you.

838
01:30:19,843 --> 01:30:20,995
Thank you.

839
01:30:33,407 --> 01:30:35,202
No lessons today.

840
01:30:37,717 --> 01:30:43,425
Ah yes... we planned to
visit the philharmonic society...

841
01:30:44,823 --> 01:30:46,075
Here are your tickets.

842
01:30:46,639 --> 01:30:47,719
Goodbye.

843
01:30:48,082 --> 01:30:49,809
- Hurra!
- Go back to your seat!

844
01:30:50,618 --> 01:30:52,830
- Why?
- Nothing. Go back to your seat!

845
01:30:56,919 --> 01:30:58,715
We are guilty before her.

846
01:30:59,183 --> 01:31:00,794
I think we have to apologize to her.

847
01:31:02,158 --> 01:31:05,796
I think that Panov will do
it better on behalf of the form.

848
01:31:06,545 --> 01:31:08,149
Those who agree... raise your hands.

849
01:33:22,654 --> 01:33:24,128
Hello, Alexander Mikhailovich.

850
01:33:24,148 --> 01:33:27,924
- Don't you recognize me?
- No... Remind me.

851
01:33:27,944 --> 01:33:30,450
We stayed in the same hotel in Tokyo.

852
01:33:30,470 --> 01:33:31,972
You were on tour and we
were on World's Championship

853
01:33:31,992 --> 01:33:33,657
- I'm Tatyana Serebryakova.
- Yes-yes, I remember.

854
01:33:33,677 --> 01:33:34,722
Where're you going now?

855
01:33:34,742 --> 01:33:36,391
- In the hotel.
- Great. You're going my way.

856
01:34:51,370 --> 01:34:52,798
Oh God! it's disgusting.

857
01:35:06,507 --> 01:35:07,766
Don't you understand the jokes?

858
01:35:08,284 --> 01:35:09,752
What do you want?

859
01:35:11,259 --> 01:35:13,720
- Let go of me.
- Try to hit me!

860
01:35:13,740 --> 01:35:15,148
- Can't you?
- Go away.

861
01:35:16,118 --> 01:35:17,715
He's coming to me.
Let him go.

862
01:35:17,735 --> 01:35:20,579
Are you crazy? Don't you know him?
He's a criminal.

863
01:35:21,076 --> 01:35:23,597
- Let him go.
- Well, it's up to you.

864
01:35:36,670 --> 01:35:40,051
Panov! Bednov!
Get back to your seats!

865
01:35:41,356 --> 01:35:44,125
We're done, Serebryakova!
Pack your valise.

866
01:36:25,207 --> 01:36:28,992
When I was as young as you...

867
01:36:32,641 --> 01:36:36,212
I fell in love for the
first time in my life.

868
01:36:41,610 --> 01:36:43,524
I fell in love with physics teacher.

869
01:36:46,153 --> 01:36:48,228
He was very young...

870
01:36:50,933 --> 01:36:54,970
talented and... handsome.

871
01:36:57,425 --> 01:37:00,692
When he talked to me...

872
01:37:04,795 --> 01:37:10,099
his eyes emited a warm light.

873
01:37:15,174 --> 01:37:17,789
Perhaps it happens to
all of us but I thought...

874
01:37:18,657 --> 01:37:20,119
that it happened only to me.

875
01:37:23,126 --> 01:37:24,895
When he aproached me...

876
01:37:27,415 --> 01:37:29,159
I felt happiness.

877
01:37:32,577 --> 01:37:36,388
I didn't think of anything on his
lessons. I only listened to his voice.

878
01:37:37,632 --> 01:37:39,710
And I felt dizzy.

879
01:37:41,549 --> 01:37:45,655
He had raucous and gentle voice.

880
01:37:47,683 --> 01:37:49,309
It seemed tender to me.

881
01:37:54,140 --> 01:37:55,894
One day on some meeting...

882
01:37:57,233 --> 01:37:59,909
he accidentally sat next to me,
shoulder to shoulder.

883
01:38:01,911 --> 01:38:03,320
And I...

884
01:38:09,477 --> 01:38:10,905
I felt like I'm blind.

885
01:38:13,330 --> 01:38:16,429
I felt very shameful.

886
01:38:17,911 --> 01:38:22,808
And I sat like numb
and was afraid to move.

887
01:38:29,337 --> 01:38:35,204
I always wanted to look at him.

888
01:38:38,519 --> 01:38:40,260
One day he got sick.

889
01:38:43,680 --> 01:38:46,460
And we had another
teacher the whole week.

890
01:38:47,674 --> 01:38:51,486
And then...
for the first time in my life...

891
01:38:55,834 --> 01:38:57,198
I...

892
01:39:00,911 --> 01:39:02,392
I understood that...

893
01:39:03,960 --> 01:39:05,548
because of the depression...

894
01:39:09,308 --> 01:39:11,257
One can die 'cause of the depression.

895
01:39:13,424 --> 01:39:16,818
These are not just words...

896
01:39:17,843 --> 01:39:19,304
this is really so.

897
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:26,603
Then he returned...

898
01:39:27,552 --> 01:39:30,178
and I wrote to him a letter.

899
01:39:30,198 --> 01:39:31,242
Well...

900
01:39:32,535 --> 01:39:35,899
A desperate letter.

901
01:39:39,162 --> 01:39:41,718
And in the three days I was
called to the headmaster's office.

902
01:39:43,911 --> 01:39:45,752
My letter was on his table.

903
01:39:47,141 --> 01:39:48,964
My parents were there.

904
01:39:51,358 --> 01:39:52,777
My mother cried.

905
01:40:00,506 --> 01:40:02,710
It was a long talk...

906
01:40:04,607 --> 01:40:07,707
with many wise phrases but...

907
01:40:08,804 --> 01:40:12,197
The smarter were the words

908
01:40:13,959 --> 01:40:15,602
the more pain I felt.

909
01:40:21,179 --> 01:40:23,586
Then physicist was transferred
to another class.

910
01:40:25,125 --> 01:40:26,767
to another class.

911
01:40:26,787 --> 01:40:31,209
And we almost never met.

912
01:40:31,944 --> 01:40:35,468
We rarely saw each
other in the corridors.

913
01:40:35,488 --> 01:40:39,492
And he greeted me in a very polite way.

914
01:40:42,134 --> 01:40:43,857
He was afraid of me for some reason.

915
01:40:46,053 --> 01:40:47,833
Of course it was an
incident for the school.

916
01:40:48,782 --> 01:40:51,575
But it was solved...

917
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:02,548
But I...

918
01:41:04,173 --> 01:41:05,579
I...

919
01:41:08,367 --> 01:41:12,388
It was like... something...

920
01:41:12,947 --> 01:41:16,315
like I lived throught...
or...

921
01:41:17,532 --> 01:41:22,405
something had to be...
born and...

922
01:41:25,748 --> 01:41:27,103
didn't born.

923
01:41:30,064 --> 01:41:32,114
Why am I telling about it?

924
01:41:37,620 --> 01:41:40,964
It's because I'm 27 years old and...

925
01:41:40,984 --> 01:41:43,408
I have never felt anything like this.

926
01:41:45,626 --> 01:41:48,213
I can openly tell this word "NEVER".

927
01:41:55,687 --> 01:41:59,756
It's like something
has broken in me and...

928
01:42:00,963 --> 01:42:02,404
that's all.

929
01:42:06,002 --> 01:42:08,254
How can I explain it...
In those times...

930
01:42:15,540 --> 01:42:19,651
In those times there was
some kind of recklessness and...

931
01:42:20,335 --> 01:42:23,446
There was happiness
in this recklessness.

932
01:42:25,944 --> 01:42:26,985
But...

933
01:42:27,876 --> 01:42:31,948
Then a lot of things happened...
I graduated, got married but...

934
01:42:34,854 --> 01:42:37,164
I divorced very soon because...

935
01:42:40,244 --> 01:42:42,662
everything that happened afterwards...

936
01:42:44,687 --> 01:42:47,994
was a kind of fake.

937
01:43:04,905 --> 01:43:07,683
It can happen to each of you.

938
01:43:12,078 --> 01:43:14,338
And then everything...
Everything...

939
01:43:16,427 --> 01:43:21,036
will depend on each of you.
On your words,

940
01:43:23,621 --> 01:43:27,508
your looks, your laughs...

941
01:43:34,472 --> 01:43:37,576
Be careful... because...

942
01:43:38,757 --> 01:43:42,929
it's very easy to ruin
someone's destiny.

943
01:43:44,906 --> 01:43:46,158
But...

944
01:43:47,686 --> 01:43:52,210
Everything is tied in this life.
If you ruin someone's destiny today,

945
01:43:52,230 --> 01:43:55,232
someone will ruin yours tomorrow.

946
01:43:55,937 --> 01:43:57,083
Because...

947
01:43:57,385 --> 01:44:02,413
you created this law yourself,

948
01:44:03,906 --> 01:44:06,796
which reads that one
can ruin anyone's destiny.

949
01:46:41,792 --> 01:46:43,646
Give me the player please.

950
01:46:46,099 --> 01:46:47,190
What?

951
01:46:47,210 --> 01:46:49,670
- Give me the player please!
- Why?

952
01:46:54,969 --> 01:46:56,861
I asked you not to bring it in school.

953
01:47:29,014 --> 01:47:30,235
You can have a break.

954
01:47:32,332 --> 01:47:36,303
What did you do there? What are
those elections of the form master?

955
01:47:37,439 --> 01:47:39,679
Do you understand what kind
of genie you are unleashing?

956
01:47:39,699 --> 01:47:40,831
I understand.

957
01:47:40,947 --> 01:47:44,082
Let the democracy be but
there had to be a limit.

958
01:47:44,265 --> 01:47:46,869
What kind of democracy is this without
coordination with the management.

959
01:47:46,889 --> 01:47:48,926
- Ordinary democracy.
- You could consult us.

960
01:47:48,946 --> 01:47:50,083
I didn't have time.

961
01:47:50,103 --> 01:47:53,071
I felt that I have to do something
but didn't know what specifically.

962
01:47:53,091 --> 01:47:56,023
- I felt it in a very last moment.
- She felt!

963
01:47:56,266 --> 01:47:59,799
And what if you feel that you have
to blow up the school tomorrow?

964
01:48:00,788 --> 01:48:04,716
If I feel it I'll blow it up.

965
01:48:04,736 --> 01:48:06,906
- Georgiy Matveevich!
- Oh, come on.

966
01:48:07,505 --> 01:48:09,891
It's a joke. You don't need to shout.

967
01:48:11,720 --> 01:48:13,741
And after all where
can she get explosives?

968
01:48:14,949 --> 01:48:20,428
Elena Mikhailovna! We appreciate you
and consider as a promising teacher.

969
01:48:22,379 --> 01:48:23,751
But you should consult with us.

970
01:48:24,040 --> 01:48:26,283
- Let's consult.
- Is it an order?

971
01:48:26,938 --> 01:48:31,053
This is not an order, but a request
that should be fulfilled.

972
01:48:31,249 --> 01:48:36,013
And the last thing... You delayed your
reference on Serebryakova for three days.

973
01:48:36,597 --> 01:48:39,034
Because of this we still can't
present the list of delegates

974
01:48:39,526 --> 01:48:42,246
for the conference of the
Komsomol asset to city commitee.

975
01:48:43,960 --> 01:48:46,062
You are disrupting an
important event. Why?

976
01:48:46,082 --> 01:48:47,947
You know why.
I'm against it.

977
01:48:49,823 --> 01:48:51,495
- Do you have any facts?
- No, I don't.

978
01:48:51,515 --> 01:48:52,783
But I have.

979
01:48:53,505 --> 01:48:55,034
This girl is doing well at school.

980
01:48:55,448 --> 01:49:00,395
She took a patronage of the most
notorious hooligans on her own initiative.

981
01:49:00,415 --> 01:49:02,737
And among other things
they began to study better.

982
01:49:02,757 --> 01:49:05,508
In the meantime the overall
progress score of the class has dropped.

983
01:49:05,719 --> 01:49:07,845
- How can you explain it?
- I can't explain it.

984
01:49:09,598 --> 01:49:13,393
But I feel there's some
relationship between these facts.

985
01:49:13,618 --> 01:49:15,083
That's it.

986
01:49:17,306 --> 01:49:18,623
Elena Mikhailovna!

987
01:49:20,112 --> 01:49:21,907
The country entrusted Serebryakova to us.

988
01:49:22,693 --> 01:49:24,644
Let's justify this confidence.

989
01:49:25,969 --> 01:49:28,653
We don't need any mysticism here.

990
01:49:40,372 --> 01:49:41,878
Serebryakova, where's the player?

991
01:49:44,513 --> 01:49:46,610
You'd better to give it back.

992
01:49:47,200 --> 01:49:48,916
Why do you think that I took it?

993
01:49:48,936 --> 01:49:50,878
- Don't you have it?
- Ransack me.

994
01:50:00,154 --> 01:50:01,734
Who did take the player?

995
01:50:04,633 --> 01:50:07,624
Once again: who did take
the player from the table?

996
01:50:08,199 --> 01:50:10,046
There's one specialist.

997
01:50:12,032 --> 01:50:13,665
Master of pocket thefts.

998
01:50:13,685 --> 01:50:15,333
Bednov, get back to your seat!

999
01:50:15,636 --> 01:50:19,422
Why? You ransacked Serebryakova.
Why don't we do the same to Panov?

1000
01:50:21,026 --> 01:50:22,565
Hey, you! Show your paper-case!

1001
01:50:23,493 --> 01:50:26,167
Try to take and look!

1002
01:50:27,404 --> 01:50:28,634
Go have some rest.

1003
01:50:33,773 --> 01:50:35,405
Stop it!

1004
01:50:42,521 --> 01:50:43,701
It's not there.

1005
01:50:44,103 --> 01:50:47,481
It happens. Don't worry, Helena
Mikhailovna, everything will be allright.

1006
01:50:48,215 --> 01:50:50,308
I want everybody to
check your paper-cases.

1007
01:50:50,809 --> 01:50:52,992
I want player on the table in 2 minutes!

1008
01:51:12,092 --> 01:51:13,265
Voila!

1009
01:51:16,329 --> 01:51:17,873
- Who's on duty?
- Me.

1010
01:51:19,238 --> 01:51:20,356
Come here.

1011
01:51:25,516 --> 01:51:26,714
- What's this?
- Where?

1012
01:51:26,734 --> 01:51:28,150
In the recycle bin.

1013
01:51:43,386 --> 01:51:45,029
Put it on the table.

1014
01:51:54,273 --> 01:51:55,700
Who did this?

1015
01:51:58,072 --> 01:51:59,657
Who did this?

1016
01:52:15,732 --> 01:52:17,378
- Freebie!
- What?

1017
01:52:18,280 --> 01:52:21,462
You always know everything!
Come on, speak up!

1018
01:52:21,482 --> 01:52:23,845
What? I know nothing,
I saw nothing.

1019
01:52:23,865 --> 01:52:25,378
You'll tell everything, bastard!

1020
01:52:25,761 --> 01:52:27,371
Alex, idiot!

1021
01:52:31,045 --> 01:52:32,236
Alexey!

1022
01:52:33,214 --> 01:52:34,743
Elena Mikhailovna, stay out of this!

1023
01:52:40,172 --> 01:52:41,936
I think it's time to call the militia.

1024
01:52:43,324 --> 01:52:44,577
Call them! Call them!

1025
01:52:44,597 --> 01:52:47,663
What are you thinking about?
I'm not going to be silent.

1026
01:52:48,591 --> 01:52:50,630
Or you think that Panov
can do everything?

1027
01:52:50,650 --> 01:52:54,595
Maybe he can do everything at
your place but it won't work here.

1028
01:52:56,851 --> 01:52:58,539
Alexey, don't do it...

1029
01:52:59,746 --> 01:53:01,987
You bastard, he can't fight back!

1030
01:54:40,106 --> 01:54:42,040
Who did this?
Who?!

1031
01:54:42,060 --> 01:54:43,893
Speak or I'll kill you!

1032
01:54:54,610 --> 01:54:56,518
Serebryakova...

1033
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:15,737
Alexey! Alexey, let him go!

1034
01:55:16,202 --> 01:55:17,430
Alexey!

1035
01:55:23,552 --> 01:55:25,088
What happened?

1036
01:55:27,370 --> 01:55:28,952
What happened?!

1037
01:55:42,609 --> 01:55:44,145
Nothing happened.

1038
01:55:57,018 --> 01:56:00,555
And now... repeat what you said!

1039
01:56:02,054 --> 01:56:03,813
Oh... Serebryakova...

1040
01:56:04,066 --> 01:56:08,084
Freebie! Say it louder!
So everyone could hear.

1041
01:56:08,538 --> 01:56:11,197
- Speak up!
- Serebryakova.

1042
01:56:46,200 --> 01:56:48,763
Well, what are you starring at?

1043
02:01:48,985 --> 02:01:50,356
Stay behind the door. Hurry!

1044
02:04:43,352 --> 02:04:46,313
Let me go.

1045
02:04:46,936 --> 02:04:48,485
- It hurts.
- What?

1046
02:04:59,218 --> 02:05:00,802
Oh my god!

1047
02:06:46,856 --> 02:06:48,750
