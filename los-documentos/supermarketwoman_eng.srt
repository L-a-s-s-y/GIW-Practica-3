3
00:00:16,391 --> 00:00:19,895
This film is about a supermarket.

4
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:26,109
By a supermarket, we mean the ordinary
run-of-the-mill kind in your neighborhood

5
00:00:26,193 --> 00:00:30,239
the one you go to for
everyday groceries.

6
00:00:30,364 --> 00:00:35,077
It does not include the 'Big Stores' that
sell everything

7
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:43,168
from food to clothes and electric
appliances.

8
00:00:45,254 --> 00:00:47,422
Get your groceries here!

9
00:00:47,548 --> 00:00:50,175
Bargains Galore

10
00:00:50,259 --> 00:00:52,386
opens today!

11
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:55,055
Rock-bottom prices!

12
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:03,897
Honest Gore

13
00:01:11,446 --> 00:01:12,072
Where's my brother?

14
00:01:12,155 --> 00:01:14,241
He's still at home.

15
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:32,342
Boss! Please wake up!

16
00:01:32,467 --> 00:01:37,347
Goro! Get up!

17
00:01:37,848 --> 00:01:39,016
Boss!

18
00:01:41,268 --> 00:01:45,480
What's the matter guys?

19
00:01:45,564 --> 00:01:46,732
What's the matter?

20
00:01:46,857 --> 00:01:48,984
The grand opening of

21
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:51,278
Bargains Galore, that's what!

22
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:54,156
I'll go over and take a look.

23
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:56,825
Discounts you wouldn't believe.

24
00:01:57,242 --> 00:01:59,328
They could crush us.

25
00:01:59,411 --> 00:02:03,248
If it's gonna shut down, it'll shut down.

26
00:02:05,709 --> 00:02:07,753
Hell of a time to be drinking!

27
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:14,593
Get going, for God's sake.

28
00:02:14,718 --> 00:02:17,846
This is a matter of life and death.

29
00:02:19,348 --> 00:02:21,642
Bread 30% off.

30
00:02:22,017 --> 00:02:24,311
Eggs, 58 yen.

31
00:02:24,895 --> 00:02:25,896
These are a bargain!

32
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:27,397
Boss, look.

33
00:02:28,065 --> 00:02:32,569
What! Everything in the freezer case,
50% off!

34
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:34,071
And, over there.

35
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:37,157
For every purchase over 3000 yen,

36
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:40,869
a free bottle of mineral water!

37
00:02:41,245 --> 00:02:43,413
What'll we do?

38
00:02:43,497 --> 00:02:47,709
I guess we'll have to wait and see.

39
00:02:47,793 --> 00:02:49,461
You mean we're not going
to do anything?

40
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:51,547
Nothing we can do about it.

41
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:54,299
Then, I guess I'll be heading back.

42
00:02:56,844 --> 00:02:59,972
'Jumbo-size ice cream, 188 yen.

43
00:03:00,097 --> 00:03:02,975
One per customer. Offer limited

44
00:03:03,058 --> 00:03:05,394
to the first 1000 customers'.

45
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:10,357
Sorry, we've just run out.

46
00:03:10,566 --> 00:03:11,483
Thank you.

47
00:03:11,483 --> 00:03:14,278
What? How come? What a scam!

48
00:03:14,403 --> 00:03:17,364
Sorry, but we're sold out.

49
00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:19,783
Thank you.

50
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:22,327
Says here, 'The first 1000 customers'!

51
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:24,037
Just a pack of lies.

52
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:26,039
Sorry, but we're sold out.

53
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:29,418
Thank you and please come again.

54
00:03:29,501 --> 00:03:31,003
The store just opened.

55
00:03:31,128 --> 00:03:33,964
How can you sell 1000 cartons
in one hour?

56
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:36,258
You're making fools of us?

57
00:03:36,967 --> 00:03:40,470
We have just sold our last one.

58
00:03:40,554 --> 00:03:44,141
Thank you.

59
00:03:46,894 --> 00:03:49,104
I don't believe this!

60
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:52,274
Oops, I'm sorry.

61
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:56,653
Goro? Is that you?

62
00:03:58,113 --> 00:04:01,658
Goro!

63
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:06,246
Wait a minute, you must be...

64
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:11,126
Yeah, me! Hanako!
Same class, sixth grade!

65
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:13,045
Hanako Inoue!

66
00:04:13,128 --> 00:04:15,172
Still alive and kicking. Hey?

67
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:21,053
You too, Goro... Remember that dance
we did at school?

68
00:04:21,136 --> 00:04:23,388
Sure do. You were the princess...

69
00:04:23,514 --> 00:04:24,765
And you were the raccoon.

70
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:42,115
I sent you a telegram on your wedding.

71
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:45,494
'Wish you every happiness.'

72
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:48,080
The cheapest message they've got.

73
00:04:48,163 --> 00:04:50,082
How's the marriage?

74
00:04:50,165 --> 00:04:51,166
My husband died.

75
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:53,794
What? So did my wife.

76
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:59,633
Wow... my sympathies.

77
00:04:59,758 --> 00:05:01,969
And my sympathies to you.

78
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:03,470
So you've come back.

79
00:05:03,595 --> 00:05:05,013
Uh-huh. I'm back.

80
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:07,850
Any kids? No.

81
00:05:07,933 --> 00:05:11,937
I've got one at college.
Studying about livestock.

82
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:14,273
College...

83
00:05:14,356 --> 00:05:16,400
No wonder we're getting old.

84
00:05:16,692 --> 00:05:19,820
Look at all the space up here.

85
00:05:19,945 --> 00:05:21,864
You could park a small car.

86
00:05:21,989 --> 00:05:24,867
Aw, shuddup. Look who's talking.

87
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:27,369
Brings back memories...

88
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:30,956
What are you doing here?

89
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:32,708
Investigating.

90
00:05:33,584 --> 00:05:36,044
So what do you think of this store?

91
00:05:39,882 --> 00:05:41,884
Oh... let me see.

92
00:05:41,925 --> 00:05:43,635
Great prices, huh?

93
00:05:44,052 --> 00:05:49,141
If they're selling something that costs
100 yen for 50 yen, that's a bargain.

94
00:05:49,266 --> 00:05:52,561
But it probably cost 30 yen
in the first place.

95
00:05:52,644 --> 00:05:54,396
Hey, you've got a point there.

96
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:56,231
Housewives know.

97
00:05:56,773 --> 00:05:59,193
Here. Take a look at this.

98
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:02,779
It says, 'Beef, 50%% off.'

99
00:06:03,947 --> 00:06:07,993
Now, take a good look, see?

100
00:06:08,994 --> 00:06:13,332
Hey, they've raised the original price.

101
00:06:13,457 --> 00:06:15,542
A Housewives know, okay?

102
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:18,128
Now, the lights they've got here.

103
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:20,964
They make everything look red.

104
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:32,476
Hanako, would you do me a favor?

105
00:06:32,601 --> 00:06:33,644
What?

106
00:06:34,061 --> 00:06:35,812
Let's go to one more store.

107
00:06:35,938 --> 00:06:36,939
Okay.

108
00:06:37,523 --> 00:06:39,483
Supermarket Honest Goro

109
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:44,363
How about this store?

110
00:06:44,488 --> 00:06:45,489
This store?

111
00:06:49,201 --> 00:06:52,246
This store stinks. Won't last much longer.

112
00:06:52,371 --> 00:06:53,080
What? How come?

113
00:06:53,205 --> 00:06:58,544
One in my neighborhood went out of
business. Looked just like this.

114
00:06:58,627 --> 00:06:59,878
Just like what?

115
00:07:00,003 --> 00:07:01,463
Just like this.

116
00:07:01,672 --> 00:07:04,049
What do you mean by 'just like this'?

117
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:06,134
Well, just like this.

118
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,595
See? Trash on the floor.

119
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,097
Trash? Where?

120
00:07:12,057 --> 00:07:15,018
Their uniforms are dirty.

121
00:07:15,602 --> 00:07:19,064
The labels should be facing the shopper...

122
00:07:20,232 --> 00:07:21,233
The meat's loosing color.

123
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:25,070
Pink juice oozing out...

124
00:07:26,321 --> 00:07:30,158
Whoa! A live fish-tank!

125
00:07:30,909 --> 00:07:32,578
What can they be thinking?

126
00:07:32,703 --> 00:07:35,122
What's wrong with that?

127
00:07:35,247 --> 00:07:39,877
I dunno. I've never seen anything
like this.

128
00:07:40,586 --> 00:07:46,425
That shopper over there. She's pulling
spinach out from the bottom.

129
00:07:46,508 --> 00:07:48,468
She does not trust this store.

130
00:07:49,136 --> 00:07:55,976
If the store we just left a while ago is
an example of a 'bad' supermarket,

131
00:07:56,059 --> 00:07:58,478
this one here is 'hopeless'.

132
00:07:59,438 --> 00:08:02,107
I'd just love to see who runs it.
Real stupid, I bet.

133
00:08:02,191 --> 00:08:04,151
This is my store.

134
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:07,404
Forget what I said.

135
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:08,989
Too late.

136
00:08:10,908 --> 00:08:16,496
The opening of 'Bargain Ga ore' must be
tough on you.

137
00:08:16,622 --> 00:08:18,248
Yeah, tell me about it.

138
00:08:18,332 --> 00:08:19,833
Take the fight to them.

139
00:08:19,917 --> 00:08:23,212
Uh-uh. It's no use doing anything now.

140
00:08:23,337 --> 00:08:28,884
Ah. You're hopeless... I would've fixed it
so no one shopped over there.

141
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:30,511
How would you do that?

142
00:08:30,636 --> 00:08:32,638
By filling everyone's fridges up.

143
00:08:32,763 --> 00:08:34,806
HOW?

144
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:38,227
Will you use your head for a minute?

145
00:08:38,352 --> 00:08:41,772
Before they opened, you should've had
a big sale.

146
00:08:41,897 --> 00:08:44,650
People would've bought everything.

147
00:08:44,816 --> 00:08:47,736
With full fridges, who's gonna buy more?

148
00:08:47,819 --> 00:08:49,613
You're smart.

149
00:08:49,738 --> 00:08:51,990
Housewives know.

150
00:08:52,908 --> 00:08:54,701
- Good luck.
- Leaving?

151
00:08:55,077 --> 00:08:57,329
You drive me crazy.

152
00:08:57,538 --> 00:09:00,123
Feel like teasing you like I used to.

153
00:09:00,249 --> 00:09:01,250
Wait.

154
00:09:01,792 --> 00:09:06,839
Don't let that scumbag Galore Get
the better of you, okay?

155
00:09:07,005 --> 00:09:15,013
THE SUPERMARKET WOMAN

156
00:09:15,013 --> 00:09:16,807
We pay attention to
the customers' needs.

157
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:20,811
We pay attention to
the customers' needs.

158
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:23,897
We strive to greet customers
with a smile.

159
00:09:23,981 --> 00:09:27,526
We strive to greet customers
with a smile.

160
00:09:27,651 --> 00:09:30,696
We strive to make profits.

161
00:09:30,821 --> 00:09:34,032
We strive to make profits.

162
00:09:34,157 --> 00:09:36,076
Let's go, go, go!

163
00:09:36,451 --> 00:09:38,328
Let's go, go, go!

164
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:45,961
Sir, your car is here.

165
00:09:57,389 --> 00:09:58,932
Mr. Mujina, sir.

166
00:10:01,852 --> 00:10:03,478
So, how are they?

167
00:10:03,604 --> 00:10:07,232
Probably worried about why you're here.

168
00:10:07,441 --> 00:10:09,735
Your sales figure yesterday?

169
00:10:09,902 --> 00:10:11,778
Just over a million yen.

170
00:10:15,657 --> 00:10:17,534
Oh, no, you shouldn't. Sir.

171
00:10:17,618 --> 00:10:21,663
Keep it. You always keep us
well informed.

172
00:10:42,643 --> 00:10:47,606
As you know,
my store has just reopened.

173
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:53,946
The problem is, we're only
a stone's throw from each other.

174
00:10:55,113 --> 00:10:58,450
I am all for avoiding needless rivalry.

175
00:10:58,659 --> 00:11:05,582
Let me get right to the point.
How about selling me your store?

176
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:07,501
Our store?

177
00:11:08,335 --> 00:11:11,505
Your store is a loser.

178
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:13,298
There's no future in it.

179
00:11:13,841 --> 00:11:16,343
Then, why do you want to buy it?

180
00:11:18,053 --> 00:11:22,933
I meant that there's no future as long
as you people run it.

181
00:11:23,016 --> 00:11:25,811
With me in charge,
the store will take off.

182
00:11:25,894 --> 00:11:29,648
Why don't you sell us your store?

183
00:11:29,731 --> 00:11:33,735
You stole all the workers and customers
away from our Dad.

184
00:11:33,861 --> 00:11:36,154
Got some nerve coming over here.

185
00:11:36,238 --> 00:11:39,032
Look, you're a babe in the woods.

186
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:42,327
You're not cut out for business.

187
00:11:42,536 --> 00:11:47,499
How much did you ring up yesterday?
A million yen?

188
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:50,169
You're hopeless, you know?

189
00:11:52,004 --> 00:11:53,338
Hopeless?

190
00:11:53,422 --> 00:11:57,342
Wanna fight? You're on!

191
00:11:59,303 --> 00:12:01,305
Well, I've said what I came to say.

192
00:12:01,388 --> 00:12:03,557
Don't be sorry later on.

193
00:12:05,851 --> 00:12:08,020
All right, let's sell!

194
00:12:08,103 --> 00:12:11,440
Absolutely not!

195
00:12:12,733 --> 00:12:14,193
Once we go bankrupt,

196
00:12:14,526 --> 00:12:16,987
They'll get it for a song.

197
00:12:17,529 --> 00:12:20,741
We haven't lost it yet.

198
00:12:20,866 --> 00:12:25,078
You're not cut out for business.
We a ways save your butt.

199
00:12:25,204 --> 00:12:27,664
Okay... please. A year then.

200
00:12:27,873 --> 00:12:29,541
Let me try one more year.

201
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:34,087
Face it. How much did you
bring in yesterday?

202
00:12:34,171 --> 00:12:37,925
A little over one million yen. But...

203
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:45,599
Other stores make four
or five times that.

204
00:12:45,766 --> 00:12:50,604
Please! I'll make Honest Goro the best
supermarket in Japan.

205
00:12:50,687 --> 00:12:57,277
Your head is always up in the clouds.
You've got to look at reality.

206
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:05,452
Just wait and see.

207
00:13:06,912 --> 00:13:11,625
I'll turn Honest Goro into the best
supermarket in Japan.

208
00:13:14,753 --> 00:13:18,507
Rock-bottom prices. Eh?
The son of a bitch.

209
00:13:33,856 --> 00:13:38,694
You're pathetic, you know, eating alone
at a place like this.

210
00:13:38,819 --> 00:13:41,238
It's for families and couples.

211
00:13:41,363 --> 00:13:42,906
So where's your girl?

212
00:13:45,367 --> 00:13:49,288
Here. You can eat alone and not be
damn conspicuous.

213
00:13:49,413 --> 00:13:51,248
You forget you're lonely.

214
00:13:51,373 --> 00:13:53,000
I know the feeling.

215
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:55,294
Those fast-food places...

216
00:13:55,377 --> 00:13:58,380
Year. They're really sad.

217
00:13:59,381 --> 00:14:00,549
You really know this stuff.

218
00:14:00,674 --> 00:14:02,885
I'm single, too.

219
00:14:03,135 --> 00:14:05,804
MY sympathies.

220
00:14:06,722 --> 00:14:07,890
Want a drink?

221
00:14:08,015 --> 00:14:09,016
Yeah.

222
00:14:11,226 --> 00:14:17,107
'Bargains Galore'Tried to buy
my store today.

223
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:21,028
Turned 'em down flat!

224
00:14:21,778 --> 00:14:28,035
Said I was going to make Honest Goro
the best in Japan.

225
00:14:33,207 --> 00:14:38,295
You know, I think I'm not cut out
for this business.

226
00:14:38,587 --> 00:14:41,548
I'm not having any fun.

227
00:14:42,049 --> 00:14:45,969
I think it's a great business.

228
00:14:46,094 --> 00:14:47,888
What's so great about it?

229
00:14:48,013 --> 00:14:50,599
It's fascinating...

230
00:14:50,724 --> 00:14:52,768
Fascinating?

231
00:14:52,893 --> 00:14:56,188
Let's say there is this housewife.

232
00:14:56,271 --> 00:14:58,232
She comes to the store.

233
00:14:58,857 --> 00:15:01,401
She has not yet decided what to buy.

234
00:15:01,985 --> 00:15:03,987
What is the first thing she does?

235
00:15:04,655 --> 00:15:07,950
She stocks up on the things she's out of.

236
00:15:08,075 --> 00:15:10,994
Potatoes, onions, tomatoes...

237
00:15:11,119 --> 00:15:14,957
That's why the vegetable section
comes first.

238
00:15:15,457 --> 00:15:17,251
Yeah? Is that right?

239
00:15:17,334 --> 00:15:21,088
Listen, this is important.

240
00:15:21,213 --> 00:15:26,927
While she is throwing the vegetables into
her shopping basket.

241
00:15:27,052 --> 00:15:29,638
She gradually gets excited.

242
00:15:29,763 --> 00:15:31,348
Like foreplay.

243
00:15:31,473 --> 00:15:35,936
She's nearing climax when she spots
that fresh snapper.

244
00:15:36,144 --> 00:15:41,650
She wonders, 'Should I make beef stew
or sukiyaki or bouillabaisse tonight? '

245
00:15:41,775 --> 00:15:43,735
Don't forget the garlic toast.

246
00:15:48,323 --> 00:15:51,493
Partial to one-pot meal plan, isn't she?

247
00:15:51,618 --> 00:15:54,580
C'mon, that's the ideal family dinner!

248
00:15:54,663 --> 00:15:59,168
The whole family around a steaming pot...
like a dream.

249
00:15:59,293 --> 00:16:00,294
Yeah... it's a dream.

250
00:16:00,419 --> 00:16:04,631
She's not just buying fish or meat
at a supermarket.

251
00:16:04,715 --> 00:16:08,969
Right. She's creating happiness
for her family.

252
00:16:09,261 --> 00:16:12,264
'Look at the dinner I made'.

253
00:16:12,347 --> 00:16:17,186
Delicious, and for so little.
A perfect family portrait.

254
00:16:18,437 --> 00:16:21,857
Hanako, I think you're lonely. Want me
to look after you tonight?

255
00:16:21,982 --> 00:16:28,030
Aw, be quiet! Your supermarket doesn't
excite the housewife.

256
00:16:28,363 --> 00:16:30,908
It doesn't talk to you like.

257
00:16:31,033 --> 00:16:35,162
'How about this to make
your family happy? '

258
00:16:35,537 --> 00:16:38,332
Come on, straighten up.

259
00:16:39,208 --> 00:16:41,168
Watch out.

260
00:16:42,294 --> 00:16:49,301
I'm gonna make us number-one!

261
00:16:59,937 --> 00:17:02,064
Here we are.

262
00:17:07,152 --> 00:17:08,153
Water!

263
00:17:11,615 --> 00:17:13,075
Here.

264
00:17:16,036 --> 00:17:17,621
Well, I'll be going now.

265
00:17:18,664 --> 00:17:22,167
Aw, don't go yet.

266
00:17:25,254 --> 00:17:26,421
Is that a 'butsu-Dan'?

267
00:17:28,298 --> 00:17:29,591
Uh-hum.

268
00:17:29,716 --> 00:17:33,136
Can I pray for your wife?

269
00:17:44,231 --> 00:17:45,607
What was her name?

270
00:17:45,691 --> 00:17:47,150
Chizuko.

271
00:17:54,533 --> 00:17:59,121
She looks like a nice person...

272
00:18:06,503 --> 00:18:08,505
Goro must have been a pain.

273
00:18:11,175 --> 00:18:14,720
Hey. Take your hands off!

274
00:18:15,053 --> 00:18:17,014
Let's excite the housewife.

275
00:18:17,139 --> 00:18:19,766
Idiot. Chizuko is watching.

276
00:18:19,933 --> 00:18:23,353
Men! Aren't they just awful, Chizuko?

277
00:18:23,437 --> 00:18:27,900
Let's go get some stuff and make
sukiyaki for us.

278
00:18:28,025 --> 00:18:31,695
With you? No thanks. I'm going home.

279
00:18:32,321 --> 00:18:34,239
Aw, stay a little longer.

280
00:18:34,364 --> 00:18:36,241
Get off, will ya?

281
00:18:36,366 --> 00:18:38,869
Then, destiny must wait...

282
00:18:38,994 --> 00:18:40,370
Idiot.

283
00:18:50,547 --> 00:18:52,633
Potatoes, yams

284
00:18:52,716 --> 00:18:55,511
70 yen...

285
00:18:55,636 --> 00:18:57,054
tomatoes, 6 for 100 yen...

286
00:18:57,179 --> 00:18:59,806
cabbage, 10 yen each...

287
00:19:14,321 --> 00:19:17,115
Hey, what are you doing?

288
00:19:17,241 --> 00:19:21,328
Oh, it's you. I'm doing a little
research for you.

289
00:19:21,411 --> 00:19:22,037
Research?

290
00:19:22,162 --> 00:19:23,956
Here, take a look.

291
00:19:24,081 --> 00:19:25,374
I'm looking.

292
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:30,254
See? Here's their weak point.

293
00:19:30,337 --> 00:19:32,339
Weak point? Where?

294
00:19:32,422 --> 00:19:35,717
They haven't finished stocking up.

295
00:19:35,843 --> 00:19:37,261
Okay. So?

296
00:19:37,928 --> 00:19:41,223
They are slow in the morning.

297
00:19:41,348 --> 00:19:43,517
SQ?

298
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:47,062
Are you really a manager?

299
00:19:47,521 --> 00:19:52,442
Why not have 'morning sales' and pull
their customers away?

300
00:19:53,068 --> 00:19:56,238
Ever heard of 'green receipts'?

301
00:19:56,363 --> 00:19:57,781
'Green receipts'?

302
00:19:57,906 --> 00:20:01,285
To show you get 3%% off in the mornings.

303
00:20:02,995 --> 00:20:03,996
What is it?

304
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:06,540
How the hell do you know so much?

305
00:20:06,623 --> 00:20:08,292
I like supermarkets.

306
00:20:08,417 --> 00:20:09,751
It'll be perfect.

307
00:20:10,627 --> 00:20:12,045
Come work for me, Hanako.

308
00:20:12,129 --> 00:20:13,422
In your store?

309
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:15,257
Naah! Why not?

310
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:16,925
You flirt too much.

311
00:20:17,843 --> 00:20:21,180
Well, I won't. I promise.

312
00:20:21,305 --> 00:20:23,891
Then... why me?
I want you near me.

313
00:20:23,974 --> 00:20:25,184
Aha! You're flirting again.

314
00:20:25,309 --> 00:20:31,148
No. It's that you make me wanna try
harder at my job.

315
00:20:31,523 --> 00:20:33,233
Welcome to our store.

316
00:20:36,486 --> 00:20:39,489
Welcome, everyone.

317
00:20:45,746 --> 00:20:48,665
Well, Honest Goro spying on us, hey?

318
00:20:51,585 --> 00:20:54,922
As you can see, business is booming.

319
00:20:55,172 --> 00:20:59,134
This is how pros run a store.
You guys are amateurs.

320
00:20:59,551 --> 00:21:01,845
Better sell fast.

321
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:05,390
Once I get your store,
nothing can stop me.

322
00:21:05,474 --> 00:21:07,392
None of that cut-throat competition.

323
00:21:07,726 --> 00:21:11,146
I can set prices as I please.

324
00:21:11,396 --> 00:21:13,649
Yup, it's gonna be perfect.

325
00:21:24,701 --> 00:21:28,038
You just going to stand there
and take that?

326
00:21:28,163 --> 00:21:29,164
But...

327
00:21:29,915 --> 00:21:31,166
Where's your pride?

328
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:32,960
It's just that...

329
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:36,588
When do I start?

330
00:21:37,798 --> 00:21:39,174
You're hiring me.

331
00:21:39,842 --> 00:21:41,343
You mean...

332
00:21:41,468 --> 00:21:45,639
I can't stand that old bastard.

333
00:21:45,764 --> 00:21:52,062
He's wiping out the competition so
he can mark prices as he wants.

334
00:21:52,229 --> 00:21:55,691
A housewife can't ignore something
Ike that. Fight him.

335
00:21:55,774 --> 00:21:57,568
But, have you ever worked?

336
00:21:57,651 --> 00:22:00,529
As a checkout girl. I'm top class.

337
00:22:00,821 --> 00:22:02,281
That's great.

338
00:22:03,574 --> 00:22:05,409
Well. Boss, let's get going.

339
00:22:10,455 --> 00:22:18,463
The goods are unloaded from
the trucks here.

340
00:22:19,339 --> 00:22:21,341
Then put on carriers,

341
00:22:21,466 --> 00:22:24,303
and enter the store through these doors.

342
00:22:31,977 --> 00:22:37,774
This is the 'back yard', the heart of
the supermarket.

343
00:22:38,150 --> 00:22:40,944
All the fresh produce is handled here.

344
00:22:51,121 --> 00:22:52,497
What's this?

345
00:22:52,623 --> 00:22:57,920
A trolley. Part of the assembly-line
operation.

346
00:22:58,086 --> 00:22:59,379
Assembly-line operation?

347
00:23:02,007 --> 00:23:04,051
I can't see it.

348
00:23:04,384 --> 00:23:09,848
Well... we have some highly skilled
workers, so...

349
00:23:09,973 --> 00:23:11,225
So, what?

350
00:23:11,934 --> 00:23:15,938
Well, they don't Ike conveyor systems.

351
00:23:16,855 --> 00:23:18,106
Ah... artists.

352
00:23:18,857 --> 00:23:23,487
So, that's how you wrap things.

353
00:23:23,570 --> 00:23:27,032
The goods are packed, weighed,

354
00:23:27,115 --> 00:23:29,326
priced, put on a trolley,

355
00:23:29,409 --> 00:23:32,162
and sent out to the store.

356
00:23:32,371 --> 00:23:37,000
That's why there are no windowsills.

357
00:23:37,167 --> 00:23:40,128
Hmm... makes sense.

358
00:23:43,173 --> 00:23:46,134
People, meet our new Chief
check-out lady.

359
00:23:46,218 --> 00:23:47,636
Hi, there!

360
00:23:47,928 --> 00:23:49,429
Hello.

361
00:23:49,555 --> 00:23:50,597
Back to work.

362
00:23:55,394 --> 00:23:57,938
Hang on, why throw them away?

363
00:23:58,063 --> 00:24:01,984
They're yesterday's leftovers.

364
00:24:02,067 --> 00:24:04,570
Don't waste them.

365
00:24:05,112 --> 00:24:07,531
Use them in our lunch packs.

366
00:24:07,614 --> 00:24:12,202
Fry it again, and sterilize it.

367
00:24:13,871 --> 00:24:15,539
No problem.

368
00:24:32,139 --> 00:24:33,599
Pork loins, 680 yen.

369
00:24:33,724 --> 00:24:35,517
Apple juice, 158 yen.

370
00:24:35,601 --> 00:24:36,977
Broccoli, 150 yen.

371
00:24:37,102 --> 00:24:39,563
Egg soup, 98 yen.

372
00:24:39,646 --> 00:24:42,608
It comes to 3,272 yen.

373
00:24:44,735 --> 00:24:46,528
From 5,000 yen,

374
00:24:49,239 --> 00:24:51,200
that's 1,728 yen change.

375
00:24:59,958 --> 00:25:02,419
Thank you.

376
00:25:02,669 --> 00:25:04,796
Have a nice day.

377
00:25:05,839 --> 00:25:09,426
Chief, this is a cabbage, isn't it?

378
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:11,637
No, that's a lettuce. A cabbage...

379
00:25:11,762 --> 00:25:12,971
This is a cabbage!

380
00:25:13,222 --> 00:25:14,723
What do you know?

381
00:25:14,848 --> 00:25:18,143
Kids today? The parents should be
horse-whipped.

382
00:25:18,227 --> 00:25:19,269
Yeah, you're right.

383
00:25:19,353 --> 00:25:22,689
2,462 yen. Please.

384
00:25:22,814 --> 00:25:24,024
2,400...

385
00:25:25,025 --> 00:25:26,235
Hold it a second.

386
00:25:29,238 --> 00:25:31,323
Can I put these back?

387
00:25:31,448 --> 00:25:32,866
Um... I'm not sure...

388
00:25:32,991 --> 00:25:37,162
They've already been rung up.
Sorry, Ma'am.

389
00:25:37,246 --> 00:25:39,206
Please leave them.

390
00:25:39,331 --> 00:25:41,333
I'll take care of it.

391
00:25:42,042 --> 00:25:45,671
That's 16 yen change.

392
00:25:45,754 --> 00:25:46,839
Thank you.

393
00:25:46,922 --> 00:25:50,050
I've set the food budget to
2000 yen a day.

394
00:25:50,175 --> 00:25:52,845
I understand.

395
00:25:52,928 --> 00:25:54,680
Please come again.

396
00:25:54,805 --> 00:25:56,932
Hey, you're way out of line.

397
00:25:57,057 --> 00:26:00,060
But the lady was happy, wasn't she?

398
00:26:00,185 --> 00:26:04,356
Never mind. Just do as you're told.

399
00:26:13,866 --> 00:26:17,035
Oh, no! What a mess!

400
00:26:17,119 --> 00:26:18,829
That's gonna be he I to clean up.

401
00:26:18,912 --> 00:26:23,584
You'll have to pay for this.

402
00:26:23,709 --> 00:26:26,170
Are you all right, Ma'am?

403
00:26:27,963 --> 00:26:31,550
Here, take this carton. Please.

404
00:26:32,384 --> 00:26:33,677
Why, thank you.

405
00:26:40,767 --> 00:26:43,854
You don't Ike any piggy's meat,
do you sweetie?

406
00:26:43,937 --> 00:26:46,565
Ooh, here's some moo-moo-meat.

407
00:26:46,648 --> 00:26:48,400
Sorry, ma'am, no pets allowed.

408
00:26:48,483 --> 00:26:50,903
Please tie it up outside.

409
00:26:51,028 --> 00:26:54,448
Why should I? My Meg is very quiet.

410
00:26:54,573 --> 00:26:57,284
Hey. She's a politician's woman...

411
00:26:57,409 --> 00:27:00,746
I'm very sorry,
we have sanitary regulations.

412
00:27:00,829 --> 00:27:05,167
Meg is not a pet. She's my baby.

413
00:27:10,797 --> 00:27:12,007
Get out of my way.

414
00:27:12,299 --> 00:27:14,551
I've got some shopping to do.

415
00:27:14,635 --> 00:27:16,345
Can't let you through.

416
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:19,806
If you want to shop here,
obey our rules.

417
00:27:19,932 --> 00:27:23,393
It's not fair to the other customers.

418
00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:30,067
How dare you talk to me like that?

419
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:31,860
Like hell I'm gonna shop here!

420
00:27:31,985 --> 00:27:35,906
It stinks!
Get your ass out of my way!

421
00:27:35,989 --> 00:27:39,034
What you've done? That woman is...

422
00:27:44,873 --> 00:27:47,125
You made a mistake here.

423
00:27:47,209 --> 00:27:51,088
The receipt says 980 yen.

424
00:27:51,171 --> 00:27:54,091
It should be 680 yen.

425
00:27:54,508 --> 00:27:57,928
The label here says 980 yen.

426
00:27:59,012 --> 00:28:02,349
Perhaps I can help.

427
00:28:02,516 --> 00:28:04,226
Okay, come with me.

428
00:28:14,695 --> 00:28:15,696
See?

429
00:28:16,697 --> 00:28:19,908
The special-off er sign is still on.

430
00:28:20,659 --> 00:28:23,078
You're absolutely right. Our mistake.

431
00:28:23,203 --> 00:28:25,831
We'll take care of it right away.

432
00:28:25,956 --> 00:28:28,458
Sorry about this.

433
00:28:31,545 --> 00:28:32,838
Is this the first time?

434
00:28:32,963 --> 00:28:34,965
No. Happens all the time.

435
00:28:35,048 --> 00:28:37,050
After special-offer sales.

436
00:28:37,134 --> 00:28:38,886
Did you tell the meat people?

437
00:28:39,011 --> 00:28:42,014
Oh, no. Why not?

438
00:28:42,139 --> 00:28:44,725
Those guys are really scary.

439
00:28:44,850 --> 00:28:46,476
Not if you go together.

440
00:29:02,326 --> 00:29:03,994
Um, excuse me.

441
00:29:17,591 --> 00:29:19,009
Excuse me.

442
00:29:19,218 --> 00:29:26,016
I think you forgot to change
the steak prices.

443
00:29:26,892 --> 00:29:30,437
Look, we've got our hands full here.

444
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:33,440
Hey, come on.

445
00:29:33,524 --> 00:29:35,609
We're the ones that get yelled at.

446
00:29:35,692 --> 00:29:37,277
Couldn't care less.

447
00:29:37,402 --> 00:29:42,950
People will buy meat at special prices.
Sales will drop.

448
00:29:43,033 --> 00:29:46,203
The manager won't like it.

449
00:29:47,037 --> 00:29:52,042
Okay, already... Hey, Gori!
Change the prices back.

450
00:29:52,167 --> 00:29:53,168
Thanks.

451
00:29:53,669 --> 00:29:55,170
I owe you one.

452
00:30:06,849 --> 00:30:08,308
Got a minute?

453
00:30:08,433 --> 00:30:10,644
Uh-huh. I'm busy.

454
00:30:11,562 --> 00:30:15,691
That's a fine chunk of meat.

455
00:30:16,358 --> 00:30:17,609
Japanese beef?

456
00:30:19,236 --> 00:30:21,947
Highest quality Kobe beef.

457
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:25,993
Don't see much of it at the checkout.
It's not selling.

458
00:30:28,537 --> 00:30:29,872
What did you want?

459
00:30:29,997 --> 00:30:34,293
We've had complaints and I thought
you should know.

460
00:30:35,210 --> 00:30:39,089
'My steak had fat an inch wide.'

461
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:43,177
'Shoulder loin wasn't all shoulder loin'.

462
00:30:43,719 --> 00:30:47,806
'The Japanese beef was costly but
tasteless.

463
00:30:47,890 --> 00:30:49,683
Is it really Japanese beef?

464
00:30:49,808 --> 00:30:51,476
Trying to pick a fright?

465
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:54,730
No. These are shoppers's comments.

466
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:57,691
Amateurs should shut their traps.

467
00:30:57,983 --> 00:31:01,653
We mix our meats, so what?
Like they say, folding screens

468
00:31:01,737 --> 00:31:08,160
and businesses fall flat on their backs
if kept straight. You like meat so much?

469
00:31:11,538 --> 00:31:14,541
Open up, Chief! Let me out!

470
00:31:21,632 --> 00:31:22,716
Is she all right?

471
00:31:22,841 --> 00:31:25,594
Yeah. Just letting her cool off.

472
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:31,725
Chief! Open the door!

473
00:31:55,374 --> 00:31:58,460
What the? The bitch!

474
00:32:06,677 --> 00:32:08,929
Good beef even sounds good.

475
00:32:12,766 --> 00:32:17,896
Just put up with it. You knocked his
beef and his pride.

476
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:19,606
Kobe beef is costly.

477
00:32:19,690 --> 00:32:21,775
What if you don't sell it all?

478
00:32:21,859 --> 00:32:23,527
It's a loss. A loss?

479
00:32:23,652 --> 00:32:24,653
We throw it out.

480
00:32:24,736 --> 00:32:28,115
Then, we lose money.

481
00:32:28,448 --> 00:32:30,617
You'll have to cover that loss.

482
00:32:30,993 --> 00:32:32,953
So what do you do?

483
00:32:33,036 --> 00:32:37,457
We bump up the prices on
our regular meat.

484
00:32:37,541 --> 00:32:43,672
Raise the price of regular meat to keep
the Kobe beef on the shelves!

485
00:32:43,797 --> 00:32:45,507
That's outrageous!

486
00:32:45,632 --> 00:32:48,886
The meat people have their reasons.

487
00:32:49,011 --> 00:32:51,388
You know, the customers like you.

488
00:32:51,513 --> 00:32:54,933
Who cares? They don't like the store.

489
00:32:55,058 --> 00:32:57,477
Can't you take a compliment?

490
00:33:00,022 --> 00:33:03,317
You should've used a cart, Sir.

491
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:07,321
But there weren't any.

492
00:33:07,446 --> 00:33:09,281
Oh. I'm sorry.

493
00:33:09,573 --> 00:33:12,034
Come here quick!

494
00:33:13,869 --> 00:33:16,538
Would you look after him?

495
00:33:22,586 --> 00:33:25,255
Goro! The carts are all gone.

496
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:27,216
Not Goro, 'General Manager'!

497
00:33:27,299 --> 00:33:30,636
The customers leave them in
the parking lot.

498
00:33:30,761 --> 00:33:34,306
Never mind how they get there.
Hurry and get them.

499
00:33:34,431 --> 00:33:36,225
Me? I'm busy now.

500
00:33:36,308 --> 00:33:38,685
Aw, forget it!

501
00:33:38,769 --> 00:33:40,145
Told you, I'm your boss.

502
00:33:40,729 --> 00:33:41,772
You idiot!

503
00:33:55,953 --> 00:33:57,913
Thank you.

504
00:34:09,049 --> 00:34:11,552
May I take this now?

505
00:34:17,558 --> 00:34:20,936
Excuse me, sir. That basket belongs
to our store.

506
00:34:21,061 --> 00:34:22,938
Okay, take them all!

507
00:34:30,153 --> 00:34:31,572
Here are the carts.

508
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:36,785
You've got a real attitude!

509
00:34:36,869 --> 00:34:38,662
I'm sorry.

510
00:34:38,787 --> 00:34:41,790
What crap are you selling here?

511
00:34:41,915 --> 00:34:44,168
I'm sorry.
Is that Al you can say?

512
00:34:44,293 --> 00:34:47,504
Some liquid leaked out of this pack and

513
00:34:47,629 --> 00:34:50,507
ruined my clothes!

514
00:34:50,632 --> 00:34:52,384
I'm sorry.

515
00:34:52,509 --> 00:34:55,053
Hold it, you're using a dirty rag!

516
00:34:55,179 --> 00:34:58,473
Can you believe this!

517
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:05,856
How can you let fish drips stain
your clothes?

518
00:35:05,981 --> 00:35:08,066
I tell you, we can't have this.

519
00:35:08,192 --> 00:35:09,401
What about the drips?

520
00:35:09,526 --> 00:35:12,821
Why do our fish leak so much?

521
00:35:13,822 --> 00:35:14,865
'Cause they don't sell.

522
00:35:14,990 --> 00:35:17,826
Why not periodically repack them?

523
00:35:17,951 --> 00:35:20,621
It's none of your business.

524
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:22,706
It is my business.

525
00:35:22,831 --> 00:35:25,417
The customers' complaints come to us.

526
00:35:25,542 --> 00:35:28,003
That's your job, to apologize nicely.

527
00:35:28,128 --> 00:35:30,422
Fresh fish, no complaints.

528
00:35:31,381 --> 00:35:35,260
What? You're saying my fish
aren't fresh?

529
00:35:35,385 --> 00:35:37,179
Well, one fresh snapper.

530
00:35:38,055 --> 00:35:39,181
What's it for?

531
00:35:39,890 --> 00:35:42,351
For sashimi later on.
Why not now?

532
00:35:42,476 --> 00:35:46,230
'Cause it looks so good. We keep it on
display and then...

533
00:35:46,355 --> 00:35:49,316
So you sell it just as it goes on the nose.

534
00:35:50,526 --> 00:35:53,237
Watch it, kid.

535
00:35:53,362 --> 00:35:55,447
Take it easy, Chief.

536
00:36:01,411 --> 00:36:02,829
What's this?

537
00:36:02,913 --> 00:36:08,752
Cold salt water. Firms up the flesh.

538
00:36:14,883 --> 00:36:16,510
Needs more salt.

539
00:36:16,969 --> 00:36:18,136
What do you think?

540
00:36:23,976 --> 00:36:26,103
Yeah. More salt.

541
00:36:31,441 --> 00:36:33,235
Are you Al right?

542
00:36:34,903 --> 00:36:36,321
Hello, welcome.

543
00:36:48,125 --> 00:36:49,418
Welcome to our store.

544
00:36:54,965 --> 00:36:58,677
Hanako, you're turning all the pros
against you.

545
00:36:58,844 --> 00:37:05,058
Hey, we get the complaints. We've
got to let the backyard guys know.

546
00:37:05,184 --> 00:37:08,645
Please watch your step.
It's very slippery here.

547
00:37:10,105 --> 00:37:11,231
Hi! How are you?

548
00:37:11,356 --> 00:37:13,650
Those guys have pride.

549
00:37:13,734 --> 00:37:15,277
Don't antagonize them.

550
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:18,197
Our store can't do without them.

551
00:37:18,572 --> 00:37:19,948
Hi there!

552
00:37:22,701 --> 00:37:26,205
Get your bok choy here!
Ten-yen each!

553
00:37:26,330 --> 00:37:27,789
Ten-yen!

554
00:37:27,873 --> 00:37:31,585
You gotta admire him.

555
00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:35,631
He doesn't like to throw away
leftovers.

556
00:37:35,714 --> 00:37:38,091
Now, there's real pro!

557
00:37:38,217 --> 00:37:41,178
Probably stocked up on
too much bok choy.

558
00:37:41,303 --> 00:37:43,305
Does it a I the time.

559
00:37:46,350 --> 00:37:49,686
Come get your bok choy here!
Only ten yen each!

560
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:54,191
Promise you won't laugh if I make
a suggestion?

561
00:37:54,483 --> 00:37:58,278
You're bad news. Telling the pros
what to do.

562
00:37:58,403 --> 00:38:00,447
Oh, don't be mean.

563
00:38:00,572 --> 00:38:05,994
I'll need your help in an experiment
tomorrow morning.

564
00:38:07,746 --> 00:38:09,748
Good morning.

565
00:38:13,043 --> 00:38:16,046
Write down Yen198, cross it out,

566
00:38:16,171 --> 00:38:19,883
and write Yen129. Perfect.

567
00:38:20,008 --> 00:38:23,804
Kiyochan, put these on.

568
00:38:23,929 --> 00:38:25,889
Okay. Before we close.

569
00:38:25,973 --> 00:38:27,891
No, no. Put' em on now.

570
00:38:27,975 --> 00:38:29,518
What? Before we open?

571
00:38:29,643 --> 00:38:32,062
It's an experiment.

572
00:38:32,187 --> 00:38:35,357
Instead of throwing out the leftover
bok choy,

573
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:39,862
lower the price now and sell them.

574
00:38:42,656 --> 00:38:45,284
Think that'll work?

575
00:38:46,285 --> 00:38:49,454
That's 31 yen change.

576
00:38:49,580 --> 00:38:52,583
Thank you, come again.

577
00:38:52,708 --> 00:38:54,835
Thank you.

578
00:38:56,128 --> 00:39:01,758
Hanako, got a minute?

579
00:39:07,389 --> 00:39:08,390
Look.

580
00:39:10,642 --> 00:39:11,894
She took one!

581
00:39:12,895 --> 00:39:13,896
She took one, too!

582
00:39:18,275 --> 00:39:19,818
It worked!

583
00:39:20,527 --> 00:39:22,571
Let's celebrate tonight!

584
00:39:24,031 --> 00:39:27,576
Cheers!

585
00:39:36,001 --> 00:39:37,961
Who'd ever guess?

586
00:39:38,086 --> 00:39:39,796
You lower the price a bit,

587
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:43,592
and they start selling like hot cakes.

588
00:39:43,675 --> 00:39:45,552
You're amazing.

589
00:39:45,677 --> 00:39:49,681
And you thought Hanako was useless.

590
00:39:50,224 --> 00:39:52,601
Yeah. Down-right stupid.

591
00:39:54,978 --> 00:39:57,439
Another thing.

592
00:39:57,564 --> 00:39:59,900
When we sold off all our lifeless
vegetables,

593
00:40:00,025 --> 00:40:03,570
the entire section glowed.

594
00:40:03,695 --> 00:40:04,863
Eh, Mitsu?

595
00:40:04,988 --> 00:40:11,245
Especially tomatoes and green peppers.

596
00:40:11,370 --> 00:40:15,332
Yeah. Green peppers and tomatoes...
they sparkled.

597
00:40:15,457 --> 00:40:21,880
We sold more tomatoes and
green peppers today than usual.

598
00:40:24,049 --> 00:40:28,345
Shelves filled with quality goods

599
00:40:28,595 --> 00:40:31,515
speak for themselves.

600
00:40:33,559 --> 00:40:36,186
Business life never ceases to amaze.

601
00:40:36,311 --> 00:40:37,771
Let's drink to that!

602
00:40:38,772 --> 00:40:41,692
Cheers!

603
00:40:42,568 --> 00:40:45,195
A carton of eggs, 28 yen,

604
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:47,781
one carton per customer.

605
00:40:48,073 --> 00:40:53,620
Great buy!

606
00:41:02,671 --> 00:41:08,927
Should be 88 yen! And they left out the
'First 1000 customers only' part.

607
00:41:10,846 --> 00:41:11,889
What!

608
00:41:12,139 --> 00:41:15,100
Eggs at 28 yen a carton!

609
00:41:15,184 --> 00:41:16,185
I'm truly sorry.

610
00:41:16,351 --> 00:41:18,395
Even at 88 yen. It's below cost!

611
00:41:18,478 --> 00:41:19,563
What can I say.

612
00:41:19,646 --> 00:41:22,900
What will happen with eggs at 28 yen?

613
00:41:23,984 --> 00:41:25,736
A stampede.

614
00:41:25,819 --> 00:41:30,490
God! We'd run out before noon!
Hanako?

615
00:41:30,657 --> 00:41:32,910
Let's order more eggs right away.

616
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:37,331
What's a supermarket without eggs?
Can't risk our reputation.

617
00:41:37,873 --> 00:41:39,833
Okay, you're in charge.

618
00:41:40,250 --> 00:41:41,960
Right. Let's go.

619
00:41:42,503 --> 00:41:46,798
Top-line goods are supposed to run out.

620
00:41:46,924 --> 00:41:50,344
Why make a fuss?

621
00:41:50,469 --> 00:41:51,345
But that's...

622
00:41:51,470 --> 00:41:55,474
Then put up a sign saying

623
00:41:55,599 --> 00:41:56,934
we made a mistake.

624
00:41:57,017 --> 00:42:01,396
The people believe in the flyers.

625
00:42:01,522 --> 00:42:02,523
It's be fraud.

626
00:42:02,606 --> 00:42:04,525
It's all my fault.

627
00:42:04,650 --> 00:42:07,819
Just order more eggs, please.

628
00:42:07,903 --> 00:42:13,951
Chief! The customers are already
lining up!

629
00:42:26,672 --> 00:42:29,508
One pack per customer.

630
00:42:29,716 --> 00:42:31,593
Line up, please!

631
00:42:40,060 --> 00:42:41,228
Got one, got one!

632
00:42:41,395 --> 00:42:44,064
Hurry, hurry!

633
00:42:57,452 --> 00:42:58,871
Don't push!

634
00:42:58,954 --> 00:43:04,376
One pack per customer, please.

635
00:43:04,459 --> 00:43:07,462
Didn't you a ready get one?

636
00:43:07,588 --> 00:43:10,215
Come on, it was somebody else!

637
00:43:11,550 --> 00:43:14,011
One last time, then. Thank you.

638
00:43:22,769 --> 00:43:24,313
The eggs! Any minute now.

639
00:43:24,438 --> 00:43:25,439
And. If we run out?

640
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:27,941
We hand out coupons.

641
00:43:28,609 --> 00:43:31,486
One per customer, valid for a week.

642
00:43:31,612 --> 00:43:32,738
That's it!

643
00:43:35,073 --> 00:43:38,744
Chief, the eggs are here.

644
00:43:48,295 --> 00:43:49,880
Here are the eggs.

645
00:43:59,306 --> 00:44:05,938
Please don't push.

646
00:44:07,814 --> 00:44:10,776
One per customer.

647
00:44:10,984 --> 00:44:15,697
No pushing.

648
00:44:16,114 --> 00:44:21,328
Don't shove.

649
00:44:21,453 --> 00:44:22,454
Thank you.

650
00:44:27,334 --> 00:44:30,754
Remember, you got them
at Honest Goro.

651
00:44:30,838 --> 00:44:35,717
One to a customer, please.

652
00:44:37,344 --> 00:44:38,345
Calm down, please.

653
00:44:38,512 --> 00:44:42,099
Get in line, please.

654
00:44:42,182 --> 00:44:45,185
Don't push.

655
00:44:45,310 --> 00:44:47,771
Thank you.

656
00:44:47,855 --> 00:44:50,649
One per customer.

657
00:44:50,774 --> 00:44:51,775
<i>That's 'M!</i>

658
00:44:53,777 --> 00:44:55,612
Please stay in line.

659
00:44:58,866 --> 00:45:00,742
We've been had!

660
00:45:00,868 --> 00:45:03,871
We're sold out.

661
00:45:03,996 --> 00:45:07,374
But here are some egg coupons.

662
00:45:07,499 --> 00:45:09,042
These are good for one week.

663
00:45:10,127 --> 00:45:14,423
One pack for 28 yen.
Honest Goro keeps its word.

664
00:45:14,590 --> 00:45:17,926
28 yen for a pack. Valid for one week.

665
00:45:18,594 --> 00:45:20,053
We keep our word.

666
00:45:20,137 --> 00:45:23,432
Liars! I hate supermarkets!

667
00:45:23,765 --> 00:45:26,226
Coupon's good for one week.

668
00:45:35,736 --> 00:45:38,155
The first three months were
a great success.

669
00:45:38,238 --> 00:45:46,205
It's only a matter of time before
Honest Goro collapses.

670
00:45:46,413 --> 00:45:49,249
We're on a roll. Let's make money.

671
00:45:49,374 --> 00:45:51,877
Use whatever means available.

672
00:45:55,255 --> 00:45:58,675
Sell good imported meat as
Japanese beef.

673
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:04,848
Call it Japanese beef and you can
double its price.

674
00:46:04,932 --> 00:46:08,393
Then take 30% off.

675
00:46:08,769 --> 00:46:12,064
We still make 40% profit.

676
00:46:18,737 --> 00:46:20,447
Look, new neighbors.

677
00:46:20,572 --> 00:46:22,241
Potential customers.

678
00:46:30,541 --> 00:46:31,375
Sorry to barge in.

679
00:46:31,458 --> 00:46:34,670
Here, let me help you.

680
00:46:35,045 --> 00:46:37,172
We're from Honest Goro.

681
00:46:37,798 --> 00:46:42,511
We're in the neighborhood.
Please drop by.

682
00:46:42,636 --> 00:46:44,054
We'll be waiting.

683
00:46:49,268 --> 00:46:51,228
You're in good shape for an oldie.

684
00:46:51,311 --> 00:46:53,438
College track team.

685
00:47:00,821 --> 00:47:02,531
Take a look.

686
00:47:02,948 --> 00:47:06,493
Our territory... in a radius of 1km
from the store.

687
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:13,000
Here's where our customers come from.

688
00:47:15,002 --> 00:47:19,089
You know, it's the customers that make
a supermarket.

689
00:47:21,717 --> 00:47:26,346
The egg incident taught me

690
00:47:26,972 --> 00:47:31,101
how scary that can be.

691
00:47:32,477 --> 00:47:33,687
Take a look.

692
00:47:35,856 --> 00:47:40,569
Thousands of people living here...

693
00:47:42,154 --> 00:47:50,162
all wanting the best they can get for
their hard-earned money.

694
00:47:52,414 --> 00:47:58,504
No wonder the customers are
dead serious.

695
00:47:59,546 --> 00:48:04,384
No wonder they look for things that are
better and cheaper.

696
00:48:05,177 --> 00:48:10,057
Supermarkets that can respond
to that, survive.

697
00:48:11,558 --> 00:48:17,898
Supermarkets that can't, die.

698
00:48:19,733 --> 00:48:22,402
You wanted to make the best store ever.

699
00:48:22,611 --> 00:48:23,987
Uh-huh.

700
00:48:24,488 --> 00:48:26,406
Best in what? Size?

701
00:48:26,990 --> 00:48:28,200
Not possible.

702
00:48:28,325 --> 00:48:29,368
Profits? Also impossible.

703
00:48:30,577 --> 00:48:31,870
Then, what?

704
00:48:35,749 --> 00:48:40,420
How's this? Put yourself in
the customer's shoes.

705
00:48:41,088 --> 00:48:46,510
Turn it into the most shopper-friendly
supermarket in Japan!

706
00:48:47,427 --> 00:48:50,389
How do I do that?

707
00:48:51,265 --> 00:48:55,894
Let's find out what the shopper wants.

708
00:48:55,978 --> 00:48:57,980
Find a suitable post for me.

709
00:48:58,814 --> 00:49:01,817
Deputy Manager... will that do?

710
00:49:10,701 --> 00:49:12,119
How are they?

711
00:49:12,286 --> 00:49:14,872
And please, be honest.

712
00:49:14,997 --> 00:49:19,334
Well, just look at the crumbs coating on
this pork cutlet...

713
00:49:19,418 --> 00:49:23,422
So thin, it sags.

714
00:49:26,133 --> 00:49:30,095
Macaroni salad, a yen per gram
is the limit.

715
00:49:30,179 --> 00:49:31,305
One yen?

716
00:49:32,139 --> 00:49:33,182
Keep trying, okay?

717
00:49:35,726 --> 00:49:40,189
Supermarket take-outs must taste good,
when cold.

718
00:49:40,314 --> 00:49:42,149
This tastes kind of gooey.

719
00:49:44,109 --> 00:49:47,446
This rice ball tastes funny.

720
00:49:47,529 --> 00:49:48,697
Funny? In what way?

721
00:49:48,822 --> 00:49:49,990
Sure this is cod roe?

722
00:49:50,115 --> 00:49:52,659
Yep! Genuine cod roe.

723
00:49:52,743 --> 00:49:57,497
Can't be.

724
00:49:58,040 --> 00:50:00,083
This is... grainy.

725
00:50:00,959 --> 00:50:02,211
Hmm. She's right.

726
00:50:02,336 --> 00:50:06,507
It is grainy.
Where do we get these from?

727
00:50:06,715 --> 00:50:08,342
From Tsurukame Foods.

728
00:50:08,425 --> 00:50:10,385
Let's check this out.

729
00:50:24,441 --> 00:50:27,110
Hello. Anybody here?

730
00:50:30,906 --> 00:50:33,742
Anybody home?

731
00:51:00,102 --> 00:51:02,437
Grainy? I don't think so.

732
00:51:02,521 --> 00:51:04,022
It's grainy.

733
00:51:04,106 --> 00:51:06,108
We're only doing what you asked.

734
00:51:06,233 --> 00:51:08,485
What are these white granules?

735
00:51:08,610 --> 00:51:11,196
You will take responsibility if we're sued?

736
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:13,156
Uh... well...
You're mixing, aren't you?

737
00:51:13,282 --> 00:51:14,867
No... that is...

738
00:51:20,122 --> 00:51:21,623
What are you mixing?

739
00:51:23,417 --> 00:51:24,835
Smelt roe, isn't it?

740
00:51:25,460 --> 00:51:27,045
Oh, he I...

741
00:51:27,629 --> 00:51:28,630
How much?

742
00:51:29,798 --> 00:51:31,466
About 10%.

743
00:51:31,466 --> 00:51:35,429
But everyone's doing it.

744
00:51:35,512 --> 00:51:39,892
Look. We don't want to deceive
our customers.

745
00:51:42,352 --> 00:51:49,234
Consider our supermarket as
your own storefront.

746
00:51:50,903 --> 00:51:57,201
Think that you're making rice balls for
customers, not for us.

747
00:51:59,828 --> 00:52:07,419
Please, make rice balls using
genuine cod roe.

748
00:52:10,005 --> 00:52:11,673
But the cost...

749
00:52:11,798 --> 00:52:13,217
That's up to you.

750
00:52:14,718 --> 00:52:18,430
But keep it low.
For the sake of everyone.

751
00:52:18,764 --> 00:52:20,933
And, we'll do our best to sell them.

752
00:52:21,975 --> 00:52:23,810
What if they don't sell?

753
00:52:24,144 --> 00:52:27,606
Competition is never easy.

754
00:52:28,148 --> 00:52:30,692
What, you'll go somewhere else?

755
00:52:31,068 --> 00:52:32,319
Let's try out best.

756
00:53:22,327 --> 00:53:24,204
It's good.

757
00:53:30,127 --> 00:53:32,004
Now, this is cod roe!

758
00:53:37,676 --> 00:53:39,386
She says it's good.

759
00:53:40,179 --> 00:53:41,638
Hear that?

760
00:53:44,850 --> 00:53:46,852
We did it!

761
00:53:46,935 --> 00:53:49,563
Thank you. Thank you.

762
00:53:49,688 --> 00:53:50,814
Don't cry.

763
00:53:50,898 --> 00:53:55,152
It's my first time to come in direct
contact with a customer.

764
00:53:55,360 --> 00:53:59,823
I'm really touched. Thank you,
thank you.

765
00:53:59,990 --> 00:54:04,411
Honest Goro

766
00:54:06,872 --> 00:54:09,583
Yummy.

767
00:54:09,708 --> 00:54:10,709
Sweet.

768
00:54:10,834 --> 00:54:13,504
Never knew corn could taste so sweet.

769
00:54:13,587 --> 00:54:15,506
Did you put sugar in?

770
00:54:15,589 --> 00:54:18,091
Don't be silly.

771
00:54:18,592 --> 00:54:21,011
Fresh corn is sweet.

772
00:54:21,094 --> 00:54:23,472
Picked just this morning.

773
00:54:23,555 --> 00:54:27,726
An idea from one of our customers,
from a farm.

774
00:54:27,851 --> 00:54:30,229
Wow!

775
00:54:33,106 --> 00:54:34,608
It's an experiment, hey?

776
00:54:34,733 --> 00:54:38,487
I wouldn't mind doing it every day.

777
00:54:41,198 --> 00:54:42,824
How's it going?

778
00:54:42,908 --> 00:54:44,701
Bring me a lunch box.

779
00:54:44,785 --> 00:54:46,870
Here you are.

780
00:54:46,995 --> 00:54:49,373
I can put anything in here?

781
00:54:49,456 --> 00:54:53,335
It's like a buffet. You can fill it
as you like it.

782
00:54:53,418 --> 00:54:55,754
For how much?
We're thinking 680 yen.

783
00:54:55,879 --> 00:54:57,673
That's cheap!

784
00:54:57,923 --> 00:55:00,133
Well, cheap is good.

785
00:55:00,259 --> 00:55:02,928
But these are made with left-overs.

786
00:55:03,053 --> 00:55:06,765
I don't think that's going to satisfy
any one.

787
00:55:10,727 --> 00:55:13,564
I got the idea from a customer.

788
00:55:14,231 --> 00:55:20,028
Why don't we hold a sale with 10% off
everything we sell?

789
00:55:20,571 --> 00:55:23,115
Now, it won't work.

790
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:26,785
Nobody gets excited unless it's
at east 30% off.

791
00:55:26,910 --> 00:55:30,789
How many items do we carry right now?

792
00:55:30,914 --> 00:55:35,544
I'd say about 6,000.

793
00:55:35,627 --> 00:55:39,214
For how many have we given
discounts to?

794
00:55:39,631 --> 00:55:43,260
Oh, maybe 200.

795
00:55:43,385 --> 00:55:49,933
Then, the remaining 5.800 items have
never been marked down. Right?

796
00:55:50,934 --> 00:55:53,812
Who would miss a chance like that?

797
00:55:53,937 --> 00:55:55,689
10% OFF EVERYTHING SALE

798
00:55:56,356 --> 00:55:58,400
How's it going here?

799
00:55:58,483 --> 00:55:59,276
Very well. Thanks.

800
00:55:59,401 --> 00:56:01,195
We're selling things that...

801
00:56:01,278 --> 00:56:03,447
we don't usually sell.

802
00:56:03,572 --> 00:56:04,865
The sale's a big hit.

803
00:56:10,037 --> 00:56:13,165
10 kilograms of rice, 4572 yen.

804
00:56:13,290 --> 00:56:15,709
One saucepan 1782 yen.

805
00:56:15,792 --> 00:56:19,129
One medium size frying pan, 2682 yen,

806
00:56:19,213 --> 00:56:21,423
one large-size frying pan, 5552 yen.

807
00:56:21,548 --> 00:56:23,592
Hello, how are you?

808
00:56:27,638 --> 00:56:30,516
Big rice bags, all gone.
More frying pans!

809
00:56:30,641 --> 00:56:32,559
Hello.

810
00:56:33,101 --> 00:56:34,770
The sale's great.

811
00:56:34,895 --> 00:56:38,190
Hanako's got more business sense
than the Boss.

812
00:56:38,315 --> 00:56:39,650
A lot better...

813
00:56:40,108 --> 00:56:43,237
Yes, how do you like it? Thank you.

814
00:56:43,320 --> 00:56:45,989
A real good buy on pots and pans today.

815
00:56:55,249 --> 00:56:56,959
Good morning.

816
00:57:07,344 --> 00:57:08,929
What are you doing?

817
00:57:09,221 --> 00:57:15,102
Repacking yesterday's left-overs and
changing the date.

818
00:57:15,185 --> 00:57:16,937
What for? I don't understand.

819
00:57:17,062 --> 00:57:23,151
We're repacking the fish and putting
today's date on.

820
00:57:23,277 --> 00:57:26,488
Here. Look at the date on this.

821
00:57:27,197 --> 00:57:30,033
That's today's date all right.

822
00:57:31,410 --> 00:57:35,706
We don't want to be a part of
this scam...

823
00:57:36,206 --> 00:57:38,250
but it's the Manager's orders.

824
00:57:38,333 --> 00:57:40,586
What if nobody buys it today?

825
00:57:40,669 --> 00:57:44,673
I guess we put a new date
on it tomorrow.

826
00:57:44,798 --> 00:57:51,180
Then, what's the label for?

827
00:57:52,222 --> 00:57:54,600
What if someone gets food poisoning?

828
00:57:54,808 --> 00:57:57,394
You'll be held responsible too.

829
00:57:58,020 --> 00:58:00,397
Well. We can't let this go on.

830
00:58:02,441 --> 00:58:05,861
Please. I have a motion.

831
00:58:08,697 --> 00:58:09,698
Go ahead.

832
00:58:12,576 --> 00:58:18,999
I want the practice of repacking
stopped.

833
00:58:20,542 --> 00:58:22,544
Keep that big mouth shut.

834
00:58:22,753 --> 00:58:26,173
I can't. This concerns everyone.

835
00:58:26,256 --> 00:58:28,509
Nobody enjoys repacking.

836
00:58:28,634 --> 00:58:34,348
Why? Because it's a lie.
We're deceiving our customers.

837
00:58:34,431 --> 00:58:37,935
No we're not.

838
00:58:38,727 --> 00:58:41,271
The date tells the day it was packed.

839
00:58:41,688 --> 00:58:44,358
If we repack it, it gets a new date.

840
00:58:44,608 --> 00:58:47,569
You believe that?

841
00:58:48,237 --> 00:58:49,238
Damn right, I do.

842
00:58:49,738 --> 00:58:52,991
If that's what you believe. Then explain
it to everyone.

843
00:59:02,251 --> 00:59:03,836
What's wrong with it?

844
00:59:04,753 --> 00:59:07,840
All supermarkets do it.

845
00:59:08,382 --> 00:59:12,511
It's something you pick up in
the store business.

846
00:59:12,886 --> 00:59:14,137
You've heard it... business and

847
00:59:14,221 --> 00:59:18,267
folding screens won't stand if they're...

848
00:59:18,600 --> 00:59:21,144
What is that? The company motto?

849
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:23,689
Well, I don't buy it.

850
00:59:24,231 --> 00:59:29,069
Fooling customers can't be good for
business in the long run.

851
00:59:29,194 --> 00:59:32,197
It'll kill our reputation.

852
00:59:32,281 --> 00:59:33,115
But...

853
00:59:33,240 --> 00:59:36,618
These part-timers are local
housewives.

854
00:59:37,536 --> 00:59:40,747
They all have families.

855
00:59:41,582 --> 00:59:44,751
When they go home, they have to
fix dinner. Yet...

856
00:59:45,169 --> 00:59:49,631
I have never seen these women
shop here.

857
00:59:50,257 --> 00:59:57,139
Why? Because they don't trust
the store.

858
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:01,268
Honesty is the best policy.

859
01:00:01,727 --> 01:00:03,812
I think everyone agrees.

860
01:00:03,937 --> 01:00:07,316
All right. Let's put it a vote.

861
01:00:08,859 --> 01:00:16,742
Repacking is a company Po icy.
Those opposed, raise your hands.

862
01:00:36,386 --> 01:00:37,596
Excuse me.

863
01:00:41,600 --> 01:00:44,478
I don't want to repack things.

864
01:00:45,020 --> 01:00:47,773
How can I explain it to my kids?

865
01:00:53,445 --> 01:00:55,656
Can I say something?

866
01:00:55,739 --> 01:01:02,579
We should quit making dishes out
of leftover stuff.

867
01:01:02,704 --> 01:01:05,415
This is wrong.

868
01:01:05,666 --> 01:01:12,047
We want to make things for the
supermarket we can be proud of.

869
01:01:13,131 --> 01:01:17,928
Who wants to make a boxed lunch with
yesterday's pork cutlets?

870
01:01:33,777 --> 01:01:37,447
Gee. That felt good.

871
01:01:38,657 --> 01:01:41,285
Did you see the Manager's face?

872
01:01:43,579 --> 01:01:47,416
And you really put him in his place.

873
01:01:49,626 --> 01:01:52,838
Not me. She was terrific.

874
01:01:55,549 --> 01:01:59,094
I saw Hanako holding the fort
all by herself,

875
01:01:59,219 --> 01:02:01,305
and the words just came out.

876
01:02:08,562 --> 01:02:10,230
Hanako.

877
01:02:10,564 --> 01:02:11,565
Can I see you?

878
01:02:24,286 --> 01:02:26,705
You want to get me in trouble?

879
01:02:26,788 --> 01:02:27,456
What's wrong?

880
01:02:27,581 --> 01:02:31,460
Come on, repacking is part of the trade.

881
01:02:31,585 --> 01:02:34,254
You put them in an awkward position.

882
01:02:34,379 --> 01:02:38,425
Who's side are you on, the pros or
the shoppers?

883
01:02:38,550 --> 01:02:43,305
A supermarket exists for the shoppers,
not the other way around.

884
01:02:43,430 --> 01:02:45,057
I get your point, but...

885
01:02:45,140 --> 01:02:46,558
No, you don't. Yes, I do.

886
01:02:46,683 --> 01:02:49,102
Then, hurry up and make it official.

887
01:02:49,186 --> 01:02:49,937
Official?

888
01:02:50,062 --> 01:02:54,274
That our policy is to sell only
fresh goods.

889
01:02:54,358 --> 01:02:55,901
But that's... What?

890
01:02:55,984 --> 01:02:58,237
That'|| off end the pros again.
How come?

891
01:02:58,320 --> 01:03:01,073
You're questioning their professionalism.

892
01:03:01,156 --> 01:03:06,245
Oh, come off it. That pained look again.

893
01:03:06,328 --> 01:03:11,917
Why hesitate so? Don't be afraid of
of fending them.

894
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:13,585
You're hurting their pride.

895
01:03:13,669 --> 01:03:17,464
Where's your backbone?

896
01:03:17,548 --> 01:03:21,552
It's not easy being a boss. You think
you know everything.

897
01:03:21,677 --> 01:03:24,721
I was only trying to save your butt.

898
01:03:24,847 --> 01:03:26,265
Don't do me favors.

899
01:03:26,348 --> 01:03:30,978
You're feeling smug because
the summer sales was a hit.

900
01:03:31,061 --> 01:03:32,521
What does it mean? What's what?

901
01:03:32,604 --> 01:03:34,064
Oh, is that the problem?

902
01:03:34,606 --> 01:03:36,692
You're sulking.

903
01:03:36,817 --> 01:03:38,151
I'm not sulking.

904
01:03:38,235 --> 01:03:40,612
You should like a egotistic bitch.

905
01:03:40,696 --> 01:03:42,906
Bitch?

906
01:03:43,323 --> 01:03:45,951
I don't have to take this. I quit!
Quit?

907
01:03:46,034 --> 01:03:50,414
I've had it up to here!

908
01:04:06,221 --> 01:04:10,184
That woman, she's...
What can I do with her?

909
01:04:11,143 --> 01:04:12,144
Right?

910
01:04:58,649 --> 01:05:00,984
Hanako here?

911
01:05:01,401 --> 01:05:03,028
She hasn't come here yet.

912
01:05:03,111 --> 01:05:04,196
Did she cal?

913
01:05:04,279 --> 01:05:07,449
No, we haven't heard from her, right?

914
01:05:07,574 --> 01:05:09,117
Strange, that...

915
01:05:09,243 --> 01:05:10,577
Wonder what's happened.

916
01:05:42,609 --> 01:05:45,988
The rice balls are doing just great.

917
01:05:57,749 --> 01:05:58,917
General Manager...

918
01:06:02,379 --> 01:06:05,465
There's a phone call for you.

919
01:06:07,926 --> 01:06:09,636
Sir. A phone ca I.

920
01:06:10,304 --> 01:06:11,680
Huh? Phone? Yes, sir.

921
01:06:18,145 --> 01:06:21,481
Hello? Goro?

922
01:06:22,191 --> 01:06:23,650
Hanako! Thank God!

923
01:06:23,817 --> 01:06:27,696
Thought I'd never see you again!
Where are you?

924
01:06:27,863 --> 01:06:28,906
Aomori.

925
01:06:29,031 --> 01:06:32,451
What are you doing up there?

926
01:06:32,534 --> 01:06:34,328
Investigating?

927
01:06:34,453 --> 01:06:35,913
There was a storm.

928
01:06:36,079 --> 01:06:38,040
I saw it on TV. So?

929
01:06:38,373 --> 01:06:39,666
Lots of apples fell.

930
01:06:39,791 --> 01:06:42,336
Saw that, too. Get to the point,
will you?

931
01:06:42,753 --> 01:06:44,713
Well, there are three types.

932
01:06:45,005 --> 01:06:46,006
What?

933
01:06:46,048 --> 01:06:49,510
One, too bruised for anything but
apple juice.

934
01:06:49,593 --> 01:06:52,596
Two, some minor damage.

935
01:06:52,721 --> 01:06:54,473
Three, no damage.

936
01:06:54,890 --> 01:06:56,016
So you...

937
01:06:56,600 --> 01:07:02,314
Right. I ordered a pile from type two
but I need your okay.

938
01:07:04,441 --> 01:07:07,569
Get as much as you want
and come right back.

939
01:07:09,238 --> 01:07:12,366
I'll head right home.

940
01:07:12,699 --> 01:07:14,868
What am I going to do with you?

941
01:08:01,874 --> 01:08:05,377
Good to see you back.
You missed me?

942
01:08:05,460 --> 01:08:08,422
Idiot. I came back for
the supermarket.

943
01:08:08,505 --> 01:08:11,717
Don't get excited. Hey, cut it out.

944
01:08:11,800 --> 01:08:14,303
Leave me alone, okay?

945
01:08:14,428 --> 01:08:16,263
Take you home? The apples?

946
01:08:16,471 --> 01:08:18,056
Don't worry.

947
01:08:20,934 --> 01:08:22,269
Great to have you back.

948
01:08:22,352 --> 01:08:25,063
Leave my shoulders alone.

949
01:08:25,147 --> 01:08:27,482
I know! Let's go to my place and...

950
01:08:27,608 --> 01:08:28,609
No way.

951
01:08:28,734 --> 01:08:30,485
How about a Hotel?

952
01:08:30,611 --> 01:08:33,780
Yuck! I'm not sleeping with you, fatso.

953
01:08:33,864 --> 01:08:34,948
Hey, that hurt.

954
01:08:35,032 --> 01:08:37,618
Pervert. Men, you're all alike.

955
01:08:38,368 --> 01:08:40,579
Okay. I'll go home and sleep alone.

956
01:08:40,662 --> 01:08:41,955
Yeah, let's go home.

957
01:08:42,706 --> 01:08:43,957
I'll get you a cab.

958
01:08:50,255 --> 01:08:51,465
Take care.

959
01:08:51,548 --> 01:08:53,592
What about the Hotel?

960
01:08:53,842 --> 01:08:55,302
Now what?

961
01:09:02,935 --> 01:09:04,436
<i>So, your husband?</i>

962
01:09:05,103 --> 01:09:08,815
Left me for another woman.
He got cancer.

963
01:09:08,899 --> 01:09:10,859
She sent him back.

964
01:09:10,984 --> 01:09:13,237
I took care of him... no choice.

965
01:09:13,362 --> 01:09:14,738
Eventually he died.

966
01:09:15,697 --> 01:09:16,698
End of story.

967
01:09:19,535 --> 01:09:22,996
This bed stuff. It's sport...
nothing else, okay?

968
01:09:37,052 --> 01:09:38,345
Well, coming or not?

969
01:09:48,063 --> 01:09:51,483
Wait. We really gonna do it?

970
01:09:51,733 --> 01:09:52,734
Why?

971
01:09:53,068 --> 01:09:59,074
Because... There's this little problem
with... 'freshness'.

972
01:10:00,367 --> 01:10:02,995
I'm not all that fresh myself.

973
01:10:03,078 --> 01:10:07,040
Wow! Yours' an encyclopedia!

974
01:10:07,332 --> 01:10:08,917
Forget about freshness.

975
01:10:14,047 --> 01:10:16,717
Uh-huh. No good.

976
01:10:21,722 --> 01:10:22,806
No, no, I'm sorry...

977
01:10:28,812 --> 01:10:29,813
Okay now.

978
01:10:36,445 --> 01:10:38,864
No, no it won't work.

979
01:10:39,448 --> 01:10:43,410
Can't help laughing.

980
01:10:45,454 --> 01:10:46,538
I'm sorry.

981
01:10:47,289 --> 01:10:48,290
That's all right.

982
01:10:48,874 --> 01:10:52,085
You know,
you're not aggressive enough.

983
01:10:53,378 --> 01:10:55,422
Nice of you to mention it now.

984
01:10:55,672 --> 01:10:56,715
Yeah, I'm sorry.

985
01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:01,428
You're probably right, though.

986
01:11:02,012 --> 01:11:04,765
Since my wife died, I tend to hold back...

987
01:11:06,225 --> 01:11:07,976
Mine had cancer, too.

988
01:11:10,229 --> 01:11:12,898
Did all I could.

989
01:11:14,149 --> 01:11:18,695
I let her do everything she wanted to.

990
01:11:18,820 --> 01:11:22,115
Went to theater... opera...

991
01:11:22,407 --> 01:11:24,660
even Europe.

992
01:11:27,829 --> 01:11:31,458
Near the end, I was always at her side.

993
01:11:33,085 --> 01:11:35,379
When I couldn't take it any more,

994
01:11:36,505 --> 01:11:39,800
off to the driving range to smash
golf balls.

995
01:11:41,218 --> 01:11:47,432
Couldn't see the balls for the tears.

996
01:11:53,021 --> 01:11:59,987
Know what though? At her funeral, I felt
content... because I had done everything.

997
01:12:03,615 --> 01:12:05,158
Let's do all we can.

998
01:12:06,535 --> 01:12:07,661
For the store.

999
01:12:08,662 --> 01:12:16,670
It may lead to our funeral, but at least
we'll look happy for having tried.

1000
01:12:23,051 --> 01:12:24,261
Hmm. Why not?

1001
01:12:26,471 --> 01:12:29,391
Let's give it all we've got.

1002
01:12:30,809 --> 01:12:31,810
Yeah.

1003
01:12:32,060 --> 01:12:33,520
Good morning.

1004
01:12:35,230 --> 01:12:36,440
Good morning.

1005
01:12:39,026 --> 01:12:46,491
I have something important to tell all
of you, so listen carefully.

1006
01:12:48,368 --> 01:12:52,247
Starting today, there will be a major
policy change.

1007
01:12:54,249 --> 01:13:02,257
From now on, we are selling only
fresh food.

1008
01:13:03,717 --> 01:13:08,597
Therefore, we will discontinue
the use of leftovers.

1009
01:13:08,972 --> 01:13:12,768
And also the practice of repacking.

1010
01:13:27,783 --> 01:13:32,412
Wow, look at the color of freshly
ground beef.

1011
01:13:32,621 --> 01:13:34,122
Should look this good.

1012
01:13:36,750 --> 01:13:41,046
Who told you to make ground meat
out of meat this fresh.

1013
01:13:41,129 --> 01:13:44,091
Sorry, but these orders came
from the boss.

1014
01:13:44,174 --> 01:13:46,927
What the hell does he know?

1015
01:13:47,052 --> 01:13:50,973
I'm the boss around here. I'll tell you
what to do, not him.

1016
01:13:55,477 --> 01:13:57,104
What's the matter?

1017
01:14:00,232 --> 01:14:01,608
Didn't sell. Hey?

1018
01:14:03,318 --> 01:14:07,072
No one comes to a supermarket
for fresh fish.

1019
01:14:07,739 --> 01:14:10,701
They buy fish else where.

1020
01:14:11,368 --> 01:14:12,870
What do we do?

1021
01:14:14,413 --> 01:14:17,708
Just throw them away.

1022
01:14:29,511 --> 01:14:31,138
It was good in the old days.

1023
01:14:33,348 --> 01:14:35,893
I heard you once owned a fish store.

1024
01:14:37,227 --> 01:14:38,812
What happened to it?

1025
01:14:40,272 --> 01:14:42,024
It was land speculators...

1026
01:14:42,524 --> 01:14:45,194
Then, Goro offered me this job.

1027
01:14:46,695 --> 01:14:50,157
I didn't mean to stay in a supermarket.

1028
01:14:50,949 --> 01:14:54,786
But hell, it isn't easy getting
a place of my own.

1029
01:14:55,954 --> 01:14:59,541
Wait until New Year's Holidays.

1030
01:15:00,125 --> 01:15:02,211
Fish stores are closed then.

1031
01:15:02,336 --> 01:15:07,007
People will come here to buy fish.
That's our chance.

1032
01:15:08,091 --> 01:15:13,347
We'll just hang in there until then, okay?

1033
01:15:17,392 --> 01:15:21,355
Look at the vegetables from the other
supermarkets.

1034
01:15:21,438 --> 01:15:25,484
Notice that each store has it own way
of cutting them?

1035
01:15:25,901 --> 01:15:27,945
Take the celery here.

1036
01:15:28,070 --> 01:15:30,864
This one is cut straight across.

1037
01:15:31,073 --> 01:15:35,285
But this one is cut at an angle.

1038
01:15:36,119 --> 01:15:37,746
Or, the cabbage.

1039
01:15:37,871 --> 01:15:42,417
Look how Sta ks are cut differently.

1040
01:15:43,252 --> 01:15:45,963
And, how about this bok choy?

1041
01:15:46,463 --> 01:15:48,549
Take a look at the cut on the end.

1042
01:15:49,842 --> 01:15:51,134
Never saw this before.

1043
01:15:51,260 --> 01:15:54,555
What are the cuts for?

1044
01:15:56,348 --> 01:15:58,350
They cut it by mistake?

1045
01:15:58,600 --> 01:16:02,729
But this one has
the same cut marks. See?

1046
01:16:03,146 --> 01:16:05,399
I wonder what they're for?

1047
01:16:06,275 --> 01:16:08,110
Don't have a clue.

1048
01:16:08,277 --> 01:16:09,862
Umm...

1049
01:16:10,445 --> 01:16:11,905
What is it, Mitsu?

1050
01:16:13,740 --> 01:16:17,995
I may be wrong, but...

1051
01:16:18,120 --> 01:16:24,835
that's to stop bok choy from growing.

1052
01:16:26,211 --> 01:16:33,260
Plants grow even after they come
to store.

1053
01:16:34,094 --> 01:16:39,850
I get it! That's why the side of
this bok choy bulges out.

1054
01:16:40,517 --> 01:16:44,563
The cuts were made to prevent this!

1055
01:16:45,147 --> 01:16:47,232
I think so.

1056
01:16:47,691 --> 01:16:51,111
Mitchan, you've been studying.

1057
01:16:53,197 --> 01:16:54,823
Good for you. Mitsu!

1058
01:17:01,663 --> 01:17:03,123
"Good morning"!

1059
01:17:03,207 --> 01:17:09,630
"Thank you for coming"!"The supermarket"
"'Honest Goro"'!"is now open for business".

1060
01:17:11,840 --> 01:17:16,178
Great turnout. Looks like
the flyers worked.

1061
01:17:16,303 --> 01:17:19,973
What's this? Still stocking shelves?

1062
01:17:20,057 --> 01:17:22,434
I'll go and take a look.

1063
01:17:22,518 --> 01:17:26,271
Today's special is 'Stew Fest'.

1064
01:17:26,355 --> 01:17:30,067
Try our fresh ingredients, all at
marked down prices.

1065
01:17:30,192 --> 01:17:33,695
The shelves are half-empty. Hurry up!

1066
01:17:33,820 --> 01:17:37,574
This is no time to be making
5000-yen steak.

1067
01:17:37,699 --> 01:17:38,825
Aw, shuddup.

1068
01:17:38,951 --> 01:17:43,497
Work on the cheaper meats and
ground beef first, will you?

1069
01:17:43,622 --> 01:17:45,916
Hey. Watch out!

1070
01:17:46,041 --> 01:17:47,125
Ouch!

1071
01:17:47,543 --> 01:17:48,544
Sorry!

1072
01:17:49,378 --> 01:17:50,671
Hurry it up!

1073
01:17:51,046 --> 01:17:56,844
I'd like to, but the Chief has to do all
the important stuff himself.

1074
01:17:56,927 --> 01:17:58,011
Can't you do it?

1075
01:17:58,095 --> 01:18:02,057
Sure.

1076
01:18:02,140 --> 01:18:08,230
But in this business, <i>us</i> youngsters
must know our place.

1077
01:18:08,397 --> 01:18:09,565
Oh, good grief.

1078
01:18:13,902 --> 01:18:16,154
People are pouring in. Step on it!

1079
01:18:16,655 --> 01:18:18,198
Can't do.

1080
01:18:18,323 --> 01:18:19,491
Why not?

1081
01:18:20,284 --> 01:18:23,787
The Chief won't let anyone touch
the sashimi.

1082
01:19:00,699 --> 01:19:04,620
Damn. The"Pros" are holding us up
big time.

1083
01:19:04,703 --> 01:19:06,205
The pros, huh?

1084
01:19:06,496 --> 01:19:12,920
Yeah. They hog all the major work
and won't let anyone else touch it.

1085
01:19:13,045 --> 01:19:16,465
We've got these trolleys
but can't use them.

1086
01:19:17,382 --> 01:19:19,927
They hate assembly-Ines.

1087
01:19:20,052 --> 01:19:22,638
We I, you tell them off. You're the boss.

1088
01:19:22,763 --> 01:19:24,932
You know I can't.

1089
01:19:25,015 --> 01:19:28,143
To start new traditions,
get rid of the old.

1090
01:19:28,268 --> 01:19:31,188
Have you no guts?

1091
01:19:32,064 --> 01:19:33,649
I can't.

1092
01:19:37,861 --> 01:19:41,907
Think. What do you expect from
a supermarket?

1093
01:19:42,115 --> 01:19:44,034
Fresh goods, reasonable prices...

1094
01:19:44,159 --> 01:19:47,454
Hey. Who's store is this anyway?

1095
01:19:48,038 --> 01:19:49,998
Good prices, and things sell.

1096
01:19:50,082 --> 01:19:57,172
And the turnover of fresh foods keeps
the shelves full.

1097
01:19:57,381 --> 01:20:02,177
So you've got to keep the backyard
in top gear churning out fresh goods.

1098
01:20:02,594 --> 01:20:05,472
Then. We need that assembly line, Goro.

1099
01:20:05,556 --> 01:20:08,475
It's the store's engine.

1100
01:20:08,559 --> 01:20:10,310
But you can't have the pros...

1101
01:20:10,435 --> 01:20:12,312
The part-timers can do it.

1102
01:20:12,855 --> 01:20:18,610
Take a fish: One person chops its head,
skins and fillets it. Make the sashimi,

1103
01:20:18,694 --> 01:20:24,199
packs it, weighs it, and labels it.
Simple.

1104
01:20:24,324 --> 01:20:26,326
Too hard.

1105
01:20:26,451 --> 01:20:28,787
Then train them.

1106
01:20:29,121 --> 01:20:31,832
Making sashimi... it's not a big deal.

1107
01:20:31,915 --> 01:20:34,251
Who's going to train them?
The pros.

1108
01:20:34,376 --> 01:20:35,460
No way! How come?

1109
01:20:35,544 --> 01:20:37,838
They won't do it.

1110
01:20:38,672 --> 01:20:41,550
I'll ask them. Nothing wrong with that.

1111
01:20:41,633 --> 01:20:43,343
You're crazy!

1112
01:20:44,219 --> 01:20:48,348
Listen, making sashimi is my job.

1113
01:20:49,474 --> 01:20:51,476
They aren't ready yet.

1114
01:20:51,977 --> 01:20:56,690
Mackerel sashimi, maybe,
but never snapper.

1115
01:20:57,232 --> 01:20:59,026
You can teach them.

1116
01:20:59,735 --> 01:21:02,154
You learn by watching the master.

1117
01:21:02,529 --> 01:21:09,912
I learned by working as an apprentice.
That's how you do it in this business.

1118
01:21:24,301 --> 01:21:25,928
I'll be blunt.

1119
01:21:27,721 --> 01:21:31,183
We don't need mastery in supermarkets.

1120
01:21:31,517 --> 01:21:35,437
Just conveyer-type skills.

1121
01:21:35,521 --> 01:21:39,024
I'd like you to teach the part-timers.

1122
01:21:39,107 --> 01:21:45,572
I want that assembly line working!

1123
01:21:45,697 --> 01:21:47,032
The hell you do!

1124
01:21:48,116 --> 01:21:50,035
I'm a fish expert.

1125
01:21:50,118 --> 01:21:52,412
I won't work in a fish factory.

1126
01:21:52,538 --> 01:21:54,206
Don't get me wrong.

1127
01:21:54,289 --> 01:21:57,626
I'm not saying that being a pro is bad.

1128
01:21:57,751 --> 01:22:03,048
Just that it doesn't go well with
supermarkets.

1129
01:22:04,132 --> 01:22:10,639
If you're serious,

1130
01:22:11,431 --> 01:22:15,310
open your own shop, or become a chef.

1131
01:22:15,435 --> 01:22:20,983
Oh. Yeah? Then I quit. This is just
a fish corner in a cruddy supermarket.

1132
01:22:21,108 --> 01:22:24,528
You're not even an expert
in a cruddy store.

1133
01:22:24,653 --> 01:22:28,156
An expert wouldn't buy costly stuff
that doesn't sell.

1134
01:22:28,282 --> 01:22:31,243
And that fish tank!
What's the point of it?

1135
01:22:31,326 --> 01:22:33,495
It only feeds your ego!

1136
01:22:40,335 --> 01:22:42,838
Drain the water, and take the tank out.

1137
01:22:42,963 --> 01:22:44,173
Chief!

1138
01:22:44,506 --> 01:22:48,135
What the hell...
Getting rid of the tank.

1139
01:22:48,218 --> 01:22:49,803
The hell you are!

1140
01:22:50,137 --> 01:22:51,513
Shut up!

1141
01:22:51,638 --> 01:22:54,474
What the fuck!

1142
01:22:55,350 --> 01:22:58,145
You want this? Here! I'll do it for you.

1143
01:22:58,395 --> 01:23:00,647
Satisfied?

1144
01:23:32,846 --> 01:23:40,854
We better start work now. The store's
opening soon.

1145
01:23:48,570 --> 01:23:50,948
He won't budge.

1146
01:23:52,574 --> 01:23:54,451
Good morning.

1147
01:23:56,578 --> 01:23:58,622
Okay, Kinchan, show us how.

1148
01:23:58,830 --> 01:24:01,959
We're going to try it.

1149
01:24:02,084 --> 01:24:04,044
Show us how to make sashimi.

1150
01:24:04,169 --> 01:24:06,046
Um, but...

1151
01:24:06,129 --> 01:24:09,800
You don't trust us women?

1152
01:24:10,050 --> 01:24:15,889
We've been cooking since
you wore diapers!

1153
01:24:16,932 --> 01:24:19,893
Now, Kinchan, come on!

1154
01:24:21,395 --> 01:24:26,900
All right. First, stand correctly.

1155
01:24:27,860 --> 01:24:30,571
Face the cutting board.

1156
01:24:30,946 --> 01:24:35,033
Get a hand-width between you and
the board.

1157
01:24:35,367 --> 01:24:38,370
Put your right foot slightly back.

1158
01:24:38,537 --> 01:24:43,792
Now. This long knife is for sashimi.
Use the entire blade.

1159
01:24:44,001 --> 01:24:45,335
Quit yapping!

1160
01:24:48,463 --> 01:24:52,092
We don't need pricey meat!

1161
01:24:52,926 --> 01:24:56,555
The cost on regular meat
goes up to cover

1162
01:24:56,638 --> 01:25:00,142
the loss on the costly Japanese beef.

1163
01:25:00,267 --> 01:25:03,478
Forget Kobe beef, and our problems
are solved.

1164
01:25:03,604 --> 01:25:07,941
Now what? It's none of your business
what we carry.

1165
01:25:08,025 --> 01:25:10,903
A supermarket is for everyday meals.

1166
01:25:10,986 --> 01:25:15,616
It's stupid to have costly steaks
occupying the best shelf.

1167
01:25:15,699 --> 01:25:19,912
Put the cheap cuts there instead.

1168
01:25:22,164 --> 01:25:27,628
I'm getting out of here. No bloody
amateurs tells me what to do!

1169
01:25:27,753 --> 01:25:30,339
Something you're not telling us?

1170
01:25:30,464 --> 01:25:32,549
Say that again! Now, now.

1171
01:25:32,674 --> 01:25:36,220
Calm down, you two. Time out.

1172
01:25:46,438 --> 01:25:47,814
You got troubles?

1173
01:25:47,940 --> 01:25:52,653
Regular pain in the ass.
Bet she can't tell pork from beef.

1174
01:25:54,947 --> 01:25:56,490
Meat scraps ready?

1175
01:25:56,615 --> 01:25:58,158
Yeah... sure.

1176
01:26:10,254 --> 01:26:12,297
I'll take this block of 'gold'.

1177
01:26:55,424 --> 01:26:57,885
This is Kobe and... that's imported.

1178
01:26:57,968 --> 01:26:59,511
You picked it.

1179
01:26:59,595 --> 01:27:01,722
Takes a crook to know one.

1180
01:27:04,391 --> 01:27:08,353
You slice it and it becomes
Japanese beef.

1181
01:27:08,437 --> 01:27:10,439
No one can tell.

1182
01:27:10,731 --> 01:27:12,399
Even the pros.

1183
01:27:12,649 --> 01:27:19,907
Mix the imported with the Japanese,
and the beef around the innards.

1184
01:27:20,240 --> 01:27:22,910
Presto! Kobe beef.

1185
01:27:23,368 --> 01:27:26,914
Ah. An expert.

1186
01:27:26,997 --> 01:27:29,541
And I get the real 'stuff'.

1187
01:27:35,631 --> 01:27:37,341
That pesty bitch...

1188
01:27:37,925 --> 01:27:41,011
Better watch her. She's pretty sharp.

1189
01:28:04,826 --> 01:28:07,120
Darling! How've you been?

1190
01:28:07,246 --> 01:28:09,581
Is he here? In our best room.

1191
01:28:22,094 --> 01:28:27,057
The head of 'Bargain Galore' Has
a favor to ask you.

1192
01:28:29,518 --> 01:28:33,397
I want you to know I envy
Honest Goro

1193
01:28:34,022 --> 01:28:37,150
for having real pros like you.

1194
01:28:39,194 --> 01:28:44,032
Good pros make good supermarkets.

1195
01:28:44,950 --> 01:28:47,953
So, imagine my astonishment

1196
01:28:48,203 --> 01:28:51,790
when I heard that a Deputy Manager,
a woman,

1197
01:28:52,249 --> 01:28:55,794
is meddling in your affairs.

1198
01:28:56,378 --> 01:28:58,630
I started out like you.

1199
01:28:58,797 --> 01:29:02,176
I know exactly how you must feel.

1200
01:29:16,565 --> 01:29:17,691
How about it?

1201
01:29:18,734 --> 01:29:21,528
All of you, come and work at my store.

1202
01:29:23,530 --> 01:29:29,661
You mean all the workers abandon
Honest Goro?

1203
01:29:29,745 --> 01:29:30,787
That's right.

1204
01:29:31,914 --> 01:29:35,501
If all of us leave,
Honest Goro will fold.

1205
01:29:53,018 --> 01:29:54,311
When?

1206
01:29:54,811 --> 01:29:58,649
Mr. Mujina will let you know.

1207
01:29:59,983 --> 01:30:04,154
Until then. It's your job to round up
your staff.

1208
01:30:07,491 --> 01:30:11,245
Hello! I'm here to get meat scraps!

1209
01:30:31,807 --> 01:30:34,268
I must say, that suit you.

1210
01:30:36,228 --> 01:30:39,731
You look better. Better than
the real you.

1211
01:30:41,608 --> 01:30:42,776
Idiot.

1212
01:30:43,902 --> 01:30:46,655
Okay. Let's order five of each.

1213
01:30:46,780 --> 01:30:49,157
For the big battle at Xmas time.

1214
01:30:49,283 --> 01:30:52,160
Xmas sales, year-end bargains...
It'll be war!

1215
01:30:52,286 --> 01:30:54,204
Whether we win or lose...

1216
01:30:54,329 --> 01:30:56,206
Think only about the customers.

1217
01:30:56,331 --> 01:30:57,958
Yeah, you're right.

1218
01:31:04,840 --> 01:31:07,801
Come right away.

1219
01:31:07,885 --> 01:31:10,345
That meat DEA er and Chief are...

1220
01:31:10,470 --> 01:31:12,514
Well? Stealing the meat!

1221
01:31:39,833 --> 01:31:41,084
That bag?

1222
01:31:46,089 --> 01:31:47,090
Let go!

1223
01:31:49,384 --> 01:31:52,638
Thief! Thief!

1224
01:31:55,307 --> 01:31:57,226
Stop!

1225
01:32:11,740 --> 01:32:13,116
Stop!

1226
01:33:03,500 --> 01:33:07,588
Takechan, go to the entrance
and keep watch.

1227
01:33:48,754 --> 01:33:49,838
Give it back!

1228
01:33:49,963 --> 01:33:52,925
Let go! I said, let go!

1229
01:33:53,884 --> 01:33:55,427
Hey! you!

1230
01:34:31,463 --> 01:34:32,965
Hanako!

1231
01:34:38,387 --> 01:34:41,223
Wow! Goro! That's fantastic!

1232
01:34:41,348 --> 01:34:42,975
College judo team.

1233
01:34:43,058 --> 01:34:44,685
I'll pay for this tomorrow.

1234
01:34:44,810 --> 01:34:46,603
Okay. Is this it?

1235
01:34:57,155 --> 01:35:00,075
Goddamn fool! Ought to be ashamed!

1236
01:35:01,243 --> 01:35:05,747
Sorry about this. He threatened me
so I had to tell the truth.

1237
01:35:05,873 --> 01:35:08,584
You can go. I'll deal with you later.

1238
01:35:10,419 --> 01:35:12,212
Leave the damn thing here!

1239
01:35:15,174 --> 01:35:17,050
You criminal.

1240
01:35:17,134 --> 01:35:21,513
You may end up in jail. Naturally, you'll
never get a job again.

1241
01:35:22,264 --> 01:35:24,933
Please give me a chance...

1242
01:35:25,058 --> 01:35:27,227
Save the crap!

1243
01:35:27,352 --> 01:35:31,565
You must have been dealing in scum
for years.

1244
01:35:31,648 --> 01:35:35,652
Yeah? Well, what about the Manager?
He's dirtier than...

1245
01:35:35,777 --> 01:35:38,572
The Manager?

1246
01:35:38,655 --> 01:35:40,365
Well... uh... um...

1247
01:35:40,449 --> 01:35:45,746
Spill it. Or I'll turn
you over to the cops.

1248
01:35:46,705 --> 01:35:49,458
He's been getting kickbacks...

1249
01:35:50,417 --> 01:35:51,418
What?

1250
01:35:51,460 --> 01:35:53,962
When the top brass do it, so do...

1251
01:35:54,046 --> 01:35:57,966
Just shut up! Get out of here,
or I'll kill I you!

1252
01:35:59,176 --> 01:36:02,429
I'll let you know later what we decide.

1253
01:36:05,307 --> 01:36:07,434
Fire me if you dare.

1254
01:36:07,518 --> 01:36:09,186
Can't run this store without me.

1255
01:36:09,311 --> 01:36:11,522
We've got Take and Gorilla.

1256
01:36:13,857 --> 01:36:16,568
They know nothing about mixing meat!

1257
01:36:16,652 --> 01:36:18,195
They don't need to mix.

1258
01:36:18,320 --> 01:36:20,280
You'll lose your edge.

1259
01:36:21,657 --> 01:36:25,285
We don't want an edge. I want a decent
business!

1260
01:36:27,538 --> 01:36:30,999
The ground meat I bought here
looks funny.

1261
01:36:31,083 --> 01:36:33,085
You using some kind of drugs?

1262
01:36:33,168 --> 01:36:34,920
To prevent discoloring?

1263
01:36:35,003 --> 01:36:38,465
We're using no such things. Right?

1264
01:36:38,549 --> 01:36:45,722
I bought this yesterday. And it's still
the same color. Now that's fishy.

1265
01:36:53,313 --> 01:36:54,356
Why do you laugh?

1266
01:36:54,481 --> 01:36:57,401
What's so funny? Hey!

1267
01:36:58,527 --> 01:37:02,406
So, what's the joke?
Yeah, tell us.

1268
01:37:03,866 --> 01:37:04,992
Please excuse us.

1269
01:37:05,075 --> 01:37:09,913
But some stores grind days-old meat.
Now, that turns gray in no time.

1270
01:37:10,038 --> 01:37:15,502
We make ours with fresh meat,
so it hold its colors.

1271
01:37:16,879 --> 01:37:19,506
So this is the real ground beef.

1272
01:37:19,631 --> 01:37:21,550
The real thing.

1273
01:37:21,675 --> 01:37:23,635
It does have a nice color.

1274
01:37:24,720 --> 01:37:27,097
And I' I grind it for you on the spot.

1275
01:37:27,222 --> 01:37:29,641
I'll have some then. Okay.

1276
01:37:29,725 --> 01:37:31,518
Me too.

1277
01:37:32,102 --> 01:37:33,312
Well, what do you know!

1278
01:37:33,395 --> 01:37:34,813
Hello, how are you?

1279
01:37:39,735 --> 01:37:41,486
Hi, there!

1280
01:37:49,828 --> 01:37:55,876
You're shopping here for a change.

1281
01:37:56,001 --> 01:37:57,628
The green onions looked too good.

1282
01:37:57,753 --> 01:37:59,171
I'll use some in my sukiyaki, tonight.

1283
01:37:59,171 --> 01:38:02,382
I'm picking up things for curried rice.

1284
01:38:02,466 --> 01:38:03,800
Pork cutlets for me.

1285
01:38:03,926 --> 01:38:07,262
Hey, I made those! No kidding!

1286
01:38:08,305 --> 01:38:11,725
Doesn't it feel great to shop
at your own place?

1287
01:38:11,808 --> 01:38:13,602
Have fun!

1288
01:38:25,572 --> 01:38:28,825
What do you think I just saw?

1289
01:38:28,951 --> 01:38:29,451
Yeah, what?

1290
01:38:29,451 --> 01:38:31,870
The part-timers are shopping right here!

1291
01:38:33,330 --> 01:38:39,711
The part-timers are shopping right here!

1292
01:38:39,795 --> 01:38:40,546
So?

1293
01:38:40,629 --> 01:38:43,131
Oh, you're hopeless.

1294
01:38:43,257 --> 01:38:47,302
Those women represent our customers.

1295
01:38:47,427 --> 01:38:50,764
They've accepted this supermarket.

1296
01:38:51,390 --> 01:38:54,059
That's a milestone. Get it?

1297
01:38:54,142 --> 01:38:56,353
But the sales still aren't good.

1298
01:38:56,478 --> 01:38:59,606
They' I go up, you see.

1299
01:38:59,731 --> 01:39:04,361
You're right to push freshness.
I know we're right!

1300
01:39:08,365 --> 01:39:11,827
Hi, how are you?

1301
01:39:21,336 --> 01:39:22,754
Some croquettes?

1302
01:39:22,838 --> 01:39:27,467
Just fried and piping hot!

1303
01:39:27,593 --> 01:39:30,971
Full of ground beef.

1304
01:39:31,054 --> 01:39:34,016
80 yen each! Check 'em out, folks!

1305
01:39:34,099 --> 01:39:38,812
This is a cabbage, isn't it?

1306
01:39:38,896 --> 01:39:41,356
That's a lettuce, you wimp.

1307
01:39:41,481 --> 01:39:47,196
Today's young people! Their parents
should be horse-whipped.

1308
01:39:47,321 --> 01:39:49,239
Hi, how are you?

1309
01:39:49,740 --> 01:39:51,575
Our sales reached 4 million yen.

1310
01:39:52,034 --> 01:39:53,827
It's still way below par.

1311
01:39:53,952 --> 01:39:55,287
Be 5 million soon.

1312
01:39:55,370 --> 01:39:56,622
Hello, how are you doing?

1313
01:39:58,207 --> 01:40:04,296
Hey. Don't you feel the staff are more
motivated now?

1314
01:40:04,588 --> 01:40:09,051
Get your yellowtail sashimi here!

1315
01:40:09,134 --> 01:40:15,140
Straight from the harbor!

1316
01:40:15,432 --> 01:40:18,352
Everybody looks more alive.

1317
01:40:18,477 --> 01:40:20,187
The credit is yours.

1318
01:40:21,146 --> 01:40:25,317
Oh-oh. The sauce. What a mess!

1319
01:40:32,741 --> 01:40:37,037
So. Let's celebrate tonight,
just you and me?

1320
01:40:37,120 --> 01:40:39,206
No way. How come?

1321
01:40:39,289 --> 01:40:43,210
If I sleep with you, I'd be known
as your woman.

1322
01:40:43,293 --> 01:40:44,169
What's wrong?

1323
01:40:44,253 --> 01:40:47,714
How can the Boss's woman
keep working here?

1324
01:40:47,840 --> 01:40:50,551
Who'd give a damn?
No, I'm serious.

1325
01:40:50,634 --> 01:40:54,221
Everyone would resent me.

1326
01:40:54,847 --> 01:40:57,766
I'd hate to quit because of that.

1327
01:40:59,601 --> 01:41:02,104
Mujina. Sir!

1328
01:41:02,729 --> 01:41:04,565
We've got a problem.
What is it?

1329
01:41:04,648 --> 01:41:07,609
Sales at Honest Goro are going up.

1330
01:41:07,943 --> 01:41:11,530
The numbers of customers, money
spent by each of them...

1331
01:41:11,613 --> 01:41:15,868
Let them grow. We'll just take over
everything!

1332
01:41:20,497 --> 01:41:25,794
Bargains Galore Has come to us again

1333
01:41:26,170 --> 01:41:30,132
with their best offer yet:

1334
01:41:30,215 --> 01:41:33,594
The store and the property for
10 billion yen.

1335
01:41:33,677 --> 01:41:38,140
They' I also take all the employees.

1336
01:41:38,432 --> 01:41:40,058
Tempting, eh?

1337
01:41:40,142 --> 01:41:43,228
You can't be serious!

1338
01:41:43,437 --> 01:41:47,107
We'll look after you in our real estate
department.

1339
01:41:47,232 --> 01:41:51,570
If you are going to sell us off to
'Ga ore', fire me first.

1340
01:41:51,820 --> 01:41:52,821
Now, now.

1341
01:41:52,905 --> 01:41:55,365
No way I'd go into real estate.

1342
01:41:55,490 --> 01:42:01,747
I can't sell off my employees and run off
to save my own ass.

1343
01:42:01,830 --> 01:42:05,626
It's not as if you're really
selling them off.

1344
01:42:05,709 --> 01:42:13,717
They'd be better off working for a big
store like Galore!

1345
01:42:14,927 --> 01:42:18,847
Eat your words!

1346
01:42:18,972 --> 01:42:23,810
You know what a scam that place is!

1347
01:42:24,436 --> 01:42:28,065
It's true that our standard was
once very low.

1348
01:42:28,190 --> 01:42:31,026
But our people came to realize this.

1349
01:42:31,151 --> 01:42:34,488
We listened to the customers,
churned out new ideas.

1350
01:42:34,655 --> 01:42:39,117
Kept on trying harder... We are becoming
a 'real' supermarket.

1351
01:42:39,243 --> 01:42:41,620
We'll get our customers back.

1352
01:42:42,037 --> 01:42:46,041
At this rate, we' I become a 2-million-yen
business in two years.

1353
01:42:46,166 --> 01:42:49,962
And soon, we'll open more branches.

1354
01:42:50,045 --> 01:42:54,883
We'll be the goose that lays
the golden egg.

1355
01:42:55,217 --> 01:43:02,266
But you guys are so greedy for a quick kill.
You're trying to sell that goose for nothing!

1356
01:43:03,559 --> 01:43:07,604
At least give me until New Year's.

1357
01:43:07,896 --> 01:43:12,192
The Xmas and New Year's sales...
If we can't get the customers in,

1358
01:43:13,485 --> 01:43:14,820
okay, I'll give up.

1359
01:43:17,072 --> 01:43:21,702
So, please... think it over.

1360
01:43:25,372 --> 01:43:27,165
They turned me down!

1361
01:43:27,249 --> 01:43:29,376
Don't know what's good for 'em.

1362
01:43:29,459 --> 01:43:30,460
What now?

1363
01:43:30,919 --> 01:43:35,382
Just have to play rough.
Round up everyone

1364
01:43:38,635 --> 01:43:41,054
and get the hell outta Honest Goro.

1365
01:43:51,648 --> 01:43:53,150
Excuse me.

1366
01:43:58,614 --> 01:44:02,284
It's been a pleasure working for you.

1367
01:44:04,912 --> 01:44:05,787
What's this?

1368
01:44:05,913 --> 01:44:07,331
My resignation.

1369
01:44:08,332 --> 01:44:11,793
I'm switching to 'Bargains Galore'
Tomorrow.

1370
01:44:15,631 --> 01:44:21,261
Guys, soon Honest Goro will
go bankrupt.

1371
01:44:28,101 --> 01:44:32,231
I'll say it again.
Honest Goro is doomed.

1372
01:44:33,315 --> 01:44:36,068
It will be absorbed by Galore.

1373
01:44:36,818 --> 01:44:39,613
You'll all be out of jobs.

1374
01:44:41,490 --> 01:44:47,454
And you know how tough it is to find
another job, the way economy is right now.

1375
01:44:48,956 --> 01:44:55,587
However, I met with Galore's boss
a couple of days ago,

1376
01:44:57,422 --> 01:45:04,263
and asked him to take all those willing
to come with me.

1377
01:45:05,764 --> 01:45:12,688
He promised he would.

1378
01:45:16,108 --> 01:45:20,028
The majority of you have already
agreed to leave.

1379
01:45:26,159 --> 01:45:28,745
I'm giving you one last chance.

1380
01:45:28,871 --> 01:45:32,040
Come with me now.

1381
01:45:33,709 --> 01:45:37,462
Don't come begging to me
after they collapse.

1382
01:45:37,546 --> 01:45:39,339
It'll be too ate.

1383
01:45:40,215 --> 01:45:47,347
Those coming with me, step over here.

1384
01:46:01,820 --> 01:46:05,532
This is your last chance.

1385
01:46:06,074 --> 01:46:09,745
Those coming with me, over here now.

1386
01:46:13,498 --> 01:46:16,043
Wait! He's lying!

1387
01:46:21,173 --> 01:46:23,967
Nobody has decided to sell just yet.

1388
01:46:25,302 --> 01:46:31,433
The owners will decide after the results
are in from holiday sales.

1389
01:46:32,643 --> 01:46:38,357
There's still time for all of us to
pitch in and save Honest Goro.

1390
01:46:39,900 --> 01:46:41,235
Isn't that right?

1391
01:46:42,653 --> 01:46:44,196
She's absolutely right.

1392
01:46:46,406 --> 01:46:52,287
I did a little research on 'Ga ore'.

1393
01:46:54,206 --> 01:47:01,672
Frankly, their level is the same
as ours was a year ago!

1394
01:47:03,465 --> 01:47:09,555
Galore is a mere discounter of
poor-quality goods.

1395
01:47:12,975 --> 01:47:15,269
Have you ever been to the place?

1396
01:47:16,103 --> 01:47:18,856
They don't care about freshness.

1397
01:47:19,773 --> 01:47:24,278
And the people there aren't even
aware of it!

1398
01:47:24,945 --> 01:47:30,701
All they do is scream, 'Low prices'.

1399
01:47:33,996 --> 01:47:42,004
Because 'Cheap' is about all
they can say.

1400
01:47:46,175 --> 01:47:47,968
Isn't that pathetic?

1401
01:47:50,345 --> 01:47:54,725
And that's how you'll end up

1402
01:47:55,225 --> 01:47:57,477
if you go work for Galore.

1403
01:48:00,689 --> 01:48:08,447
You people have ideals.

1404
01:48:11,783 --> 01:48:14,578
Kiyochan's vegetables are a hit now.

1405
01:48:16,872 --> 01:48:21,210
Remember the rice ball fiasco?

1406
01:48:24,963 --> 01:48:29,176
Takechan, you haven't forgotten

1407
01:48:29,593 --> 01:48:32,679
how happy you made those women

1408
01:48:33,555 --> 01:48:35,265
with your fresh ground beef.

1409
01:48:37,726 --> 01:48:43,899
Shinchan, it must've been tough throwing
away your sashimi day after day.

1410
01:48:45,150 --> 01:48:50,989
But Honest Goro is turning into
a fantastic store.

1411
01:48:52,699 --> 01:48:55,536
You see, Galore is feeling threatened.

1412
01:48:55,661 --> 01:48:59,122
That's why they want to take over
and get rid of us.

1413
01:48:59,414 --> 01:49:02,084
So they can sell junk at higher prices.

1414
01:49:09,800 --> 01:49:13,971
I am staying right here. Even by myself.

1415
01:49:21,270 --> 01:49:24,231
I'll stay with you.

1416
01:49:24,356 --> 01:49:25,941
I'll stay with you, too.

1417
01:49:42,082 --> 01:49:45,711
I'm staying, too.

1418
01:49:46,253 --> 01:49:51,758
Thank you, Mitchan.

1419
01:49:52,801 --> 01:49:54,428
I'm not going either.

1420
01:49:56,013 --> 01:49:59,391
I don't care how big that other store is.

1421
01:50:00,225 --> 01:50:06,648
I'd rather die then work at a place
with vegetables that shitty.

1422
01:50:09,818 --> 01:50:13,197
Thank you, Kiyochan.

1423
01:50:37,429 --> 01:50:43,644
I'm retiring and starting my own
sashimi restaurant.

1424
01:50:44,561 --> 01:50:48,315
Good for you!

1425
01:50:53,362 --> 01:50:55,030
But before I do,

1426
01:50:55,864 --> 01:50:59,952
Got to teach these birdbrains
every damn thing about fish.

1427
01:51:02,746 --> 01:51:08,043
That'll be my parting present.

1428
01:51:09,878 --> 01:51:11,630
Thank you, Shinchan.

1429
01:51:19,346 --> 01:51:20,556
Chief!

1430
01:51:23,225 --> 01:51:24,351
Excuse me!

1431
01:51:31,859 --> 01:51:36,572
Are we ready for the toast?

1432
01:51:37,781 --> 01:51:40,534
To our new manager, cheers!

1433
01:52:01,013 --> 01:52:04,266
Manager!

1434
01:52:04,933 --> 01:52:07,895
Chief brought a truck to the delivery bay.

1435
01:52:08,020 --> 01:52:09,396
What's up? Stealing the...

1436
01:52:09,521 --> 01:52:12,024
Stealing what? All the meat!

1437
01:52:12,733 --> 01:52:17,446
We won't have anything left to sell
tomorrow. Hey, Hanako!

1438
01:52:24,578 --> 01:52:28,332
With nothing to sell, that'll break 'em.

1439
01:52:56,652 --> 01:52:59,613
It's a freezer! The meat'll freeze!

1440
01:53:00,072 --> 01:53:02,157
We haven't far to go.

1441
01:53:02,282 --> 01:53:07,538
Hey! Open it up!

1442
01:53:07,746 --> 01:53:09,081
Hanako!

1443
01:53:10,999 --> 01:53:13,627
Goro! Help!

1444
01:53:13,752 --> 01:53:14,837
Hanako!

1445
01:53:20,509 --> 01:53:21,969
Stop!

1446
01:53:27,391 --> 01:53:32,271
Whoa! Stop! Wait!

1447
01:53:36,859 --> 01:53:38,277
Please!

1448
01:53:44,408 --> 01:53:47,661
Someone's been kidnapped!
Follow that van!

1449
01:53:47,744 --> 01:53:48,745
Got ya.

1450
01:53:58,547 --> 01:54:01,675
A woman's locked inside.
She'll freeze to death!

1451
01:54:07,556 --> 01:54:09,516
Hang in there, Hanako.

1452
01:54:17,399 --> 01:54:21,486
Help me, Goro! Help!

1453
01:54:21,695 --> 01:54:22,821
Hanako!

1454
01:54:25,574 --> 01:54:27,242
Police? A kidnapping!

1455
01:54:27,367 --> 01:54:29,661
A woman's locked in a freezer van!

1456
01:54:29,745 --> 01:54:32,539
It's heading for the harbor!

1457
01:54:47,554 --> 01:54:48,555
Stop!

1458
01:54:51,683 --> 01:54:54,645
Help me. Goro!

1459
01:54:59,107 --> 01:55:00,817
Stop!

1460
01:55:02,069 --> 01:55:07,741
Hanako's in the freezer, stop!

1461
01:55:07,866 --> 01:55:09,243
Shut up!

1462
01:55:38,647 --> 01:55:40,023
Sorry!

1463
01:56:23,275 --> 01:56:24,651
That's the van!

1464
01:56:29,531 --> 01:56:32,743
Hear me? Pull over to the left now!

1465
01:56:42,503 --> 01:56:43,378
Uh-oh!

1466
01:56:43,504 --> 01:56:46,548
Hell. Didn't they say pull over?

1467
01:57:11,073 --> 01:57:12,282
Goro...

1468
01:57:16,161 --> 01:57:22,084
Hanako, don't die!

1469
01:58:22,269 --> 01:58:23,520
Stop!

1470
01:58:28,609 --> 01:58:30,944
I'll pay you back later...

1471
01:58:31,028 --> 01:58:34,698
Move up, move up!

1472
01:59:01,517 --> 01:59:02,935
Hanako!

1473
01:59:11,693 --> 01:59:15,239
Hanako...

1474
01:59:36,009 --> 01:59:37,052
Doctor.

1475
01:59:38,011 --> 01:59:39,972
She'll be fine now.

1476
01:59:40,556 --> 01:59:41,598
Oh, good.

1477
01:59:42,266 --> 01:59:49,022
Thanks to your husband's quick thinking.

1478
01:59:49,106 --> 01:59:51,775
You'll be okay. Quick what?

1479
01:59:51,859 --> 01:59:55,153
Your husband warmed you up
with his body.

1480
01:59:55,529 --> 01:59:56,738
His body?

1481
01:59:56,864 --> 02:00:02,369
He held you snug and then gave you
a warm bath...

1482
02:00:02,494 --> 02:00:04,246
Exactly what you needed.

1483
02:00:04,371 --> 02:00:06,915
College hiking club, y'know?

1484
02:00:07,374 --> 02:00:08,542
Bath?

1485
02:00:10,294 --> 02:00:12,045
You took my clothes off?

1486
02:00:12,379 --> 02:00:13,172
But...

1487
02:00:13,255 --> 02:00:17,843
Your husband gave you a bath.
He saved your life.

1488
02:00:17,968 --> 02:00:18,969
Husband?

1489
02:00:19,094 --> 02:00:22,097
A small I misunderstanding on their part.

1490
02:00:22,222 --> 02:00:26,018
Besides, your freshness wasn't as bad
as you thought.

1491
02:00:26,101 --> 02:00:29,229
Aw! Don't ever speak to me again!

1492
02:00:37,738 --> 02:00:43,076
There you are!

1493
02:00:45,370 --> 02:00:48,332
Your wife's asking for you.

1494
02:00:52,628 --> 02:00:59,134
Hey, I've got a great idea. Who do you
think these people are?

1495
02:01:00,344 --> 02:01:01,637
They're fishermen.

1496
02:01:02,429 --> 02:01:05,057
They fish even on New Year's day!

1497
02:01:05,140 --> 02:01:07,559
Hmm, so?

1498
02:01:07,643 --> 02:01:12,356
Aw... What do you mean, so?
Use your head!

1499
02:01:12,481 --> 02:01:16,777
Why don't we buy all the fish they catch
on New Year's day?

1500
02:01:16,985 --> 02:01:18,403
And?

1501
02:01:20,781 --> 02:01:23,242
Will you use your head?

1502
02:01:23,575 --> 02:01:25,577
On the New Year's day,

1503
02:01:25,702 --> 02:01:27,871
no store carries fish.

1504
02:01:27,955 --> 02:01:31,959
I get it! Our store
will be the only one...

1505
02:01:32,084 --> 02:01:34,419
with a boatfull of really fresh fish!

1506
02:01:34,503 --> 02:01:37,965
Hanako. You're one in a million!

Let's go over the greetings...

Hello, nice to see you.

Certainly, ma'am.

1512
02:02:50,245 --> 02:02:52,080
Just a moment, please.

Thank you for waiting.

A Happy New Year, everyone.

1516
02:03:16,605 --> 02:03:20,651
This New Year will be our best yet.
I feel it.

1517
02:03:20,734 --> 02:03:21,735
Yes, sir!

1518
02:03:21,860 --> 02:03:22,903
Hanako?

1519
02:03:27,241 --> 02:03:34,957
For the happiness of our customers and for
Honest Goros prosperity in the New Year...

1520
02:03:37,709 --> 02:03:39,461
Ready?

Hello there.

1524
02:04:39,313 --> 02:04:41,773
Where are the customers?

1525
02:04:41,940 --> 02:04:43,275
Find some! Yes, sir!

1526
02:04:47,154 --> 02:04:48,322
Er, where?

1527

Outside!
