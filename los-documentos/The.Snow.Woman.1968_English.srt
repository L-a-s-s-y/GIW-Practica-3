00:00:14,959 --> 00:00:18,730
Long ago, on the border between Mino
and Hida, where there is much snow,

2
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:25,494
there circulated among the people who
lived there a legend of the Snow Woman.

3
00:00:37,556 --> 00:00:39,777
They say that one evening,
during a strong snow-storm,

4
00:00:40,334 --> 00:00:44,260
the spirit of snow turned
into the terrible Snow Witch,

5
00:00:44,336 --> 00:00:49,425
and roamed the mountains and plains.
And if a man accidentally spied her,

6
00:00:49,545 --> 00:00:55,120
the Snow Woman immediately
took possession of him.

7
00:00:55,121 --> 00:00:59,082
Common villagers believe this legend.

24
00:03:15,312 --> 00:03:20,523
At last, at last, I have found it!

25
00:03:24,267 --> 00:03:28,000
This tree is remarkable!
It looks like a living being.

26
00:03:28,731 --> 00:03:33,090
Truly! It stood here for many years.

27
00:03:34,564 --> 00:03:36,676
And now... at last we found it
completely by accident.

28
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:39,966
Thanks! Thanks!

29
00:04:00,106 --> 00:04:04,594
Master, the weather is terrible.
What shall we do?

30
00:04:04,595 --> 00:04:07,632
This night will be very nasty.

31
00:04:28,474 --> 00:04:33,133
Let's stay here until the night
is over. It doesn't matter.

32
00:04:34,081 --> 00:04:36,100
But there will be much
to tell about after.

33
00:04:37,338 --> 00:04:41,695
It is a very happy evening,
we have found the splendid material
for which we searched so long.

34
00:04:43,362 --> 00:04:48,340
And the blizzard's howl sounds to me
as if it were a song of celebration.

35
00:04:49,962 --> 00:04:52,475
Yes, we will obtain the
permission of the Bailiff,

36
00:04:53,243 --> 00:04:55,695
and saw this tree as soon as possible.

37
00:04:57,352 --> 00:04:59,533
At last I will begin the work.

38
00:05:00,774 --> 00:05:07,672
My name will be known in Mino
mountains, and my work will remain
with the people for a long time.

39
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:15,415
And the people will remember for
thousands of years, that the goddess
Cannon was made by my hands.

40
00:11:08,322 --> 00:11:12,730
You... so young and so beautiful...

41
00:11:14,856 --> 00:11:20,278
I decided that I will not kill you.

42
00:11:21,393 --> 00:11:26,623
But in return, you mustn't tell
anyone about what you saw today!

43
00:11:28,852 --> 00:11:31,056
Even your most intimate people.

44
00:11:32,474 --> 00:11:37,464
Even relatives, children, or your wife.

45
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:44,153
If you say even one word -

46
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:48,561
I will kill you.

47
00:11:50,557 --> 00:11:54,074
Keep silent about this!

48
00:11:58,653 --> 00:12:01,389
Swear!

49
00:12:03,753 --> 00:12:06,292
Yes, yes, I swear!

50
00:13:06,038 --> 00:13:11,524
I will not talk! I will tell no one!
I will be silent, please  don't kill me!

51
00:13:27,607 --> 00:13:32,312
- What's happening?
Did you have a nightmare?
- It's all right.

52
00:13:34,108 --> 00:13:35,906
I slept badly.

53
00:13:36,151 --> 00:13:41,289
Are you hiding something from me?

54
00:13:41,409 --> 00:13:44,341
What nonsense! I have nothing to hide.

55
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:49,337
I hope so.
You see, I know you well.

56
00:13:50,484 --> 00:13:58,028
But I can't understand anyway,
what caused my husband's death,
and why you are sick since then.

57
00:13:58,397 --> 00:14:04,826
I just forgot to put wood on the fire,
and he froze in his sleep.

58
00:14:04,946 --> 00:14:09,421
The people who brought you home
the next day, said the same thing.

59
00:14:11,465 --> 00:14:15,179
Well, if you know nothing more,
then I should believe their words.

60
00:14:16,741 --> 00:14:19,367
Heave-ho! Heave-ho!

61
00:14:21,905 --> 00:14:28,614
The tree! They brought the tree!
The tree, which the master found!

62
00:14:28,734 --> 00:14:31,027
What? My husband?

63
00:14:33,808 --> 00:14:44,629
Heave-ho! Heave-ho!
Here is the village! At last!

64
00:14:44,749 --> 00:14:52,221
Hey, heave-ho! Heave-ho!
Heave-ho! Heave-ho!

65
00:14:56,142 --> 00:14:58,608
Here is the tree!
They brought it at last!

66
00:15:01,758 --> 00:15:03,780
Bonze!

67
00:15:09,353 --> 00:15:13,293
The Prior of the temple said,
today they brought that good material,

68
00:15:14,073 --> 00:15:16,356
which the deceased Shigetomo found.

69
00:15:16,476 --> 00:15:21,121
He said that you are the successor
of the master. Set about the work
on the goddess Cannon immediately.

70
00:15:22,387 --> 00:15:25,264
But I... What do you say...

71
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:28,992
I completely lack the experience
for such an important work.

72
00:15:29,027 --> 00:15:33,893
Never mind. The deceased Shigetomo
has always praised you.

73
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:41,428
And the Prior insists that despite
your youth, your work is noteworthy.

74
00:15:42,481 --> 00:15:44,360
Thank you for such complimentary words.

75
00:15:45,152 --> 00:15:49,688
Yosaku, if you refuse this job it would
be extremely impolite. You must agree.

76
00:15:58,236 --> 00:16:00,007
Yes, I will undertake this work,

77
00:16:01,493 --> 00:16:05,741
which the master desired so much to do,
although I am not worthy of this honor.

78
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:07,493
I have taken advantage of your roof.
Please excuse me.

79
00:17:12,517 --> 00:17:14,106
Oh, get out of the rain!

80
00:17:14,985 --> 00:17:17,800
If you stand under such intense rain,
you will be utterly drenched.

81
00:17:18,406 --> 00:17:20,078
Well, don't hesitate,
please, come inside.

82
00:17:20,198 --> 00:17:22,084
No, I don't wish to impose on you...

83
00:17:22,204 --> 00:17:25,666
Why? People shoud help each other
in situations like this.

84
00:17:26,112 --> 00:17:28,291
Let me open the door for you.

85
00:17:41,464 --> 00:17:46,920
It's an old house,
there is no need to hesitate.

86
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:50,819
Thank you very much for your care.
It is so unexpected...

87
00:17:51,289 --> 00:17:53,774
It is a spring rain already,
nevertheless it is cold.

88
00:17:55,065 --> 00:17:57,517
Here, please drink this hot beverage.

89
00:17:57,864 --> 00:18:01,455
No, thank you,
I will continue on my way soon.

90
00:18:05,458 --> 00:18:07,599
But you cannot go now, can you?

91
00:18:09,234 --> 00:18:11,135
Where are you headed?

92
00:18:12,001 --> 00:18:13,772
To the city of Gudze,
in the province of Katiman.

93
00:18:15,133 --> 00:18:17,214
So far?

94
00:18:18,031 --> 00:18:21,251
Such a young girl under such rain!

95
00:18:22,574 --> 00:18:26,586
I wish you only good things.
Please spend this night here.

96
00:18:31,465 --> 00:18:34,918
Mistress, this girl has gotten soaked.

97
00:18:35,611 --> 00:18:40,160
Oh, forgive me, you must change
into dry clothes immediately!

98
00:18:42,067 --> 00:18:43,603
Please, here you are!

99
00:18:57,850 --> 00:19:00,174
Here is clothing, if you please...

100
00:19:08,333 --> 00:19:14,067
Ah, you are so beautiful!
I look at you and envy you!

101
00:19:24,434 --> 00:19:26,477
It looks like the hand of
a living person!

102
00:19:28,434 --> 00:19:30,180
Is this the hand of the goddess Cannon?

103
00:19:30,468 --> 00:19:32,078
Just a sample.

104
00:19:33,329 --> 00:19:36,424
It is a very complicated work,
and I am very inexperienced,
so I must repeat it 10 times more.

105
00:19:38,737 --> 00:19:40,516
It turns out well!

106
00:19:42,354 --> 00:19:44,608
My master was an outstanding craftsman.

107
00:19:45,908 --> 00:19:47,927
The hand is very bad.

108
00:19:51,468 --> 00:19:53,586
It's beautiful.

109
00:19:55,097 --> 00:19:57,883
I would like to have
such beautiful hands.

110
00:20:00,468 --> 00:20:03,341
Your hands are beautiful!

111
00:20:07,426 --> 00:20:10,485
I was entrusted to carve the main
sacred statue for our local temple.

112
00:20:11,398 --> 00:20:13,771
To obtain this work is a great honor,
for any master of Buddhist statues.

113
00:20:14,849 --> 00:20:18,729
But I am not sure that I have the
ability for this. So I worry very much.

114
00:20:19,522 --> 00:20:22,778
Don't worry.
Surely, everything will be all right.

115
00:20:23,571 --> 00:20:25,534
You are very gifted.

116
00:20:26,128 --> 00:20:28,564
I undertook this work, risking my life,

117
00:20:29,307 --> 00:20:31,913
because my master could not make it,
but I...

118
00:20:33,498 --> 00:20:36,707
Surely, you will complete it!

119
00:20:39,097 --> 00:20:43,902
Thank you, I don't know why, but
it seems to me that I lack courage...

120
00:20:47,023 --> 00:20:49,661
It is late already. Good night.

121
00:20:50,635 --> 00:20:53,261
No. I would like to look more.

122
00:20:54,239 --> 00:20:56,468
If I will not disturb you...

123
00:20:57,907 --> 00:20:59,691
Of course not...

124
00:21:13,995 --> 00:21:18,260
Everything is all right now.
You saved me.

125
00:21:20,954 --> 00:21:23,121
Do not worry.

126
00:21:25,929 --> 00:21:28,035
Mistress, what is the matter?

127
00:21:29,496 --> 00:21:33,350
I felt heaviness in my sleep at night.

128
00:21:34,415 --> 00:21:39,513
But miss Yuki looked after me.
So everything is okay now.

129
00:21:40,065 --> 00:21:43,805
I see. Excuse me, I slept like a log.

130
00:21:44,622 --> 00:21:47,933
Never mind. You worked very hard,
and got very tired.

131
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:53,427
Miss Yuki's parents were doctors.

132
00:21:55,444 --> 00:21:59,842
- She recognized all my symptoms
right away. - Really?

133
00:22:00,927 --> 00:22:04,885
There is an excellent medicine for
this illness. I will go for it later.

134
00:22:06,073 --> 00:22:07,674
Where?

135
00:22:08,922 --> 00:22:12,365
This is an herb. I believe
it grows somewhere hereabout.

136
00:22:19,741 --> 00:22:24,496
Here is the herb. A medicine.
There is a lot of it here!

137
00:22:25,078 --> 00:22:27,877
Really. And here, and here.

138
00:22:42,839 --> 00:22:45,456
Miss Yuki. Are you in a hurry to leave?

139
00:22:54,598 --> 00:22:58,399
Couldn't you stay in our house,
until the mistress gets well?

140
00:23:00,034 --> 00:23:02,194
Someone is waiting for you, probably?

141
00:23:05,863 --> 00:23:09,615
Me... I have no one.

142
00:23:11,714 --> 00:23:14,872
Really? Neither do I.

143
00:23:16,556 --> 00:23:17,902
You too?

144
00:23:18,252 --> 00:23:20,119
I did not know my parents.

145
00:23:20,862 --> 00:23:25,010
My deceased master saved me
and raised me as his son.

146
00:23:26,162 --> 00:23:27,873
I see...

147
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:35,891
But as for you, miss Yuki...
Do you have a fiance?

148
00:23:40,861 --> 00:23:45,301
- Really?
- And have you already a bride?

149
00:23:45,709 --> 00:23:48,521
Nonsense! Who would marry me?

150
00:23:51,084 --> 00:23:52,954
Really?

151
00:23:56,313 --> 00:23:58,071
Miss Yuki!

152
00:24:22,532 --> 00:24:26,133
What impudence! I don't care if you are
just children, I'll show you no mercy!

153
00:24:27,863 --> 00:24:29,993
Bailiff!

154
00:24:30,284 --> 00:24:32,498
Children, what did you do?

155
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:34,427
Are these your children?

156
00:24:37,257 --> 00:24:39,114
They scattered logs!

157
00:24:40,245 --> 00:24:44,957
- It hurts! Ahhh... Forgive me, please!
- Such impudence!

158
00:24:45,586 --> 00:24:49,936
- Mistress!
- Take that!.. And that!!

159
00:24:51,014 --> 00:24:53,082
Hey, get out of here!

160
00:24:53,527 --> 00:24:54,942
Mistress!

161
00:24:55,272 --> 00:24:56,168
Who are you?

162
00:24:56,853 --> 00:25:01,101
I am Yosaku. I once asked you
for permission to fell a tree.
I am master Shigetomo's apprentice.

163
00:25:01,326 --> 00:25:04,051
- What? Master of Buddhist statues?
- Yes.

164
00:25:15,963 --> 00:25:19,814
Mistress! Mistress!

165
00:25:21,374 --> 00:25:22,959
My horse!

166
00:25:23,863 --> 00:25:25,485
Mistress!

167
00:25:28,219 --> 00:25:30,395
I will punish you later. Just wait!

168
00:25:31,455 --> 00:25:34,105
Go!

169
00:25:39,231 --> 00:25:41,476
I'm... dying...

170
00:25:41,957 --> 00:25:44,421
- Mistress!
- Hold on!

171
00:25:45,846 --> 00:25:52,985
Miss Yuki, your arrival here
was no accident.

172
00:25:54,943 --> 00:25:57,519
I beg you, take care of Yosaku!

173
00:25:59,024 --> 00:26:00,524
Yes.

174
00:26:02,567 --> 00:26:06,686
Yosaku will surely become master.

175
00:26:07,906 --> 00:26:13,267
But someone should help him.

176
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:20,511
Miss Yuki, please, marry Yosaku!

177
00:26:21,498 --> 00:26:23,740
Yes... But...

178
00:26:25,812 --> 00:26:27,915
I beg you!

179
00:26:36,494 --> 00:26:40,282
It's an imposition...
but if you wish...

180
00:26:42,155 --> 00:26:44,179
Thanks! Ah...

181
00:26:49,211 --> 00:26:52,907
- Mistress!
- Mistress!

182
00:26:56,429 --> 00:27:02,178
- What? The old woman died?
- Yes. You need not punish her now.

183
00:27:02,556 --> 00:27:04,953
It's enough! But what about the woman?

184
00:27:05,486 --> 00:27:07,628
- The woman?
- The woman.

185
00:27:07,748 --> 00:27:09,783
I ask you, what became of this girl?

186
00:27:10,588 --> 00:27:19,559
She married Yosaku, performing
the dying request of the old woman.

187
00:28:05,891 --> 00:28:07,860
Do you like me?

188
00:28:09,705 --> 00:28:12,678
Yes, I do.
Since the first time I saw you.

189
00:28:13,974 --> 00:28:15,435
And I do also...

190
00:28:18,277 --> 00:28:19,875
Really?

191
00:28:55,101 --> 00:28:56,550
Yuki...

192
00:28:57,578 --> 00:29:00,599
Why is your body so cold?

193
00:31:13,395 --> 00:31:15,798
Yuki? Yuki?

194
00:31:20,437 --> 00:31:24,850
Where did you disappear to?
Oh! Your face is turning blue!

195
00:31:26,108 --> 00:31:29,821
- I don't feel very well...
- What happened? Is everything okay?

196
00:31:30,502 --> 00:31:32,908
Yes... It is better already.

197
00:31:37,422 --> 00:31:40,023
- Let us return home.
- Yes... Let us return home.

198
00:31:40,593 --> 00:31:43,800
Are you all right?
Let me give you a hand.

199
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:28,016
Oh, it is the Bailiff!
What an unexpected visit!

200
00:33:28,610 --> 00:33:31,817
What happened?
Some pressing matter?

201
00:33:32,729 --> 00:33:35,367
As you know, I was invited into
the capital by the high court Official.

202
00:33:35,813 --> 00:33:38,265
I have arrived this morning.

203
00:33:38,748 --> 00:33:41,549
Fortunately, I met there this man.

204
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:43,949
Who is he?

205
00:33:45,299 --> 00:33:49,263
His name is Gyokei, he is a master of
Buddhist statues in the capital.

206
00:33:49,759 --> 00:33:53,821
He belongs to the school of Unkei.
He is a very famous master.

207
00:33:54,509 --> 00:33:56,243
Let me introduce myself. Gyokei.

208
00:33:58,767 --> 00:34:01,634
By the way, he was the one
I wish to talk to you about.

209
00:34:02,525 --> 00:34:06,290
I heard, your temple needed
the main sacred statue.

210
00:34:07,274 --> 00:34:12,796
Please entrust its production
to master sculptor Gyokei.

211
00:34:13,204 --> 00:34:16,206
I am very grateful for your proposal,

212
00:34:16,503 --> 00:34:21,717
but I have already entrusted it
to Yosaku, Shigetomo's apprentice.

213
00:34:22,187 --> 00:34:25,900
I understand! If Shigetomo made
the statue, it would be another story,

214
00:34:26,457 --> 00:34:28,426
but this is too great an honor
for an unknown youth.

215
00:34:28,546 --> 00:34:32,933
Besides that, I have heard that
five years have already passed since
you entrusted him with this work.

216
00:34:33,777 --> 00:34:36,375
Five years have passed already,
but he has done nothing!

217
00:34:36,685 --> 00:34:38,015
May I speak?

218
00:34:38,262 --> 00:34:42,956
I have heard that it requires 4-5 years
to dry the material for the statue.

219
00:34:43,439 --> 00:34:47,088
Yosaku is probably waiting
until the material is ready.

220
00:34:47,435 --> 00:34:48,902
I understand!

221
00:34:49,717 --> 00:34:55,513
But I say you entrusted an unknown
master with producing the main sacred
statue for the state temple.

222
00:34:59,283 --> 00:35:00,806
What will you do
if he does not finish it?

223
00:35:01,178 --> 00:35:06,738
He has not started to work yet,
so let Gyokei also do it.

224
00:35:07,465 --> 00:35:10,802
We will look at their works,
and select the best.

225
00:35:12,063 --> 00:35:14,024
Do you have any objections?

226
00:35:16,662 --> 00:35:19,622
Well, it sounds very convincing.
I will agree.

227
00:35:30,811 --> 00:35:33,696
I am so happy!
Because I've got a good wife.

228
00:35:36,086 --> 00:35:37,574
I feel the same about you.

229
00:35:38,812 --> 00:35:40,843
Also, you are a marvelous mother.

230
00:35:42,651 --> 00:35:45,426
I hope... my son also thinks so...

231
00:35:45,986 --> 00:35:51,533
You are a good mother. Moreover you are
still as beautiful as you were before.

232
00:36:19,009 --> 00:36:22,868
Gyokei, he is your competitor.

233
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:28,914
Yosaku, Gyokei is a very famous master.

234
00:36:30,536 --> 00:36:33,645
We have decided just now
that he will also produce
a main sacred statue for the temple.

235
00:36:34,709 --> 00:36:40,141
But this work was entrusted
to you, wasn't it? Show us
what you are capable of.

236
00:36:54,408 --> 00:36:56,514
- This woman...
- What?

237
00:36:57,554 --> 00:37:01,179
I've hunted for women in the capital
for five years, but among them there
was none to compare with her.

238
00:37:02,492 --> 00:37:04,832
She is even more beautiful
than she was before.

239
00:37:09,867 --> 00:37:13,854
The Bailiff supports Gyokei.

240
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:33,144
But I will not lose to him!
I have changed in these five years.

241
00:37:41,108 --> 00:37:46,157
Now, now, near the small
brook behind the house,

242
00:37:47,247 --> 00:37:51,991
A snake lived before,
and a tortoise lives now.

243
00:37:53,595 --> 00:37:59,056
A common tortoise,
but it steals people.

244
00:37:59,328 --> 00:38:04,727
Yesterday it took four people,

245
00:38:05,109 --> 00:38:09,999
and today - five more.
A family of nine people in all.

246
00:38:10,828 --> 00:38:12,822
And these stolen people disappeared...

247
00:38:13,721 --> 00:38:16,211
Taro doesn't sing!
Don't you know this song?

248
00:38:17,630 --> 00:38:18,856
Then don't bother us!

249
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:21,890
Oh oh! His mom!
She will punish us. Let's run!

250
00:38:26,787 --> 00:38:28,422
Taro.

251
00:38:30,310 --> 00:38:35,628
Everything is okay, your mom is here.
Are you injured?

252
00:38:35,863 --> 00:38:38,786
Mom, teach me to sing this song!

253
00:38:39,819 --> 00:38:42,036
You are too young,
it is difficult for you!

254
00:38:42,854 --> 00:38:46,173
- No. Teach me!
- Will you be able to memorize it?

255
00:38:46,519 --> 00:38:47,733
- Yes.
- Yes?

256
00:38:49,478 --> 00:38:55,559
Now, now...

257
00:38:56,438 --> 00:39:09,549
near the small brook behind the house
a snake lived before,
and a tortoise lives now.

258
00:39:10,506 --> 00:39:16,921
A common tortoise.
But it steals people.

259
00:39:17,255 --> 00:39:29,303
Yesterday it took four people,
and today - five.

260
00:39:30,091 --> 00:39:43,116
A family of nine people at all.
And these stolen people disappeared...

261
00:39:43,384 --> 00:39:48,607
Now, now, now!

262
00:39:50,419 --> 00:39:52,001
Mom!

263
00:40:08,445 --> 00:40:11,702
You must win certainly,
otherwise I will lose my honor.

264
00:40:12,928 --> 00:40:15,179
You are the famous Gyokei.
You produce such a splendid statue,

265
00:40:15,525 --> 00:40:17,938
Yosaku won't be be able to compete with
you, even if he stands on his head.

266
00:40:17,939 --> 00:40:21,724
Villagers usually know
nothing of high society.

267
00:40:22,108 --> 00:40:25,811
Yes, that is so. They are like
the frogs that live in the well.

268
00:40:26,356 --> 00:40:30,718
Yosaku competes with you,
but there are boundaries,
and he does not know his place.

269
00:40:30,941 --> 00:40:35,134
It seems to me, he is poor, and has too
low a position for this kind of work.

270
00:40:36,050 --> 00:40:40,460
But he is very self-confident. By the
way, his wife doesn't match him either.

271
00:40:42,912 --> 00:40:44,988
Don't worry, everything will be ok.

272
00:40:54,288 --> 00:41:03,786
It is unfair! Gyokei has apprentices,
but you have to do everything yourself.

273
00:41:06,095 --> 00:41:08,807
Yosaku! Is Yosaku home?

274
00:41:11,606 --> 00:41:13,347
Oh, Official!

275
00:41:18,809 --> 00:41:20,216
What are you doing?!

276
00:41:21,651 --> 00:41:25,073
We are arresting him for
cutting down a tree on the land
of the Bailiff. Do not resist!

277
00:41:25,321 --> 00:41:28,444
This is unbelievable! He gave me
permission to cut down the tree!

278
00:41:28,564 --> 00:41:31,731
Shut up! The Bailiff says
he knew nothing about it.

279
00:41:32,115 --> 00:41:34,035
What are you waiting for?
Take him away!

280
00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:36,784
Wait!

281
00:41:37,304 --> 00:41:42,715
My husband obtained an order
from the state temple!

282
00:41:42,835 --> 00:41:45,666
He must carry out this work!
You cannot take him away!

283
00:41:45,786 --> 00:41:51,166
We will take him away, regardless.
Take him!

284
00:41:51,706 --> 00:41:52,887
Wait!

285
00:41:53,898 --> 00:41:57,043
The Bailiff is a merciful person.

286
00:41:58,789 --> 00:42:02,107
If you want to save your husband,
you should serve the Bailiff.

287
00:42:02,227 --> 00:42:03,264
What?

288
00:42:03,384 --> 00:42:08,409
The Bailiff likes you.
You will obtain glory and wealth.

289
00:42:09,015 --> 00:42:10,291
Villain!

290
00:42:10,701 --> 00:42:13,643
What? You don't accept? Well, fine!

291
00:42:14,472 --> 00:42:16,816
Then pay me the penalty for illegally
felling the tree: three gold coins.

292
00:42:17,051 --> 00:42:18,637
What did you say?

293
00:42:18,872 --> 00:42:21,595
I will sell you this tree
for three gold coins.

294
00:42:22,858 --> 00:42:29,399
But if not, we will take away Yuki, and
she will not return while she lives.

295
00:42:32,855 --> 00:42:35,257
- I will pay!
- Yuki!

296
00:42:35,785 --> 00:42:37,424
You will pay?

297
00:42:38,929 --> 00:42:44,494
Well, we will give you
five days, okay? Five days!

298
00:42:45,188 --> 00:42:46,859
Yes, that is fine.

299
00:42:47,193 --> 00:42:49,869
If you do not pay in five days...

300
00:42:51,423 --> 00:42:54,076
The Bailiff will be waiting
for you impatiently...

301
00:42:57,432 --> 00:42:59,178
Five days, five days...

302
00:43:12,746 --> 00:43:15,656
You... How could you make this promise?

303
00:43:17,340 --> 00:43:21,507
This is illegal... How can such
unscrupulous people live in this world!

304
00:43:21,903 --> 00:43:24,272
Yes, it is illegal, but the Bailiff
has a higher position than we have.

305
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:27,304
But isn't there someone
above the Bailiff?

306
00:43:28,321 --> 00:43:31,925
The Bailiff has a patron.

307
00:43:33,064 --> 00:43:35,236
He occupies an important position
in Mino city.

308
00:43:36,422 --> 00:43:39,889
I see... Patron...

309
00:43:42,115 --> 00:43:46,474
You can't personally present
an application! You can just pass it
through the Bailiff.

310
00:43:46,896 --> 00:43:51,047
But I can't. That is why I am here
in person. Please, allow me!

311
00:43:51,404 --> 00:43:54,141
It is impossible!
The master is away now.

312
00:43:55,032 --> 00:44:00,651
Then allow me to give it to his wife.
I think we will understand each other.

313
00:44:01,171 --> 00:44:06,341
Impossible, impossible! Madam is busy,
because her child suddenly became ill!

314
00:44:07,053 --> 00:44:07,978
Child?

315
00:44:08,331 --> 00:44:11,870
Can you cure him?

316
00:44:14,483 --> 00:44:17,493
If something happens to him
before the Master returns...

317
00:44:18,001 --> 00:44:21,357
I... I cannot live!

318
00:44:26,973 --> 00:44:31,159
May I report? There is a woman
before our gates, who says
she is the daughter of doctors.

319
00:44:31,279 --> 00:44:33,772
She asks permission to see the child.

320
00:44:47,251 --> 00:44:49,257
This way, please.

321
00:44:55,729 --> 00:44:58,404
Will you be able to cure him?
Will my child get well?

322
00:44:59,873 --> 00:45:03,043
I have a child the same age as yours.

323
00:45:03,328 --> 00:45:05,347
I relate to your misfortune as
if it were my own.

324
00:45:06,193 --> 00:45:08,794
I will save him,
even at the cost of my life!

325
00:45:09,351 --> 00:45:12,249
Thank you! I trust you.

326
00:45:21,336 --> 00:45:24,010
She is only a woman!
She is not a specialist in this field,
and she will not be able to cure him!

327
00:45:24,283 --> 00:45:28,165
We were also unable...
Even though we have tested
all possible means and methods.

328
00:45:28,285 --> 00:45:29,564
It is very difficult
to cure this illness.

329
00:45:29,787 --> 00:45:33,430
I've never seen
such a terrible fever in this age.

330
00:45:33,653 --> 00:45:35,535
If we could stop his fever,
it would save him.

331
00:45:47,929 --> 00:46:01,607
Now, now, near the small brook
behind the house a snake lived before,

332
00:46:01,727 --> 00:46:12,822
and a tortoise lives now...

333
00:48:21,494 --> 00:48:26,075
When did you return? Where did you go?

334
00:48:28,666 --> 00:48:31,845
You...
Why do you look so pale?

335
00:48:33,914 --> 00:48:37,731
If I can cure the child of the patron,
then I will obtain a reward.

336
00:48:38,857 --> 00:48:42,322
- Therefore you...
- I will cure him for sure!

337
00:48:43,622 --> 00:48:46,743
Now I cannot care for you, but,
be patient a little, please.

338
00:48:47,904 --> 00:48:51,234
I am okay. I am okay.
But you are so pale...

339
00:48:51,495 --> 00:48:55,074
Don't worry. It is because of the work.

340
00:49:14,155 --> 00:49:19,171
I have to go now...
Care for Taro, please.

341
00:49:27,109 --> 00:49:30,975
I cooked dinner for you.

342
00:49:36,817 --> 00:49:39,591
Yuki!

343
00:51:00,941 --> 00:51:05,202
- Where is your wife?
- She went out.

344
00:51:06,192 --> 00:51:08,434
And you let her go?

345
00:51:11,425 --> 00:51:13,914
Well, good.
You have now only three days.

346
00:51:14,818 --> 00:51:17,852
If you do not pay,
you know what will happen.

347
00:51:18,645 --> 00:51:20,332
Yes, I know.

348
00:51:20,452 --> 00:51:22,256
Well, that's good.

349
00:51:23,334 --> 00:51:29,796
This is your goddess?! Poor work.

350
00:51:30,345 --> 00:51:32,268
Looks like a doll!

351
00:51:33,057 --> 00:51:39,937
You will not be able to win. You are
just the frog, that lives in the well.

352
00:51:40,829 --> 00:51:46,847
I repeat. Three days. Is that clear?

353
00:52:49,504 --> 00:52:51,622
He arrived! He arrived!

354
00:53:00,051 --> 00:53:04,400
Wife! Is it true that our son
is at death's door?
Does he still breathe? Is he alive?

355
00:53:04,830 --> 00:53:08,184
- Yes.
- Oh, thank goodness! He is alive!

356
00:53:12,146 --> 00:53:14,410
Son!

357
00:53:17,077 --> 00:53:18,688
Son!

358
00:53:21,393 --> 00:53:23,449
- Sir!
- Son!

359
00:53:23,750 --> 00:53:28,035
- So good, so good!
- What happened?

360
00:53:29,954 --> 00:53:31,738
Everything is all right.

361
00:53:33,470 --> 00:53:39,142
She saved our son, when even
the doctors proved powerless.

362
00:53:40,579 --> 00:53:42,354
Thank you so much for saving our child.

363
00:53:42,474 --> 00:53:45,128
Thank you!
I am so grateful that you saved him!

364
00:53:46,032 --> 00:53:47,940
Please, accept this reward
as the sign of my gratitude!

365
00:53:51,244 --> 00:53:55,390
Gyokei sad he will deliver the statue
to the temple tomorrow.

366
00:53:56,814 --> 00:53:58,448
Tomorrow?

367
00:53:59,030 --> 00:54:01,881
But what about you?
Is it not ready yet?

368
00:54:02,817 --> 00:54:07,818
I have almost finished, but...

369
00:54:10,238 --> 00:54:15,036
I still cannot do the face...

370
00:54:15,761 --> 00:54:17,631
What? The face?

371
00:54:18,287 --> 00:54:21,569
I racked my brains,
but I can devise nothing.

372
00:54:22,300 --> 00:54:24,785
Yosaku, what are you saying?

373
00:54:25,467 --> 00:54:27,692
The Bailiff requires
that you present your work.

374
00:54:28,051 --> 00:54:31,544
I know. That is why I...

375
00:54:44,665 --> 00:54:52,323
- Yosaku, What happened?
- No, I can't...

376
00:54:58,607 --> 00:55:01,282
- Oh, Bailiff.
- Yosaku!

377
00:55:05,207 --> 00:55:08,804
You have not forgotten?
Pay the three gold coins!

378
00:55:09,869 --> 00:55:11,120
But I...

379
00:55:12,083 --> 00:55:14,782
You can't? At last do you understand?

380
00:55:15,983 --> 00:55:17,407
- Take him!
- Aye!

381
00:55:18,993 --> 00:55:24,541
- What are you doing?
Yosaku has important work!
- That is not important.

382
00:55:43,554 --> 00:55:50,220
- You?!
- Take the money and depart, please.

383
00:56:07,626 --> 00:56:09,434
Yuki!

384
00:56:22,359 --> 00:56:23,796
Taro!

385
00:56:25,988 --> 00:56:31,572
- Forgive me. I will never leave
you again. - Don't leave me again!

386
00:56:32,654 --> 00:56:33,991
Of course not.

387
00:56:34,225 --> 00:56:38,649
But then other men will come
to take away my father.

388
00:56:39,909 --> 00:56:43,637
No. No one will take him away...

389
00:56:45,482 --> 00:56:48,108
Your dear father...

390
00:56:52,517 --> 00:56:54,721
That is it! The face!

391
00:56:56,975 --> 00:56:58,224
My face?

392
00:56:58,344 --> 00:57:02,311
Now I know how to make
the face of goddess. Here it is!

393
00:57:25,176 --> 00:57:28,107
This work is remarkable.

394
00:57:29,754 --> 00:57:32,380
We expected it from a master
known in all of Japan!

395
00:57:36,681 --> 00:57:38,108
Don't you like it?

396
00:57:39,901 --> 00:57:42,229
Look at her face attentively.

397
00:57:45,963 --> 00:57:51,288
In my opinion the face, which shines
of gold, is too bright.

398
00:57:51,938 --> 00:57:55,945
Really, both bright, and beautiful.

399
00:57:56,628 --> 00:57:57,650
Yes!

400
00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:01,628
That's fine, but it is not enough.

401
00:58:02,420 --> 00:58:06,631
It needs something more.

402
00:58:07,293 --> 00:58:09,361
Something more? What can that be?

403
00:58:11,940 --> 00:58:15,791
- Compassionate heart.
- Compassionate heart?

404
00:58:16,608 --> 00:58:22,997
Look at her face attentively.
Do you see compassion in her eyes?

405
00:58:31,421 --> 00:58:34,595
It's a pity, but it's impossible
to pray to such an image.

406
00:58:45,646 --> 00:58:55,594
- Tell Yosaku, I am awaiting his work.
- Certainly, I will tell him.

407
00:59:27,466 --> 00:59:33,249
Yuki! Yuki! Let's go
to the holiday ritual. Get ready!

408
00:59:33,369 --> 00:59:35,057
To the holiday ritual?

409
00:59:35,678 --> 00:59:37,486
In no way I can imagine eyes
for the goddess.

410
00:59:38,526 --> 00:59:42,014
My last chance is to ask
the gods for help. Let us go together.

411
00:59:43,414 --> 00:59:45,445
Yes... But...

412
00:59:46,255 --> 00:59:49,859
I heard, the Prior said the goddess
must have a compassionate gaze.

413
00:59:56,939 --> 00:59:59,217
But I cannot visualize this gaze.

414
01:00:00,592 --> 01:00:03,973
Apparently,
I need to ask the gods for help.

415
01:00:05,137 --> 01:00:06,540
Yes.

416
01:00:08,878 --> 01:00:14,968
I have almost finished my work.
If you will also come,
let us ask the gods together.

417
01:00:17,051 --> 01:00:19,664
Yes. Let us go together.

418
01:00:22,679 --> 01:00:27,264
And let us also bring Taro.
Taro! Taro!

419
01:00:56,344 --> 01:00:59,970
- Bubbles in the boiling water!
- Taro! Taro!

420
01:01:53,606 --> 01:01:54,993
Where is Mom?

421
01:03:02,541 --> 01:03:05,014
At last, my desire will be carried out.

422
01:03:10,280 --> 01:03:15,810
Don't be afraid. You are even more
beautiful when you are afraid.

423
01:03:23,458 --> 01:03:30,862
You have such white skin.
I've never seen a woman with such skin.

424
01:03:34,488 --> 01:03:37,163
I have dreamed so long
of undressing you!

425
01:03:53,973 --> 01:03:57,634
Do you tremble? It's very nice!

426
01:04:06,437 --> 01:04:11,081
Thus, remove your kimono and show me
your beautiful skin! Well?

427
01:04:19,293 --> 01:04:23,318
Do you cry? You shouldn't.

428
01:05:12,814 --> 01:05:14,845
You! You!

429
01:05:30,673 --> 01:05:32,142
Snow Woman!

430
01:05:34,059 --> 01:05:39,892
I must kill anyone
who has seen my true appearance.

431
01:05:52,842 --> 01:05:58,985
I am guilty! I am guilty! I... I...

432
01:06:11,243 --> 01:06:16,518
- Where is Mom?
- Well, probably she has already
returned home.

433
01:06:17,100 --> 01:06:18,916
Yes. She is probably already home.

434
01:06:30,034 --> 01:06:32,288
Sir! Sir!

435
01:07:00,442 --> 01:07:02,807
Snow Woman!

436
01:07:43,019 --> 01:07:45,100
Mom returned!

437
01:07:47,069 --> 01:07:50,115
Have you finally returned?
We searched for you so long.

438
01:07:54,856 --> 01:07:57,011
Mom, where have you been?

439
01:07:59,624 --> 01:08:02,138
Mom, What happened?

440
01:08:03,084 --> 01:08:07,864
What happened, Yuki? Yuki!

441
01:08:09,721 --> 01:08:11,071
Yuki!

442
01:08:25,148 --> 01:08:27,996
Today I must finish my work
at all cost.

443
01:08:33,184 --> 01:08:35,810
But I can't.
Because I see a dark shadow.

444
01:08:37,140 --> 01:08:42,418
- Shadow?
- Why does this shadow follow me?

445
01:08:44,381 --> 01:08:47,565
You see, I have almost
finished everything...

446
01:08:52,744 --> 01:08:55,447
-  The Bailiff has been killed!
- They say his servants are also dead!

447
01:08:55,567 --> 01:08:57,519
This was a strange death!

448
01:08:58,484 --> 01:09:01,754
Yuki. They said the Bailiff
has been killed.

449
01:09:02,187 --> 01:09:05,291
What? I did not catch...

450
01:09:05,613 --> 01:09:11,648
No, I heard well. They said
that the servants are also killed.
Let us go and look.

451
01:09:17,506 --> 01:09:22,673
It is not necessary to look. I have
already seen everything with my eyes.

452
01:09:22,674 --> 01:09:26,075
Really? Who killed the Bailiff?

453
01:09:27,635 --> 01:09:30,361
I saw you five years ago.

454
01:09:31,021 --> 01:09:33,061
What are you saying to my wife?

455
01:09:33,546 --> 01:09:36,320
You are a ghost!

456
01:09:36,698 --> 01:09:38,865
I recognized you that previous time.

457
01:09:41,279 --> 01:09:44,071
And I have seen you again last evening.

458
01:09:44,923 --> 01:09:49,388
You killed the Bailiff
in the little house near the temple.

459
01:09:50,691 --> 01:09:54,004
It was not a simple death.

460
01:09:55,672 --> 01:09:58,371
It was done by a ghost.

461
01:09:59,615 --> 01:10:01,801
You did it!

462
01:10:03,228 --> 01:10:05,061
Vile ghost!

463
01:10:11,084 --> 01:10:15,776
Shaman! I will not allow
such violence in my house! Get out!

464
01:10:17,572 --> 01:10:20,308
It is your ghosty wife who must leave!

465
01:10:20,680 --> 01:10:24,158
- Ghost?
- Yes! I will prove it to you!

466
01:10:25,508 --> 01:10:30,891
There is a scar on her arm
from the boiling water I splashed
on her five years ago. Look!

467
01:10:33,753 --> 01:10:41,551
Hey! Get out! Get out! I will not spare
you despite your being a shaman!

468
01:10:44,283 --> 01:10:47,047
Traitor!

469
01:10:59,797 --> 01:11:01,122
Yuki!

470
01:11:04,115 --> 01:11:06,951
Don't be afraid! I will not allow
even one finger to touch you!

471
01:11:09,527 --> 01:11:15,257
You are my only wife.
And Taro's dear mother.

472
01:11:18,465 --> 01:11:21,841
No one can break our happiness!

473
01:11:26,286 --> 01:11:32,616
Yuki, it seems to me,
that my soul was cleansed just now,

474
01:11:34,564 --> 01:11:36,960
and I can complete the work.

475
01:11:37,257 --> 01:11:38,928
- Really?
- Yes.

476
01:12:00,705 --> 01:12:04,791
But this dark shadow
remains nevertheless...

477
01:12:12,839 --> 01:12:14,821
- Yuki!
- Yes.

478
01:12:16,245 --> 01:12:17,644
Yuki.

479
01:12:20,071 --> 01:12:24,201
The shaman said that you are a ghost.
I do not believe this.

480
01:12:25,588 --> 01:12:28,248
She also said there is a five-year old
scar on your arm,

481
01:12:29,065 --> 01:12:32,037
but I do not believe
in such nonsense either.

482
01:12:36,433 --> 01:12:41,693
But I recalled an event just now,
which occurred before our wedding.

483
01:12:46,750 --> 01:12:53,820
When I look at your kind face,

484
01:12:54,492 --> 01:12:58,211
I can't believe it ever
happened at all.

485
01:12:58,651 --> 01:13:03,840
But I still fear, to recall
that terrible evening.

486
01:13:06,230 --> 01:13:10,570
Yuki, I have one very bad memory,

487
01:13:11,449 --> 01:13:13,455
which I have never told anyone about.

488
01:13:14,707 --> 01:13:17,481
It was five years ago.

489
01:13:18,608 --> 01:13:22,806
There was a terrible
snow-storm that night.

490
01:13:26,088 --> 01:13:31,175
I saw the terrible Snow Woman,
who killed my master.

491
01:13:39,520 --> 01:13:41,238
Yuki...

492
01:13:42,754 --> 01:13:46,069
It was me.

493
01:13:48,360 --> 01:13:50,180
You?

494
01:13:51,447 --> 01:13:55,183
Despite everything,
you finally spoke of it.

495
01:13:57,969 --> 01:14:03,443
You shouldn't have done that.

496
01:14:05,975 --> 01:14:10,559
For all these years, I have prayed
for your silence so many times.

497
01:14:16,077 --> 01:14:17,616
I...

498
01:14:18,668 --> 01:14:24,268
Since becoming your wife,
I learned human happiness.

499
01:14:25,544 --> 01:14:27,692
And when Taro was born, we lived
happily together, the three of us.

500
01:14:29,686 --> 01:14:35,283
And I prayed only about that,
not to lose this happiness.

501
01:14:38,077 --> 01:14:40,108
But finally you...

502
01:14:50,264 --> 01:14:54,099
You talked about this!

503
01:15:22,032 --> 01:15:24,854
Yuki!

504
01:15:25,532 --> 01:15:30,576
I must kill you.

505
01:15:38,235 --> 01:15:41,550
You have broken your promise!

506
01:15:42,402 --> 01:15:45,976
I will kill you.

507
01:16:58,754 --> 01:17:03,292
Take care of Taro now instead of me!

508
01:17:04,344 --> 01:17:08,589
And complete your work,
and let it be excellent.

509
01:17:24,981 --> 01:17:26,497
Yuki...

510
01:17:38,850 --> 01:17:40,571
Mom!

511
01:17:44,707 --> 01:17:45,642
Yuki!

512
01:17:48,797 --> 01:18:05,906
Mom! Where are you going?
Don't leave! Mom! Mom!

513
01:18:13,821 --> 01:18:17,142
Oh! Compassionate gaze...

514
01:18:20,982 --> 01:18:24,221
Mom!

515
01:18:36,561 --> 01:18:52,901
Mom! Mom! Don't leave!
Don't leave! Mom! Mom!
