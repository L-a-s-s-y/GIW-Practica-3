KRISTAL FILM PRESENTS
A FILM BY JOE D'AMATO

2
00:00:13,096 --> 00:00:20,062
IMAGES IN A CONVENT

3
00:02:03,915 --> 00:02:07,294
THIS MOVIE IS FREELY ADAPTED FROM THE
NOVEL "LA RELIGIEUSE" BY DENIS DIDEROT

4
00:02:08,337 --> 00:02:10,964
Did you pick the fruit, Cesco?

5
00:02:11,548 --> 00:02:13,216
His Eminence will be here soon.

6
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:19,139
I'm sorry, Sister Marta,
but it's happened again.

7
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:21,725
It was him.

8
00:02:29,483 --> 00:02:32,861
Nonsense. I don't want to hear you talk
about these stupid superstitions again.

9
00:02:34,237 --> 00:02:35,155
Yes.

10
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:37,574
You better go now.
They're coming.

11
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:51,672
I'm sorry, Your Eminence, but we don't
hear much about the outside world here.

12
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:56,301
Wise words from a wise
woman, Mother Superior.

13
00:02:56,718 --> 00:02:59,054
I'm aware I'm making
a difficult request.

14
00:02:59,763 --> 00:03:03,600
Countess Isabella's father
was a pious, righteous man.

15
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:11,358
Shortly before passing, he asked me to
protect her from her uncle, Don Ascanio.

16
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:14,069
People say Ascanio is a
ruthless individual.

17
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,280
He's even worse than his
reputation, actually.

18
00:03:17,823 --> 00:03:18,990
A corrupt, morally broken man.

19
00:03:19,825 --> 00:03:22,035
Yet, young Isabella adores him.

20
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:26,039
Your Eminence, are you
afraid he might corrupt her?

21
00:03:27,082 --> 00:03:29,334
We're still in time
to save her soul.

22
00:03:30,377 --> 00:03:31,712
That's why I brought her here.

23
00:03:32,963 --> 00:03:35,882
I will do what you
ask, Your Eminence.

24
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:39,636
I know your every action is
aimed at helping others.

25
00:03:40,804 --> 00:03:41,972
Thank you, Mother Superior.

26
00:03:42,514 --> 00:03:44,683
Isabella is a proud,
imperious woman,

27
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:49,980
but I hope you'll convince
her to take the vows.

28
00:03:50,814 --> 00:03:51,940
Against her will?

29
00:03:52,524 --> 00:03:54,526
- With no real vocation?
- Well...

30
00:03:55,444 --> 00:03:57,028
It would offend our
Lord, Your Eminence.

31
00:03:57,654 --> 00:03:59,948
She would only become part of
a minor order, Sister Angela.

32
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:05,162
But it would protect her from Don Ascanio's
attempts to take her away from here.

33
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:09,791
We'll revoke her vows as soon
as things will calm down.

34
00:04:10,834 --> 00:04:14,045
She'll be released from
her new religious life.

35
00:04:14,755 --> 00:04:15,797
Assuming she wishes so.

36
00:04:17,007 --> 00:04:19,509
It is my duty to fulfill the
wishes of the Church of God.

37
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:24,431
But now you're asking me to fulfill the
wishes of the Church of this world.

38
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:29,936
One of the many issues a man in my position
is required to deal with, unfortunately.

39
00:04:31,563 --> 00:04:38,195
I know your goodness and the peace of this
convent will perform the miracle we need.

40
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:42,949
And now, if you'll forgive me, I
must return to Milan at once.

41
00:04:43,825 --> 00:04:45,202
As you wish, Your Eminence.

42
00:04:46,036 --> 00:04:48,288
But please tell your coachman
to stay away from the forest.

43
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:51,333
It's dangerous,
especially at night.

44
00:07:34,371 --> 00:07:35,789
Welcome to Santa Fiora.

45
00:07:36,247 --> 00:07:38,541
I'm Sister Giulia and
she's Sister Consolata.

46
00:07:39,042 --> 00:07:41,002
I'm Isabella,
Countess of Lignate.

47
00:07:43,797 --> 00:07:45,882
What do you want?
Are you my maids?

48
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:49,386
Maids? No, we're just here
to help a fellow sister.

49
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:52,555
Sister Angela, our mother
superior, wants you to wear this.

50
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:56,393
Do you really believe
I'm going to wear this?

51
00:07:58,061 --> 00:07:59,062
It would damage my skin.

52
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:09,406
Two underskirts, four shirts, two
pair of socks, three wimples.

53
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:13,827
We also have one,
two, three tunics.

54
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:15,829
Mother Superior?

55
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:18,039
Isabella is here, Mother.

56
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:22,711
You can go now, Sister Giulia.

57
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:25,255
You too, Sister Veronica.

58
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:34,139
Welcome to Santa
Fiora, Isabella.

59
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:36,307
Welcome to this
place of serenity.

60
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:40,311
Cover yourself!

61
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:42,272
Cover yourself, I said!

62
00:08:51,406 --> 00:08:54,909
I won't judge your
insolence, young lady.

63
00:08:56,411 --> 00:08:59,039
My duty is to forgive
and understand you.

64
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:11,593
You've been sent here to find peace
in the serenity of this convent.

65
00:09:12,469 --> 00:09:14,387
That's why you're holding
me captive, then?

66
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:19,726
You're here because of your father's
will, as well as the Church's.

67
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:23,855
Both very good reasons for
obedience, don't you think?

68
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:27,609
Just be honest and say I'm here
because of the cardinal's intrigues.

69
00:09:30,153 --> 00:09:33,490
Young lady! How dare you talk
like that about a saintly man?

70
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:35,158
You better be careful, Mother.

71
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:37,827
My uncle loves me too much
to tolerate such an abuse.

72
00:09:38,453 --> 00:09:40,497
He'll do whatever it takes
to get me away from here.

73
00:09:41,372 --> 00:09:43,792
I won't ask you to take any
sacred vows, Isabella.

74
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:47,378
Novitiate is a struggle
against human nature.

75
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:52,634
And the sacrifices we are required
to make are very much inhumane.

76
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:56,096
Besides, they're only valued
if done with humility

77
00:09:57,931 --> 00:10:01,434
by a spirit who values
a life of love and charity.

78
00:10:03,228 --> 00:10:04,938
It would be too much for you.

79
00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:08,483
You would have to destroy
your arrogance first.

80
00:10:09,359 --> 00:10:10,568
Your boundless pride.

81
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:12,403
What do you know about love?

82
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:15,156
About the kisses of a man who loves you?
His arms holding you?

83
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:17,909
- Isabella!
- I know all those feelings.

84
00:10:18,201 --> 00:10:20,120
You'll never make me forget them.

85
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:22,956
How could you, after all?
With some useless prayers?

86
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:25,250
Young lady! You're
being blasphemous!

87
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:28,086
I won't listen to one more word.

88
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:29,587
Go back to your cell.

89
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:31,047
That's an order.

90
00:17:28,548 --> 00:17:29,465
Ascanio.

91
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:37,807
Ascanio.

92
00:17:39,976 --> 00:17:40,893
Ascanio.

93
00:21:26,076 --> 00:21:26,994
Ascanio.

94
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:36,629
Ascanio.

95
00:25:10,217 --> 00:25:12,678
I beg you to forgive
me, Sister Marta.

96
00:25:14,304 --> 00:25:16,140
Your lust doesn't
deserve forgiveness.

97
00:25:17,141 --> 00:25:18,058
Come with me.

98
00:25:48,464 --> 00:25:49,673
You've done a horrible thing!

99
00:25:50,632 --> 00:25:52,092
I will drive Satan
out of your body!

100
00:25:55,471 --> 00:25:56,388
I repent.

101
00:25:57,097 --> 00:25:58,891
I repent with all my soul.

102
00:26:01,143 --> 00:26:02,019
Forgive me.

103
00:27:09,378 --> 00:27:10,295
Licinia.

104
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:15,551
Licinia.

105
00:30:03,927 --> 00:30:04,845
No.

106
00:30:05,304 --> 00:30:06,221
No.

107
00:30:30,704 --> 00:30:34,124
Sisters, don't get so upset!
Please calm down!

108
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:36,835
Everything's fine! Calm down!

109
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:39,004
I'm sure there's nothing
to worry about!

110
00:30:39,421 --> 00:30:40,839
Sisters, please
try to calm down!

111
00:30:41,298 --> 00:30:43,175
- Where's Sister Marta?
- Probably in her cell.

112
00:30:43,508 --> 00:30:46,219
- Go call her, Sister Veronica, hurry.
- Yes! I'll be right back!

113
00:30:51,308 --> 00:30:52,642
I'm ashamed of myself, Lord.

114
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:55,228
But you know I didn't
mean to do that.

115
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:59,066
I still can't explain what
happened to me all of a sudden.

116
00:30:59,441 --> 00:31:00,901
Something I couldn't resist.

117
00:31:01,234 --> 00:31:02,152
Forgive me.

118
00:31:07,824 --> 00:31:09,576
- What happened?
- Maybe a war broke out!

119
00:31:11,787 --> 00:31:15,457
- At last, Sister Marta. Where were you?
- Praying in the chapel. What's happening?

120
00:31:15,832 --> 00:31:17,834
I don't know yet but I fear
it's something serious.

121
00:31:21,505 --> 00:31:22,631
May the Lord have mercy on us!

122
00:31:43,527 --> 00:31:44,444
My God!

123
00:31:44,986 --> 00:31:46,363
- Is he dead?
- I don't know!

124
00:31:51,785 --> 00:31:54,413
He's still breathing.
Go back to the others.

125
00:32:00,419 --> 00:32:01,628
- Easy, be careful.
- Yes, yes.

126
00:32:04,005 --> 00:32:04,923
She's coming.

127
00:32:07,426 --> 00:32:10,512
- Are we in danger, Sister?
- No, don't worry.

128
00:32:11,096 --> 00:32:13,598
Thanks be to the Virgin Mary!
What was that noise?

129
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:16,768
There's a wounded man in the garden.
Sister Angela is taking care of him.

130
00:32:19,104 --> 00:32:20,897
- A wounded man?
- May the Lord help us.

131
00:32:21,857 --> 00:32:23,233
May the Lord protect us.

132
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:12,491
Our rules forbid us to host
a man under this roof.

133
00:33:12,824 --> 00:33:14,075
I'm aware of that, Sister Marta.

134
00:33:14,618 --> 00:33:16,786
But our duty is to
help those in need,

135
00:33:17,078 --> 00:33:18,705
as well as to shelter
anyone seeking asylum.

136
00:33:19,372 --> 00:33:21,791
Besides, our convent is
too far from any village.

137
00:33:22,375 --> 00:33:24,586
No one else could
help that poor man.

138
00:33:26,546 --> 00:33:29,341
- You're right, but don't you find
this incident a bit odd? - Not at all.

139
00:33:29,758 --> 00:33:33,220
Brigands have assaulted travellers
wandering in the forest many times.

140
00:33:34,387 --> 00:33:37,265
I see, but I wonder what could
have led that young man here.

141
00:33:37,766 --> 00:33:39,684
Our convent is the only
building on these hills.

142
00:33:40,268 --> 00:33:42,395
Maybe he got lost, who knows.

143
00:33:43,313 --> 00:33:47,025
Go now, and make sure the
others do as I ordered.

144
00:33:55,951 --> 00:33:58,078
Excuse me, Mother.
You wanted to see me?

145
00:33:59,412 --> 00:34:00,622
Yes, Sister Veronica.

146
00:34:02,916 --> 00:34:04,876
I want you to tell Cesco
I need to see him.

147
00:34:05,961 --> 00:34:08,505
We have also to bring some
food to that young man.

148
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:13,843
- I want you to take care of that
personally. - I will, Mother.

149
00:34:14,386 --> 00:34:16,846
I'm old enough to not be
led into any temptation.

150
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:20,934
I won't condone that kind of
language, Sister Veronica.

151
00:34:21,476 --> 00:34:22,978
I apologize, Mother.

152
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:42,747
They say that young man
is so handsome and kind!

153
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:45,792
- He fought bravely against those brigands!
- Oh, dear.

154
00:34:46,126 --> 00:34:49,087
- They might be looking for him!
- Stop scaring me!

155
00:34:49,462 --> 00:34:50,755
No, I just want you
to be prepared.

156
00:34:51,256 --> 00:34:53,300
What would you do if those
heathens came here?

157
00:34:54,884 --> 00:34:56,177
I would die of
fright, of course.

158
00:34:56,803 --> 00:34:58,513
But what if they raped you?

159
00:34:59,055 --> 00:35:02,601
- I'd rather drop dead.
- And I'd rather be a martyr.

160
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:04,936
For the love of Mary,
you're talking nonsense.

161
00:35:14,571 --> 00:35:16,531
- Drink this.
- Thank you.

162
00:35:17,532 --> 00:35:19,117
You sure you don't want
any, Sister Marta?

163
00:35:19,451 --> 00:35:21,995
It's you who bring me this
stuff in secret, after all.

164
00:35:22,454 --> 00:35:26,708
No, thank you. I told you I've learned
to repress all my earthly desires.

165
00:35:27,709 --> 00:35:32,839
Oh, I know. You even refused a
necklace any woman would envy.

166
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:34,257
Six next to me.

167
00:35:37,010 --> 00:35:38,762
Your friendship is the
only gift I need.

168
00:35:41,389 --> 00:35:42,891
You deserve more,
Sister Marta.

169
00:35:44,059 --> 00:35:46,936
As soon as I'm out of here,
I'll convince the cardinal

170
00:35:47,395 --> 00:35:50,857
you're the best-suited mother
superior for this convent.

171
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,194
Do you want me to commit
the sin of pride?

172
00:35:56,029 --> 00:35:56,946
Oh, no.

173
00:35:58,114 --> 00:36:00,283
I only want us to be friends.

174
00:36:03,411 --> 00:36:04,496
You should take that away.

175
00:36:05,205 --> 00:36:08,750
Our rules don't allow for
profane things in our cells.

176
00:36:11,711 --> 00:36:12,796
I don't see a problem.

177
00:36:13,755 --> 00:36:16,341
It's Don Ascanio,
my adored uncle.

178
00:36:17,425 --> 00:36:19,969
He won't be able to help me if
someone doesn't tell him I'm here.

179
00:36:20,595 --> 00:36:22,806
What about that young man?
What do you know about him?

180
00:36:23,598 --> 00:36:27,560
Nothing more than what he said. His name
is Guido Bencio. It seems he's an artist.

181
00:36:30,105 --> 00:36:33,441
Sister Marta, please allow
me to speak to him.

182
00:36:34,609 --> 00:36:35,652
I'm afraid it's impossible.

183
00:36:36,236 --> 00:36:39,114
I'll do anything for you, but our
mother superior was adamant.

184
00:36:39,614 --> 00:36:41,491
- I'm sorry.
- Come up with an idea, then.

185
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:43,576
An excuse, a ploy, a ruse.

186
00:36:44,077 --> 00:36:45,995
I must speak to that
young man at any cost.

187
00:36:50,417 --> 00:36:51,918
Sublime. Divine, even.

188
00:36:53,086 --> 00:36:56,631
- You deserve sainthood for your cooking
skills. - Oh, don't be blasphemous.

189
00:36:58,383 --> 00:36:59,300
Quite the opposite.

190
00:36:59,759 --> 00:37:01,761
I could be even more
faithful and pious than you.

191
00:37:02,178 --> 00:37:04,806
Heaven must be quite
a bore, though.

192
00:37:05,432 --> 00:37:06,474
Holy Jesus and Mary.

193
00:37:11,104 --> 00:37:12,313
I could always change my mind.

194
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:15,984
Maybe there's a reason
I ended up here.

195
00:37:16,943 --> 00:37:19,446
Maybe you could heal my soul the
same way you're healing my body.

196
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:20,822
Of course we could.

197
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:24,284
We'd have to be pretty close, though,
and that could be problematic.

198
00:37:25,118 --> 00:37:26,995
If I could only get a room
here at the convent.

199
00:37:27,996 --> 00:37:29,205
No, it's against the rules.

200
00:37:30,123 --> 00:37:31,875
I could try to convince
your mother superior.

201
00:37:32,709 --> 00:37:36,045
She must be an exceptional woman
with unbending principles.

202
00:37:36,421 --> 00:37:37,589
You could say that.

203
00:37:39,299 --> 00:37:42,135
Sure, but she sent you in her place.
Tell her we need to talk.

204
00:37:42,969 --> 00:37:48,349
Mark my words, Isabella. Try not to be
impulsive, and think of a better solution.

205
00:37:49,601 --> 00:37:53,980
If you pretend to indulge Mother Superior,
you'll bring your plan to fruition.

206
00:37:55,607 --> 00:37:58,026
For a nun, you sound
like a woman of the world.

207
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:01,654
You better watch your words,
Isabella, if you want me as an ally.

208
00:38:02,155 --> 00:38:03,907
And always be respectful
to what I'm wearing.

209
00:38:04,574 --> 00:38:08,578
I apologize, Sister Marta, but I'll
get mad if I stay here any longer.

210
00:38:09,162 --> 00:38:10,705
Very well, my dear,
I'll help you.

211
00:38:11,247 --> 00:38:13,291
How can you be so sure we
can trust that man, though?

212
00:38:14,334 --> 00:38:17,295
- You said he seems to be a gentleman.
- That's what I believe.

213
00:38:17,962 --> 00:38:20,799
But what appears on the surface
often differs from what is within.

214
00:38:21,591 --> 00:38:24,803
This is the only opportunity I have.
I beg you, let me speak to him.

215
00:38:26,262 --> 00:38:29,682
No, Isabella. I'm not leaving
you alone with a man.

216
00:38:30,683 --> 00:38:32,185
I'll talk to him, I promise you.

217
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:34,938
I'll have to wait for
the right moment.

218
00:38:35,605 --> 00:38:37,065
Mother Superior must
never find out.

219
00:38:38,233 --> 00:38:40,610
I'm only doing this
for you, Isabella.

220
00:39:07,595 --> 00:39:08,972
Did you want to see me?

221
00:39:10,265 --> 00:39:11,683
I wanted to see you
again, mostly.

222
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:17,605
- I don't have much time, so tell me.
- I'm dying.

223
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:20,441
No, it's not the wound
that's killing me.

224
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:22,402
Your hands worked a miracle.

225
00:39:23,862 --> 00:39:26,072
I'll die of cold and loneliness.

226
00:39:27,407 --> 00:39:28,825
Sister Veronica told me.

227
00:39:30,785 --> 00:39:32,245
What you ask is
simply impossible.

228
00:39:33,538 --> 00:39:35,373
Impossible is a cruel word.

229
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:37,500
And you're not cruel,
that's for sure.

230
00:39:38,877 --> 00:39:41,129
Do you know why I've asked to
be brought into the convent?

231
00:39:42,505 --> 00:39:48,011
We'll do our best to heal you,
even if you'll be confined here.

232
00:39:48,761 --> 00:39:49,721
That's not the reason.

233
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:51,222
I want to be close to you.

234
00:39:51,848 --> 00:39:55,518
I won't tolerate that kind of
language, I'm warning you.

235
00:39:56,603 --> 00:39:59,939
Please, don't misunderstand me.
It's dangerous outside.

236
00:40:01,316 --> 00:40:05,028
I'm still in bad shape, but I'm the
only one who can protect you all.

237
00:40:06,779 --> 00:40:08,740
Our fate lies with the
will of the Lord.

238
00:40:09,365 --> 00:40:13,620
Besides, our convent is too
poor to attract evildoers.

239
00:40:14,078 --> 00:40:17,916
Our only material wealth is a few
silver candlesticks in the chapel.

240
00:40:19,667 --> 00:40:21,419
You have much more
than that, Mother.

241
00:40:21,878 --> 00:40:23,087
Your virtues, for instance.

242
00:40:24,881 --> 00:40:25,882
What do you mean?

243
00:40:26,674 --> 00:40:29,636
That I'm a man and that you're
still a woman under that tunic.

244
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:32,347
- Sir!
- No, don't lie to yourself.

245
00:40:33,139 --> 00:40:34,682
Why did you send
your gardener away?

246
00:40:35,224 --> 00:40:37,518
- Did you want us to remain alone?
- How dare you?

247
00:40:39,479 --> 00:40:40,480
- Mother...
- My God!

248
00:40:41,522 --> 00:40:42,440
What's wrong?

249
00:40:44,025 --> 00:40:45,777
- What are you doing?
- Please, don't leave me.

250
00:40:46,069 --> 00:40:47,528
- Take your hands off me.
- I need you.

251
00:40:48,154 --> 00:40:49,948
- I need to feel your breath.
- You're insane.

252
00:40:51,157 --> 00:40:52,742
No, no!

253
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:55,370
- Don't talk. You're finally mine.
- No, let me go!

254
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:58,331
- Forget about your role.
- No! Please, stop!

255
00:41:00,333 --> 00:41:02,460
- Don't resist me, I need you.
- No!

256
00:41:03,169 --> 00:41:05,213
I need to feel the heat of
your body against mine.

257
00:41:08,216 --> 00:41:09,133
Let me go!

258
00:41:09,968 --> 00:41:12,178
Don't let your lips say what
your heart does not believe.

259
00:41:13,012 --> 00:41:15,306
- Be quiet. I won't hurt you.
- No.

260
00:41:16,349 --> 00:41:18,476
- Mother!
- Sister Marta! Help!

261
00:41:18,977 --> 00:41:20,728
Have you gone insane?
Take your hands off her!

262
00:41:22,897 --> 00:41:24,649
Come on, Mother. Let's
get out of here.

263
00:41:25,984 --> 00:41:26,901
My God.

264
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:48,965
Is that you, Sister Marta?

265
00:41:56,681 --> 00:41:59,308
- Isabella!
- I understand your surprise.

266
00:41:59,767 --> 00:42:01,060
I know whom you
were waiting for.

267
00:42:02,103 --> 00:42:05,523
I guess Mother Superior doesn't even
imagine what happens in your bed,

268
00:42:05,898 --> 00:42:07,108
right, Sister Licinia?

269
00:42:08,192 --> 00:42:10,737
Can you imagine what would
happen if someone told her?

270
00:42:12,488 --> 00:42:13,865
No, please, I'm begging you.

271
00:42:14,657 --> 00:42:16,868
Don't betray me. I won't
do it again, I swear!

272
00:42:18,327 --> 00:42:20,329
Why would I care about
your repentance?

273
00:42:21,581 --> 00:42:25,293
- I won't say anything.
- Thank you. You have my eternal gratitude.

274
00:42:26,586 --> 00:42:28,880
Words are meaningless
without action.

275
00:42:29,255 --> 00:42:31,799
I'll do anything, you
only have to ask.

276
00:42:33,468 --> 00:42:35,470
I want you to bring a
message to that man.

277
00:42:35,928 --> 00:42:38,681
- Impossible!
- Only for me, not for you.

278
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:40,933
I'm too closely watched.

279
00:42:42,018 --> 00:42:44,854
I'd hoped for Sister Marta's help,
but I realized I can't count on her.

280
00:42:45,354 --> 00:42:46,397
It's up to you now.

281
00:42:47,190 --> 00:42:50,651
I don't care how, but you
must bring him that message.

282
00:42:51,402 --> 00:42:52,987
Do it or I'll reveal
what you were doing.

283
00:43:52,588 --> 00:43:54,423
Sister Licinia? Sister Licinia?

284
00:43:56,092 --> 00:43:58,594
- Sister Marta, I...
- Don't say anything.

285
00:43:59,178 --> 00:44:00,763
I know why you're
here in my cell.

286
00:44:03,141 --> 00:44:06,686
- Does it still hurt?
- Yes, Sister Marta. It burns.

287
00:44:08,187 --> 00:44:09,647
A purifying fire, Sister.

288
00:44:10,314 --> 00:44:12,358
And that will keep the flames
of Hell away from you.

289
00:44:41,470 --> 00:44:42,930
Thank you, Sister Marta.

290
00:44:43,598 --> 00:44:46,100
Your soft touch almost
makes my pain fade away.

291
00:44:49,395 --> 00:44:51,063
It's because of my
love for you, Sister.

292
00:44:51,355 --> 00:44:52,940
You're the sweetest
soul among all of us.

293
00:44:53,524 --> 00:44:56,402
And I want to save you from
lust and sinning again.

294
00:50:09,715 --> 00:50:11,967
Sister Consolata? Sister
Consolata, wake up.

295
00:50:12,468 --> 00:50:13,928
Satan is here in our convent.

296
00:50:55,511 --> 00:50:58,138
Mother! Open the
door, Mother, hurry!

297
00:50:58,889 --> 00:50:59,807
Mother!

298
00:51:00,933 --> 00:51:05,479
- Sister Veronica, what's wrong? Speak!
- The church! Sacrilege!

299
00:51:05,896 --> 00:51:06,981
Follow me, quick!

300
00:51:09,608 --> 00:51:10,609
What's going on?

301
00:51:11,485 --> 00:51:12,528
What's happening?

302
00:51:13,821 --> 00:51:14,738
Holy Mary!

303
00:51:59,491 --> 00:52:00,576
Come here, quick!

304
00:52:01,785 --> 00:52:02,786
Over there, by the altar!

305
00:52:03,829 --> 00:52:04,747
Look!

306
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:07,750
No! No!

307
00:52:08,292 --> 00:52:09,752
- Holy Mary.
- Look!

308
00:52:11,670 --> 00:52:13,213
There! There he is again!

309
00:52:14,048 --> 00:52:14,965
Look!

310
00:52:15,758 --> 00:52:16,675
It cannot be!

311
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:19,178
Holy Mary.

312
00:52:20,012 --> 00:52:21,764
May the Lord help us!

313
00:52:26,894 --> 00:52:28,812
We must flee, Sisters!

314
00:52:30,439 --> 00:52:31,899
Flee, hurry!

315
00:52:33,692 --> 00:52:35,319
It's the Devil! The Devil!

316
00:52:52,711 --> 00:52:53,629
Oh, Lord.

317
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:13,065
Yes, Sister Marta.
It's horrible.

318
00:53:13,941 --> 00:53:17,277
Either we're all dreaming, or
the Lord has left this convent.

319
00:53:17,820 --> 00:53:19,905
It couldn't have been a
hallucination, Mother.

320
00:53:20,447 --> 00:53:23,992
We've all seen that sacrilegious
image in place of our Lord.

321
00:53:26,704 --> 00:53:28,455
I have to face the
facts, Sister Marta.

322
00:53:29,456 --> 00:53:35,254
I don't know what our sins are, but we
must free the convent of this curse.

323
00:53:37,256 --> 00:53:40,342
- What do you intend to do, Mother?
- I'm calling Father Arnaldo.

324
00:53:40,884 --> 00:53:41,844
He's an exorcist.

325
00:53:43,721 --> 00:53:45,639
Go to his abbey and alert him.

326
00:53:47,307 --> 00:53:51,937
With his help, God willing, our
convent will finally return to peace.

327
00:53:52,896 --> 00:53:58,652
I'll step away from my position as soon as
we're able to reach the cardinal.

328
00:53:59,820 --> 00:54:06,535
I'll tell him that you're the most
worthy to succeed me, Sister Marta.

329
00:54:07,286 --> 00:54:09,246
What are you saying, Mother?
I'm not worthy at all.

330
00:54:11,081 --> 00:54:12,332
Please, obey my orders.

331
00:54:12,750 --> 00:54:14,126
You can leave at dawn.

332
00:54:15,294 --> 00:54:16,837
Be careful, Sister Marta.

333
00:54:18,130 --> 00:54:20,340
I would never forgive myself
if something happened to you.

334
00:54:21,383 --> 00:54:25,512
Thank you, Mother. I'll take
the path across the forest.

335
00:54:26,513 --> 00:54:27,431
You can go now.

336
00:54:28,515 --> 00:54:29,475
I'll go praying.

337
00:54:44,490 --> 00:54:46,492
Countess Isabella is waiting for you.
Here's the key.

338
00:54:46,950 --> 00:54:48,452
Tell Isabella I'll
meet her in one hour.

339
00:54:48,786 --> 00:54:50,329
I'll wait for the
others to fall asleep.

340
00:54:51,497 --> 00:54:54,541
Second aisle, first door to the left.
Don't forget.

341
00:54:54,917 --> 00:54:57,628
First door. Thanks, Sister.
Wait a minute.

342
00:54:58,712 --> 00:55:01,340
See that unknown god over there?
It looks like he's watching us.

343
00:55:01,882 --> 00:55:03,008
Do you also know the legend?

344
00:55:04,468 --> 00:55:08,639
The convent was built on top of an old
pagan temple. I guess that one got angry.

345
00:55:08,972 --> 00:55:11,016
A lot of bad things happened
here over the centuries.

346
00:55:11,475 --> 00:55:13,685
Fires, pestilence, raids.

347
00:55:14,311 --> 00:55:17,189
I'm an artist.
A sculptor, to be precise.

348
00:55:17,689 --> 00:55:19,775
I came here to see that statue.

349
00:55:20,484 --> 00:55:23,612
He's much more than a
simple work of art.

350
00:55:24,321 --> 00:55:27,491
He looks alive, and somehow
full of some evil force.

351
00:55:28,033 --> 00:55:32,246
- His eyes are cold as agony.
- Please, leave me alone!

352
00:55:32,746 --> 00:55:34,289
Do you think it could
be Satan himself?

353
00:55:41,255 --> 00:55:42,631
You just gave me an idea.

354
00:55:43,006 --> 00:55:46,635
Satan himself. I'll scare them so
much they wouldn't dare stop me.

355
00:56:11,285 --> 00:56:12,202
Come in.

356
00:56:17,332 --> 00:56:19,626
- Well? How did it go?
- He'll be here in an hour.

357
00:56:20,002 --> 00:56:21,545
- How is he?
- As handsome as an angel.

358
00:56:21,962 --> 00:56:23,839
That's not what I meant, stupid.

359
00:56:24,172 --> 00:56:27,551
- Did you mention what I want from him?
- Of course. He said he's willing to help.

360
00:56:27,926 --> 00:56:29,177
Did he sound sincere?

361
00:56:29,469 --> 00:56:31,221
I mean, is he
really a gentleman?

362
00:56:31,722 --> 00:56:34,725
How silly of me, what would
you know about gentlemen?

363
00:56:35,183 --> 00:56:37,686
- He has...
- What? Speak!

364
00:56:39,271 --> 00:56:42,065
The way he looks at you. There's
an evil gleam in his eyes.

365
00:56:42,608 --> 00:56:46,236
A gleam that makes you uneasy. It's
the same stare of the unknown god.

366
00:56:49,489 --> 00:56:52,367
Without his help, it
will be the end for me.

367
00:57:07,925 --> 00:57:10,510
- No, please! I don't want to!
- Keep walking and don't be silly!

368
00:57:20,103 --> 00:57:21,021
Is it for me?

369
00:57:21,730 --> 00:57:23,774
It's a beautiful necklace,
but I can't accept it.

370
00:57:25,192 --> 00:57:27,861
Why not? I just want to give
you a token of my friendship.

371
00:57:29,404 --> 00:57:31,198
And prove you I'm not as
arrogant as it seems.

372
00:57:33,492 --> 00:57:35,619
Thanks, I've never seen
anything so beautiful.

373
00:57:35,953 --> 00:57:40,374
I can't accept it. It's against the
rules to own anything. It'd be a sin.

374
00:57:42,709 --> 00:57:44,544
Only if you were already a nun.

375
00:57:45,295 --> 00:57:47,005
But you still aren't,
just like me.

376
00:57:47,589 --> 00:57:50,550
You could come with me when I get
away from here. Think about it, Giulia.

377
00:57:51,426 --> 00:57:52,469
You could stay in my palace.

378
00:57:53,762 --> 00:57:54,972
As my personal maid and friend.

379
00:57:56,223 --> 00:57:58,266
You'd have gorgeous dresses
and many more jewels.

380
00:57:58,684 --> 00:58:00,894
- Powerful men would be at your feet.
- No, stop talking!

381
00:58:01,979 --> 00:58:04,940
Don't lie to me. You want it.
I can see it in your eyes.

382
00:58:05,357 --> 00:58:06,400
Now listen carefully.

383
00:58:07,109 --> 00:58:08,402
I need you to do
something for me.

384
00:58:08,860 --> 00:58:09,778
For both of us.

385
00:58:11,905 --> 00:58:14,700
Ave Maria, gratia
plena, Dominus tecum,

386
00:58:15,075 --> 00:58:19,955
benedicta tu in mulieribus, et
benedictus fructus ventris tui, lesus.

387
00:58:20,789 --> 00:58:24,418
Sancta Maria, Mater Dei, or a
pro nobis peccatoribus,

388
00:58:25,002 --> 00:58:27,421
nunc et in hora mortis nostrae.
Amen.

389
00:58:28,255 --> 00:58:30,716
Ave Maria, gratia
plena, Dominus tecum,

390
00:58:31,174 --> 00:58:35,512
benedicta tu in mulieribus, et
benedictus fructus ventris tui, lesus.

391
00:58:36,471 --> 00:58:39,516
Sancta Maria, Mater Dei, or a
pro nobis peccatoribus,

392
00:58:39,975 --> 00:58:42,227
nunc et in hora mortis nostrae.
Amen.

393
00:58:44,312 --> 00:58:46,606
Ave Maria, gratia
plena, Dominus tecum,

394
00:58:47,065 --> 00:58:48,150
benedicta tu in mulieribus.

395
00:59:39,076 --> 00:59:40,368
At your service, Countess.

396
00:59:40,952 --> 00:59:42,079
Or shall I call you Sister?

397
00:59:44,831 --> 00:59:46,083
My name is Guido Bencio.

398
00:59:46,541 --> 00:59:49,836
You requested my help, so I
reckon you knew my name already.

399
00:59:51,004 --> 00:59:53,590
They're holding you captive,
if I'm not mistaken.

400
00:59:54,299 --> 00:59:55,217
You have nothing to say?

401
00:59:56,051 --> 00:59:57,260
I see you don't trust me yet.

402
00:59:58,136 --> 00:59:59,638
That's logical, given
you don't know me.

403
01:00:00,764 --> 01:00:02,432
Trust is mutual, though,
don't you think?

404
01:00:03,308 --> 01:00:06,520
I'm risking my neck here. A kidnapping and
a sacrilege would mean a death sentence.

405
01:00:07,104 --> 01:00:10,440
I'd like to keep my neck intact, you see.
Unless the stakes are worth it.

406
01:00:16,321 --> 01:00:17,239
Do you mind?

407
01:00:18,323 --> 01:00:19,241
Let me see.

408
01:00:21,618 --> 01:00:22,953
This necklace would
be my payment?

409
01:00:24,412 --> 01:00:26,706
A beautiful piece of jewelry.
Probably worth a lot, I admit.

410
01:00:28,125 --> 01:00:29,584
It's still not enough, though.

411
01:00:30,669 --> 01:00:33,088
There's another jewel that could
convince me to take the risk.

412
01:00:33,463 --> 01:00:34,381
Your beauty.

413
01:00:35,924 --> 01:00:37,634
One must give in
order to receive.

414
01:00:38,927 --> 01:00:40,303
And you have lots to give.

415
01:00:41,638 --> 01:00:42,556
No, you can't.

416
01:00:43,098 --> 01:00:45,225
Marvellous. I'm finally
hearing your voice.

417
01:00:45,725 --> 01:00:48,812
They told me you were as fierce as a
tiger, but now you're gentle like a lamb.

418
01:00:50,272 --> 01:00:52,190
No. Please.

419
01:04:34,746 --> 01:04:37,999
Free us from temptation, Lord,
and deliver us from evil.

420
01:04:45,090 --> 01:04:46,007
Let's go.

421
01:04:55,433 --> 01:04:56,518
I'm Isabella of Lignate.

422
01:04:57,560 --> 01:04:58,478
You?

423
01:05:00,021 --> 01:05:02,148
Indeed. And I'm not the
harlot you think I am,

424
01:05:02,482 --> 01:05:04,818
always ready to rub herself
against the first man she finds.

425
01:05:05,110 --> 01:05:06,027
A real pity.

426
01:05:06,778 --> 01:05:08,238
Although I'm still a
little skeptical.

427
01:05:11,116 --> 01:05:14,702
And now that we've introduced ourselves,
could you explain this mix-up?

428
01:05:15,203 --> 01:05:16,913
I had to be sure I
could trust you.

429
01:05:17,539 --> 01:05:20,333
- And your verdict is?
- You're nothing but a miserable man.

430
01:05:20,792 --> 01:05:23,253
Oh, I'm much more than that.
I'm also a ruthless sinner.

431
01:05:23,878 --> 01:05:25,505
- That means you have a price?
- Indeed.

432
01:05:26,089 --> 01:05:27,298
If said price is
right, of course.

433
01:05:27,632 --> 01:05:29,092
Someone's coming, hurry!

434
01:05:29,801 --> 01:05:30,718
Hurry up.

435
01:05:34,639 --> 01:05:35,682
You know where to find me.

436
01:05:57,328 --> 01:05:58,246
The Devil!

437
01:05:59,164 --> 01:06:00,582
May the Lord save us all!

438
01:06:56,930 --> 01:06:59,349
Hurry up and go
back to your cell.

439
01:06:59,766 --> 01:07:03,811
Not a word on what happened or
you'll regret it. Both of you.

440
01:07:35,260 --> 01:07:39,722
Holy Jesus and Mary, I can't believe
I have to see such things at my age.

441
01:07:40,098 --> 01:07:43,560
How can someone not believe
in the unknown god's curse?

442
01:07:44,102 --> 01:07:45,019
Hush, Sister Veronica.

443
01:07:45,603 --> 01:07:49,357
- You don't even realize how blasphemous
you sound. - Hurry up, Sister Marta.

444
01:07:49,899 --> 01:07:52,652
Let's hope that saintly man
will drive the Devil away.

445
01:07:53,111 --> 01:07:55,280
- Praise the Lord.
- Always be praised.

446
01:08:52,003 --> 01:08:55,131
- What the hell's that nun doing in the
middle of the forest? - Damned if I know.

447
01:08:55,632 --> 01:08:57,300
She's not taking a
stroll, that's for sure.

448
01:08:57,717 --> 01:08:58,718
What's she doing then?

449
01:08:59,427 --> 01:09:00,762
Walking to the village, I guess.

450
01:09:06,726 --> 01:09:11,064
- What should we do? - Maybe that guy
who ran away told them about us.

451
01:09:11,689 --> 01:09:13,816
I bet she's taking the convent's
riches to the village.

452
01:09:14,442 --> 01:09:15,401
Let's follow her.

453
01:09:41,135 --> 01:09:44,138
Stop right there, Sister. Don't
scream or we'll kill you.

454
01:09:48,976 --> 01:09:51,187
- I sure hope she's not dead!
- Nah, no worries.

455
01:09:51,854 --> 01:09:54,482
Let's drag her somewhere quieter
so we can search her in peace.

456
01:09:55,233 --> 01:09:56,150
Come on.

457
01:09:57,860 --> 01:09:58,903
She's a heavy one!

458
01:09:59,362 --> 01:10:02,699
Nuns aren't like us.
They eat everyday.

459
01:10:03,658 --> 01:10:05,034
And I'm sure their
grub's tasty, too!

460
01:10:15,336 --> 01:10:17,296
- This is a good spot.
- Yeah.

461
01:10:21,342 --> 01:10:22,635
Let's see what she's hiding.

462
01:10:24,595 --> 01:10:25,722
You do the honors.

463
01:10:37,108 --> 01:10:39,652
Nope. There's nothing here.

464
01:10:41,821 --> 01:10:43,990
- Not a single coin here.
- Look at her melons.

465
01:10:44,741 --> 01:10:45,992
Maybe she's got
something in here.

466
01:10:47,952 --> 01:10:49,912
Hey, she looks like
a normal woman.

467
01:10:53,249 --> 01:10:54,959
This nun doesn't look
half-bad, you know.

468
01:10:56,878 --> 01:10:59,630
Firm thighs. Tell me,
you ever screw a nun?

469
01:11:00,173 --> 01:11:04,177
Plenty. When I was with One Eye's
gang we screwed a whole convent.

470
01:11:07,388 --> 01:11:08,347
Let's have a look.

471
01:11:11,476 --> 01:11:12,852
Let's see how she
looks in the nude.

472
01:11:22,987 --> 01:11:24,697
- Hey, this gal's a virgin.
- Get out of here.

473
01:11:25,114 --> 01:11:26,032
She fucking is!

474
01:11:27,742 --> 01:11:30,787
You heard me right, Falcone.
She's a virgin.

475
01:11:31,370 --> 01:11:32,914
She must have just became a nun.

476
01:11:33,206 --> 01:11:36,083
- We really have to screw her. Our
reputation is at stake. - That's right.

477
01:11:36,375 --> 01:11:39,670
I'm going first. You already
banged a whole convent, after all.

478
01:11:40,129 --> 01:11:42,715
Keep your spirits high, Sister! I'm
gonna play you like a trombone!

479
01:11:57,355 --> 01:11:58,272
Did that hurt?

480
01:12:00,274 --> 01:12:02,360
- Let me go! Let me go!
- Hurry!

481
01:12:03,194 --> 01:12:05,238
I'll give her a taste
of my own medicine!

482
01:12:06,489 --> 01:12:08,282
- No! Let me go!
- Stop squirming!

483
01:12:08,825 --> 01:12:10,326
- Stop squirming, I said!
- Let me go!

484
01:12:12,912 --> 01:12:14,539
- Let me go!
- Be good or it'll hurt more!

485
01:12:14,956 --> 01:12:15,873
Let me go!

486
01:12:18,167 --> 01:12:19,961
- Stop struggling!
- Please, stop!

487
01:12:25,508 --> 01:12:26,425
Be good!

488
01:12:28,135 --> 01:12:29,387
- Stop struggling!
- Hold her!

489
01:12:31,264 --> 01:12:33,933
Hey, let me have a go at her!

490
01:12:35,893 --> 01:12:37,228
Come on, you had enough!

491
01:12:39,063 --> 01:12:40,731
It's my turn now, move it!

492
01:12:41,858 --> 01:12:42,775
Hold her!

493
01:12:45,862 --> 01:12:47,697
- Stop squirming!
- And be quiet!

494
01:12:49,699 --> 01:12:50,616
Be good.

495
01:12:52,785 --> 01:12:53,703
Don't struggle.

496
01:12:55,496 --> 01:12:56,998
Keep your mouth
occupied with this.

497
01:12:59,792 --> 01:13:00,710
Shut her up!

498
01:13:14,765 --> 01:13:16,684
Be a good girl, it ain't
like we're killing you!

499
01:13:17,018 --> 01:13:18,477
Suck on this and be quiet.

500
01:13:50,843 --> 01:13:52,845
Behave. Give it another go.

501
01:13:53,804 --> 01:13:54,931
Yeah, that's good.

502
01:14:21,707 --> 01:14:24,001
- Come here, you!
- No, don't touch me!

503
01:14:24,502 --> 01:14:25,586
Stop her, she's fleeing!

504
01:14:26,003 --> 01:14:29,924
- Chase her down, I'm exhausted!
- Nah, let her go already.

505
01:14:30,257 --> 01:14:31,425
Catch her, come on!

506
01:14:32,093 --> 01:14:34,178
- Nah.
- Get a move on, come on!

507
01:17:22,263 --> 01:17:25,933
- It's terrible!
- What happened to her?

508
01:17:31,105 --> 01:17:32,523
Lord, help us!

509
01:17:34,483 --> 01:17:37,444
We must pray for salvation!

510
01:17:39,196 --> 01:17:40,114
My God!

511
01:17:55,880 --> 01:17:57,756
So you state that those
infernal apparitions

512
01:17:58,132 --> 01:18:02,511
started after that
young girl arrived here.

513
01:18:02,970 --> 01:18:07,725
Yes. I believe Isabella's wretched,
tortured soul may have evoked them.

514
01:18:09,435 --> 01:18:14,398
If you knew she was a sinner from the
start, it was your duty to punish her.

515
01:18:15,149 --> 01:18:16,942
You didn't have to
empathize with her.

516
01:18:17,484 --> 01:18:21,363
Unfortunately, Father, it
is often hard to realize

517
01:18:22,281 --> 01:18:26,035
how weak charity
and empathy can be.

518
01:18:28,454 --> 01:18:34,501
That's all it takes for Satan
to triumph over any soul.

519
01:18:38,422 --> 01:18:39,757
Remember the dogma
of every saint.

520
01:18:41,133 --> 01:18:43,344
Never let yourself be
satisfied with bad deeds.

521
01:18:43,802 --> 01:18:46,972
Never let your heart be
satisfied with bad deeds.

522
01:18:48,265 --> 01:18:50,559
God be my witness, I take
all the blame for this.

523
01:18:51,435 --> 01:18:52,937
Do you think it's enough?

524
01:18:53,312 --> 01:18:55,064
Your faith is a wall
built on pride, Mother.

525
01:18:55,606 --> 01:18:58,150
It was you, with your
foolish actions,

526
01:18:58,651 --> 01:19:02,279
who allowed lust to take
hold of this pious place.

527
01:19:03,155 --> 01:19:05,699
There's no doubt Satan
resides within these walls.

528
01:19:07,326 --> 01:19:09,828
And even if there was any doubt,

529
01:19:10,663 --> 01:19:18,504
have you asked yourself why I was
already on my way to this convent?

530
01:19:21,840 --> 01:19:26,637
You're right, you couldn't have known since
Sister Marta never reached the village.

531
01:19:27,304 --> 01:19:29,348
I had a premonition.

532
01:19:29,848 --> 01:19:34,561
As if Satan, in all of his
arrogance, was challenging me.

533
01:19:37,606 --> 01:19:38,649
I will win this battle.

534
01:19:39,483 --> 01:19:41,944
- May the Lord listen to you.
- Shut up, Mother!

535
01:19:42,653 --> 01:19:45,447
Your foolish conduct offended
the blessed name of our Lord!

536
01:19:46,031 --> 01:19:49,952
I'm sure Isabella is an unwitting
tool in the hands of Satan!

537
01:19:50,828 --> 01:19:57,001
I believe the same for that man
you so foolishly sheltered.

538
01:19:57,835 --> 01:19:59,044
And as for you, Mother...

539
01:20:01,880 --> 01:20:02,798
Tell me,

540
01:20:07,303 --> 01:20:11,849
did you, may God forgive my
language, fornicate with that man?

541
01:20:20,649 --> 01:20:23,444
Sister, my good sister,

542
01:20:25,696 --> 01:20:28,824
I feel so guilty for
what happened to you.

543
01:20:30,659 --> 01:20:31,702
I beg your forgiveness.

544
01:20:33,871 --> 01:20:36,373
Maybe the Lord was
kind with you.

545
01:20:37,541 --> 01:20:39,835
He granted you
this beautiful madness.

546
01:20:41,295 --> 01:20:44,548
You now have the gift to
forget the men's cruelty.

547
01:20:46,383 --> 01:20:52,431
It will be much harder for me.
For all of us.

548
01:20:54,183 --> 01:20:57,478
We'll have to pay for our
weaknesses day after day.

549
01:21:00,481 --> 01:21:03,108
Maybe not even prayers
will be strong enough.

550
01:21:04,735 --> 01:21:07,112
Maybe not even prayers
will heal our wounds.

551
01:21:08,947 --> 01:21:11,116
They won't be enough
to atone for our sins.

552
01:21:12,451 --> 01:21:13,369
Our lust.

553
01:22:06,922 --> 01:22:07,840
Listen to me.

554
01:22:08,799 --> 01:22:10,509
Whoever you are, I'm
not scared of you.

555
01:22:11,093 --> 01:22:13,303
I don't want the
others to pay for me.

556
01:22:14,012 --> 01:22:15,305
I'm the one who's
challenging you.

557
01:22:16,056 --> 01:22:18,600
I dare you to take
me, unknown god.

558
01:22:25,482 --> 01:22:27,568
I will exorcise every
room of the convent.

559
01:22:28,402 --> 01:22:32,448
You are all strictly forbidden to
leave your cells until I'm done.

560
01:22:32,823 --> 01:22:35,409
As you wish, Father.
We will meditate.

561
01:22:35,993 --> 01:22:37,035
But no prayers.

562
01:22:37,703 --> 01:22:40,038
It would make things worse since
the Lord is angry with you.

563
01:22:41,039 --> 01:22:44,209
But, Father, it's the ones seeking
forgiveness who need to pray the most.

564
01:22:45,961 --> 01:22:47,004
Don't question my orders.

565
01:22:47,629 --> 01:22:48,547
You can go now.

566
01:23:08,734 --> 01:23:13,697
I confide in your strength, Lord,
to destroy the Prince of Darkness.

567
01:23:17,701 --> 01:23:21,872
Through the power of God I'll soon
annihilate you, filthy demon. Amen.

568
01:24:43,245 --> 01:24:44,621
So they really believed it, huh?

569
01:24:46,707 --> 01:24:48,959
Listen to me, Satan
does not exist.

570
01:24:49,418 --> 01:24:52,129
Besides, even if he existed, he
wouldn't be any worse than us humans.

571
01:24:53,046 --> 01:24:56,675
Indeed, my dear, it was us who invented
him, like we invented laws or religions.

572
01:24:57,551 --> 01:24:59,344
We invented him to
restrain our own nature.

573
01:25:00,637 --> 01:25:02,806
Aren't you afraid of being
tormented by your conscience?

574
01:25:03,682 --> 01:25:05,851
Absolutely not. I only
live by one rule.

575
01:25:06,226 --> 01:25:08,228
Take what you like,
whenever you like.

576
01:25:08,729 --> 01:25:11,273
Don't put off to tomorrow
the sins you can do today.

577
01:25:15,110 --> 01:25:16,403
You're so strange, though.

578
01:25:16,987 --> 01:25:21,658
You keep saying Satan doesn't exist,
yet you act like he's possessed you.

579
01:25:22,159 --> 01:25:26,413
What? Don't tell me a smart girl
like you believes those tales.

580
01:25:27,039 --> 01:25:30,250
Well, it's all down to how you
define it, but evil does exist.

581
01:25:32,919 --> 01:25:34,671
We often enjoy being
evil for the sake of it.

582
01:25:35,088 --> 01:25:36,840
Or just to affirm our
position of power.

583
01:25:37,382 --> 01:25:40,844
Did you come here to discuss
philosophy or your escape plan?

584
01:25:50,729 --> 01:25:51,772
Here I am, Satan.

585
01:26:15,420 --> 01:26:18,799
I'll defeat you and send you
back to the depths of Hell.

586
01:26:19,216 --> 01:26:23,970
No evil of yours will ever
defeat the might of God's army.

587
01:26:25,138 --> 01:26:29,810
Because I am the Lord of the
Universe, and evil will not prevail.

588
01:26:30,477 --> 01:26:33,647
Evil will not prevail over the
Lord and his Holy Kingdom.

589
01:26:34,523 --> 01:26:40,987
I order you to return to Hell. You're
not welcome at the Lord's table.

590
01:26:42,531 --> 01:26:45,826
You will obey my commands and
leave this house of God.

591
01:27:00,215 --> 01:27:01,466
It's an exciting plan, indeed.

592
01:27:01,842 --> 01:27:03,385
But it's still too
risky, my dear.

593
01:27:04,678 --> 01:27:07,013
I've already had the pleasure
of sleeping with two nuns.

594
01:27:08,181 --> 01:27:11,059
To kidnap a third, and of noble
heritage, would be too much.

595
01:27:11,685 --> 01:27:16,690
Besides, don't forget rulers
always like to hang a freethinker.

596
01:27:17,357 --> 01:27:20,986
- But don't tell me you decided to...
- To remain a nun?

597
01:27:21,778 --> 01:27:25,741
Of course not. I never had the
desire to wear these clothes.

598
01:27:26,533 --> 01:27:29,077
To be honest, I was expecting
to feel some new thrills.

599
01:27:30,328 --> 01:27:31,329
What is it, Mr. Bencio?

600
01:27:32,289 --> 01:27:33,707
The lack of a monetary gain?

601
01:27:34,624 --> 01:27:36,168
Is that making you
resist my request?

602
01:27:40,213 --> 01:27:42,924
Da, Domine, terrorem
tuum super bestiam,

603
01:27:43,341 --> 01:27:45,177
quee exterminat vineam tuam.

604
01:27:46,470 --> 01:27:48,972
Exorcizo te,
immundissime spiritus,

605
01:27:49,514 --> 01:27:53,643
omnis incursio adversarii,
omne phantasma, omnis legio,

606
01:27:54,436 --> 01:27:59,399
in nomine Domini nostri Jesu Christi
eradicare et effugare ab hoc plasmate Dei.

607
01:28:01,109 --> 01:28:06,448
Audi ergo, et time, Satana, inimice
fidei, hostis generis humani...

608
01:28:06,907 --> 01:28:08,992
I always have money to hire
someone to commit a crime.

609
01:28:09,284 --> 01:28:11,578
And I also have money to clear
that someone of said crime.

610
01:28:14,456 --> 01:28:15,791
I want you, Isabella.

611
01:28:49,950 --> 01:28:50,909
Help me.

612
01:29:37,998 --> 01:29:41,918
Recede ergo in nomine Patris,
et Filii, et Spiritus Sancti:

613
01:29:42,794 --> 01:29:44,254
da locum Spiritui Sancto,

614
01:29:45,046 --> 01:29:48,758
per hoc signum sanctae Cruci
Jesu Christi Domini nostri:

615

Sancto vivit et regnat Deus,

01:29:55,265 --> 01:29:56,725
per omnia saecula saeculorum.

617
01:30:57,994 --> 01:31:00,121
Domine, exaudi orationem meam.

618
01:31:00,872 --> 01:31:02,874
<i>Et clamor meus ad te venial.</i>

619
01:31:30,110 --> 01:31:32,696
Da, Domine, terrorem
tuum super bestiam,

620
01:31:33,279 --> 01:31:34,990
quee exterminat vineam tuam.

621
01:31:36,199 --> 01:31:38,451
Exorcizo te,
immundissime spiritus,

622
01:31:39,077 --> 01:31:43,206
omnis incursio adversarii,
omne phantasma, omnis legio,

623
01:31:44,082 --> 01:31:48,920
in nomine Domini nostri Jesu Christi
eradicare et effugare ab hoc plasmate Dei.

624
01:33:03,328 --> 01:33:08,541
Audi ergo, et time, Satana, inimice
fidei, hostis generis humani,

625
01:33:09,417 --> 01:33:13,046
mortis adductor, vitae raptor,
justitiae declinator,

626
01:33:13,713 --> 01:33:18,635
malorum radix, fomes vitiorum,
seductor hominum, proditor gentium,

627
01:33:19,427 --> 01:33:24,766
incitator invidiae, origo avaritiae,
causa discordiae, excitator dolorum...

628
01:33:59,217 --> 01:34:00,260
You're beautiful.

629
01:34:15,483 --> 01:34:16,401
Yes.

630
01:35:02,071 --> 01:35:06,159
Recede ergo in nomine Patris,
et Filii, et Spiritus Sancti:

631
01:35:06,993 --> 01:35:08,703
da locum Spiritui Sancto,

632
01:35:09,245 --> 01:35:14,417
per hoc signum sanctae Cruci
Jesu Christi Domini nostri:

633
01:35:15,001 --> 01:35:20,089
qui cum Patre et eodem Spiritu

634
01:35:20,882 --> 01:35:22,634
per omnia saecula saeculorum.

635
01:35:23,760 --> 01:35:26,721
Domine, exaudi orationem meam.

636
01:35:28,765 --> 01:35:30,767
<i>Et clamor meus ad te venial.</i>

637
01:35:32,227 --> 01:35:38,358
(LATIN PRAYER CONTINUES)

638
01:35:54,249 --> 01:36:00,797
Audi ergo, et time, Satana, inimice
fidei, hostis generis humani,

639
01:36:01,881 --> 01:36:07,720
mortis adductor, vitae raptor,
justitiae declinator,

640
01:36:08,388 --> 01:36:14,352
malorum radix, fomes vitiorum,

641
01:36:15,144 --> 01:36:21,609
incitator invidiae, origo avaritiae,

642
01:36:22,235 --> 01:36:27,532
Recede ergo in nomine Patris,
et Filii, et Spiritus Sancti:

643
01:36:28,324 --> 01:36:29,951
da locum Spiritui Sancto,

644
01:36:30,660 --> 01:36:36,332
per hoc signum sanctae Cruci
Jesu Christi Domini nostri:

645
01:36:38,668 --> 01:36:43,631

per omnia saecula saeculorum.

647
01:36:47,176 --> 01:36:49,262
Domine, exaudi orationem meam.

648
01:36:50,096 --> 01:36:52,181
<i>Et clamor meus ad te venial.</i>

649
01:37:20,335 --> 01:37:22,003
- Come here.
- Give me your lips.

650
01:37:33,139 --> 01:37:35,391
- Come on.
- Oh, yes.

651
01:37:41,814 --> 01:37:42,732
Like this.

652
01:37:49,697 --> 01:37:50,615
Oh, yes.

653
01:38:42,750 --> 01:38:43,668
Yes.

654
01:39:56,240 --> 01:39:58,784
Cesco, the cardinal
will be here soon.

655
01:40:01,496 --> 01:40:02,955
Why didn't you pick the fruit?

656
01:40:03,956 --> 01:40:04,874
It's happened again.

657
01:40:07,001 --> 01:40:08,002
It was him, once again.

658
01:40:11,923 --> 01:40:15,218
When will you stop believing these
silly superstitions, Cesco?
