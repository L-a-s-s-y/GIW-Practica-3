00:00:11,254 --> 00:00:15,350
A tax officer shall take all steps
necessary for prosecution

4
00:00:15,458 --> 00:00:19,589
when he discovers that an offense
has been committed.

5
00:00:19,695 --> 00:00:23,689
National Tax Offenses Act,
Article 12, Clause 2

6
00:00:25,768 --> 00:00:28,260
WINTER

7
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:45,909
Here's his seal.

8
00:01:46,015 --> 00:01:47,881
And the registration.

9
00:01:50,052 --> 00:01:51,782
He didn't fuss?

10
00:01:52,155 --> 00:01:52,884
No.

11
00:01:52,989 --> 00:01:55,049
He's like a baby in my hands.

12
00:01:55,625 --> 00:01:56,854
How is he?

13
00:01:56,959 --> 00:01:59,554
The doctor said 6 months.

14
00:01:59,662 --> 00:02:02,723
But the cancer has spread.

15
00:02:03,332 --> 00:02:08,168
This is for you. He'll be
getting 30,000 a month.

16
00:02:09,872 --> 00:02:11,636
Call me when he dies.

17
00:02:13,543 --> 00:02:16,809
Set up a dummy company with
the old man as president.

18
00:02:16,913 --> 00:02:18,541
What do we call it?

19
00:02:18,648 --> 00:02:22,050
It doesn't matter. What's the
old man's name?

20
00:02:22,151 --> 00:02:23,175
Hakamada.

21
00:02:23,286 --> 00:02:25,380
Call it Hakamada Real Estate.

22
00:02:27,423 --> 00:02:29,756
He'll be dead by next year?

23
00:02:29,859 --> 00:02:32,021
For sure.

24
00:02:40,836 --> 00:02:43,305
SUMMER

25
00:02:55,451 --> 00:02:56,714
This cost 400 million?

26
00:02:56,819 --> 00:03:00,881
It should be worth 700 now.

27
00:03:01,257 --> 00:03:04,955
What if the mortgage is sold
before we bid?

28
00:03:05,061 --> 00:03:11,763
Don't worry. See that 2nd-
floor apartment?

29
00:03:12,568 --> 00:03:16,061
People there have loan sharks
after them.

30
00:03:18,207 --> 00:03:24,977
OK then, lady? The boss will pay
your debts.

31
00:03:34,724 --> 00:03:37,250
Here's the debt contract...

32
00:03:38,661 --> 00:03:41,290
Their promise to vacate...

33
00:03:43,399 --> 00:03:47,097
Consent to transfer chattel...

34
00:03:48,437 --> 00:03:51,168
And a power of attorney.

35
00:03:51,641 --> 00:03:56,773
You're really going to pay
our debts?

36
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:01,715
We sure will. Don't worry.

37
00:04:04,186 --> 00:04:09,853
Here's 2 million in cash.
You can leave tonight.

38
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,528
"THE NINAGAWA FAMILY"

39
00:04:22,505 --> 00:04:25,304
No one will buy this place now.

40
00:04:25,808 --> 00:04:29,040
Spend some time here to scare
the tenants out.

41
00:04:29,178 --> 00:04:30,168
Yeah.

42
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:36,541
I'll handle the bank and
others.

43
00:04:37,119 --> 00:04:39,350
But Kikuchi holds the second
mortgage.

44
00:04:39,955 --> 00:04:43,790
He's got enemies. I can scare
him off.

45
00:04:48,064 --> 00:04:49,259
Mr. Kikuchi!

46
00:04:52,034 --> 00:04:56,472
Mr. Gondo! Got a good deal
for me?

47
00:04:59,241 --> 00:05:02,609
The Kudo Family from Osaka is
sending some hitmen.

48
00:05:02,712 --> 00:05:06,877
They'll be in two groups,
facing to get you.

49
00:05:07,717 --> 00:05:08,377
When?

50
00:05:08,484 --> 00:05:09,816
Tomorrow.

51
00:05:11,887 --> 00:05:15,449
Got it. Awful, huh? Thanks for
the tip.

52
00:05:15,558 --> 00:05:16,821
Take care.

53
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:20,259
I owe you a favor.

54
00:05:20,529 --> 00:05:25,524
Those apartments you wanted in
Minatomachi.

55
00:05:25,634 --> 00:05:29,537
They're yours. I'll sign over
the mortgage.

56
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:33,139
Good. Now sell it for
750 million.

57
00:05:33,409 --> 00:05:37,141
Put it in the old man's
account.

58
00:05:37,513 --> 00:05:42,645
Hakamada Real Estate,
that's right.

59
00:05:59,301 --> 00:06:04,501
I'll be goddamned! I made too
much money again.

60
00:06:05,574 --> 00:06:13,107
Paid 400 million, spent 180 on
improvements and sold it for 750.

61
00:06:13,282 --> 00:06:14,716
How much did I make?

62
00:06:14,817 --> 00:06:16,911
170 million.

63
00:06:17,186 --> 00:06:20,520
Right.

64
00:06:20,823 --> 00:06:24,919
Not bad. The problem is
hiding it all.

65
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:36,730
Gondo here. Dietman Urushibara!
Calling in person.

66
00:06:37,173 --> 00:06:39,335
This is an honor...

67
00:06:42,678 --> 00:06:48,675
What, sir? Dainikko shares?
I should buy some?

68
00:06:48,784 --> 00:06:52,448
Thank you so much. Your tips
are always good.

69
00:06:52,555 --> 00:06:56,219
Those Yamanaka shares you
suggested went up fast.

70
00:06:57,026 --> 00:07:02,988
I'll send you a little
something in the usual way.

71
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:21,742
This is for Urushibara,
the Diet member.

72
00:07:21,851 --> 00:07:23,979
His man will be there.

73
00:07:24,186 --> 00:07:25,210
OK.

74
00:07:46,475 --> 00:07:49,309
So, you're off to prison now.

75
00:07:50,279 --> 00:07:57,345
You're a proper gangster.
Violence is obsolete.

76
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:02,885
Now we go to jail for tax
evasion.

77
00:08:03,425 --> 00:08:07,260
Today we are businessmen...

78
00:08:07,363 --> 00:08:10,390
Donating to politicians and
helping save taxes.

79
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:19,236
Don't worry at all about your
family. Just do your time.

80
00:08:37,459 --> 00:08:38,722
How many years?

81
00:08:40,396 --> 00:08:43,389
Three at most. Nothing to it.

82
00:08:45,634 --> 00:08:47,569
Can you do me a favor?

83
00:08:47,736 --> 00:08:48,795
What?

84
00:08:50,472 --> 00:08:53,965
Pretend you loaned me
50 million.

85
00:08:54,410 --> 00:09:01,317
Made to much again? Look out.
The taxmen are getting shrewder.

86
00:09:55,237 --> 00:10:01,370
Taxmen? To hell with them.
Catch me if you can!

87
00:10:05,014 --> 00:10:10,009
A TAXING WOMAN

88
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:45,813
59, 60. It's getting
crowded.

89
00:10:49,958 --> 00:10:51,221
See the cash register?

90
00:10:56,965 --> 00:10:58,524
Nothing is rung up.

91
00:10:59,034 --> 00:11:00,024
I see.

92
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:02,733
Those two.

93
00:11:03,672 --> 00:11:05,698
They look like part-timers.

94
00:11:06,341 --> 00:11:08,833
Bet there's no tax withheld.

95
00:11:10,679 --> 00:11:12,113
See that bill there?

96
00:11:12,347 --> 00:11:13,280
Yes.

97
00:11:18,053 --> 00:11:19,112
How many digits?

98
00:11:19,321 --> 00:11:20,254
Three.

99
00:11:20,889 --> 00:11:22,414
Ours has four.

100
00:11:23,192 --> 00:11:24,421
Right...

101
00:11:24,626 --> 00:11:28,654
Why do they use both types?

102
00:11:28,797 --> 00:11:33,132
They probably throw out the
3-digit ones to hide sales?

103
00:11:33,235 --> 00:11:38,003
Right. You're getting better.
I'll leave this to you.

104
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:46,005
With all the food you carry,
you don't shop, do you?

105
00:11:46,315 --> 00:11:51,344
Just for rice, vegetables
and fish.

106
00:11:51,520 --> 00:12:00,691
How much from inventory,
100,000?

107
00:12:00,796 --> 00:12:06,258
Not so much. About 80,000 yen.

108
00:12:06,368 --> 00:12:08,234
80,000

109
00:12:12,007 --> 00:12:12,997
Why?

110
00:12:13,108 --> 00:12:15,907
Do you count that 80,000 yen
as sales?

111
00:12:16,011 --> 00:12:17,843
Of course not.

112
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:22,279
We eat our own things.
Why should it be sales?

113
00:12:22,851 --> 00:12:24,877
Isn't your shop incorporated?

114
00:12:24,987 --> 00:12:25,886
Yes.

115
00:12:25,988 --> 00:12:29,857
Then the food doesn't belong
to you personally, does it?

116
00:12:30,225 --> 00:12:32,057
Theoretically not. But...

117
00:12:32,161 --> 00:12:36,462
If it's not yours, you should
pay for it, right?

118
00:12:39,434 --> 00:12:40,493
Am I right?

119
00:12:42,371 --> 00:12:47,810
Since you're a new corporation,
I'll call it an error.

120
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:50,778
I'll make it receivable.

121
00:12:50,946 --> 00:12:54,314
You mean I bought my own
things on credit?

122
00:12:54,416 --> 00:12:55,281
Exactly.

123
00:12:55,384 --> 00:12:58,877
OK, OK. I'll pay the bill to
make you happy.

124
00:12:58,987 --> 00:13:00,979
Now, regarding your company's
taxes...

125
00:13:01,757 --> 00:13:07,788
It failed to declare 80,000
yen a month in income.

126
00:13:07,996 --> 00:13:12,058
You incorporated last May, so
8 months times 80,000 yen...

127
00:13:12,167 --> 00:13:15,399
Please revise your declared
income and file a new return.

128
00:13:15,871 --> 00:13:18,238
You mean pay more tax?

129
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:19,273
Exactly.

130
00:13:19,708 --> 00:13:25,113
You act so polite but you're
just a bloodsucker.

131
00:13:25,214 --> 00:13:26,113
Calm down.

132
00:13:26,215 --> 00:13:32,485
Why should you pick on poor
people like us?

133
00:13:32,788 --> 00:13:33,881
You cow!

134
00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:38,520
Go catch real criminals!
There's millions of them.

135
00:13:38,627 --> 00:13:41,688
I'll be glad to. Tell me their
names and addresses.

136
00:13:41,797 --> 00:13:44,733
Isn't that your job?

137
00:14:43,058 --> 00:14:45,823
My seals and passbooks.

138
00:14:50,198 --> 00:14:51,791
Can you get them?

139
00:15:23,198 --> 00:15:25,429
Why?

140
00:15:25,534 --> 00:15:28,163
I need them for a while.

141
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:34,476
Here's the hotel statements
from yesterday.

142
00:15:34,576 --> 00:15:37,307
Put them in the garbage
tomorrow.

143
00:15:37,412 --> 00:15:38,209
Mr. Gondo.

144
00:15:38,313 --> 00:15:39,246
What?

145
00:15:39,348 --> 00:15:40,907
There's someone else.

146
00:15:43,785 --> 00:15:45,754
What are you babbling about?

147
00:15:45,821 --> 00:15:47,813
You have a new lover!

148
00:15:49,458 --> 00:15:51,017
What kind of woman?

149
00:15:51,326 --> 00:15:53,158
Kumi from the nightclub?

150
00:15:55,764 --> 00:15:57,027
It's Kumi!

151
00:15:58,533 --> 00:16:02,937
Relax. Why should you care who
else I sleep with anyway?

152
00:16:03,038 --> 00:16:08,170
It's not that. You're giving
her the seals and passbooks.

153
00:16:08,677 --> 00:16:12,739
You're dumping me. You are,
aren't you?

154
00:16:12,848 --> 00:16:14,612
No, I'm not.

155
00:16:14,716 --> 00:16:16,981
What's her number?
I'll talk to her.

156
00:16:17,085 --> 00:16:18,815
Wait a minute.

157
00:16:20,455 --> 00:16:23,084
All right, I'll call.

158
00:16:30,899 --> 00:16:33,334
Kumi? It's me.

159
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:37,598
I'm held up here.

160
00:16:38,874 --> 00:16:42,743
Yeah. We're arguing about it.
How did you know?

161
00:16:43,478 --> 00:16:46,880
Wait, you two just talk it
over and...

162
00:16:53,622 --> 00:16:54,817
I'll kill you.

163
00:17:31,259 --> 00:17:32,352
Get out!

164
00:17:33,328 --> 00:17:34,853
I'm through with you.

165
00:17:35,964 --> 00:17:36,761
Get out now.

166
00:17:40,669 --> 00:17:44,265
You can't do this to me.

167
00:17:44,372 --> 00:17:48,173
I'm sick of you. I'll give you
a week.

168
00:17:48,276 --> 00:17:50,609
Now pack up and
get the hell out.

169
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:54,716
Please wait, darling, please.

170
00:17:56,218 --> 00:18:01,623
Darling, wait. I apologize.

171
00:19:33,181 --> 00:19:34,649
Congratulations!

172
00:19:56,371 --> 00:19:57,896
Good morning.

173
00:19:58,807 --> 00:20:02,437
Good morning. How did it go?

174
00:20:02,911 --> 00:20:05,244
They had two routes for cash.

175
00:20:14,389 --> 00:20:16,722
Are you checking the pinball
parlor today?

176
00:20:16,825 --> 00:20:18,054
Yes. The Taiko.

177
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:19,923
Fix your cowlick.

178
00:20:21,563 --> 00:20:22,622
Did you mark the bills?

179
00:20:22,731 --> 00:20:23,460
Yes.

180
00:20:23,565 --> 00:20:25,397
An old trick, but still good.

181
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:26,160
Yes.

182
00:20:26,268 --> 00:20:29,705
I'll be at your office at ten
on Tuesday.

183
00:20:29,804 --> 00:20:31,329
See you then.

184
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:39,273
Now just where exactly are you
located? Is that near the...

185
00:20:40,348 --> 00:20:41,179
Hey, Ms. Itakura.

186
00:20:41,283 --> 00:20:41,807
Come here.

187
00:20:41,916 --> 00:20:42,747
What is it?

188
00:20:42,851 --> 00:20:43,819
Just come along.

189
00:20:43,918 --> 00:20:46,217
Why did you do that?

190
00:20:51,126 --> 00:20:53,960
Are you feeling all right?

191
00:20:54,062 --> 00:20:54,552
Yes.

192
00:20:54,663 --> 00:20:58,964
You should know better than to
ask their location like that.

193
00:20:59,067 --> 00:20:59,591
But...

194
00:20:59,701 --> 00:21:00,862
No buts.

195
00:21:00,969 --> 00:21:06,567
They'll think we can't
figure out anything at all.

196
00:21:06,841 --> 00:21:09,675
We must always act like we
know everything.

197
00:21:19,854 --> 00:21:22,119
Your books say you always
pay cash.

198
00:21:22,223 --> 00:21:24,055
Yeah. I always pay cash.

199
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:28,062
Wouldn't checks be more
convenient?

200
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:30,790
I hate banks.

201
00:21:31,099 --> 00:21:33,193
I went bankrupt once.

202
00:21:33,301 --> 00:21:36,838
I was loyal to my bank then.

203
00:21:36,838 --> 00:21:38,206
"TSUKASA CREDIT UNION"
I was loyal to my bank then.

204
00:21:38,206 --> 00:21:39,107
"TSUKASA CREDIT UNION"

205
00:21:39,107 --> 00:21:43,169
And what did they do?

206
00:21:43,278 --> 00:21:48,342
When business slowed, they cut
me off cold.

207
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:50,652
All right.

208
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:57,591
Let me ask again. This bank in
your books...

209
00:21:57,692 --> 00:21:59,684
Is it your sole bank?

210
00:21:59,794 --> 00:22:01,592
Yes. I already told you.

211
00:22:01,696 --> 00:22:03,722
Are you sure?

212
00:22:03,832 --> 00:22:06,028
I'm pretty sure.

213
00:22:09,003 --> 00:22:10,301
You're sure.

214
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,401
Excuse me.

215
00:22:14,509 --> 00:22:15,568
And what is this?

216
00:22:16,845 --> 00:22:19,713
Silly lies won't work.

217
00:22:20,782 --> 00:22:27,211
Oh, that...um...yes, I do have
a small checking account there.

218
00:22:27,322 --> 00:22:29,985
Sometimes you're obliged...

219
00:22:30,091 --> 00:22:31,559
You keep money at Tsukasa.

220
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:34,125
May I see the records?

221
00:22:34,229 --> 00:22:37,290
I don't keep records on that.

222
00:22:38,166 --> 00:22:41,534
No account book?

223
00:22:42,504 --> 00:22:44,973
Show me the check stubs.

224
00:22:45,073 --> 00:22:46,837
I don't keep them.

225
00:22:46,941 --> 00:22:52,608
I throw them out when the
checks are used up.

226
00:22:53,782 --> 00:22:59,585
Do you think you can stop us
by not showing us anything?

227
00:22:59,687 --> 00:23:03,351
Don't make them think you're
hiding something.

228
00:23:03,458 --> 00:23:08,487
Show her what you have, notes,
receipts, anything.

229
00:23:08,596 --> 00:23:12,795
I would if I could. There just
isn't anything to show.

230
00:23:12,901 --> 00:23:14,802
Where are yesterday's proceeds?

231
00:23:15,537 --> 00:23:22,102
I put them in the bank's night
depository.

232
00:23:22,210 --> 00:23:24,008
You don't have them here?

233
00:23:24,345 --> 00:23:25,040
No.

234
00:23:29,584 --> 00:23:33,316
Let's see that bag.

235
00:23:34,656 --> 00:23:36,147
That's my personal property.

236
00:23:36,257 --> 00:23:39,659
But a personal bag can hold
company stuff.

237
00:23:39,761 --> 00:23:40,956
It's all personal.

238
00:23:41,062 --> 00:23:45,227
I'll decide what's personal.
Let's have a look.

239
00:23:45,333 --> 00:23:52,763
Open it, or she'll think
you're hiding something.

240
00:24:02,951 --> 00:24:04,886
Dump it out on the table.

241
00:24:13,094 --> 00:24:14,756
What's in the envelope?

242
00:24:21,135 --> 00:24:22,535
Count it, please.

243
00:24:36,551 --> 00:24:39,282
390,300 yen.

244
00:24:40,054 --> 00:24:41,750
Where did it come from?

245
00:24:42,290 --> 00:24:46,193
I brought it from home, to buy
something.

246
00:24:46,361 --> 00:24:48,523
It's sort of pocket money.

247
00:24:48,596 --> 00:24:51,031
I spent this note here
yesterday.

248
00:24:51,699 --> 00:24:54,225
This is my mark.

249
00:24:56,905 --> 00:24:59,101
What's it doing here?

250
00:25:01,809 --> 00:25:02,970
Well...

251
00:25:03,711 --> 00:25:06,112
You're hiding income.

252
00:25:10,051 --> 00:25:11,713
Let's see your computer.

253
00:25:13,555 --> 00:25:15,285
The counter is set to"2."

254
00:25:15,557 --> 00:25:17,549
Show me yesterday's sales.

255
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:22,120
7,415,100.

256
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:24,563
Reset it and do it again.

257
00:25:27,835 --> 00:25:30,236
7,805,400.

258
00:25:30,638 --> 00:25:38,410
Let's see. The difference is...

259
00:25:39,914 --> 00:25:41,974
390,300.

260
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:45,049
Exactly what you had in the
envelope.

261
00:25:46,554 --> 00:25:51,515
You better tell the truth now.

262
00:25:51,693 --> 00:25:53,958
Or you're in real trouble.

263
00:25:54,295 --> 00:25:58,027
350,000 a day...10 million
a month...120 million a year...

264
00:25:58,266 --> 00:26:03,671
Tax and penalty at 56%, or 65%
with local tax...

265
00:26:07,542 --> 00:26:10,774
Which makes 78 million.

266
00:26:11,713 --> 00:26:15,514
Times 5 years, that's nearly
400 million, plus a 30% fine.

267
00:26:15,617 --> 00:26:19,987
About 520 million in all.

268
00:26:20,088 --> 00:26:21,488
500 million!

269
00:26:21,589 --> 00:26:23,319
You're joking! It's crazy.
I could never...

270
00:26:23,424 --> 00:26:30,422
How the hell could I pay that?
I'd have to sell this place.

271
00:26:30,531 --> 00:26:34,969
You're my accountant. Do some-
thing! You want me bankrupt?

272
00:26:35,069 --> 00:26:37,470
But her figures...

273
00:26:37,572 --> 00:26:43,842
Listen. If I go bankrupt you
won't get any taxes at all.

274
00:26:44,012 --> 00:26:54,011
But, anything you've hidden is
taxable.

275
00:26:55,723 --> 00:26:59,592
Whose side are you on anyway?

276
00:27:01,229 --> 00:27:07,658
Are you working for the tax
office or me, you bastard?

277
00:27:07,769 --> 00:27:11,228
You have no right to call me
names!

278
00:27:11,339 --> 00:27:16,403
I don't need you anymore!
You're fired!

279
00:27:16,778 --> 00:27:20,374
You just kiss the taxman's
ass. Get out!

280
00:27:21,315 --> 00:27:24,342
Everybody's against me.

281
00:27:25,553 --> 00:27:30,856
This place is my blood, sweat
and tears...my whole life.

282
00:27:31,659 --> 00:27:38,156
Why me? The bastards. What
have I done to deserve this?

283
00:27:43,771 --> 00:27:50,268
Go ahead. Take my shop, take
everything.

284
00:28:02,990 --> 00:28:04,720
Let's stop for now.

285
00:28:04,826 --> 00:28:12,324
Let me talk to him. I'll
straighten him out.

286
00:28:12,433 --> 00:28:19,397
Fine. I'll leave it to you for
today. Thanks.

287
00:28:30,184 --> 00:28:33,712
You were just acting?

288
00:28:33,821 --> 00:28:36,188
No, it was real.

289
00:28:36,457 --> 00:28:41,088
I'd cry all day to save
a million.

290
00:29:08,022 --> 00:29:09,820
An adult motel...

291
00:29:26,073 --> 00:29:29,532
25, 26, 27...

292
00:29:34,248 --> 00:29:35,910
28 cars.

293
00:29:36,651 --> 00:29:40,713
There's some Chinese dumplings
in the fridge.

294
00:29:41,556 --> 00:29:42,819
Found them? Now, sweetie...

295
00:29:42,924 --> 00:29:44,950
Put them in the microwave.

296
00:29:46,627 --> 00:29:49,654
You can do it.
You're 5, a big boy now.

297
00:29:51,465 --> 00:29:52,524
Did you put them in?

298
00:29:53,167 --> 00:29:55,898
Now set the dial to 5 minutes
and push the button.

299
00:29:57,071 --> 00:30:03,033
No, no. The white dial.
Set it to...

300
00:30:03,678 --> 00:30:11,484
Hello? Hello, sweetie?

301
00:30:17,792 --> 00:30:21,524
I counted quickly, so I'm not
sure. But...

302
00:30:21,629 --> 00:30:28,934
30 rooms, 3 times a day at
6,000 yen.

303
00:30:29,036 --> 00:30:31,528
And 60% profit that's
about 120 million a year.

304
00:30:31,639 --> 00:30:32,504
Your cowlick.

305
00:30:32,607 --> 00:30:33,597
Oh, yes.

306
00:30:34,141 --> 00:30:35,268
Let me see that.

307
00:30:44,218 --> 00:30:47,313
Very low declared income.

308
00:30:49,357 --> 00:30:51,223
And he does real estate, too.

309
00:30:51,325 --> 00:30:53,851
I'd like to investigate him.

310
00:30:54,662 --> 00:30:59,032
All right. Hideki Gondo.
46, eh?

311
00:30:59,634 --> 00:31:04,072
No. Please don't.

312
00:31:09,810 --> 00:31:11,870
Why not?

313
00:31:12,446 --> 00:31:16,941
It's Memorial Day.

314
00:31:17,051 --> 00:31:19,680
So what?

315
00:31:24,558 --> 00:31:28,962
No, please. Not today.

316
00:31:29,063 --> 00:31:30,122
Why not?

317
00:31:30,231 --> 00:31:33,827
The ancestors are watching.

318
00:31:33,935 --> 00:31:36,166
Let them if they want.

319
00:31:38,539 --> 00:31:40,599
Hold it. Stay there.

320
00:31:41,742 --> 00:31:43,677
Black...not bad at all.

321
00:31:44,779 --> 00:31:46,941
Black sheets might work.

322
00:31:47,581 --> 00:31:49,914
We could use them at the
motels.

323
00:31:54,855 --> 00:32:02,854
Is the president in? Have him
call me. It's about sheets.

324
00:32:03,798 --> 00:32:07,929
A million for you for this
month.

325
00:32:08,769 --> 00:32:16,541
Yesterday's statements.
Get them on the garbage truck.

326
00:32:24,819 --> 00:32:29,917
If the tax office found them,
I'd be in big trouble.

327
00:32:30,858 --> 00:32:32,884
It's your job now.

328
00:33:35,356 --> 00:33:38,793
Old man Hakamada is dead.

329
00:33:40,594 --> 00:33:45,259
Bankrupt the company. Close the
bank account.

330
00:33:45,666 --> 00:33:49,296
Then issue a promissory note
to my company.

331
00:33:49,537 --> 00:33:50,800
How much?

332
00:33:50,905 --> 00:33:53,136
120 million.

333
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:54,708
Right, sir.

334
00:33:55,142 --> 00:33:57,441
There's somebody to see you.

335
00:33:57,545 --> 00:33:58,535
Who?

336
00:33:58,779 --> 00:34:02,045
He got your name from Maruo,
the loan shark.

337
00:34:11,258 --> 00:34:12,692
Who are you?

338
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:20,528
I don't use calling cards. I'm
a "cleaner." I clean money.

339
00:34:21,669 --> 00:34:26,869
Men like you end up with lots
of secret money. It's fine...

340
00:34:26,974 --> 00:34:32,413
But it has to stay secret.

341
00:34:32,746 --> 00:34:36,080
If you use it, the taxmen will
catch you.

342
00:34:40,121 --> 00:34:45,150
If I clean 50 million for you
right now, how much do I get?

343
00:34:47,428 --> 00:34:50,091
People pay 10 percent for
buying receipts, right?

344
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:52,658
So?

345
00:35:04,445 --> 00:35:09,850
A prizewinning lottery ticket
for 50 million. See?

346
00:35:22,696 --> 00:35:32,695
So you sell me this ticket for
55 million? That's a new one!

347
00:35:34,608 --> 00:35:37,076
SPRING

348
00:35:37,278 --> 00:35:43,013
The Audit Dept. is going to
focus on adult motels.

349
00:35:43,617 --> 00:35:47,315
Of course, they deal only in cash.

350
00:35:47,521 --> 00:35:49,513
What's the most important
factor?

351
00:35:51,025 --> 00:36:01,024
No receipts. So, it's easy to
hide income.

352
00:36:01,635 --> 00:36:08,701
And since expenses are low,
profit margins are high.

353
00:36:09,109 --> 00:36:18,348
Usually 65%. It's very
lucrative.

354
00:36:18,452 --> 00:36:24,756
That means most are tax
evaders.

355
00:36:25,092 --> 00:36:28,062
A perfect time to check on
Gondo Trading, eh?

356
00:36:28,162 --> 00:36:28,561
Yes.

357
00:36:28,662 --> 00:36:30,358
Are you ready?

358
00:36:30,464 --> 00:36:31,397
Yes.

359
00:36:31,699 --> 00:36:36,637
Why don't you start with the
linen supplier?

360
00:36:36,737 --> 00:36:37,500
Yes, sir.

361
00:36:58,025 --> 00:37:02,861
Will you be much longer?
I want to go out.

362
00:37:03,297 --> 00:37:07,758
Not long. Go ahead.
I'm all right on my own.

363
00:37:07,868 --> 00:37:12,863
OK. But who are you checking,
anyway?

364
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:16,902
It can't be us. The auditors
were here just last year.

365
00:37:17,011 --> 00:37:21,779
I only want to confirm some
details. Don't worry.

366
00:37:22,283 --> 00:37:31,090
Take your time.

367
00:37:52,479 --> 00:37:55,210
I'm Tax Auditor Itakura.

368
00:37:55,316 --> 00:37:58,150
Hello. Come right in.

369
00:38:06,327 --> 00:38:08,558
That's the first time the
string worked.

370
00:38:09,797 --> 00:38:12,164
You're more of a pro than
you look.

371
00:38:12,599 --> 00:38:14,261
I like that.

372
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:21,474
Where's your partner?

373
00:38:21,575 --> 00:38:22,634
Partner?

374
00:38:24,611 --> 00:38:25,670
You came alone?

375
00:38:25,779 --> 00:38:27,008
Yes.

376
00:38:28,515 --> 00:38:30,541
A woman...

377
00:38:30,651 --> 00:38:31,710
Pardon?

378
00:38:32,586 --> 00:38:39,550
Sorry, I mean...it's great
to have a lady auditor.

379
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:40,389
What do you mean?

380
00:38:40,494 --> 00:38:43,225
Never mind. Have seat.

381
00:39:10,090 --> 00:39:11,080
What's this?

382
00:39:11,959 --> 00:39:13,359
A leopard.

383
00:39:14,762 --> 00:39:19,791
Cute. He has freckles, too.

384
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:23,161
It's from Animal Takahashi,
the pro wrestler.

385
00:39:23,270 --> 00:39:28,004
I saved him from a gang of
loan sharks.

386
00:39:28,409 --> 00:39:34,349
I never make money because
I'm always helping people.

387
00:39:35,416 --> 00:39:36,145
Want a drink?

388
00:39:36,250 --> 00:39:38,116
No thanks. I'm on duty.

389
00:39:38,218 --> 00:39:42,417
Is it fun to give us citizens
a hard time?

390
00:39:42,656 --> 00:39:45,387
No, it's only work.

391
00:39:45,826 --> 00:39:47,260
To taxes!

392
00:39:47,661 --> 00:39:54,158
Let's begin. Names and birth
dates of your family, please.

393
00:40:03,710 --> 00:40:08,114
Hideki Gondo, that's me.

394
00:40:08,749 --> 00:40:13,619
Taro is my son.

395
00:40:13,821 --> 00:40:18,987
And Mitsuko Sugino
lives with me.

396
00:40:23,197 --> 00:40:24,927
My wife is dead.

397
00:40:25,699 --> 00:40:28,931
Mitsuko is my common-law wife
so to speak.

398
00:40:29,570 --> 00:40:35,976
When I grow a little fonder
of her, we'll marry, and...

399
00:40:37,377 --> 00:40:42,179
I'll give her some of my money.
Want to know how?

400
00:40:43,183 --> 00:40:44,310
How?

401
00:40:47,321 --> 00:40:49,153
I'll divorce her and...

402
00:40:50,257 --> 00:40:55,252
Give her plenty of alimony.
Alimony is tax-free, see?

403
00:40:55,729 --> 00:41:00,360
And then we remarry.

404
00:41:00,834 --> 00:41:04,498
That's how much I'd do for the
woman I love.

405
00:41:04,872 --> 00:41:08,206
She might run away the minute
she gets the money.

406
00:41:16,917 --> 00:41:22,515
The sheets at your hotel. The
unit price is above average.

407
00:41:22,823 --> 00:41:28,057
You think I inflate it to hide
the number of customers?

408
00:41:29,196 --> 00:41:32,963
I'm not cheap, Ms. Itakura.

409
00:41:33,834 --> 00:41:39,034
You see, we use special sheets,
dyed to order.

410
00:41:39,373 --> 00:41:42,605
That's why they're costly.

411
00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:48,512
See this pink? Lovely, with
just a tinge of yellow.

412
00:41:49,149 --> 00:41:52,642
It's the most flattering color
for Japanese women.

413
00:41:57,124 --> 00:41:59,491
Hey, you look gorgeous.

414
00:42:00,260 --> 00:42:02,786
And here's a black one.

415
00:42:06,967 --> 00:42:11,063
Oh, it's very becoming on you.

416
00:42:12,639 --> 00:42:17,043
What about this bad debt of
120 million?

417
00:42:20,314 --> 00:42:21,646
Hakamada Real Estate.

418
00:42:21,748 --> 00:42:24,377
What is it?

419
00:42:24,718 --> 00:42:31,750
A real headache, that's what.
Keeps me awake at night.

420
00:42:36,730 --> 00:42:39,256
A fine old man he was.

421
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:45,329
But he lost about 100 million
in speculation.

422
00:42:45,872 --> 00:42:53,109
He issued a lot of promissory
notes, then, poof! Bankruptcy.

423
00:42:53,580 --> 00:43:00,680
See this note on the check?
It says "payment refused."

424
00:43:01,154 --> 00:43:03,885
May I borrow this for a while?

425
00:43:04,458 --> 00:43:10,056
About this loan of 50 million
yen from Kihachiro Ninagawa.

426
00:43:10,697 --> 00:43:13,030
Do you have documents for it?

427
00:43:15,469 --> 00:43:19,497
There's nothing on paper.

428
00:43:19,973 --> 00:43:25,037
I wanted some, but he refused.

429
00:43:27,247 --> 00:43:28,442
Hop in.

430
00:43:28,849 --> 00:43:31,409
No, thank you. I'll take a cab.

431
00:43:31,518 --> 00:43:33,077
Come on.

432
00:43:33,186 --> 00:43:37,214
No. It might make other
taxpayers suspicious.

433
00:43:38,759 --> 00:43:40,557
We're strict about that.

434
00:43:40,894 --> 00:43:44,422
Ishii? It's me.

435
00:43:44,631 --> 00:43:47,191
I'm coming over with a nosy
tax collector.

436
00:43:47,300 --> 00:43:48,529
I got it.

437
00:43:54,841 --> 00:43:58,039
Open up 210. I'll hide there
with the books.

438
00:44:16,263 --> 00:44:17,959
This is the computer.

439
00:44:19,032 --> 00:44:25,905
They show all-nighters, short-
timers and rooms being cleaned.

440
00:44:26,139 --> 00:44:28,438
Only five vacancies.
Business is good.

441
00:44:33,780 --> 00:44:37,114
This locks the door
automatically.

442
00:44:37,551 --> 00:44:41,283
They can't open it from
inside.

443
00:44:41,388 --> 00:44:42,583
How do they get out?

444
00:44:42,689 --> 00:44:43,850
They call us.

445
00:44:43,957 --> 00:44:46,950
We then push this button.

446
00:44:47,060 --> 00:44:48,460
And in emergency?

447
00:44:50,097 --> 00:44:52,589
This unlocks all the doors.

448
00:44:53,467 --> 00:44:54,491
Want to see the rooms?

449
00:44:54,601 --> 00:44:56,194
Yes, very much.

450
00:45:31,838 --> 00:45:36,242
Mitsuko? I'm on my way home
with a tax collector.

451
00:45:36,543 --> 00:45:41,072
Take anything she shouldn't
see to the safety deposit box.

452
00:46:20,987 --> 00:46:23,547
Oh, hello. I'm going to
the bank.

453
00:46:23,657 --> 00:46:27,094
I'll check the mahjong parlor
that's for sale.

454
00:46:27,194 --> 00:46:31,564
Let's not talk business
in front of a guest.

455
00:46:31,665 --> 00:46:35,432
Guess who this is? Ms. Itakura
from the Tax Office.

456
00:46:35,535 --> 00:46:37,663
Good morning. How are you?

457
00:46:37,771 --> 00:46:42,835
She's suspicious. But I'm
no a tax evader, am I?

458
00:46:42,943 --> 00:46:47,779
If I were, I'd change the
company address every year.

459
00:46:47,881 --> 00:46:50,908
Super idea, isn't it?

460
00:46:51,017 --> 00:46:59,187
Our computers flag the changes.
We check them all the time.

461
00:46:59,392 --> 00:47:03,796
See? She's so smart.

462
00:47:03,897 --> 00:47:06,093
Smart and attractive.

463
00:47:08,201 --> 00:47:09,897
See you later.

464
00:47:14,341 --> 00:47:15,866
Hey, wait, that bag...

465
00:47:34,427 --> 00:47:37,226
A twin of the hotel computer.

466
00:47:37,631 --> 00:47:44,128
To check up on my employees.

467
00:47:52,445 --> 00:47:55,938
Wow! I didn't know you could
do that.

468
00:47:56,049 --> 00:48:03,684
You scroll the screen to here,
wait, and then it returns.

469
00:48:05,258 --> 00:48:06,453
Would you like to try?

470
00:48:07,193 --> 00:48:08,024
May I?

471
00:48:08,161 --> 00:48:09,288
Sure.

472
00:48:09,396 --> 00:48:10,864
I'm terrible.

473
00:48:15,936 --> 00:48:21,898
That one. You got to squat
and jump to get it.

474
00:48:22,909 --> 00:48:25,538
Good one! You're good.

475
00:49:15,362 --> 00:49:18,230
How did you know I was here?

476
00:49:19,599 --> 00:49:23,195
You're a good investigator,
but not a good "investigatee."

477
00:49:23,303 --> 00:49:23,998
May I sit down?

478
00:49:24,104 --> 00:49:25,037
Go ahead.

479
00:49:25,438 --> 00:49:27,998
A beer and separate checks.

480
00:49:30,210 --> 00:49:33,339
Why are you drinking so late?
What about your family?

481
00:49:33,580 --> 00:49:36,049
My mother is babysitting
tonight.

482
00:49:36,216 --> 00:49:37,445
And your husband?

483
00:49:38,451 --> 00:49:40,044
I'm divorced.

484
00:49:50,597 --> 00:49:51,792
Congratulations!

485
00:49:51,898 --> 00:49:52,524
On what?

486
00:49:52,665 --> 00:49:53,792
Your birthday.

487
00:49:53,900 --> 00:49:57,735
Is it? Yeah, it is. How did you...

488
00:49:57,837 --> 00:50:02,298
Not a good "investigatee," eh?
You told me your birth date.

489
00:50:02,409 --> 00:50:04,037
Touché.

490
00:50:04,644 --> 00:50:06,806
So...it's my birthday.

491
00:50:06,913 --> 00:50:07,744
Happy birthday.

492
00:50:07,847 --> 00:50:08,871
Thanks.

493
00:50:18,191 --> 00:50:22,287
I have to work harder. My son
still has a long way to go...

494
00:50:22,395 --> 00:50:24,921
Taro. He's so sweet.

495
00:50:25,031 --> 00:50:28,331
He's good-natured all right,
but he's too dreamy.

496
00:50:29,803 --> 00:50:33,262
How could a man like me have
a son like him?

497
00:50:33,673 --> 00:50:37,303
Because part of you is like
that, too.

498
00:50:37,644 --> 00:50:40,170
What? Never.

499
00:50:40,580 --> 00:50:45,382
Your hotel rooms say so.
You're selling dreams.

500
00:50:56,763 --> 00:51:02,669
If I thought he could get all
my money I'd die happy.

501
00:51:06,272 --> 00:51:08,036
Do me a favor.

502
00:51:10,310 --> 00:51:15,874
I'll explain an idea to give
him money tax-free.

503
00:51:15,982 --> 00:51:18,645
Just nod your head
if it would work.

504
00:51:18,751 --> 00:51:19,411
No, I couldn't.

505
00:51:19,519 --> 00:51:28,360
Listen. I vouch for his loan. He
buys a company in the red.

506
00:51:28,461 --> 00:51:32,831
We make it break even, then
merge it with my company.

507
00:51:33,133 --> 00:51:38,265
We double the capital of the
new company, get a loan...

508
00:51:38,371 --> 00:51:39,236
Then we...

509
00:51:39,606 --> 00:51:40,665
Wait!

510
00:51:56,589 --> 00:52:04,258
Sure I did. I loaned
50 million to Gondo.

511
00:52:04,364 --> 00:52:07,698
So you did. May I see
the papers?

512
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:10,099
What frigging papers?

513
00:52:11,971 --> 00:52:16,705
I'm Ninagawa of the Kanto
Ninagawa Family.

514
00:52:16,809 --> 00:52:20,871
If I say I loaned it, I loaned it.

515
00:52:21,047 --> 00:52:24,984
But if you make a loan, then
you would...

516
00:52:25,084 --> 00:52:27,349
Prepare some documents...

517
00:52:27,453 --> 00:52:28,887
Specifying the interest
and terms...

518
00:52:28,988 --> 00:52:32,652
Hey, shut up. If you loan
a friend 5,000 for a cab...

519
00:52:32,759 --> 00:52:37,288
You want a document?
You charge him interest?

520
00:52:37,397 --> 00:52:39,423
But for a large sum like
50 million yen...

521
00:52:39,532 --> 00:52:40,693
Dumb bitch.

522
00:52:42,402 --> 00:52:46,863
It's relative. 50 million is
nothing for us. Understand?

523
00:52:46,973 --> 00:52:55,905
For peanuts like 50 million,
we trust each other.

524
00:52:56,649 --> 00:53:00,518
Documents? Why the hell do we
need documents?

525
00:53:02,522 --> 00:53:05,583
Hey, honey, you commute by
subway?

526
00:53:07,594 --> 00:53:12,157
Yes, the Minatomachi Line.

527
00:53:12,465 --> 00:53:15,333
Don't go near the edge of
the platform.

528
00:53:17,437 --> 00:53:20,635
I hear you got a cute little son.

529
00:53:21,574 --> 00:53:22,872
Be careful.

530
00:53:25,245 --> 00:53:28,682
Yes, Mr. Gondo is one of our
customers.

531
00:53:28,781 --> 00:53:31,046
Then, as this audit warrant
says...

532
00:53:31,150 --> 00:53:34,746
I would like all information on
the accounts and transactions...

533
00:53:34,854 --> 00:53:39,019
Of Gondo Trading, Hideki Gondo,
Taro Gondo and Mitsuko Sugino.

534
00:53:39,092 --> 00:53:40,856
What is "all information"?

535
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:48,060
Everything related to them,
no matter what name it's under.

536
00:53:48,167 --> 00:53:56,303
False names are difficult.

537
00:53:56,743 --> 00:54:00,874
If someone asks to use a fake
name, we can check.

538
00:54:00,980 --> 00:54:05,008
But if a person registers his
own name, address and seal...

539
00:54:05,118 --> 00:54:09,317
We can't know if he is acting
for someone else.

540
00:54:10,456 --> 00:54:16,054
Banks get all kinds of money.

541
00:54:16,162 --> 00:54:21,032
Real names, false names,
taxed, untaxed.

542
00:54:21,134 --> 00:54:23,569
We can't tell which is which.

543
00:54:24,304 --> 00:54:27,433
That's not our job.

544
00:54:27,540 --> 00:54:31,636
Of course you can see
everything if you insist.

545
00:54:31,744 --> 00:54:37,047
We have some 40,000 accounts.
Check them all if you like.

546
00:54:44,657 --> 00:54:46,819
"GONDO TRADING"

547
00:55:35,475 --> 00:55:43,611
I checked all the records. No
hint of a fake Gondo account.

548
00:55:43,716 --> 00:55:50,623
We have to crack that gangster
and the dummy land company.

549
00:55:54,961 --> 00:55:59,194
We might need help from the
Tax Inspection Bureau.

550
00:56:00,133 --> 00:56:05,231
I suppose so. The Bureau can...

551
00:56:15,348 --> 00:56:16,646
Here comes Ninagawa!

552
00:56:27,360 --> 00:56:28,760
Get me the top man.

553
00:56:30,863 --> 00:56:33,799
I'm Ninagawa of the Kanto
Ninagawa Family.

554
00:56:34,300 --> 00:56:37,168
He's in a meeting right now.

555
00:56:37,270 --> 00:56:41,332
I am the general affairs
chief. May I help you?

556
00:56:41,441 --> 00:56:44,240
No. You can't help me.
Get me the boss.

557
00:56:44,343 --> 00:56:45,606
As I said...

558
00:56:45,711 --> 00:56:49,204
What's more important,
a meeting or taxpayers?

559
00:56:49,482 --> 00:56:52,509
Please explain your problem.

560
00:56:52,618 --> 00:56:54,246
Fellow citizens!

561
00:56:54,887 --> 00:56:59,120
I'm Kihachiro Ninagawa.

562
00:56:59,225 --> 00:57:05,495
A taxpayer just like you.

563
00:57:05,698 --> 00:57:12,832
I work very hard to do
what I can for our country.

564
00:57:12,939 --> 00:57:21,643
I declare my income, and I was
about to pay my taxes.

565
00:57:22,014 --> 00:57:30,115
Then these stupid bureaucrats
sent some bitch of an auditor.

566
00:57:30,690 --> 00:57:39,156
These farts of petty bureau-
crats live off our taxes.

567
00:57:39,365 --> 00:57:45,362
And they have the nerve to
raid our homes and workplaces...

568
00:57:45,471 --> 00:57:51,672
To investigate us like crooks.

569
00:57:51,978 --> 00:58:00,409
It's against all human decency
and insults our dignity.

570
00:58:01,554 --> 00:58:03,250
What's so funny?

571
00:58:03,689 --> 00:58:05,783
You, there.

572
00:58:07,159 --> 00:58:10,254
I'm talking to you, idiot.
Can't you hear?

573
00:58:10,530 --> 00:58:14,865
What are you grinning at?
I'm talking serious.

574
00:58:20,606 --> 00:58:26,102
The Director is free to see
you now.

575
00:58:26,212 --> 00:58:28,909
Please come this way.

576
00:58:38,090 --> 00:58:39,718
That's absurd.
Let's call the police.

577
00:58:39,825 --> 00:58:42,920
We can't. Unless they get
violent or break something.

578
00:58:43,029 --> 00:58:44,827
Is that right?

579
00:58:44,964 --> 00:58:45,897
Coffee cups!

580
00:58:48,568 --> 00:58:49,831
Salt. Give me salt.

581
00:58:52,972 --> 00:58:57,307
Whether we trust you is not
the issue.

582
00:58:57,810 --> 00:59:02,612
It's whether Mr. Gondo's tax
returns are accurate.

583
00:59:02,882 --> 00:59:05,647
In other words you don't
trust me.

584
00:59:05,751 --> 00:59:07,811
As I said, it's not that...

585
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:09,513
Then you trust me?

586
00:59:10,156 --> 00:59:13,285
You'll stop auditing Gondo?

587
00:59:13,459 --> 00:59:15,519
Come on, answer me!

588
00:59:15,628 --> 00:59:18,462
Are you going to stop auditing
him or not?

589
00:59:18,564 --> 00:59:26,062
Now, an audit simply clarifies
if the declared items are true.

590
00:59:26,172 --> 00:59:28,698
They're true you idiot.

591
00:59:29,208 --> 00:59:35,170
You say I'm lying? Do you want
me to get you fired?

592
00:59:35,514 --> 00:59:36,538
Give me the phone.

593
00:59:38,884 --> 00:59:43,379
Get me the Director General
of Tax Agency.

594
00:59:43,990 --> 00:59:47,552
Shut up and do it.

595
00:59:48,828 --> 00:59:51,559
This is Ninagawa of the Kanto
Ninagawa Family.

596
00:59:52,064 --> 00:59:57,162
Not there? Tell him I'll come
to his house tonight.

597
00:59:58,371 --> 01:00:04,402
Hey, you're the sweetie who
came over. Coffee? Good girl.

598
01:00:16,055 --> 01:00:16,715
Damn it!

599
01:00:17,023 --> 01:00:18,184
Sweet enough for you?

600
01:00:18,324 --> 01:00:19,383
Bitch!

601
01:00:20,159 --> 01:00:22,492
Call the police. Willful
destruction of public property.

602
01:00:41,781 --> 01:00:42,976
I won't forget this!

603
01:00:56,462 --> 01:00:57,725
Pardon me.

604
01:01:02,368 --> 01:01:07,466
I'm looking for Hakamada Real
Estate's office.

605
01:01:07,573 --> 01:01:09,439
Hakamada Real Estate?

606
01:01:09,542 --> 01:01:11,374
It's building number 53.

607
01:01:11,477 --> 01:01:17,212
53...see that blue truck?
It's right there.

608
01:01:37,065 --> 01:01:39,432
SUMMER

609
01:01:50,178 --> 01:01:52,807
"...APPOINTED AN INSPECTOR..."

610
01:01:57,151 --> 01:01:59,017
Congratulations!

611
01:02:02,657 --> 01:02:10,429
You're the best I've known.
You deserve your promotion.

612
01:02:11,699 --> 01:02:15,261
Thank you, sir. I couldn't
have done it without you.

613
01:02:17,472 --> 01:02:18,940
Watch your cowlick.

614
01:02:25,213 --> 01:02:29,378
It's a tough job, so look
after yourself.

615
01:02:31,319 --> 01:02:35,017
I feel like the bride's
father...

616
01:02:35,123 --> 01:02:39,493
"TOKYO REGIONAL
TAX ADMINISTRATION"

617
01:02:54,909 --> 01:02:58,402
"INSPECTION BUREAU"

618
01:03:09,790 --> 01:03:11,224
I'm Ryoko Itakura...

619
01:03:11,325 --> 01:03:15,421
The new inspector, reporting
for duty.

620
01:03:15,530 --> 01:03:20,298
Hello! I have been expecting you.

621
01:03:20,501 --> 01:03:24,268
Come this way. I'll take you
to your superior.

622
01:03:25,406 --> 01:03:30,208
Quiet, isn't it? 150 people
are out on a raid today.

623
01:03:31,846 --> 01:03:35,840
This is the command center
for the raid.

624
01:03:42,490 --> 01:03:48,794
Meet your new inspector,
Ryoko Itakura.

625
01:03:48,996 --> 01:03:50,589
Ryoko? Glad to meet you.

626
01:03:50,698 --> 01:03:55,966
I needed a lady. They're rare.
She'll be very useful.

627
01:04:00,074 --> 01:04:07,880
They're slave drivers. It's
day and night, 365 days a year.

628
01:04:08,616 --> 01:04:10,949
He hasn't been home in 3 days.

629
01:04:11,052 --> 01:04:13,544
You've been on 4 days yourself.

630
01:04:15,122 --> 01:04:16,818
I brought the president.

631
01:04:16,924 --> 01:04:18,984
Use Room 5.

632
01:04:21,028 --> 01:04:23,554
I'll go back to the extra-
marital's house.

633
01:04:27,902 --> 01:04:32,272
Ryoko. Come with me to the
extramarital's place.

634
01:04:32,373 --> 01:04:34,274
She just came to say hello.

635
01:04:34,375 --> 01:04:35,673
She's official, isn't she?

636
01:04:35,776 --> 01:04:36,800
Yes, but...

637
01:04:36,911 --> 01:04:37,708
Come on.

638
01:04:37,812 --> 01:04:39,075
I'd like to.

639
01:04:39,413 --> 01:04:45,114
Maybe you should. If we
search the extramarital...

640
01:04:47,388 --> 01:04:48,981
What's an extramarital?

641
01:04:49,090 --> 01:04:51,286
Oh, it means "mistress."

642
01:05:07,742 --> 01:05:12,237
Got certificates and notes,
but not the deposit box key.

643
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:14,212
Maybe it's on her body?

644
01:05:14,949 --> 01:05:20,650
We let her change. I think she
hid something in her bosom.

645
01:05:20,755 --> 01:05:23,384
I think so, too.

646
01:05:23,491 --> 01:05:29,453
Then she's been washing dishes
for the last 20 minutes.

647
01:05:35,202 --> 01:05:38,604
Sorry, ma'am, we'd like you to
change once again.

648
01:05:39,674 --> 01:05:42,303
Why? I'm fine in this.

649
01:05:42,410 --> 01:05:46,211
We want to check that
pretty dress.

650
01:05:46,314 --> 01:05:50,775
Why? Nothing's hidden in it.

651
01:05:50,885 --> 01:05:52,820
I saw you hide something.

652
01:05:52,920 --> 01:05:53,717
I did not.

653
01:05:53,821 --> 01:05:55,414
Then you won't mind a search.

654
01:05:55,523 --> 01:05:58,891
I saw you put something
between your breasts.

655
01:05:58,993 --> 01:06:00,484
There's nothing between my
breasts.

656
01:06:00,594 --> 01:06:02,028
You're sure?

657
01:06:02,129 --> 01:06:02,926
Of course I'm sure.

658
01:06:03,030 --> 01:06:04,828
But we're not!

659
01:06:05,399 --> 01:06:11,930
I'll strip, then. And what if
you don't find anything?

660
01:06:12,039 --> 01:06:18,377
Calm down. We're only
doing our job.

661
01:06:18,479 --> 01:06:23,508
Here's a lady inspector and
a search warrant for your person.

662
01:06:25,986 --> 01:06:29,787
All right, look!

663
01:06:43,204 --> 01:06:46,368
Where's the key?

664
01:06:47,508 --> 01:06:50,034
You boys like naked women?

665
01:06:55,015 --> 01:06:56,950
Women have this, too.

666
01:06:57,051 --> 01:06:59,486
Look! Don't you want to
search this, too?

667
01:06:59,587 --> 01:07:00,486
Uh...

668
01:07:00,588 --> 01:07:02,784
Somebody cover her up.

669
01:07:17,705 --> 01:07:21,198
Excuse me. Could this be it?

670
01:07:24,512 --> 01:07:25,445
Where?

671
01:07:25,546 --> 01:07:28,141
Under the kitchen sink.

672
01:07:31,285 --> 01:07:36,280
How did she hide it there?
I was sure she put it in her bra.

673
01:07:45,633 --> 01:07:49,365
Good job!

674
01:07:49,470 --> 01:07:54,170
Say, this is Ryoko Itakura.
She joined us today.

675
01:07:54,275 --> 01:07:56,369
It's a pleasure, gentlemen.

676
01:10:53,554 --> 01:10:54,988
Inspection.

677
01:10:57,925 --> 01:10:59,393
You have a tip for us?

678
01:11:00,194 --> 01:11:03,460
Yes, we're the people who
investigate tax evaders.

679
01:11:04,298 --> 01:11:08,497
What's the company called?

680
01:11:09,603 --> 01:11:10,696
Gondo Trading?

681
01:11:12,072 --> 01:11:15,008
Here's an address.

682
01:11:15,242 --> 01:11:16,471
Ready?

683
01:11:19,446 --> 01:11:24,441
A woman named Kumi Torikai...

684
01:11:25,352 --> 01:11:31,383
At 305 Beach Street, Minatomachi

685
01:11:33,260 --> 01:11:38,096
She takes out the garbage in
the morning...

686
01:11:38,198 --> 01:11:42,659
Check the garbage? You mean...

687
01:11:43,871 --> 01:11:46,568
Hello? Hello?

688
01:11:55,015 --> 01:11:56,210
She hung up.

689
01:12:03,557 --> 01:12:07,494
Minatomachi, that's your
old bailiwick.

690
01:12:07,961 --> 01:12:09,520
Do you know Gondo Trading?

691
01:12:09,630 --> 01:12:10,563
Yes.

692
01:12:11,165 --> 01:12:12,599
Want to handle it?

693
01:12:12,700 --> 01:12:15,397
I'd love to.

694
01:14:12,953 --> 01:14:15,286
I got it! I got it!

695
01:14:29,369 --> 01:14:30,598
Good job.

696
01:14:31,271 --> 01:14:35,641
I've approved an investigation
of Gondo Trading.

697
01:14:35,742 --> 01:14:37,176
Thank you, sir.

698
01:14:37,578 --> 01:14:40,480
What's the most important in
investigating?

699
01:14:41,181 --> 01:14:44,276
That it's undercover.

700
01:14:44,384 --> 01:14:49,721
Yes. Four people for
groundwork...

701
01:14:49,823 --> 01:14:52,884
And a hundred for the raid.

702
01:14:52,993 --> 01:14:53,858
Yes.

703
01:14:53,961 --> 01:14:58,695
Normally, if so many people
move, there's a leak.

704
01:14:58,799 --> 01:14:59,494
Yes.

705
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:04,265
But our investigation have
never leaked before.

706
01:15:05,239 --> 01:15:05,934
I see.

707
01:15:06,039 --> 01:15:10,568
So, if it leaks this time, you
will be the prime suspect.

708
01:15:11,245 --> 01:15:14,113
It's a joke. I'm sorry...

709
01:15:14,248 --> 01:15:21,553
But Gondo knows you. Be very,
very careful.

710
01:15:55,756 --> 01:15:58,191
Focus on the man. Get closer.

711
01:16:06,066 --> 01:16:08,001
That man. You know him?

712
01:16:09,269 --> 01:16:11,932
President of a Gondo motel.

713
01:16:13,540 --> 01:16:16,009
He's bringing today's proceeds.

714
01:16:19,112 --> 01:16:20,603
Look, another one.

715
01:16:23,083 --> 01:16:24,176
Who?

716
01:16:27,321 --> 01:16:28,289
I don't know.

717
01:16:28,956 --> 01:16:30,185
Check the license.

718
01:16:32,392 --> 01:16:33,951
Zoom in.

719
01:16:35,896 --> 01:16:38,627
Focus! Can you read it?

720
01:16:39,066 --> 01:16:45,302
Kawasaki 55 MU 7220.

721
01:16:47,574 --> 01:16:51,636
Another one! Maybe there's
a party tonight.

722
01:16:55,115 --> 01:16:59,109
The license numbers belong to
the presidents of this motels.

723
01:16:59,219 --> 01:17:00,448
Show us the hotels.

724
01:17:04,691 --> 01:17:05,715
One in Yushima...

725
01:17:08,462 --> 01:17:09,862
Sankocho...

726
01:17:11,665 --> 01:17:12,758
Akasaka and...

727
01:17:14,534 --> 01:17:17,561
Kawanoe. These are the
presidents of them.

728
01:17:17,971 --> 01:17:19,439
What relation to Gondo?

729
01:17:19,539 --> 01:17:23,237
Gondo is a director of each hotel.

730
01:17:23,343 --> 01:17:26,279
You mean presidents deliver
money to director?

731
01:17:27,447 --> 01:17:31,714
In other words, he's the real
owner, right?

732
01:18:09,723 --> 01:18:12,420
Good morning. I'm from
Otani Bank.

733
01:18:13,427 --> 01:18:16,124
They're named in his books.

734
01:18:19,766 --> 01:18:21,359
Gondo is coming up.

735
01:18:36,983 --> 01:18:38,576
Let's trail him.

736
01:19:10,317 --> 01:19:12,946
This will lead to his
extramarital, right?

737
01:19:13,053 --> 01:19:13,884
Yes.

738
01:19:14,254 --> 01:19:19,818
In the morning? I wouldn't
feel up to it this early.

739
01:20:23,290 --> 01:20:26,419
Hi, darling.

740
01:20:44,744 --> 01:20:49,580
They're having a good time in
there. It might be a while.

741
01:20:53,753 --> 01:20:56,985
Pretend we're lovers.

742
01:20:57,090 --> 01:20:59,184
So nobody will suspect us.

743
01:21:03,830 --> 01:21:06,800
Put your head down.

744
01:21:07,968 --> 01:21:13,999
Shake it, like you're sulking.

745
01:21:54,381 --> 01:21:56,350
Hi. Come on in.

746
01:21:56,449 --> 01:21:58,042
Good morning.

747
01:22:08,028 --> 01:22:09,656
No identification.

748
01:22:10,430 --> 01:22:12,865
But he smells like a banker.

749
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:17,596
You follow him. I'll stay here
and watch.

750
01:22:58,778 --> 01:23:02,340
The hidden income flows to
this bank, eh?

751
01:23:02,449 --> 01:23:08,582
Yes. Gondo's common-law wife
has a safety deposit box there.

752
01:23:08,688 --> 01:23:12,318
I rented one myself and went
in when she did, to check.

753
01:23:13,727 --> 01:23:15,195
We've got it on video.

754
01:23:15,295 --> 01:23:17,662
Hey, Ijuin. You look great.

755
01:23:17,764 --> 01:23:19,995
He's our Jack Nicholson...

756
01:23:20,100 --> 01:23:22,069
They're going in.

757
01:23:29,776 --> 01:23:31,438
She's Mitsuko Sugino.

758
01:23:31,644 --> 01:23:32,976
The necklace...

759
01:23:35,415 --> 01:23:36,542
Now watch.

760
01:23:38,551 --> 01:23:41,988
She's wearing a different
necklace.

761
01:24:39,379 --> 01:24:40,369
Good luck.

762
01:24:47,587 --> 01:24:50,147
Oh god! It's awful!

763
01:24:50,457 --> 01:24:59,366
You OK? Sorry. But it's
impossible to park in front.

764
01:25:14,047 --> 01:25:17,643
Shit, they actually threw me
in jail.

765
01:25:17,750 --> 01:25:21,380
Thanks for keeping your mouth
shut until we got you out.

766
01:25:21,488 --> 01:25:24,549
I almost told them,
but I held back.

767
01:25:25,725 --> 01:25:28,058
That's my boy. A model inspector.

768
01:25:29,462 --> 01:25:30,452
Chief!

769
01:25:31,331 --> 01:25:33,926
Got a rough count of his real
income yet?

770
01:25:34,033 --> 01:25:38,232
Still checking. But so far,
we estimate...

771
01:25:38,338 --> 01:25:42,036
Some 50 million a year for
5 hotels equals 250 million.

772
01:25:42,141 --> 01:25:45,111
If we can prove 3 years,
it's 750 million.

773
01:25:45,211 --> 01:25:47,203
Or 1.25 billion over 5 years.

774
01:25:47,313 --> 01:25:50,681
Plus the hidden 170 million
from the apartments.

775
01:25:50,817 --> 01:25:53,616
But where?

776
01:25:53,820 --> 01:25:57,052
It all depends on what we find
in the raid.

777
01:25:57,156 --> 01:25:58,124
How many raiders?

778
01:25:58,224 --> 01:26:01,752
More than 100 for 33 places:
office, home, extramarital's...

779
01:26:01,861 --> 01:26:05,389
Motels, suppliers, and the
Ninagawa Family, of course.

780
01:26:05,498 --> 01:26:05,988
When do you start?

781
01:26:06,099 --> 01:26:07,397
Look at this.

782
01:26:11,004 --> 01:26:12,802
Gondo's house.

783
01:26:12,906 --> 01:26:16,809
One surveillance camera here,
another inside.

784
01:26:16,976 --> 01:26:23,212
We come this way to avoid
the cameras.

785
01:26:25,685 --> 01:26:30,749
The gate is opened at 7:30
when his son goes to school.

786
01:26:31,291 --> 01:26:34,284
Try to keep the kid out of it.

787
01:26:34,394 --> 01:26:37,762
Next time it opens is at 10...

788
01:26:38,264 --> 01:26:41,063
When the maid takes the
garbage out.

789
01:26:41,401 --> 01:26:45,338
So you start at 10?

790
01:26:46,105 --> 01:26:48,040
Are you sure he'll be home?

791
01:26:48,141 --> 01:26:50,406
He usually is.

792
01:26:50,510 --> 01:26:51,375
Usually?

793
01:26:51,477 --> 01:26:54,970
During our 60-day stake-out, he
only left early twice for golf.

794
01:26:55,081 --> 01:26:57,744
Who knows? He might
play golf on D-day.

795
01:26:57,850 --> 01:26:58,374
Maybe.

796
01:26:58,484 --> 01:27:02,945
Well? How will you prevent that?

797
01:27:03,056 --> 01:27:09,462
We're counting on you, sir.
You're such a sly old actor...

798
01:27:10,029 --> 01:27:11,156
What...?

799
01:27:13,066 --> 01:27:18,562
Oh, all right. What's the
number?

800
01:27:20,974 --> 01:27:26,003
See, they're slave drivers. No
mercy, not even for their boss.

801
01:27:26,112 --> 01:27:29,810
Hello. May I speak to
Mr. Gondo?

802
01:27:30,583 --> 01:27:32,575
It's personal.

803
01:27:33,820 --> 01:27:37,382
Tell him I own a motel
outside Tokyo.

804
01:27:38,925 --> 01:27:48,267
Mr. Gondo? I run a motel...

805
01:27:48,968 --> 01:27:51,130
I won't tell you my name yet...

806
01:27:52,038 --> 01:28:00,811
But I have to sell it.

807
01:28:02,749 --> 01:28:08,245
It has 30 rooms. I'd like to
explain about it in person.

808
01:28:08,421 --> 01:28:13,587
I'm going to Tokyo November 1st.

809
01:28:13,693 --> 01:28:16,891
Perhaps we could meet at
10 a.m. on the 2nd.

810
01:28:18,331 --> 01:28:22,132
At your home?

811
01:28:23,036 --> 01:28:26,268
Yes, I know the address
already.

812
01:28:27,507 --> 01:28:32,241
Fine. See you on the 2nd at 10.

813
01:28:33,312 --> 01:28:35,338
Thanks. I'll be right on time.

814
01:29:01,007 --> 01:29:04,444
You gave me a fright!
Good morning.

815
01:29:04,544 --> 01:29:05,944
You're early.

816
01:29:06,312 --> 01:29:08,042
I couldn't sleep.

817
01:29:08,181 --> 01:29:11,345
And I was afraid he might
leave early.

818
01:29:11,451 --> 01:29:12,578
He's inside?

819
01:29:12,685 --> 01:29:15,245
Yes. The boy, too.

820
01:29:15,788 --> 01:29:16,448
Hey.

821
01:29:18,291 --> 01:29:19,224
It's his wife.

822
01:29:20,259 --> 01:29:20,988
Oh!

823
01:29:21,094 --> 01:29:21,493
Shall I stop her?

824
01:29:21,594 --> 01:29:24,655
No, too late. Follow her on this.

825
01:30:15,214 --> 01:30:19,242
Stay with her until a replace-
ment arrives.

826
01:30:19,552 --> 01:30:21,544
It's nearly time, I must go.

827
01:30:36,202 --> 01:30:45,373
It's past 10. Maybe they
don't have garbage today.

828
01:30:47,680 --> 01:30:49,239
It's past 10.

829
01:30:50,316 --> 01:30:52,615
It's about time they called.

830
01:31:45,538 --> 01:31:46,904
Shall we move in now?

831
01:31:47,006 --> 01:31:49,566
No. Too well guarded.

832
01:31:49,675 --> 01:31:54,773
With 60 seconds warning
he could get rid of everything.

833
01:32:15,434 --> 01:32:17,335
Tax Inspectors.
Where's Mr. Gondo?

834
01:32:36,989 --> 01:32:39,049
Tax Inspectors. It's a search.

835
01:32:39,158 --> 01:32:42,754
Suspected violations of
the Corporation Tax Act.

836
01:32:42,929 --> 01:32:45,626
We have a search warrant.

837
01:32:45,865 --> 01:32:48,164
OK. They're in!

838
01:32:55,808 --> 01:32:58,869
They're in? Got it.

839
01:33:00,880 --> 01:33:02,007
Kaneko here.

840
01:33:13,592 --> 01:33:14,855
Who is it?

841
01:33:15,227 --> 01:33:15,956
Hello.

842
01:33:16,062 --> 01:33:17,655
Look friendly!

843
01:33:17,930 --> 01:33:22,265
Sorry to bother you. I'm from
the Minatomachi Tax Office.

844
01:33:28,307 --> 01:33:32,972
Tax Inspectors. It's a search.
Suspected corporate tax evasion.

845
01:33:45,424 --> 01:33:49,759
Ma'am, they're safety shoes
for auto factories.

846
01:33:49,929 --> 01:33:51,898
A truck can't crush them.

847
01:33:52,264 --> 01:33:53,254
Cut it!

848
01:34:05,544 --> 01:34:07,308
Hang it up!

849
01:34:20,626 --> 01:34:23,596
Oh shit! Inspectors.
Get the books.

850
01:35:11,944 --> 01:35:17,008
Tax Inspectors. It's a search.
Suspected corporate tax evasion.

851
01:35:47,980 --> 01:35:53,783
Tax Inspector. It's a search.

852
01:35:53,886 --> 01:35:57,982
How dare you search guests!
We've nothing to do with it.

853
01:35:58,090 --> 01:35:59,683
Sorry to bother you.

854
01:35:59,792 --> 01:36:05,288
But someone might pretend to be
a guest to hide things. Right?

855
01:36:19,411 --> 01:36:21,539
My turn now. Go back to
Gondo's.

856
01:36:21,647 --> 01:36:25,106
The woman in white. Her car is
the red BMW.

857
01:36:45,604 --> 01:36:49,666
Long time no see, Mr. Gondo.

858
01:36:52,778 --> 01:36:54,713
You're an Inspector now?

859
01:36:58,517 --> 01:37:00,213
Congratulations.

860
01:37:04,223 --> 01:37:06,852
We're always congratulating
each other.

861
01:37:10,229 --> 01:37:12,858
I'll be right back.

862
01:37:42,261 --> 01:37:44,389
Hey, what about school?

863
01:37:44,496 --> 01:37:45,759
I'm not going.

864
01:37:45,931 --> 01:37:46,990
Why not?

865
01:37:47,099 --> 01:37:49,762
I don't want to. Leave me alone.

866
01:37:51,303 --> 01:37:53,397
Where are you going?

867
01:37:53,505 --> 01:37:54,905
Out.

868
01:37:55,007 --> 01:37:56,942
Out where?

869
01:37:57,042 --> 01:38:02,310
None of your business.
Do I have to tell you everything?

870
01:38:02,414 --> 01:38:05,009
Remember you're still a minor and...

871
01:38:05,117 --> 01:38:08,212
And you support me, right?
I'm sick of hearing it.

872
01:38:08,320 --> 01:38:09,413
Come here.

873
01:38:14,793 --> 01:38:15,783
Where are you going?

874
01:38:15,894 --> 01:38:19,058
I can go where I like.

875
01:38:20,532 --> 01:38:23,798
Hey! That hurts!

876
01:38:27,640 --> 01:38:30,576
What's this?

877
01:38:33,545 --> 01:38:34,444
I don't know.

878
01:38:34,546 --> 01:38:38,176
What do you mean? 200,000 yen.
Where did you get it?

879
01:38:38,651 --> 01:38:39,414
I saved it and...

880
01:38:39,518 --> 01:38:40,542
And?

881
01:38:41,787 --> 01:38:43,619
I work and...

882
01:38:43,722 --> 01:38:49,354
You work? Don't be ridiculous.
Did you steal it?

883
01:38:49,461 --> 01:38:50,121
No.

884
01:38:50,229 --> 01:38:51,925
Where did you steal it from?

885
01:38:52,031 --> 01:38:53,897
I said I didn't!

886
01:38:54,500 --> 01:38:56,526
What's it for?

887
01:39:01,540 --> 01:39:04,374
Speak up. What were you going
to buy?

888
01:39:07,212 --> 01:39:08,202
What?

889
01:39:10,949 --> 01:39:14,351
An operation? What operation?

890
01:39:15,421 --> 01:39:16,889
For my nose.

891
01:39:17,589 --> 01:39:20,753
Your nose? You have a nose
problem?

892
01:39:22,394 --> 01:39:23,794
Who said?

893
01:39:24,029 --> 01:39:25,224
My teacher.

894
01:39:25,798 --> 01:39:27,061
Your teacher.

895
01:39:28,534 --> 01:39:31,595
He said my sinusitis
makes me stupid.

896
01:39:33,639 --> 01:39:35,267
I'll keep it anyway.

897
01:39:35,374 --> 01:39:39,709
No! Give it to me! It's mine!

898
01:39:54,393 --> 01:39:57,192
You can't leave, Mr. Gondo,
while the search is on.

899
01:39:57,296 --> 01:39:58,764
I'll go.

900
01:40:17,983 --> 01:40:18,916
Taro!

901
01:40:23,222 --> 01:40:24,212
Taro!

902
01:40:43,642 --> 01:40:47,238
I'm sorry.
I thought you were going to...

903
01:40:47,346 --> 01:40:53,547
Commit suicide?
I'm not that stupid.

904
01:40:54,186 --> 01:40:55,176
No.

905
01:40:58,123 --> 01:41:01,287
It's nice here. Still like
the country.

906
01:41:01,927 --> 01:41:05,159
My father and I used to play
catch here.

907
01:41:05,431 --> 01:41:07,991
You did? That's nice.

908
01:41:08,100 --> 01:41:11,434
Those were the good days.

909
01:41:12,805 --> 01:41:17,436
Mother was still alive and
father wasn't like he is now.

910
01:41:18,677 --> 01:41:23,172
You said you work. Can you
tell me about it?

911
01:41:23,282 --> 01:41:26,309
I set up a company at school.

912
01:41:26,418 --> 01:41:27,511
A company?

913
01:41:28,086 --> 01:41:29,679
Yes. I barter things.

914
01:41:30,222 --> 01:41:34,284
Kids have lots of extra stuff.

915
01:41:34,726 --> 01:41:37,855
They want to trade for other.

916
01:41:38,530 --> 01:41:42,023
I act as the middleman and get
a 10% commission.

917
01:41:42,134 --> 01:41:43,932
Really? Is it good business?

918
01:41:44,036 --> 01:41:47,165
In a good month I make 10,000 yen.

919
01:41:47,306 --> 01:41:48,604
Does your teacher know?

920
01:41:50,075 --> 01:41:53,477
I got caught the other day.
We're still arguing about it.

921
01:41:53,579 --> 01:41:54,774
What does he say?

922
01:41:54,880 --> 01:41:56,906
Easy money's no good.

923
01:41:57,783 --> 01:42:05,782
It's not easy. I find buyers,
negotiate prices... It's hard.

924
01:42:06,391 --> 01:42:09,418
Then there's problems like
things breaking.

925
01:42:09,528 --> 01:42:11,224
Sounds interesting.

926
01:42:11,330 --> 01:42:12,958
It is.

927
01:42:14,399 --> 01:42:19,303
Let's go home.
Your father is worried.

928
01:42:37,623 --> 01:42:39,353
Taro's OK.

929
01:42:44,596 --> 01:42:46,656
But let him alone now.

930
01:42:49,268 --> 01:42:50,361
Thank you.

931
01:42:54,039 --> 01:42:58,977
While I take to him, you watch
where his eyes move.

932
01:43:04,182 --> 01:43:06,651
It's very strange, Mr. Gondo.

933
01:43:07,819 --> 01:43:13,258
Everyone has cash, bank
Accounts, other liquid assets.

934
01:43:13,358 --> 01:43:19,423
But you have nothing at all.
Where is it?

935
01:43:22,868 --> 01:43:25,997
You know, I respect you.

936
01:43:26,638 --> 01:43:30,234
You earn much more than I do,
many people work under you.

937
01:43:30,342 --> 01:43:35,872
You have status, a reputation.
I can't help but respect you.

938
01:43:35,981 --> 01:43:42,114
There's one thing I can't
respect about you, though.

939
01:43:42,654 --> 01:43:47,615
You're a tax cheater.

940
01:43:48,627 --> 01:43:53,065
Well, where is it?

941
01:44:07,079 --> 01:44:09,241
Take them all down.

942
01:44:22,594 --> 01:44:25,120
No, not that! It's not mine.

943
01:44:25,230 --> 01:44:29,167
I'll get in trouble. No! No!

944
01:44:38,577 --> 01:44:42,275
Oh, no.

945
01:44:47,452 --> 01:44:54,359
He's going to dump me.
It's all my fault.

946
01:44:59,197 --> 01:45:01,291
You using this lipstick today?

947
01:45:05,604 --> 01:45:09,371
No! Not that! That's mine.

948
01:45:22,554 --> 01:45:28,323
You got the teapot. That
should be enough for you pigs.

949
01:45:52,250 --> 01:46:00,590
I make 320,000 a month. Tell me
one thing, Mr. Gondo.

950
01:46:01,193 --> 01:46:02,286
What?

951
01:46:02,994 --> 01:46:07,898
How can I make money like you?
I really want to know.

952
01:46:09,601 --> 01:46:11,399
Why?

953
01:46:11,737 --> 01:46:16,971
You see, we raid your place,
and we find things.

954
01:46:17,576 --> 01:46:24,506
We check how you did it and
then go to the prosecutor.

955
01:46:24,850 --> 01:46:30,847
He'll stamp the indictment.
The stamping sounds great.

956
01:46:31,456 --> 01:46:39,262
Boom, boom, see? And you're
off to court.

957
01:46:40,065 --> 01:46:49,668
But first, we investigate you
for maybe a year.

958
01:46:50,375 --> 01:46:53,641
We're starting a long
relationship.

959
01:46:54,312 --> 01:46:58,943
So I thought it might be good
to know how you look a thing.

960
01:47:18,503 --> 01:47:21,667
What did you want to know?

961
01:47:22,174 --> 01:47:25,076
How to save money...
Forget it.

962
01:47:25,177 --> 01:47:28,875
No, let me tell you.

963
01:47:30,849 --> 01:47:36,686
To save money you don't spend it.

964
01:47:37,756 --> 01:47:44,720
You give 10,000 yen at a funeral,
20 at a wedding. It's a no good.

965
01:47:44,963 --> 01:47:48,559
A million yen is nothing
if you spend it.

966
01:47:48,667 --> 01:47:51,501
But even 100,000 is all yours
if you save it.

967
01:47:56,942 --> 01:48:04,042
Say you're trying to fill
a glass with dripping water.

968
01:48:04,416 --> 01:48:11,755
It's half full, you're thirsty,
so you drink. That's stupid.

969
01:48:12,524 --> 01:48:15,016
Wait until it's full.

970
01:48:16,895 --> 01:48:18,557
But still don't drink.

971
01:48:19,130 --> 01:48:28,438
When it brims over, lick it.

972
01:48:28,607 --> 01:48:30,735
Then you can save the water...

973
01:48:52,864 --> 01:48:54,389
Sure.

974
01:48:55,066 --> 01:48:59,162
And...that's a lot of water...

975
01:49:02,040 --> 01:49:06,774
This is Ninagawa. Of the Kanto
Ninagawa Family!

976
01:49:07,212 --> 01:49:08,908
Get me Urushibara.

977
01:49:09,180 --> 01:49:13,515
It's emergency!
Get on with it! Quick!

978
01:49:13,919 --> 01:49:19,881
If you can't cooperate, you'll
have to close your bank early.

979
01:49:20,859 --> 01:49:22,725
We don't like doing it.
But we have a warrant.

980
01:49:22,827 --> 01:49:27,527
You can't do that.
We are cooperating, aren't we?

981
01:49:28,767 --> 01:49:34,206
I don't know about others,
but at this bank...

982
01:49:34,306 --> 01:49:37,606
We never allow accounts under
false names.

983
01:49:37,876 --> 01:49:43,315
We follow all government
regulations.

984
01:49:43,415 --> 01:49:48,012
We refuse such requests from
customers...

985
01:49:48,720 --> 01:49:52,521
Even though we'd love to get
new accounts.

986
01:49:52,624 --> 01:50:00,498
Please check anything
you like.

987
01:50:15,080 --> 01:50:18,812
Mr. Gondo, it's useless.
Give us the key.

988
01:50:19,417 --> 01:50:24,720
We could force open your
deposit box with warrant.

989
01:50:24,923 --> 01:50:28,325
But that would tarnish your
credit rating.

990
01:50:28,994 --> 01:50:34,956
You're a capable man, you'll
stay in business.

991
01:50:35,400 --> 01:50:37,699
Stay friendly with your banks.

992
01:50:38,770 --> 01:50:44,402
You can't afford to have the
banks cut you off, can you?

993
01:50:44,509 --> 01:50:47,570
All right. I'll give you the key.

994
01:50:47,746 --> 01:50:49,647
Where is it?

995
01:50:52,784 --> 01:50:54,082
Mitsuko has it.

996
01:51:01,259 --> 01:51:07,824
I'd like to talk with Mrs. Gondo.

997
01:51:07,932 --> 01:51:10,697
I'm a tax auditor.

998
01:51:10,802 --> 01:51:15,331
Just a minor detail. She's
the only one who can help us.

999
01:51:15,507 --> 01:51:16,497
This way, please.

1000
01:51:16,608 --> 01:51:18,338
Thank you.

1001
01:51:34,692 --> 01:51:36,422
Are you the taxman?

1002
01:51:36,928 --> 01:51:38,521
Actually, I'm...

1003
01:51:38,630 --> 01:51:39,461
An inspector.

1004
01:51:39,564 --> 01:51:40,930
How did you know?

1005
01:51:41,032 --> 01:51:42,398
I expected you.

1006
01:51:42,500 --> 01:51:46,096
Thanks anyway for saying
you were an auditor.

1007
01:51:46,604 --> 01:51:48,505
What is it?

1008
01:51:48,873 --> 01:51:51,138
We want the deposit box key.

1009
01:51:52,811 --> 01:51:55,542
What? I don't know what you're
talking about.

1010
01:51:55,647 --> 01:52:00,676
You're a fine wife. I know why
you don't want to admit it.

1011
01:52:00,785 --> 01:52:04,119
But your husband sent us here.

1012
01:52:04,289 --> 01:52:09,853
We found his cache behind the
shelves. He's given up.

1013
01:52:22,807 --> 01:52:24,207
All right.

1014
01:52:25,810 --> 01:52:27,972
Let's talk privately.

1015
01:52:29,114 --> 01:52:30,742
Leave us alone.

1016
01:52:40,458 --> 01:52:41,687
OK?

1017
01:52:41,993 --> 01:52:48,263
Yeah. I'll give it to you.
But not right here.

1018
01:52:48,366 --> 01:52:49,061
You have it?

1019
01:52:49,167 --> 01:52:53,161
Yes, but it's hard to get it.

1020
01:52:54,105 --> 01:52:55,630
In the ladies' room, then?

1021
01:52:56,141 --> 01:52:56,972
Yes.

1022
01:52:57,075 --> 01:52:59,044
I'll send the female inspector.

1023
01:52:59,144 --> 01:53:03,582
No. I only trust you. I won't
give it to anyone else.

1024
01:53:05,383 --> 01:53:09,514
You're sure you'll give it to me?

1025
01:53:11,356 --> 01:53:12,346
Sure.

1026
01:53:13,091 --> 01:53:14,150
Promise?

1027
01:53:16,528 --> 01:53:17,518
Yes.

1028
01:53:20,031 --> 01:53:21,329
Show me your promise.

1029
01:54:22,627 --> 01:54:23,720
That noise?

1030
01:54:24,095 --> 01:54:26,326
I was nervous, I had to pee.

1031
01:54:26,431 --> 01:54:27,592
Here's the key.

1032
01:54:29,267 --> 01:54:31,566
We got the box key. How's it
going here?

1033
01:54:31,669 --> 01:54:34,264
They're being difficult...

1034
01:54:37,942 --> 01:54:39,240
We found this.

1035
01:54:45,950 --> 01:54:49,751
Can you explain this note?

1036
01:54:50,488 --> 01:54:54,016
It says, replace 10 million from
Gondo's false account with...

1037
01:54:54,125 --> 01:54:56,720
Money from the Sapporo branch.

1038
01:54:56,995 --> 01:54:58,395
Who wrote this?

1039
01:54:59,163 --> 01:55:00,529
I have no idea.

1040
01:55:00,632 --> 01:55:03,067
It's an order. It was written
by your superior.

1041
01:55:03,167 --> 01:55:06,797
It's either the branch manager
or his deputy.

1042
01:55:08,539 --> 01:55:15,275
Now, we know you want to cover
your boss, but it won't work.

1043
01:55:17,849 --> 01:55:21,217
I can't tell you.

1044
01:55:21,452 --> 01:55:22,886
Where's the deputy?

1045
01:55:24,055 --> 01:55:25,819
What's this about?

1046
01:55:25,923 --> 01:55:28,449
Hmm. I don't have any idea.

1047
01:55:28,559 --> 01:55:30,528
Only you and the branch
manager...

1048
01:55:30,628 --> 01:55:33,826
Can give such orders. Which of
you was it?

1049
01:55:33,931 --> 01:55:40,098
Here's something else he
wrote. It's the same hand.

1050
01:55:47,278 --> 01:55:50,146
You wrote it, didn't you?

1051
01:55:51,049 --> 01:55:53,678
Hmm. It looks similar.

1052
01:55:53,785 --> 01:55:58,689
Similar? What do you mean
similar?

1053
01:55:59,057 --> 01:56:01,891
Cut the crap! It is your
writing!

1054
01:56:05,029 --> 01:56:09,524
Where are you going?

1055
01:56:10,068 --> 01:56:12,196
Wait!

1056
01:56:29,287 --> 01:56:32,621
Look! You allowed Gondo to
open a false account!

1057
01:56:32,724 --> 01:56:34,454
I am sorry.

1058
01:56:34,559 --> 01:56:35,219
How much is there?

1059
01:56:36,561 --> 01:56:37,460
How much?

1060
01:56:37,829 --> 01:56:40,765
180 million yen...

1061
01:56:53,511 --> 01:56:54,342
Hi, there.

1062
01:56:54,445 --> 01:56:55,435
How is it going?

1063
01:56:55,546 --> 01:56:58,414
Fine. We got 900 million yen.
Still about 300 short.

1064
01:56:58,516 --> 01:56:59,108
How did it the hotels go?

1065
01:56:59,217 --> 01:57:02,551
The sheet volume was
cut by half.

1066
01:57:02,620 --> 01:57:06,318
Gondo thinks of everything.
This case will take a while.

1067
01:57:06,424 --> 01:57:06,948
Where's the chief?

1068
01:57:07,058 --> 01:57:10,085
On the phone. Looks like
the pressure is on.

1069
01:57:13,030 --> 01:57:17,491
Yes, Mr. Urushibara.

1070
01:57:17,635 --> 01:57:23,336
I see. But this case is very
complex.

1071
01:57:23,441 --> 01:57:28,971
We'd certainly hate to get you
involved. It might hurt you.

1072
01:57:31,716 --> 01:57:34,481
I appreciate your calling us,
but I really can't...

1073
01:57:35,219 --> 01:57:41,989
Besides, sir, I hear some
reporters are on to this.

1074
01:57:44,228 --> 01:57:48,063
Any attempts now might hurt
your name.

1075
01:57:50,268 --> 01:57:54,831
Thank you for your
understanding.

1076
01:57:55,807 --> 01:57:59,209
Certainly. I did not receive
any call from you.

1077
01:57:59,477 --> 01:58:03,209
Goodby.

1078
01:58:06,584 --> 01:58:09,052
SPRING

1079
01:58:19,831 --> 01:58:21,356
Mr. Gondo.

1080
01:58:31,843 --> 01:58:33,209
Let's take a walk.

1081
01:58:38,816 --> 01:58:43,447
I wanted to thank you, about Taro.

1082
01:58:52,663 --> 01:58:54,325
You've lost weight.

1083
01:58:54,499 --> 01:58:59,563
Yeah. I've been grilled almost
every day.

1084
01:59:00,972 --> 01:59:02,998
You're bearing up well.

1085
01:59:04,308 --> 01:59:08,404
I have been for 6 months.
But I'm tired.

1086
01:59:30,301 --> 01:59:31,929
6 months...

1087
01:59:34,739 --> 01:59:36,469
Will you still fight?

1088
01:59:42,246 --> 01:59:47,184
Isn't it about time
we stopped all this?

1089
01:59:49,287 --> 01:59:52,121
No one goes bankrupt after
inspections.

1090
01:59:52,390 --> 01:59:57,556
You've done your best,
for Taro's sake.

1091
01:59:57,662 --> 02:00:01,861
He knows that.

1092
02:00:08,773 --> 02:00:11,436
Taro's worried about you.

1093
02:00:13,411 --> 02:00:19,408
He knows what you're going
through. He wants to help.

1094
02:00:23,621 --> 02:00:26,614
He's more mature than
you think.

1095
02:00:28,859 --> 02:00:30,191
You think so?

1096
02:00:33,631 --> 02:00:34,599
Hope you're right.

1097
02:00:34,699 --> 02:00:36,065
I am.

1098
02:00:37,501 --> 02:00:41,768
If you really care about him...

1099
02:00:43,007 --> 02:00:46,967
Give him your strength, not
your money.

1100
02:00:58,089 --> 02:01:01,059
Peace of mind might really
be better.

1101
02:01:16,774 --> 02:01:19,141
See those kids playing
down there?

1102
02:01:21,712 --> 02:01:27,709
It saddens me to see them
so happy.

1103
02:01:29,553 --> 02:01:33,081
I feel my chance for happiness
slipping away.

1104
02:01:46,003 --> 02:01:50,338
Say, why don't you quit this
tax racket and live with me?

1105
02:02:35,920 --> 02:02:36,717
Mr. Gondo!

1106
02:03:32,009 --> 02:03:34,740
The 300 million is in a box at
the Schilla Bank.

1107
02:03:37,448 --> 02:03:39,349
That's the box number.
