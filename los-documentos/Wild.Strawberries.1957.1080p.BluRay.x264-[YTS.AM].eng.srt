1
00:00:48,453 --> 00:00:50,655
In our relations with other people,

2
00:00:50,703 --> 00:00:54,835
we mainly discuss and evaluate

3
00:00:54,883 --> 00:00:57,803
their character and behavior.

4
00:00:58,503 --> 00:01:03,135
That is why I have withdrawn

5
00:01:03,183 --> 00:01:06,143
from nearly all so-called relations.

6
00:01:07,263 --> 00:01:12,323
This has made my oldage
rather lonely.

7
00:01:13,563 --> 00:01:19,605
My life has been full of hard work,
and I am grateful.

8
00:01:19,653 --> 00:01:22,445
It began as toil
for bread and butter

9
00:01:22,493 --> 00:01:27,543
and ended in a love for science.

10
00:01:27,823 --> 00:01:33,615
I have a son, also a doctor,
who lives in Lund.

11
00:01:33,663 --> 00:01:38,973
He has been married for many years.
They have no children.

12
00:01:39,383 --> 00:01:45,643
My old mother is still alive
and is very active, in spite of her age.

13
00:01:50,513 --> 00:01:55,573
My wife Karin
has been dead for many years.

14
00:01:56,903 --> 00:01:59,560
Dinner is served, Professor Borg.

15
00:02:02,233 --> 00:02:04,395
Thank you.

16
00:02:04,443 --> 00:02:07,913
I am lucky
in having a good housekeeper.

17
00:02:08,913 --> 00:02:13,553
Perhaps I should add
that I am an old pedant,

18
00:02:13,953 --> 00:02:17,625
which at times
has been rather trying

19
00:02:17,673 --> 00:02:22,933
for myself and those around me.

20
00:02:24,763 --> 00:02:28,273
My name is Isak Borg,

21
00:02:28,933 --> 00:02:31,653
and I am 78.

22
00:02:32,473 --> 00:02:38,193
Tomorrow I shall receive
an honorary degree in Lund Cathedral.

23
00:02:53,293 --> 00:02:56,883
WILD STRAWBERRIES

24
00:03:57,393 --> 00:04:00,685
In the early hours of June 1st,

25
00:04:00,733 --> 00:04:05,123
I had a weird
and very unpleasant dream.

26
00:04:05,693 --> 00:04:09,235
I dreamt that during
my morning walk

27
00:04:09,283 --> 00:04:14,865
I lost my way among empty streets

28
00:04:14,913 --> 00:04:17,713
with ruined houses.

29
00:09:27,803 --> 00:09:28,965
Are you ill?

30
00:09:29,013 --> 00:09:32,805
Miss Agda, please prepare
some breakfast. I'm taking the car.

31
00:09:32,853 --> 00:09:37,145
Please, Professor! Go back to bed
and I'll bring you coffee at 9:00,

32
00:09:37,193 --> 00:09:40,525
and we'll leave at 10:00 as planned.

33
00:09:40,573 --> 00:09:43,444
Oh, well, I'll go without breakfast.

34
00:09:45,323 --> 00:09:47,694
And who will pack your tails?

35
00:09:48,243 --> 00:09:51,463
- I will do it myself.
- And what about me?

36
00:09:52,543 --> 00:09:58,205
You can come in the car or fly.
Please yourself.

37
00:09:58,253 --> 00:10:02,965
I've looked forward to seeing you get
your honorary degree.

38
00:10:03,013 --> 00:10:06,925
And we had arranged
everything so nicely,

39
00:10:06,973 --> 00:10:10,345
and now you're taking the car.

40
00:10:10,393 --> 00:10:13,055
The ceremony isn't until 5:00.

41
00:10:13,103 --> 00:10:16,725
If I leave at once, I've got 14 hours
before the ceremony.

42
00:10:16,773 --> 00:10:19,533
You'll ruin everything!

43
00:10:20,443 --> 00:10:24,025
What about your son who is expecting you
at the airport in Malmo?

44
00:10:24,073 --> 00:10:28,333
You can think up an explanation.

45
00:10:30,953 --> 00:10:34,383
If you go by car,
I won't come at all.

46
00:10:35,413 --> 00:10:37,575
Now listen, Miss Agda!

47
00:10:37,623 --> 00:10:42,705
Take the car, and you'll ruin
the greatest day of my life.

48
00:10:42,753 --> 00:10:45,255
We're not married, Miss Agda.

49
00:10:45,303 --> 00:10:49,925
I thank God for that every night.

50
00:10:49,973 --> 00:10:54,475
I've used my common sense for 74 years,
and it won't let me down now.

51
00:10:54,523 --> 00:10:57,095
Is that your last word?

52
00:10:57,143 --> 00:10:59,363
Yes.

53
00:11:01,233 --> 00:11:06,815
But I shall say plenty to myself
about selfish, crabby old men

54
00:11:06,863 --> 00:11:12,485
who never think of those who have
served them faithfully for 40 years.

55
00:11:12,533 --> 00:11:15,615
Incredible that I have put up...

56
00:11:15,663 --> 00:11:20,585
with your bossing for so long.

57
00:11:20,633 --> 00:11:24,125
Just give the word,
and I'll leave tomorrow.

58
00:11:24,173 --> 00:11:29,893
I'm going by car anyway,
and you can do as you damn well please.

59
00:11:36,483 --> 00:11:42,743
I happen to be grown-up
and needn't take orders from you.

60
00:11:46,863 --> 00:11:50,025
No one can pack like you, Miss Agda.

61
00:11:50,073 --> 00:11:52,173
Really?

62
00:11:52,953 --> 00:11:54,485
Old sourpuss.

63
00:11:54,533 --> 00:11:56,495
Shall I boil you a couple of eggs?

64
00:11:56,543 --> 00:12:01,303
Yes, please, if you will be
so extremely kind.

65
00:12:06,093 --> 00:12:11,643
The faculty should have made me
honorary idiot.

66
00:12:15,513 --> 00:12:18,845
I'll calm the old girl down
with a present.

67
00:12:18,893 --> 00:12:21,685
I hate resentful people.

68
00:12:21,733 --> 00:12:26,623
I wouldn't hurt a fly,
let alone Miss Agda.

69
00:12:27,403 --> 00:12:29,065
Toast?

70
00:12:29,113 --> 00:12:31,365
No, don't trouble yourself
on my account.

71
00:12:31,413 --> 00:12:34,623
What are you cross about?

72
00:12:40,083 --> 00:12:42,063
Don't you want a cup?

73
00:12:48,133 --> 00:12:49,545
Good morning, Uncle Isak.

74
00:12:49,593 --> 00:12:54,345
Well, well, why is my daughter-in-law
up at this hour?

75
00:12:54,393 --> 00:12:58,055
Who can sleep when you and Aunt Agda
are making such a row?

76
00:12:58,103 --> 00:13:00,435
There has been no row.

77
00:13:00,483 --> 00:13:02,493
No, not at all.

78
00:13:04,103 --> 00:13:06,185
You're taking the car to Lund?

79
00:13:06,233 --> 00:13:07,315
Yes.

80
00:13:07,363 --> 00:13:09,145
Can I come with you?

81
00:13:09,193 --> 00:13:10,775
You're going home?

82
00:13:10,823 --> 00:13:13,735
Yes, I want to go home.

83
00:13:13,783 --> 00:13:15,575
Home to Evald?

84
00:13:15,623 --> 00:13:17,285
You don't need to ask why.

85
00:13:17,333 --> 00:13:20,075
I would take the train
if I could afford it.

86
00:13:20,123 --> 00:13:22,415
Of course you may ride with me.

87
00:13:22,463 --> 00:13:24,834
I'll be ready in ten minutes.

88
00:13:27,633 --> 00:13:29,513
Good heavens!

89
00:13:57,533 --> 00:14:01,995
Please don't smoke.
I can't stand cigarette smoke.

90
00:14:02,043 --> 00:14:03,495
I forgot.

91
00:14:03,543 --> 00:14:07,133
There should be a law
forbidding women to smoke.

92
00:14:08,043 --> 00:14:09,375
Beautiful weather.

93
00:14:09,423 --> 00:14:13,523
Yes, but sultry.

94
00:14:14,013 --> 00:14:16,505
- I think we'll have a thunderstorm.
- So do I.

95
00:14:16,553 --> 00:14:18,255
No, give me a cigar anytime.

96
00:14:18,303 --> 00:14:21,635
That's stimulating and relaxing.
That's a vice for men.

97
00:14:21,683 --> 00:14:24,725
And what vices may a woman have?

98
00:14:24,773 --> 00:14:27,975
Weeping, giving birth
and speaking ill of her neighbors.

99
00:14:28,023 --> 00:14:30,815
How old are you really, Uncle Isak?

100
00:14:30,863 --> 00:14:32,315
Why do you ask?

101
00:14:32,363 --> 00:14:34,145
No reason. Why?

102
00:14:34,193 --> 00:14:37,155
I know why you asked.

103
00:14:37,203 --> 00:14:39,543
Oh, well.

104
00:14:41,583 --> 00:14:45,665
Don't pretend.
You don't like me. You never have.

105
00:14:45,713 --> 00:14:48,165
I only know you
as a father-in-law.

106
00:14:48,213 --> 00:14:50,295
Why are you going home?

107
00:14:50,343 --> 00:14:52,295
On impulse. Nothing more.

108
00:14:52,343 --> 00:14:54,675
Evald happens to be my son.

109
00:14:54,723 --> 00:14:56,175
So he is.

110
00:14:56,223 --> 00:14:59,755
Evald and I are very much alike.
We have our principles.

111
00:14:59,803 --> 00:15:01,715
You don't need to tell me that.

112
00:15:01,763 --> 00:15:03,225
Now, this loan, for instance.

113
00:15:03,273 --> 00:15:05,185
I know exactly
what you're going to say.

114
00:15:05,233 --> 00:15:08,015
He should have paid it back
when he became an associate professor.

115
00:15:08,063 --> 00:15:10,685
It's a matter of honor for him
to pay back 5,000 a year,

116
00:15:10,733 --> 00:15:12,105
and so on, and so on.

117
00:15:12,153 --> 00:15:14,145
A promise is a promise.

118
00:15:14,193 --> 00:15:17,065
For us, it means
that we never can be free together,

119
00:15:17,113 --> 00:15:19,065
and that your son
works himself to death.

120
00:15:19,113 --> 00:15:21,535
You have your own income.

121
00:15:21,583 --> 00:15:23,535
Especially when one considers
the fact that you're filthy rich

122
00:15:23,583 --> 00:15:24,995
and don't need the money.

123
00:15:25,043 --> 00:15:30,933
A promise is a promise.
And I know Evald respects that.

124
00:15:31,673 --> 00:15:34,393
Perhaps.
But he also hates you.

125
00:15:44,473 --> 00:15:47,975
What doy ou have against me?

126
00:15:48,023 --> 00:15:49,765
Shall I be frank?

127
00:15:49,813 --> 00:15:51,793
Yes, I'm asking you.

128
00:15:52,443 --> 00:15:55,065
You're a selfish old man, Uncle Isak.

129
00:15:55,113 --> 00:15:59,873
You're utterly ruthless
and never listen to anyone but yourself.

130
00:16:00,663 --> 00:16:05,963
But you hide it all behind
your old-world manners and charm.

131
00:16:06,663 --> 00:16:12,473
Beneath your benevolent exterior,
you're as hard as nails.

132
00:16:13,093 --> 00:16:17,763
But you can't fool us
who have seen you at close quarters.

133
00:16:19,263 --> 00:16:22,349
Remember when
I came to you a month ago?

134
00:16:23,723 --> 00:16:26,635
I had a stupid idea
that you might help Evald and me.

135
00:16:26,683 --> 00:16:29,225
So I asked to stay with you
for a week or two.

136
00:16:29,273 --> 00:16:31,765
Remember what you answered?

137
00:16:31,813 --> 00:16:35,163
I said I'd be delighted.

138
00:16:36,153 --> 00:16:39,873
Perhaps you've forgotten,
but you said,

139
00:16:40,653 --> 00:16:44,785
"Don't try to draw me
into your marital squabbles.

140
00:16:44,833 --> 00:16:46,615
I don't give a damn.

141
00:16:46,663 --> 00:16:48,705
You and Evald must make
the best of it."

142
00:16:48,753 --> 00:16:50,365
Did I say that?

143
00:16:50,413 --> 00:16:53,745
- Not only that.
- Oh, no.

144
00:16:53,793 --> 00:16:56,022
These were your very words:

145
00:16:56,383 --> 00:16:58,795
"I have no respect
for mental suffering,

146
00:16:58,843 --> 00:17:01,286
so don't come lamenting to me.

147
00:17:01,593 --> 00:17:06,345
If you need therapy,
you'd better see a shrink.

148
00:17:06,393 --> 00:17:10,055
Or why not a minister?
It's in fashion now."

149
00:17:10,103 --> 00:17:12,113
Did I say that?

150
00:17:12,523 --> 00:17:15,605
Your judgments are very categorical,
Uncle Isak.

151
00:17:15,653 --> 00:17:19,333
I should hate to depend on you.

152
00:17:23,363 --> 00:17:27,445
I have liked having you
about the house.

153
00:17:27,493 --> 00:17:29,245
Like a cat.

154
00:17:29,293 --> 00:17:31,705
A cat or a human being.

155
00:17:31,753 --> 00:17:37,045
You're a fine young woman,
and I'm sorry you dislike me.

156
00:17:37,093 --> 00:17:39,835
- I don't dislike you.
- Really?

157
00:17:39,883 --> 00:17:42,397
- I feel sorry for you.
- Sorry?

158
00:17:46,803 --> 00:17:50,885
I'd like to tell you about a dream
I had this morning.

159
00:17:50,933 --> 00:17:53,305
I'm not very interested in dreams.

160
00:17:53,353 --> 00:17:57,493
No. No, of course not.

161
00:18:10,373 --> 00:18:12,455
Where are you going now?

162
00:18:12,503 --> 00:18:15,343
I want to show you something.

163
00:18:48,033 --> 00:18:53,615
We lived here every summer
during the first 20 years of my life.

164
00:18:53,663 --> 00:18:57,529
There were ten of us children.
Perhaps you knew that.

165
00:18:58,753 --> 00:19:00,295
Does anyone live here now?

166
00:19:00,343 --> 00:19:02,393
No, not this summer.

167
00:19:06,173 --> 00:19:08,925
I'll go swimming, if you don't mind.
We have plenty of time.

168
00:19:08,973 --> 00:19:10,953
Yes, by all means, do.

169
00:19:23,533 --> 00:19:26,703
The place where
wild strawberries grow!

170
00:19:38,673 --> 00:19:42,763
Perhaps I got a little sentimental.

171
00:19:43,713 --> 00:19:46,505
Perhaps I got a little tired

172
00:19:46,553 --> 00:19:49,433
and felt a bit sad.

173
00:19:50,803 --> 00:19:56,135
It's not impossible that I began
to think of this and that,

174
00:19:56,183 --> 00:20:00,153
associated with places
where I played as a child.

175
00:20:01,193 --> 00:20:03,953
I don't know how it happened,

176
00:20:04,653 --> 00:20:07,235
but the day's clear reality

177
00:20:07,283 --> 00:20:12,485
dissolved into the even clearer
images of memory

178
00:20:12,533 --> 00:20:15,115
that appeared before my eyes

179
00:20:15,163 --> 00:20:18,480
with the strength
of a true stream of events.

180
00:20:35,513 --> 00:20:36,613
Sara.

181
00:20:39,353 --> 00:20:41,323
Sara,

182
00:20:41,733 --> 00:20:44,413
it's your cousin Isak.

183
00:20:45,863 --> 00:20:51,123
Well, I've become quite old,
of course, so I don't look the same.

184
00:20:51,913 --> 00:20:57,963
But you, you haven't changed at all.

185
00:21:03,543 --> 00:21:06,545
Good morning, sweet cousin.
What are you doing?

186
00:21:06,593 --> 00:21:09,715
Picking strawberries, silly.
Can't you see?

187
00:21:09,763 --> 00:21:12,465
And who shall be favored
with these delicious berries

188
00:21:12,513 --> 00:21:16,345
picked in the early morn
by a lovely young woman?

189
00:21:16,393 --> 00:21:19,845
Nonsense. You know quite well
that it's Uncle Aron's name day today.

190
00:21:19,893 --> 00:21:22,305
I forgot to make a present.

191
00:21:22,353 --> 00:21:25,065
So he'll get a basket
of wild strawberries instead.

192
00:21:25,113 --> 00:21:26,315
I'll help you.

193
00:21:26,363 --> 00:21:29,945
You see, Sigbritt and Charlotta made
a tapestry and Angelica baked a cake,

194
00:21:29,993 --> 00:21:31,775
and Anna has painted
a really good picture,

195
00:21:31,823 --> 00:21:34,905
and Kristina and Birgitta
wrote a song that they'll sing to him.

196
00:21:34,953 --> 00:21:38,075
That's the best one.
Uncle Aron is stone-deaf.

197
00:21:38,123 --> 00:21:40,995
He'll be very pleased,
and you're stupid.

198
00:21:41,043 --> 00:21:43,763
And you have a darned cute nape.

199
00:21:45,963 --> 00:21:47,545
You know you shouldn't do that.

200
00:21:47,593 --> 00:21:50,125
- Says who?
- I say.

201
00:21:50,173 --> 00:21:52,925
Besides, you're an unusually
insufferable young man

202
00:21:52,973 --> 00:21:54,715
who thinks he's really something.

203
00:21:54,763 --> 00:21:57,965
I'm your cousin,
and you're in love with me.

204
00:21:58,013 --> 00:21:59,563
With you!

205
00:22:00,773 --> 00:22:03,287
Come and be kissed on the lips.

206
00:22:03,563 --> 00:22:07,725
If you don't behave, I'll tell Isak
you're always trying to kiss me.

207
00:22:07,773 --> 00:22:11,583
Little Isak! I could beat him up
with one arm.

208
00:22:11,993 --> 00:22:14,815
You know quite well that Isak and I
are secretly engaged.

209
00:22:14,863 --> 00:22:18,615
So secretly, everyone knows it.

210
00:22:18,663 --> 00:22:21,745
It's not my fault that the twins
let the cat out of the bag.

211
00:22:21,793 --> 00:22:26,093
When is the wedding?
When is the wedding?

212
00:22:26,833 --> 00:22:31,835
I don't know which of you four brothers
is the least conceited,

213
00:22:31,883 --> 00:22:34,295
but I think it's Isak.

214
00:22:34,343 --> 00:22:35,965
Isak is the nicest, anyway.

215
00:22:36,013 --> 00:22:38,755
And you're the horridest, nastiest,

216
00:22:38,803 --> 00:22:43,725
silliest, stupidest--
I can't find the words to describe you!

217
00:22:43,773 --> 00:22:46,935
Admit you've got
a weak spot for me.

218
00:22:46,983 --> 00:22:49,395
And you reek of cigars.

219
00:22:49,443 --> 00:22:51,493
It's a nice manly smell.

220
00:22:53,193 --> 00:22:57,315
And the twins,
who know most things,

221
00:22:57,363 --> 00:23:02,245
say you've been up to no good
with that Berglund girl.

222
00:23:02,293 --> 00:23:07,705
She's not a nice girl, the twins say.
And I agree.

223
00:23:07,753 --> 00:23:11,165
How pretty you are
when you blush.

224
00:23:11,213 --> 00:23:14,545
You must kiss me.
I can't bear it any longer.

225
00:23:14,593 --> 00:23:19,005
Now that I think of it,
I'm madly in love with you.

226
00:23:19,053 --> 00:23:21,567
- You're just saying that.
- No.

227
00:23:23,563 --> 00:23:26,345
And the twins say

228
00:23:26,393 --> 00:23:29,645
that you're mad about girls.

229
00:23:29,693 --> 00:23:31,623
Is that true?

230
00:23:41,163 --> 00:23:44,093
Oh, look what you've done!

231
00:23:44,913 --> 00:23:49,473
And what will Isak say,
who really loves me?

232
00:23:50,333 --> 00:23:55,143
I'm so sad!
You've hurt me so!

233
00:23:56,513 --> 00:23:59,005
You've made
a bad woman of me.

234
00:23:59,053 --> 00:24:01,135
At any rate, nearly.

235
00:24:01,183 --> 00:24:05,135
I never want to see you again,
at least not before brunch.

236
00:24:05,183 --> 00:24:08,993
I have to hurry.
Help me pick up the strawberries.

237
00:24:09,603 --> 00:24:12,760
Oh, and now I've got
a stain on my apron!

238
00:24:41,763 --> 00:24:45,613
Where's Isak?

239
00:24:46,013 --> 00:24:50,895
Out fishing with Papa,
and they can't hear the gong.

240
00:24:50,943 --> 00:24:57,203
Anyway, Papa said
not to wait with brunch.

241
00:25:46,783 --> 00:25:49,035
In Jesus' name
we take our seat.

242
00:25:49,083 --> 00:25:52,803
Bless, O Lord,
this food we eat. Amen.

243
00:26:01,343 --> 00:26:04,545
Benjamin, go and wash
your hands at once.

244
00:26:04,593 --> 00:26:07,555
How old do you have to be
to learn cleanliness?

245
00:26:07,603 --> 00:26:09,443
I have.

246
00:26:09,973 --> 00:26:13,725
Sigbritt, pass Angelica the porridge.

247
00:26:13,773 --> 00:26:17,453
Your fingernails are filthy.

248
00:26:18,113 --> 00:26:20,127
Hagbart, pass the bread.

249
00:26:21,573 --> 00:26:24,735
Don't take so much butter.

250
00:26:24,783 --> 00:26:28,825
Charlotta, the salt is lumpy.
You let it get damp.

251
00:26:28,873 --> 00:26:31,035
How often have I told you
not to let it sit out?

252
00:26:31,083 --> 00:26:34,415
It's paint under my nails.

253
00:26:34,463 --> 00:26:36,335
Who gathered
the wild strawberries for me?

254
00:26:36,383 --> 00:26:39,143
- I did.
- What?

255
00:26:40,383 --> 00:26:44,085
Speak up, dear.
Uncle Aron can't hear.

256
00:26:44,133 --> 00:26:47,005
I did!

257
00:26:47,053 --> 00:26:50,765
Fancy your remembering
my name day.

258
00:26:50,813 --> 00:26:53,363
How kind ofyou.

259
00:26:53,813 --> 00:26:58,105
Couldn't Uncle have a drink
to celebrate?

260
00:26:58,153 --> 00:27:01,163
Never when Papa is not at home.

261
00:27:01,613 --> 00:27:05,025
Uncle has already had three drinks.

262
00:27:05,073 --> 00:27:09,025
We saw him when we went out
to bathe at 8:00.

263
00:27:09,073 --> 00:27:11,405
So you've picked berries too.
Thank you.

264
00:27:11,453 --> 00:27:14,553
Twins, speakwhen spoken to.

265
00:27:15,873 --> 00:27:20,013
And as you didn't make your beds,
you can dry the silver.

266
00:27:20,753 --> 00:27:23,625
You will do as Auntie says.

267
00:27:23,673 --> 00:27:26,425
Benjamin, don't bite your nails.

268
00:27:26,473 --> 00:27:30,055
Anna, what are you doing?
Remember you're not a little girl anymore.

269
00:27:30,103 --> 00:27:32,055
I want to give Uncle my picture.

270
00:27:32,103 --> 00:27:34,935
Please, Auntie, can't we give him
our presents now?

271
00:27:34,983 --> 00:27:36,805
- Where is your present?
- Under the table.

272
00:27:36,853 --> 00:27:38,863
No, after we've eaten.

273
00:27:39,863 --> 00:27:44,645
A very advanced work of art:
Fritjof and Ingeborg.

274
00:27:44,693 --> 00:27:48,615
You can't tell which is Fritjof!.

275
00:27:48,663 --> 00:27:53,995
What were Sara and Sigfrid doing
in the wild strawberry patch?

276
00:27:54,043 --> 00:27:56,955
We saw you! We saw you!

277
00:27:57,003 --> 00:27:59,745
The twins ought to be muzzled.

278
00:27:59,793 --> 00:28:01,915
The twins will be quiet
or leave the table.

279
00:28:01,963 --> 00:28:03,585
No freedom of speech, eh?

280
00:28:03,633 --> 00:28:05,813
Shut up, you brats.

281
00:28:06,173 --> 00:28:09,983
Sara's blushing! Sara's blushing!

282
00:28:10,723 --> 00:28:13,805
Sigfrid is blushing too!
Sigfrid and Sara! Sigfrid and Sara!

283
00:28:13,853 --> 00:28:16,023
Quiet, everybody!

284
00:28:19,193 --> 00:28:20,765
But Sara!

285
00:28:20,813 --> 00:28:23,184
They're lying! They're lying!

286
00:28:48,513 --> 00:28:54,773
Isak is so fine and good,

287
00:28:55,683 --> 00:28:59,935
so moral and sensitive.

288
00:28:59,983 --> 00:29:03,413
He wants us to read poetry

289
00:29:03,653 --> 00:29:05,975
and talk about the next life

290
00:29:06,023 --> 00:29:09,913
and play four-handed piano.

291
00:29:11,323 --> 00:29:15,003
And he only wants to kiss
in the dark,

292
00:29:15,953 --> 00:29:18,655
and he talks about sin.

293
00:29:18,703 --> 00:29:21,673
He's on such a terribly high level,

294
00:29:22,713 --> 00:29:25,513
and I feel so worthless.

295
00:29:26,753 --> 00:29:30,773
And I am worthless--
there's no denying it.

296
00:29:33,973 --> 00:29:37,675
But sometimes it seems to me
that I'm a lot older than Isak,

297
00:29:37,723 --> 00:29:40,015
if you know what I mean.

298
00:29:40,063 --> 00:29:44,953
And then I think he's a child,
although we're the same age.

299
00:29:45,813 --> 00:29:51,195
And Sigfrid is so bold and exciting,
and I want to go home.

300
00:29:51,243 --> 00:29:53,485
I don't want to be here all summer

301
00:29:53,533 --> 00:29:56,115
and be an object of ridicule
for the twins and all of you.

302
00:29:56,163 --> 00:29:58,195
I don't want to!

303
00:29:58,243 --> 00:30:00,535
I'll speak to Sigfrid.

304
00:30:00,583 --> 00:30:02,115
If he doesn't behave,

305
00:30:02,163 --> 00:30:04,665
I'll make sure he's made to study
during the summer holidays.

306
00:30:04,713 --> 00:30:06,415
Papa will fix that
as easy as anything.

307
00:30:06,463 --> 00:30:09,455
He too thinks Sigfrid is a
good-for-nothing and needs to work.

308
00:30:09,503 --> 00:30:13,313
Poor little Isak
who's so good to me.

309
00:30:14,303 --> 00:30:17,193
How unfair everything is.

310
00:30:18,513 --> 00:30:20,725
All will be well, you'll see.

311
00:30:20,773 --> 00:30:24,153
Listen, now they're singing
for Uncle Aron.

312
00:30:25,153 --> 00:30:30,525
How silly to write a song
for a deaf old man.

313
00:30:30,573 --> 00:30:32,235
How typical of the twins.

314
00:30:32,283 --> 00:30:37,235
Flowers nod, grasses bow

315
00:30:37,283 --> 00:30:42,825
Around our lovely house

316
00:30:42,873 --> 00:30:48,495
We our Uncle Aron celebrate

317
00:30:48,543 --> 00:30:50,585
And with our song

318
00:30:50,633 --> 00:30:55,273
Ornament his brow

319
00:30:55,683 --> 00:30:59,425
Four cheers for Uncle Aron.

320
00:30:59,473 --> 00:31:03,903
Hurrah, hurrah, hurrah, hurrah!

321
00:31:10,863 --> 00:31:13,275
I'll run down and meet
Isak and Uncle.

322
00:31:13,323 --> 00:31:15,083
You do that.

323
00:31:15,703 --> 00:31:21,543
I was overwhelmed by feelings
of emptiness and sadness,

324
00:31:21,623 --> 00:31:25,633
but was soon awakened
from my reveries

325
00:31:26,463 --> 00:31:29,915
by the voice of a young girl
asking me repeatedly about something.

326
00:31:29,963 --> 00:31:31,835
Is this your house?

327
00:31:31,883 --> 00:31:34,045
No, it's not.

328
00:31:34,093 --> 00:31:36,465
You're lucky to be telling the truth.

329
00:31:36,513 --> 00:31:39,425
It's my dad who owns the whole
headland, including the house.

330
00:31:39,473 --> 00:31:43,425
I lived here once.
Two hundred years ago.

331
00:31:43,473 --> 00:31:46,073
Oh, yeah?

332
00:31:46,183 --> 00:31:49,475
- Is that your car up at the gate?
- Yes, that's my car.

333
00:31:49,523 --> 00:31:50,685
Looks antique.

334
00:31:50,733 --> 00:31:53,873
Yes, it's antique, like its owner.

335
00:31:54,363 --> 00:31:58,775
So you have self-irony too.
That's fantastic.

336
00:31:58,823 --> 00:32:00,905
Where are you going?
I mean, in which direction?

337
00:32:00,953 --> 00:32:02,825
Well, I'm going to Lund.

338
00:32:02,873 --> 00:32:05,575
But that suits me perfectly.
You see, I'm on my way to Italy.

339
00:32:05,623 --> 00:32:08,415
I'm honored.

340
00:32:08,463 --> 00:32:10,835
My name's Sara.
Silly name, isn't it?

341
00:32:10,883 --> 00:32:14,295
My name's Isak.
It's silly too.

342
00:32:14,343 --> 00:32:15,665
Weren't they married?

343
00:32:15,713 --> 00:32:20,595
No, unfortunately.
That was Abraham and Sara.

344
00:32:20,643 --> 00:32:21,845
Let's leave, then.

345
00:32:21,893 --> 00:32:25,765
I have another lady with me.
Here she comes.

346
00:32:25,813 --> 00:32:28,725
- Marianne, this is Sara.
- Hello.

347
00:32:28,773 --> 00:32:30,805
We're going to have company
as far as Lund.

348
00:32:30,853 --> 00:32:34,855
Sara's off to Italy, but she's promised
to ride a ways with us.

349
00:32:34,903 --> 00:32:38,373
Ironic again, but it suits you.

350
00:32:38,903 --> 00:32:40,663
Let's be off.

351
00:32:45,243 --> 00:32:48,455
Hey, guys, I've got a lift
almost to Italy.

352
00:32:48,503 --> 00:32:54,763
That's Anders and that's Viktor
and this is Father Isak.

353
00:32:56,883 --> 00:33:00,563
That peach you're gaping at
is Marianne.

354
00:33:03,933 --> 00:33:05,595
What a big bus.

355
00:33:05,643 --> 00:33:07,635
Yes, there's room for us all.

356
00:33:07,683 --> 00:33:12,113
Put your luggage in the trunk,
if you don't mind.

357
00:33:27,243 --> 00:33:31,245
I must tell you, Isak,
that Anders and I are going steady.

358
00:33:31,293 --> 00:33:33,664
We're crazy about each other.

359
00:33:34,043 --> 00:33:37,129
Viktor's the chaper one.
Daddy insisted.

360
00:33:37,753 --> 00:33:42,755
Viktor is in love with me too.

361
00:33:42,803 --> 00:33:45,755
It's a brilliant move of Daddy's.

362
00:33:45,803 --> 00:33:49,573
I may have to seduce Viktor
to get rid of him.

363
00:33:50,483 --> 00:33:54,855
I'd better tell you I'm a virgin.
That's why I'm so cheeky.

364
00:33:54,903 --> 00:33:56,975
And I smoke a pipe.

365
00:33:57,023 --> 00:34:02,413
Viktor says it's good for you.
He's crazy about anything healthy.

366
00:34:04,033 --> 00:34:07,035
I was once in love
with a woman called Sara.

367
00:34:07,083 --> 00:34:09,535
No! She was like me, wasn't she?

368
00:34:09,583 --> 00:34:12,535
She was, actually.

369
00:34:12,583 --> 00:34:14,205
What happened to her?

370
00:34:14,253 --> 00:34:18,665
She married my brother Sigfrid
and had six children.

371
00:34:18,713 --> 00:34:22,715
She's 75 now
and quite a beautiful old lady.

372
00:34:22,763 --> 00:34:26,354
I can't think of anything worse
than growing old.

373
00:34:26,803 --> 00:34:29,863
Oh, dear,
now I have put my foot in it.

374
00:35:14,678 --> 00:35:16,210
Are you all right?

375
00:35:16,258 --> 00:35:19,340
I have no excuse.
It's all our fault.

376
00:35:19,388 --> 00:35:25,648
My wife was driving.
Are you all right?

377
00:35:26,148 --> 00:35:31,948
The murderers must introduce
themselves! My name's Alman.

378
00:35:32,278 --> 00:35:35,270
That's mywife Berit.
You can see she has been an actress.

379
00:35:35,318 --> 00:35:38,230
That's the complication
we were discussing when--

380
00:35:38,278 --> 00:35:40,480
Come here, Berit,
and say you're sorry.

381
00:35:40,528 --> 00:35:44,280
I'm so sorry.
It was all my fault.

382
00:35:44,328 --> 00:35:48,700
I was just going to hit my husband
when that curve appeared.

383
00:35:48,748 --> 00:35:54,000
God punishes some people at once,
eh, you Catholic?

384
00:35:54,048 --> 00:35:57,080
Let's get your car upright.

385
00:35:57,128 --> 00:35:59,960
- Oh, never mind us. Please.
- Shut up, Sten.

386
00:36:00,008 --> 00:36:04,778
Some people are unselfish,
though you don't think so.

387
00:36:07,058 --> 00:36:11,618
My wife is a little nervous.
We've had a shock.

388
00:36:13,148 --> 00:36:18,020
Just look at him measuring
his strength with the youngsters,

389
00:36:18,068 --> 00:36:24,168
straining his flabby muscles
to show off in front of that cute girl.

390
00:36:29,578 --> 00:36:33,218
Darling, you might have a stroke.

391
00:36:35,628 --> 00:36:38,040
My wife likes ridiculing me.

392
00:36:38,088 --> 00:36:41,308
I let her.
It's psychotherapy.

393
00:37:44,658 --> 00:37:49,588
I never know whether mywife
is really crying or just play acting.

394
00:37:50,328 --> 00:37:52,914
I'll be damned if it isn't real.

395
00:37:55,128 --> 00:37:58,000
It happens when you catch
a glimpse of death.

396
00:37:58,048 --> 00:38:00,120
Can't you shut up?

397
00:38:00,168 --> 00:38:03,228
My wife can really live a part.

398
00:38:03,758 --> 00:38:07,300
For two years,
she made me think she had cancer

399
00:38:07,348 --> 00:38:10,970
and plagued us
with every possible symptom,

400
00:38:11,018 --> 00:38:13,930
even though the doctors
could find nothing wrong with her.

401
00:38:13,978 --> 00:38:19,810
Eventually we believed her
more than the doctors!

402
00:38:19,858 --> 00:38:22,100
It's natural that you're upset,

403
00:38:22,148 --> 00:38:24,650
but why not leave your wife
in peace for a while?

404
00:38:24,698 --> 00:38:27,110
A woman has a right
to her tears, eh?

405
00:38:27,158 --> 00:38:30,588
Don't get in the way
of a woman's tears.

406
00:38:31,708 --> 00:38:36,490
You are beautiful,
but old Berit's a bit past her prime.

407
00:38:36,538 --> 00:38:38,290
So you can afford to defend her.

408
00:38:38,338 --> 00:38:41,830
I sympathize with her.
For several reasons.

409
00:38:41,878 --> 00:38:44,090
Very sarcastic!

410
00:38:44,138 --> 00:38:47,250
Yet you don't seem
in the least hysterical.

411
00:38:47,298 --> 00:38:51,010
But little Berit is.

412
00:38:51,058 --> 00:38:53,340
Do you know
what that means for me?

413
00:38:53,388 --> 00:38:55,220
I gather you're a Catholic.

414
00:38:55,268 --> 00:38:57,770
Quite right.
That's how I stand it.

415
00:38:57,818 --> 00:39:00,180
We ridicule each other.

416
00:39:00,228 --> 00:39:02,560
She has her hysteria.
I have my Catholicism.

417
00:39:02,608 --> 00:39:05,900
So, you see,
we need each other.

418
00:39:05,948 --> 00:39:09,677
It's only egoism
that we haven't killed each other.

419
00:39:19,338 --> 00:39:21,410
There it came.

420
00:39:21,458 --> 00:39:25,018
That's what is called syncopes,
isn't it?

421
00:39:27,088 --> 00:39:29,688
Very funny.

422
00:39:32,848 --> 00:39:36,970
If I'd had a stopwatch,
I could have timed the explosion.

423
00:39:37,018 --> 00:39:40,488
Shut up! Shut up!

424
00:39:45,778 --> 00:39:49,248
This may be too blunt,

425
00:39:50,078 --> 00:39:54,088
but for the children's sake,
will you please get out.

426
00:40:03,338 --> 00:40:06,638
Forgive us, if you can.

427
00:40:36,828 --> 00:40:40,758
It was with mixed feelings
I saw this region again.

428
00:40:41,038 --> 00:40:44,098
I had my first practice here,

429
00:40:44,338 --> 00:40:48,808
and my old mother lives nearby.

430
00:40:58,848 --> 00:41:01,278
Hello there, Doctor.

431
00:41:02,358 --> 00:41:04,770
So you're in these parts again,
Doctor?

432
00:41:04,818 --> 00:41:08,341
Shall I fill it up?
Pass me the key to the hood.

433
00:41:10,698 --> 00:41:13,498
Eva! Come here a moment!

434
00:41:15,288 --> 00:41:19,048
It's Dr. Borg in person.

435
00:41:19,618 --> 00:41:23,790
Mom and Dad and the whole countryside
still talk about him.

436
00:41:23,838 --> 00:41:26,348
The world's best doctor.

437
00:41:27,628 --> 00:41:31,380
Let's call the baby after him.

438
00:41:31,428 --> 00:41:34,840
Isak Akerman-- not a bad name
for a prime minister.

439
00:41:34,888 --> 00:41:36,880
Suppose it's a girl.

440
00:41:36,928 --> 00:41:40,238
We only have boys.

441
00:41:46,318 --> 00:41:49,350
And how's your father these days?

442
00:41:49,398 --> 00:41:53,440
Oh, Dad's getting a bit decrepit.

443
00:41:53,488 --> 00:41:56,538
But Mom's as lively as a cricket.

444
00:41:57,408 --> 00:42:00,657
And you're going to see
your mother, Doctor?

445
00:42:00,918 --> 00:42:04,870
She's amazing.
She must be at least 95.

446
00:42:04,918 --> 00:42:07,718
- Ninety-six.
- Imagine that.

447
00:42:09,588 --> 00:42:11,250
What do I oweyou?

448
00:42:11,298 --> 00:42:14,550
- This is on Eva and me!
- Absolutely not!

449
00:42:14,598 --> 00:42:18,510
Don't insult us, Doctor.
We can do the proper thing too!

450
00:42:18,558 --> 00:42:23,180
Why should you pay
for my gasoline?

451
00:42:23,228 --> 00:42:27,060
There are things
that can't be paid back--

452
00:42:27,108 --> 00:42:28,810
not even with gas.

453
00:42:28,858 --> 00:42:31,400
We haven't forgotten.

454
00:42:31,448 --> 00:42:35,230
Ask anyone around here.

455
00:42:35,278 --> 00:42:38,588
They all remember your kindness.

456
00:42:40,328 --> 00:42:43,620
Maybe I should have stayed here.

457
00:42:43,668 --> 00:42:45,548
What doyou mean?

458
00:42:48,498 --> 00:42:51,330
You said you should have stayed.

459
00:42:51,378 --> 00:42:53,630
Did l?

460
00:42:53,678 --> 00:42:57,478
Well, thanks anyway.

461
00:42:58,388 --> 00:43:03,090
Let me know when the new son arrives,
and I'll be the godfather.

462
00:43:03,138 --> 00:43:05,318
You know where to find me.

463
00:43:26,248 --> 00:43:31,210
During lunch I was in good spirits

464
00:43:31,258 --> 00:43:35,790
and told the young people about
my years as district medical officer.

465
00:43:35,838 --> 00:43:38,500
My stories were quite a success,

466
00:43:38,548 --> 00:43:42,340
and I don't think they laughed
merely out of courtesy.

467
00:43:42,388 --> 00:43:47,148
I had wine with the lunch,
and then port with the coffee.

468
00:43:51,028 --> 00:43:56,958
Ah, when creation shows
so much beauty,

469
00:43:57,528 --> 00:44:00,860
how radiant must be its source!

470
00:44:00,908 --> 00:44:03,150
He is going to be a minister,
and Viktor a doctor.

471
00:44:03,198 --> 00:44:05,410
Reciting poetry
is against our agreement

472
00:44:05,458 --> 00:44:09,870
not to discuss God
or science on this trip.

473
00:44:09,918 --> 00:44:11,200
It was beautiful!

474
00:44:11,248 --> 00:44:15,710
How can anyone today
study to become a minister!

475
00:44:15,758 --> 00:44:20,210
Your rationalism is as dry as dust.

476
00:44:20,258 --> 00:44:22,050
I say that modern man--

477
00:44:22,098 --> 00:44:23,920
I say that--

478
00:44:23,968 --> 00:44:29,180
believes only in himself

479
00:44:29,228 --> 00:44:30,930
and his biological death.

480
00:44:30,978 --> 00:44:33,810
Modern man is a figment
of your imagination.

481
00:44:33,858 --> 00:44:37,520
Man regards death with horror.

482
00:44:37,568 --> 00:44:41,860
Religion for the people.
Opium for the aching limb.

483
00:44:41,908 --> 00:44:43,530
How sweet they both are!

484
00:44:43,578 --> 00:44:45,700
I always agree with the one
I spoke with last.

485
00:44:45,748 --> 00:44:48,700
Once you believed in Santa Claus--
now in God.

486
00:44:48,748 --> 00:44:52,240
You never had any imagination!

487
00:44:52,288 --> 00:44:54,870
What do you say, Professor?

488
00:44:54,918 --> 00:45:00,750
Whatever I said
would be met with tolerant irony,

489
00:45:00,798 --> 00:45:02,380
so I'll say nothing.

490
00:45:02,428 --> 00:45:04,380
I'm sure they'll be disappointed.

491
00:45:04,428 --> 00:45:08,438
No, Sara. Very, very happy.

492
00:45:10,228 --> 00:45:13,770
"Where is the friend I seek

493
00:45:13,818 --> 00:45:19,560
at break of day?

494
00:45:19,608 --> 00:45:23,650
When night falls, when--"

495
00:45:23,698 --> 00:45:27,070
"When night falls,
I still have not found Him."

496
00:45:27,118 --> 00:45:30,910
"My burning heart
shows me His traces--"

497
00:45:30,958 --> 00:45:33,329
Are you religious, Professor?

498
00:45:35,128 --> 00:45:39,250
"I see His traces

499
00:45:39,298 --> 00:45:44,398
wherever flowers bloom.

500
00:45:49,228 --> 00:45:54,778
His love is mingled with every air."

501
00:45:55,438 --> 00:45:58,440
"His voice calls
in the summer wind."

502
00:45:58,488 --> 00:46:01,908
Not bad for a love poem.

503
00:46:02,488 --> 00:46:07,088
I've gone all solemn again
for no reason.

504
00:46:07,998 --> 00:46:13,200
Well, I'm going to call on my mother.
I'll be back soon.

505
00:46:13,248 --> 00:46:16,258
- May I come?
- Of course.

506
00:46:27,678 --> 00:46:30,318
Here comes the thunder.

507
00:46:36,568 --> 00:46:41,060
I have just sent you a telegram

508
00:46:41,108 --> 00:46:44,400
on your great day.

509
00:46:44,448 --> 00:46:46,030
And now you're here.

510
00:46:46,078 --> 00:46:49,878
We all have our bright moments,
dear Mother.

511
00:46:52,078 --> 00:46:54,910
Is that your wife over there?

512
00:46:54,958 --> 00:46:58,298
I don't want to talk to her.

513
00:46:58,708 --> 00:47:01,170
She has done us too much harm.

514
00:47:01,218 --> 00:47:04,000
No, Mother dear.

515
00:47:04,048 --> 00:47:08,670
This is Evald's wife, Marianne.

516
00:47:08,718 --> 00:47:12,068
Well, let her come
and say hello to me.

517
00:47:14,058 --> 00:47:16,260
Good day, Mrs. Borg.

518
00:47:16,308 --> 00:47:19,680
And why are you
gadding about like this?

519
00:47:19,728 --> 00:47:21,810
I have been in Stockholm for a visit.

520
00:47:21,858 --> 00:47:26,020
Why aren't you with Evald
and the child?

521
00:47:26,068 --> 00:47:29,030
Evald and I have no children.

522
00:47:29,078 --> 00:47:34,508
These young people nowadays!
I bore ten children.

523
00:47:35,878 --> 00:47:41,928
Will you please hand me
that big box over there.

524
00:47:43,668 --> 00:47:46,630
My mother lived in this house.

525
00:47:46,678 --> 00:47:50,380
Do you remember
coming to see her, Isak?

526
00:47:50,428 --> 00:47:52,340
Very well.

527
00:47:52,388 --> 00:47:56,470
Here are some of your toys.

528
00:47:56,518 --> 00:48:01,480
I have been trying to think
which of you owned what.

529
00:48:01,528 --> 00:48:05,310
Ten children,
and all dead except Isak.

530
00:48:05,358 --> 00:48:07,570
Twenty grandchildren.

531
00:48:07,618 --> 00:48:10,570
Evald's the only one
who comes to see me.

532
00:48:10,618 --> 00:48:13,775
Don't get me wrong--
I'm not complaining.

533
00:48:14,248 --> 00:48:17,530
Fifteen great-grandchildren
whom I have never seen.

534
00:48:17,578 --> 00:48:23,370
I send presents
for all their birthdays.

535
00:48:23,418 --> 00:48:29,300
I get letters of thanks,
but nobody bothers to visit me

536
00:48:29,348 --> 00:48:32,920
unless they want to borrow money.

537
00:48:32,968 --> 00:48:36,220
Oh, I know I'm tiresome.

538
00:48:36,268 --> 00:48:38,850
Don't think that, Mother.

539
00:48:38,898 --> 00:48:41,318
And I've one more fault.

540
00:48:41,568 --> 00:48:43,600
I don't die.

541
00:48:43,648 --> 00:48:47,310
The inheritance
isn't being divided up

542
00:48:47,358 --> 00:48:50,744
the way these crafty young people
had planned.

543
00:48:51,578 --> 00:48:55,200
This was Sigbritt's doll.

544
00:48:55,248 --> 00:48:58,450
She got it when she turned eight.

545
00:48:58,498 --> 00:49:01,200
I made the dress myself.

546
00:49:01,248 --> 00:49:03,660
But she never cared for it

547
00:49:03,708 --> 00:49:05,710
so it went to Charlotta.

548
00:49:05,758 --> 00:49:09,598
She took care of it--
I remember it clearly.

549
00:49:11,098 --> 00:49:12,920
Do you see who that is?

550
00:49:12,968 --> 00:49:16,568
Sigfrid was three
and you were five.

551
00:49:16,978 --> 00:49:20,470
And myself.

552
00:49:20,518 --> 00:49:23,532
What a fright
one looked in those days.

553
00:49:23,978 --> 00:49:25,480
May I have it?

554
00:49:25,528 --> 00:49:28,368
By all means.
It's only rubbish.

555
00:49:29,068 --> 00:49:30,980
And here's a coloring book.

556
00:49:31,028 --> 00:49:36,700
I don't know whose it was.

557
00:49:36,748 --> 00:49:39,628
They've all put their names in it.

558
00:49:40,368 --> 00:49:42,410
Kristina has scrawled:

559
00:49:42,458 --> 00:49:47,718
"I love Papa more than
anything in the whole world."

560
00:49:48,668 --> 00:49:53,978
And Birgitta has put:
"I'm going to marry Papa."

561
00:49:54,718 --> 00:49:59,398
Isn't that funny?
I laughed when I saw it.

562
00:50:00,138 --> 00:50:04,350
Don't you think it's cold in here?

563
00:50:04,398 --> 00:50:07,060
No, not particularly.

564
00:50:07,108 --> 00:50:10,860
I have felt cold all my life.

565
00:50:10,908 --> 00:50:14,400
Mostly my stomach.
I wonder why.

566
00:50:14,448 --> 00:50:17,360
You have low blood pressure.

567
00:50:17,408 --> 00:50:22,320
Let us have some tea,
and we can sit and talk.

568
00:50:22,368 --> 00:50:26,371
No, thank you, Mother.
We won't disturb you any longer.

569
00:50:29,758 --> 00:50:32,750
Sigbritt's eldest boy
will soon be 50.

570
00:50:32,798 --> 00:50:35,960
I thought of giving him
Father's gold watch.

571
00:50:36,008 --> 00:50:40,228
It has no hands.
Does that matter?

572
00:50:49,858 --> 00:50:54,230
I remember when Sigbritt's boy
was a newborn.

573
00:50:54,278 --> 00:50:59,740
He used to lie in the lilac arbor
at the summer house.

574
00:50:59,788 --> 00:51:03,128
Now he's turning 50.

575
00:51:03,958 --> 00:51:09,500
And little cousin Sara used to
carry him around and sing to him.

576
00:51:09,548 --> 00:51:12,748
She married Sigfrid,
that good-for-nothing.

577
00:51:13,298 --> 00:51:18,800
Well, you must go now,
or you'll be late for the ceremony.

578
00:51:18,848 --> 00:51:23,970
I am very glad you came,
and I hope to seeyou again.

579
00:51:24,018 --> 00:51:27,818
Give my love to Evald.
Good-bye.

580
00:51:54,218 --> 00:51:56,670
Where are Anders and Viktor?

581
00:51:56,718 --> 00:52:02,648
They started arguing about God,
and then they lost their tempers.

582
00:52:02,808 --> 00:52:05,970
And Anders tried
to twist Viktor's arm,

583
00:52:06,018 --> 00:52:10,020
and Viktor said that was
a lousy argument for God's existence.

584
00:52:10,068 --> 00:52:13,770
I said they could talk
about me instead.

585
00:52:13,818 --> 00:52:18,570
Then they told me to shut up
because I didn't understand the debate,

586
00:52:18,618 --> 00:52:20,150
so I left.

587
00:52:20,198 --> 00:52:24,360
They went up the hill to fight it out
because each insisted...

588
00:52:24,408 --> 00:52:27,410
the other had hurt
his innermost feelings.

589
00:52:27,458 --> 00:52:30,044
- Where are they now?
- Up there.

590
00:52:33,798 --> 00:52:35,500
I'll see to them.

591
00:52:35,548 --> 00:52:38,268
Which one do you like best?

592
00:52:38,338 --> 00:52:40,630
Which one do you like best?

593
00:52:40,678 --> 00:52:44,090
I don't know.
Anders is going to be a minister--

594
00:52:44,138 --> 00:52:46,488
He's a darling.

595
00:52:47,098 --> 00:52:49,180
But a minister's wife--

596
00:52:49,228 --> 00:52:52,270
Viktor's nice too.
In a different way.

597
00:52:52,318 --> 00:52:55,810
- Viktor will go far, of course.
- What do you mean?

598
00:52:55,858 --> 00:53:01,150
A doctor earns more money.
And ministers are out of date.

599
00:53:01,198 --> 00:53:05,168
Though he has got nice legs
and a sweet neck.

600
00:53:06,118 --> 00:53:08,847
But how can anyone believe in God?

601
00:53:21,718 --> 00:53:24,608
Well? Does God exist?

602
00:53:47,998 --> 00:53:53,490
I dozed off,
but was haunted by vivid

603
00:53:53,538 --> 00:53:59,428
and humiliating dreams.

604
00:54:00,088 --> 00:54:06,470
There was something overpowering
in these dream images

605
00:54:06,518 --> 00:54:12,778
that bored relentlessly into my mind.

606
00:54:23,158 --> 00:54:25,958
Haveyou looked in the mirror, Isak?

607
00:54:28,328 --> 00:54:31,271
Then I'll show you
what you look like.

608
00:54:32,328 --> 00:54:35,660
You're a worried old man
who's soon going to die,

609
00:54:35,708 --> 00:54:38,718
but I have all my life before me.

610
00:54:40,008 --> 00:54:42,808
That hurt your feelings, after all.

611
00:54:43,338 --> 00:54:46,670
No, it didn't hurt.

612
00:54:46,718 --> 00:54:52,108
Yes, it hurt
because you can't bear the truth.

613
00:54:52,848 --> 00:54:56,698
The truth is that
I've been too considerate.

614
00:54:57,018 --> 00:54:59,889
And so became unintentionally cruel.

615
00:55:02,318 --> 00:55:03,480
I understand.

616
00:55:03,528 --> 00:55:08,748
No, you don't understand.
We don't speak the same language.

617
00:55:09,698 --> 00:55:11,490
Look in the mirror again.

618
00:55:11,538 --> 00:55:13,838
No, don't turn away.

619
00:55:14,168 --> 00:55:16,008
I see.

620
00:55:16,338 --> 00:55:18,298
Listen to me.

621
00:55:19,208 --> 00:55:22,728
I'm going to marry
your brother Sigfrid.

622
00:55:23,258 --> 00:55:27,688
Love is almost a game for us.

623
00:55:29,098 --> 00:55:33,858
Look at your face now.
Try to smile!

624
00:55:35,228 --> 00:55:38,118
There! Now you're smiling.

625
00:55:39,898 --> 00:55:42,238
But it hurts so.

626
00:55:42,448 --> 00:55:47,440
As professor emerit us,
you ought to know why it hurts.

627
00:55:47,488 --> 00:55:49,417
But you don't know.

628
00:55:50,198 --> 00:55:54,418
You know so much,
and you don't know anything.

629
00:55:56,078 --> 00:55:57,790
I must go.

630
00:55:57,838 --> 00:56:01,678
I promised to keep an eye
on Sigbritt's baby.

631
00:56:30,118 --> 00:56:32,628
Poor little thing.

632
00:56:33,038 --> 00:56:36,088
Hush, baby. Sleep.

633
00:56:37,078 --> 00:56:39,307
Don't be afraid of the wind

634
00:56:39,958 --> 00:56:45,098
or the birds

635
00:56:45,628 --> 00:56:48,888
or the waves of the sea.

636
00:56:49,298 --> 00:56:52,670
I'm here with you,
holding you tight.

637
00:56:52,718 --> 00:56:55,568
Don't be afraid, little one.

638
00:56:56,638 --> 00:56:59,068
It will soon be day again.

639
00:56:59,808 --> 00:57:01,850
No one will hurt you.

640
00:57:01,898 --> 00:57:05,368
I am with you.
I am holding you.

641
01:00:13,128 --> 01:00:15,642
Please come in, Professor Borg.

642
01:01:33,548 --> 01:01:36,562
Have you brought
your examination book?

643
01:01:43,098 --> 01:01:47,444
Please identify the bacterial specimen
under the microscope.

644
01:01:58,148 --> 01:02:00,591
There must be something wrong.

645
01:02:04,448 --> 01:02:06,030
Not with the microscope.

646
01:02:06,078 --> 01:02:09,668
I can't see a thing.

647
01:02:10,418 --> 01:02:13,428
Please read this text.

648
01:02:28,058 --> 01:02:29,901
What does it mean?

649
01:02:31,228 --> 01:02:33,278
I don't know.

650
01:02:34,648 --> 01:02:35,770
Really?

651
01:02:35,818 --> 01:02:39,948
I'm a doctor, not a linguist.

652
01:02:40,698 --> 01:02:46,748
What you see on the blackboard
is a doctor's first duty.

653
01:02:47,578 --> 01:02:50,798
Don't you know what that is?

654
01:02:53,288 --> 01:02:55,120
Let me think.

655
01:02:55,168 --> 01:02:57,098
Take your time.

656
01:02:58,838 --> 01:03:03,268
A doctor's first duty--

657
01:03:03,428 --> 01:03:05,438
A doctor's--

658
01:03:06,848 --> 01:03:08,300
I've forgotten.

659
01:03:08,348 --> 01:03:12,898
A doctor's first duty
is to ask for forgiveness.

660
01:03:13,308 --> 01:03:17,988
Of course! Now I remember!

661
01:03:29,408 --> 01:03:32,378
You have been accused of guilt.

662
01:03:35,248 --> 01:03:39,319
I'll make a note that you haven't
understood the charge.

663
01:03:41,718 --> 01:03:43,978
Is it serious?

664
01:03:44,388 --> 01:03:46,474
Unfortunately, Professor.

665
01:03:58,068 --> 01:03:59,810
I have a weak heart.

666
01:03:59,858 --> 01:04:02,190
I'm an old man.

667
01:04:02,238 --> 01:04:05,440
You must be lenient with me.
It's only fair.

668
01:04:05,488 --> 01:04:08,780
There's nothing about your heart
in my papers.

669
01:04:08,828 --> 01:04:10,280
Do you want to stop the examination?

670
01:04:10,328 --> 01:04:12,668
No, for God's sake, no!

671
01:04:19,878 --> 01:04:23,388
Please diagnose the patient.

672
01:04:36,938 --> 01:04:39,868
The patient is dead.

673
01:05:01,838 --> 01:05:04,080
What are you writing in my book?

674
01:05:04,128 --> 01:05:07,518
- My verdict.
- And that is?

675
01:05:07,638 --> 01:05:09,898
That you are incompetent.

676
01:05:12,968 --> 01:05:18,608
You are also accused of some minor
but still serious offenses.

677
01:05:18,978 --> 01:05:23,698
Callousness, selfishness,
ruthlessness.

678
01:05:24,238 --> 01:05:27,270
Your wife has made the charge.

679
01:05:27,318 --> 01:05:29,690
You'll be confronted with her.

680
01:05:29,738 --> 01:05:32,280
But myw ife has been dead for years!

681
01:05:32,328 --> 01:05:34,498
Do you think I'm joking?

682
01:05:36,788 --> 01:05:39,258
Please come with me.

683
01:05:39,458 --> 01:05:41,838
You have no choice.

684
01:08:02,138 --> 01:08:05,760
Many forget a woman
who has been dead for 30 years.

685
01:08:05,808 --> 01:08:09,238
Some cherish
a sweet and fading picture,

686
01:08:09,858 --> 01:08:15,328
but you can recall this scene
at any time.

687
01:08:15,868 --> 01:08:18,878
Tuesday, May 1 st, 1917.

688
01:08:19,828 --> 01:08:21,570
You stood on this very spot.

689
01:08:21,618 --> 01:08:26,338
and heard and saw what that man
and woman said and did.

690
01:08:41,058 --> 01:08:45,550
Now I'll go home and tell Isak.
I know just what he'll say.

691
01:08:45,598 --> 01:08:49,238
"My poor girl, I'm sorry for you."

692
01:08:50,818 --> 01:08:53,488
Just as if he were God.

693
01:08:54,818 --> 01:09:00,328
Then I'll weep and say,
"Do you really feel sorry for me?"

694
01:09:01,288 --> 01:09:06,008
He'll say, "Yes, very sorry."

695
01:09:06,328 --> 01:09:10,410
Then I'll weep even more
and ask him to forgive me.

696
01:09:10,458 --> 01:09:11,700
He'll say,

697
01:09:11,748 --> 01:09:17,348
"You mustn't beg my forgiveness.
There is nothing to forgive."

698
01:09:19,848 --> 01:09:22,858
But he doesn't mean
a word he says

699
01:09:24,558 --> 01:09:27,108
because he's cold as ice.

700
01:09:28,728 --> 01:09:31,698
And suddenly he gets very tender,

701
01:09:32,938 --> 01:09:35,738
and I scream at him that he's mad

702
01:09:37,238 --> 01:09:40,788
and that his hypocrisy makes me sick.

703
01:09:41,528 --> 01:09:44,610
Then he says
he'll get me a sedative

704
01:09:44,658 --> 01:09:48,168
and that he understands
everything quite well.

705
01:09:49,078 --> 01:09:52,601
And I tell him it's his fault
that I am as I am.

706
01:09:53,668 --> 01:09:58,098
And he looks sad
and says it is his fault.

707
01:09:59,718 --> 01:10:02,630
But he doesn't really care
about anything

708
01:10:02,678 --> 01:10:04,938
because he's so cold.

709
01:10:28,618 --> 01:10:30,160
Where is she?

710
01:10:30,208 --> 01:10:34,750
Gone. All are gone.

711
01:10:34,798 --> 01:10:39,018
Removed by an operation,
Professor.

712
01:10:39,338 --> 01:10:43,050
A surgical masterpiece.
No pain.

713
01:10:43,098 --> 01:10:45,684
Nothing that bleeds or trembles.

714
01:10:45,928 --> 01:10:48,398
How silent it is.

715
01:10:49,098 --> 01:10:52,347
A perfect achievement
in its way, Professor.

716
01:10:52,648 --> 01:10:54,470
And the punishment?

717
01:10:54,518 --> 01:10:58,270
I don't know.
The usual, I suppose.

718
01:10:58,318 --> 01:10:59,940
The usual?

719
01:10:59,988 --> 01:11:01,940
Loneliness.

720
01:11:01,988 --> 01:11:04,320
Loneliness?

721
01:11:04,368 --> 01:11:07,498
Precisely.

722
01:11:07,948 --> 01:11:10,110
Is there no mercy?

723
01:11:10,158 --> 01:11:13,798
Don't ask me. I don't know.

724
01:11:33,728 --> 01:11:35,778
What's this?

725
01:11:36,318 --> 01:11:39,230
The children wanted
to stretch their legs.

726
01:11:39,278 --> 01:11:42,020
But it's still raining.

727
01:11:42,068 --> 01:11:47,038
I told them about today
and they want to honor you.

728
01:11:48,198 --> 01:11:49,320
Slept well?

729
01:11:49,368 --> 01:11:55,428
Yes, but recently I've had
the weirdest dreams,

730
01:11:59,958 --> 01:12:04,340
as if I  must tell myself something
I won't listen to when I'm awake.

731
01:12:04,388 --> 01:12:06,018
What's that?

732
01:12:07,098 --> 01:12:10,518
That I'm dead.
Although I'm alive.

733
01:12:11,098 --> 01:12:13,898
You and Evald are very alike.

734
01:12:14,478 --> 01:12:16,180
So you've said.

735
01:12:16,228 --> 01:12:18,778
He said the same thing.

736
01:12:18,898 --> 01:12:21,020
About me?

737
01:12:21,068 --> 01:12:22,850
No. About himself.

738
01:12:22,898 --> 01:12:24,658
But he's only 38.

739
01:12:26,948 --> 01:12:29,530
May I tell you about it?

740
01:12:29,578 --> 01:12:33,798
Yes, I'd be grateful.

741
01:12:35,078 --> 01:12:39,500
A few months ago
I wanted to talk to Evald,

742
01:12:39,548 --> 01:12:41,710
so he drove me down to the sea.

743
01:12:41,758 --> 01:12:46,098
It was raining then too.
He sat where you sit now.

744
01:12:48,098 --> 01:12:52,510
Well, you've trapped me.
What do you want to say?

745
01:12:52,558 --> 01:12:55,144
Something unpleasant, of course.

746
01:12:56,148 --> 01:12:58,260
I wish I didn't have to.

747
01:12:58,308 --> 01:13:00,698
You have found someone else.

748
01:13:01,278 --> 01:13:03,190
Don't be childish.

749
01:13:03,238 --> 01:13:07,900
You tell me in funereal tones
that you must talk to me,

750
01:13:07,948 --> 01:13:11,740
and then you find it
hard to begin.

751
01:13:11,788 --> 01:13:17,740
Come on, for heaven's sake!
Don't keep me on tenterhooks!

752
01:13:17,788 --> 01:13:19,700
I almost want to laugh now.

753
01:13:19,748 --> 01:13:21,700
Whatever do you think
I'm going to tell you?

754
01:13:21,748 --> 01:13:26,000
That I've killed someone,
or stolen the faculty funds?

755
01:13:26,048 --> 01:13:28,134
I'm going to have a baby.

756
01:13:30,548 --> 01:13:32,130
Are you sure?

757
01:13:32,178 --> 01:13:34,630
The doctor told me yesterday.

758
01:13:34,678 --> 01:13:39,358
So that was the secret.

759
01:13:40,058 --> 01:13:44,658
I might as well tell you
that I intend to have this child.

760
01:13:45,568 --> 01:13:48,768
- You've made up your mind?
- Yes, I have.

761
01:14:04,668 --> 01:14:06,790
You know I don't want a child.

762
01:14:06,838 --> 01:14:09,340
You'll have to choose
between me and the child.

763
01:14:09,388 --> 01:14:12,768
- Poor Evald.
- Don't "poor Evald" me!

764
01:14:13,258 --> 01:14:16,800
It's absurd to bring children
into this world

765
01:14:16,848 --> 01:14:19,800
and think they'll be better off
than we are.

766
01:14:19,848 --> 01:14:23,770
- That's just an excuse.
- Call it what you want.

767
01:14:23,818 --> 01:14:28,150
I was an unwanted child
in a hellish marriage.

768
01:14:28,198 --> 01:14:31,150
Is he even sure I'm his son?

769
01:14:31,198 --> 01:14:34,900
That's no excuse
for behaving like this.

770
01:14:34,948 --> 01:14:36,530
I must be at the hospital at 3:00.

771
01:14:36,578 --> 01:14:41,404
I have neither the time nor the desire
to discuss this any further.

772
01:14:41,628 --> 01:14:43,838
You're a coward.

773
01:14:44,088 --> 01:14:45,848
Yes.

774
01:14:45,918 --> 01:14:48,120
This life sickens me.

775
01:14:48,168 --> 01:14:49,880
I will not be forced to take on

776
01:14:49,928 --> 01:14:52,840
a responsibility that will make me live
for one day longer than I want to.

777
01:14:52,888 --> 01:14:58,028
And you know
that I mean what I say.

778
01:15:10,148 --> 01:15:12,020
I know that this is wrong.

779
01:15:12,068 --> 01:15:14,480
There's neither right nor wrong.

780
01:15:14,528 --> 01:15:18,700
We act according to our needs.

781
01:15:18,748 --> 01:15:20,591
And what are they?

782
01:15:20,748 --> 01:15:25,330
Yours is a hellish desire
to live and to create life.

783
01:15:25,378 --> 01:15:26,798
And yours?

784
01:15:27,628 --> 01:15:31,928
Mine is to be dead.
Stone-dead.

785
01:15:44,518 --> 01:15:48,578
If you want to smoke a cigarette,
I don't mind.

786
01:15:52,608 --> 01:15:55,748
Why have you told me all this?

787
01:15:57,908 --> 01:16:04,128
I saw you with your mother,
and I was panic-stricken.

788
01:16:05,328 --> 01:16:07,298
I don't understand.

789
01:16:09,548 --> 01:16:14,178
I thought: That's his mother.

790
01:16:14,678 --> 01:16:19,800
An old woman, cold as ice,

791
01:16:19,848 --> 01:16:23,188
more forbidding than death.

792
01:16:24,148 --> 01:16:26,698
And this is her son,

793
01:16:26,938 --> 01:16:30,408
and there are light-years
between them.

794
01:16:31,148 --> 01:16:34,078
He himself says
he's a living corpse.

795
01:16:35,908 --> 01:16:41,628
And Evald is growing
just as lonely, cold and dead.

796
01:16:42,998 --> 01:16:46,298
And I thought of the baby inside me.

797
01:16:46,998 --> 01:16:51,290
All along the line,
there's nothing but cold and death

798
01:16:51,338 --> 01:16:54,638
and loneliness.

799
01:16:55,218 --> 01:16:57,848
It must end somewhere.

800
01:16:58,718 --> 01:17:01,568
But you're going back to Evald!

801
01:17:03,018 --> 01:17:06,140
To say I can't agree
to his conditions.

802
01:17:06,188 --> 01:17:10,270
I want this child.
No one can take it from me.

803
01:17:10,318 --> 01:17:13,047
Not even the man
I love most ofall.

804
01:17:16,198 --> 01:17:18,320
Can I help you?

805
01:17:18,368 --> 01:17:20,297
No one can help me.

806
01:17:21,408 --> 01:17:24,798
We are too old.
Things have gone too far.

807
01:17:25,408 --> 01:17:28,330
What happened after your talk?

808
01:17:28,378 --> 01:17:31,138
Nothing.
I left him the next day.

809
01:17:31,378 --> 01:17:34,178
Hasn't he gotten in touch with you?

810
01:17:35,378 --> 01:17:40,438
- I don't want us to get--
- To get what?

811
01:17:41,888 --> 01:17:44,818
Like those two in the car today.

812
01:17:46,268 --> 01:17:49,198
I was just thinking of them.

813
01:17:49,438 --> 01:17:53,238
It reminded me of my own marriage.

814
01:17:53,688 --> 01:17:55,560
But we love each other.

815
01:17:55,608 --> 01:17:58,150
Long may he live
Long may he live

816
01:17:58,198 --> 01:18:01,328
May he live to be
a hundred years old

817
01:18:03,328 --> 01:18:06,280
We heard you're celebrating
a grand occasion today.

818
01:18:06,328 --> 01:18:10,580
With these simple flowers
we want to say

819
01:18:10,628 --> 01:18:15,250
that we are very impressed
that you've been a doctor for 50 years.

820
01:18:15,298 --> 01:18:19,388
We know you must be
a very wise old man

821
01:18:19,928 --> 01:18:22,670
who knows everything about life

822
01:18:22,718 --> 01:18:27,438
and has learned
all the instructions by heart.

823
01:18:29,438 --> 01:18:32,198
Thank you.

824
01:18:33,148 --> 01:18:36,618
Now we must go on.
It's getting late.

825
01:19:05,428 --> 01:19:10,090
So you did come.
Evald and I had given up hope.

826
01:19:10,138 --> 01:19:13,238
A nice drive is relaxing, isn't it?

827
01:19:13,768 --> 01:19:17,028
You'll have to get
into your tails at once.

828
01:19:17,778 --> 01:19:21,440
Good afternoon, Marianne.
I've told Evald you're coming.

829
01:19:21,488 --> 01:19:24,288
Thank you.
That was most kind.

830
01:19:24,988 --> 01:19:26,940
So you came after all, Miss Agda.

831
01:19:26,988 --> 01:19:32,378
I considered it my duty.
But my pleasure's been spoiled.

832
01:19:33,378 --> 01:19:35,258
Welcome, Father.

833
01:19:36,208 --> 01:19:38,290
As you see,
I've brought Marianne with me.

834
01:19:38,338 --> 01:19:41,130
- Hello, Marianne.
- May I put my things upstairs?

835
01:19:41,178 --> 01:19:44,250
The guest room as usual, Father?

836
01:19:44,298 --> 01:19:47,384
Let me take your bag.
It's rather heavy.

837
01:19:50,558 --> 01:19:53,470
- Did you have a good trip?
- Yes, it was pleasant.

838
01:19:53,518 --> 01:19:54,810
Who are those young people?

839
01:19:54,858 --> 01:19:57,140
I don't know. They're nice,
and they're off to Italy.

840
01:19:57,188 --> 01:20:00,190
- They seem nice.
- Yes, they're very nice.

841
01:20:00,238 --> 01:20:03,248
It's a quarter past 4:00.

842
01:20:08,038 --> 01:20:10,481
I've bought you new shoelaces.

843
01:20:18,998 --> 01:20:21,420
I'm leaving tomorrow,
so don't worry.

844
01:20:21,468 --> 01:20:23,920
- Areyou going to a hotel?
- No, why?

845
01:20:23,968 --> 01:20:27,760
Can't we share the bedroom
for one more night? Unless you object.

846
01:20:27,808 --> 01:20:30,880
- Give me a hand unpacking?
- It's nice to see you.

847
01:20:30,928 --> 01:20:32,890
And unexpected.

848
01:20:32,938 --> 01:20:34,680
Same here.

849
01:20:34,728 --> 01:20:37,640
Are we going on
to the banquet afterwards?

850
01:20:37,688 --> 01:20:42,514
Yes, I'll just call Stenberg
and tell him I'll have a lady with me.

851
01:20:49,868 --> 01:20:52,298
Hurry up, Professor!

852
01:22:26,918 --> 01:22:31,920
During the ceremony,

853
01:22:31,968 --> 01:22:36,188
my thoughts strayed
to the day's events,

854
01:22:36,678 --> 01:22:40,970
and it was then I decided

855
01:22:41,018 --> 01:22:44,118
to write down what had happened.

856
01:22:44,278 --> 01:22:50,230
In this jumble of events,

857
01:22:50,278 --> 01:22:54,788
I seemed to discern
an extraordinary logic.

858
01:23:20,138 --> 01:23:23,180
Did you enjoy the ceremony?

859
01:23:23,228 --> 01:23:25,238
Yes, thank you.

860
01:23:26,818 --> 01:23:28,390
Areyou tired, Miss Agda?

861
01:23:28,438 --> 01:23:30,100
I won't deny it.

862
01:23:30,148 --> 01:23:32,591
Take one of my sleeping pills.

863
01:23:35,028 --> 01:23:40,208
Miss Agda, I am sorry
about this morning.

864
01:23:40,458 --> 01:23:42,450
Are you ill, Professor?

865
01:23:42,498 --> 01:23:44,490
No. Why?

866
01:23:44,538 --> 01:23:48,258
I don't like the sound of it.

867
01:23:48,588 --> 01:23:51,531
Is it so rare
for me to say I'm sorry?

868
01:23:53,638 --> 01:23:56,438
Do you want the carafe
on the table?

869
01:24:20,118 --> 01:24:24,338
Thank you anyway, Professor.
Good night.

870
01:24:24,628 --> 01:24:26,678
Miss Agda,

871
01:24:28,378 --> 01:24:32,750
as we have known each other

872
01:24:32,798 --> 01:24:34,960
for so many years,

873
01:24:35,008 --> 01:24:38,590
don't you think we could call
each other Agda and Isak?

874
01:24:38,638 --> 01:24:41,340
No, I don't.

875
01:24:41,388 --> 01:24:42,988
Why not?

876
01:24:43,478 --> 01:24:46,492
Have you brushed your teeth,
Professor?

877
01:24:47,148 --> 01:24:51,310
No intimacies for me, thank you.

878
01:24:51,358 --> 01:24:53,600
It's all right between us as it is.

879
01:24:53,648 --> 01:24:56,610
But we are old now.

880
01:24:56,658 --> 01:25:01,748
Speak for yourself.
A woman is jealous of her reputation.

881
01:25:02,158 --> 01:25:06,450
What would people think if we
suddenly began to say Agda and Isak?

882
01:25:06,498 --> 01:25:08,450
They would make fun of us.

883
01:25:08,498 --> 01:25:11,960
Are you always right?

884
01:25:12,008 --> 01:25:14,130
Almost always.

885
01:25:14,178 --> 01:25:19,478
At our age,
we should know how to behave.

886
01:25:26,348 --> 01:25:30,730
Good night, Professor.
I'll leave the door ajar.

887
01:25:30,778 --> 01:25:35,118
You know where I am
if you want anything.

888
01:26:20,448 --> 01:26:24,200
Father Isak! You were splendid
in the procession.

889
01:26:24,248 --> 01:26:26,240
We were terribly proud
to know you.

890
01:26:26,288 --> 01:26:30,330
An old girl is giving us a lift
all the way to Hamburg.

891
01:26:30,378 --> 01:26:33,330
- Anders is mad about her.
- Oh, be quiet.

892
01:26:33,378 --> 01:26:35,210
We just wanted to say good-bye.

893
01:26:35,258 --> 01:26:38,415
Good-bye. And thank you
for your company.

894
01:26:40,048 --> 01:26:42,380
It's you I really love, you know.

895
01:26:42,428 --> 01:26:46,778
Today, tomorrow, always.

896
01:26:46,978 --> 01:26:49,148
I'll remember.

897
01:26:49,268 --> 01:26:52,278
Come on.

898
01:26:57,448 --> 01:27:01,498
We have to go now.

899
01:27:04,788 --> 01:27:07,208
Let me hear from you.

900
01:27:19,048 --> 01:27:21,848
- I think Uncle is asleep.
- Evald!

901
01:27:23,388 --> 01:27:24,710
Yes, Father?

902
01:27:24,758 --> 01:27:26,738
Areyou back already?

903
01:27:27,728 --> 01:27:30,488
Marianne lost the heel on a shoe.

904
01:27:32,148 --> 01:27:34,568
So you're going to the dance?

905
01:27:35,478 --> 01:27:37,698
I suppose so.

906
01:27:38,528 --> 01:27:41,650
- How are you, Father?
- Excellent.

907
01:27:41,698 --> 01:27:44,748
- Heart all right?
- Excellent.

908
01:27:46,198 --> 01:27:48,588
Sleep well.

909
01:27:50,498 --> 01:27:53,758
Sit down a moment.

910
01:27:55,168 --> 01:27:57,388
Anything special?

911
01:27:58,378 --> 01:28:04,018
How is it to be
between you and Marianne?

912
01:28:05,178 --> 01:28:06,880
Forgive my asking.

913
01:28:06,928 --> 01:28:08,728
I don't know.

914
01:28:09,268 --> 01:28:12,318
It's not my business, but--

915
01:28:14,018 --> 01:28:16,640
But wouldn't it--

916
01:28:16,688 --> 01:28:18,770
I have asked her to stay with me.

917
01:28:18,818 --> 01:28:21,060
Shouldn't you-- I mean--

918
01:28:21,108 --> 01:28:25,440
- I can't live without her.
- You mean alone?

919
01:28:25,488 --> 01:28:28,610
I can't live without her.
That's what I mean.

920
01:28:28,658 --> 01:28:30,650
Oh, I see.

921
01:28:30,698 --> 01:28:32,758
It will be as she wants.

922
01:28:32,868 --> 01:28:35,838
And she--

923
01:28:36,208 --> 01:28:39,638
She says she'll think about it.

924
01:28:40,258 --> 01:28:42,250
About that debt of yours--

925
01:28:42,298 --> 01:28:44,590
Don't worry,
you'll get your money.

926
01:28:44,638 --> 01:28:47,518
That's not what I meant.

927
01:28:49,718 --> 01:28:51,130
How are you, Uncle Isak?

928
01:28:51,178 --> 01:28:53,180
Fine.Just fine.

929
01:28:53,228 --> 01:28:56,260
I lost a heel.
Will these shoes do?

930
01:28:56,308 --> 01:28:59,068
They're very nice.

931
01:29:01,738 --> 01:29:04,118
Thanks for coming with me.

932
01:29:07,158 --> 01:29:10,378
I like you, Marianne.

933
01:29:10,698 --> 01:29:13,298
I like you too, Uncle Isak.

934
01:29:21,458 --> 01:29:25,928
If I have been worried
or sad during the day,

935
01:29:26,138 --> 01:29:32,018
it often calms me
to recall childhood memories.

936
01:29:32,728 --> 01:29:35,398
I did so on this evening too.

937
01:29:46,948 --> 01:29:50,628
Isak, there are no
wild strawberries left.

938
01:29:51,078 --> 01:29:53,360
Auntie wants you
to look for your papa.

939
01:29:53,408 --> 01:29:56,490
We'll sail around and meet you
at the other side of the island.

940
01:29:56,538 --> 01:30:01,218
I can't find either Papa or Mama.

941
01:30:01,498 --> 01:30:04,388
Come, I'll help you.
