October

12
00:03:55,757 --> 00:03:58,316
They say, our troops will leave the town by night.

13
00:04:02,563 --> 00:04:06,819
Are the Americans going to come here, guys?

14
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:11,348
All the youth is leaving town. What are we going to do?

15
00:04:20,928 --> 00:04:25,689
All the elder lads join the army.

16
00:04:25,724 --> 00:04:29,814
Yes! Lucky ones. They are accepted, and we are not. 
They say: grow older, someone should stay here.

17
00:04:33,227 --> 00:04:37,779
That’s right. We stay here not just to watch them.

18
00:04:39,184 --> 00:04:45,723
Scoundrels! What do they need in our land?
Brutes!

19
00:04:48,016 --> 00:04:51,989
Revenge! We should revenge! 
They’ll pay for this!

20
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:24,960
Look, guys, and remember everything
that they do here.

21
00:05:24,961 --> 00:05:29,956
- We should stay and revenge!
- We must not leave.

22
00:05:33,297 --> 00:05:43,240
We we’ll stay as guerillas.
Guys! We are pioneers!

23
00:05:43,653 --> 00:05:46,879
Yes! We should struggle to the end.

24
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:50,074
This is how the Labour Party teaches us.

25
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:54,805
Let’s tell our teacher about it.

26
00:05:55,412 --> 00:05:58,545
Right! Let’s visit him and tell him,

27
00:05:58,645 --> 00:06:09,070
 that we want to become guerillas,
soldiers of Kim Il-sung

28
00:06:13,256 --> 00:06:18,917
They stay here. They want to help our struggle.
I know, they are brave guys.

29
00:06:18,918 --> 00:06:22,406
You know them from school. Can we trust them?

30
00:06:22,407 --> 00:06:29,041
Yes! They are sons of workers. All of them are pioneers
they are certainly reliable.

31
00:06:29,042 --> 00:06:34,644
I think, it depends on the way they’re 
organized and guided.

32
00:06:37,929 --> 00:06:40,291
I charge you with that, comrade Park.

33
00:06:40,292 --> 00:06:48,582
- I assume, they have thought up this decision
well. - We should support the boys.

34
00:06:54,168 --> 00:06:55,624
- Comrade secretary!
- Yes. Who’s that?

35
00:06:55,625 --> 00:07:00,110
- Head of the district committee.
- How many people do you have?

36
00:07:00,111 --> 00:07:05,997
Uh? Thirty. That’s good!
You’ll help us get the.

37
00:07:05,998 --> 00:07:10,626
Wait in the agreed place in thirty minutes.

38
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:25,927
You’ll have to take direction of the second guerilla squad,
but don’t forget about the boys.

39
00:07:27,316 --> 00:07:30,653
Yes! I will fulfil the task of
the party committee.

40
00:07:30,654 --> 00:07:37,077
Remember: the success of a guerilla squad
depends mostly on severe military discipline.

41
00:07:37,078 --> 00:07:44,720
- Keep contact with the population. The population
will always support you. - Yes!

42
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:51,278
Yes? And the Sam Dong factory?
Seventeen people more?

43
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:55,308
Eighteen? Has everyone that are going to leave with me arrived?

44
00:07:55,309 --> 00:08:03,967
Not yet? Move along and report the full list
by number 20.

45
00:08:06,268 --> 00:08:09,379
Who is the smartest of these boys?

46
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:14,967
Choi Yong Chan is. He’s their leader.
He’s a very clever lad.

47
00:08:14,968 --> 00:08:21,507
Is he the one whose father was killed by
the Japanese on the factory?

48
00:08:21,508 --> 00:08:25,749
Yes, and he is so persistent. Just like
his father. He helped me at school.

49
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:30,984
He’s a good leader. I think he will
be very helpful to us.

50
00:08:30,985 --> 00:08:35,409
Very good. Well, he should be a liaison.

51
00:08:36,464 --> 00:08:39,843
- We decided to stay.
- Did the teacher approve this?

52
00:08:39,844 --> 00:08:47,197
- Yes, he knows.
- Will you work together? It’s good!

53
00:08:47,198 --> 00:08:53,677
Yes! This evening I’ll tell you everything. See you!

54
00:08:58,416 --> 00:09:01,929
- Are you leaving? - Yes. Lots of
fighters have found asylum at our side.

55
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:06,711
Are you leaving not for long, right? 

56
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:14,640
- Do you think, they are retreating for no reason?
- I know. That’s why I’m not going to leave.

57
00:09:14,641 --> 00:09:18,396
Our side can only win! It can’t be other way.

58
00:09:18,397 --> 00:09:22,039
Chang Yong is right. It’s not just a retreat.
We’ll come back here tomorrow by order.

59
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:25,525
Our people can’t be defeated.

60
00:09:25,526 --> 00:09:36,649
Our people will stand for itself.
This retreat is a temporary strategic retreat.

61
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:42,684
Don’t worry. We will show these Americans!

62
00:09:42,685 --> 00:09:48,578
- We’ll gather ourselves and start beating them stronger.
We’ll be back soon. - I think so, too.

63
00:09:51,483 --> 00:09:54,812
- Struggle, too! Don’t lose courage.
- Yes!

64
00:09:55,252 --> 00:10:04,520
- We’ll try to come back faster!
- Right! We will act, too!

65
00:10:07,657 --> 00:10:11,233
- It’s time to go. So long!
- Mother, faster!

66
00:10:11,234 --> 00:10:19,124
- Take this for the road.
- Thank you!

67
00:10:23,498 --> 00:10:30,009
- See you soon. - Come back, we are waiting for you.
- Watch yourself. - Good luck.

68
00:10:38,305 --> 00:10:40,338
- Why does our army retreat?

69
00:10:41,694 --> 00:10:49,845
- It’s needed. They know better when
to retreat and when to attack.

70
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:34,212
- Did you get to know the situation?
- Yes, yes, the situation is hard.

71
00:12:34,213 --> 00:12:44,861
We have ascertained that most of the population
are workers, the red ones. They are influenced by the Labour party.

72
00:12:44,862 --> 00:12:49,138
Uh... We’re in trouble again.
Did you catch many communists?

73
00:12:49,139 --> 00:12:51,658
- Yes, about 150.
- Why so few?

74
00:12:51,659 --> 00:12:52,507
It’s hard to get the information. The population
is hostile to Americans.

75
00:12:52,508 --> 00:12:53,508
I know one man, Kang Tae-Sik,
he can be helpful to us.

76
00:12:53,509 --> 00:12:54,846
Who is he?

77
00:12:54,847 --> 00:13:07,937
He is from this place, under the Japanese
he had his own rice mill in the town.

78
00:13:08,263 --> 00:13:09,730
I think, he’s quite reliable.

79
00:13:09,765 --> 00:13:31,932
He hates communists. He is dreaming of his own land.
I think he’s quite easy to buy. May I bring him here?

80
00:13:31,967 --> 00:13:34,727
Certainly, now!

81
00:13:46,436 --> 00:13:49,225
What do you think of your own land?

82
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:09,174
Yes, I think it’s good, I think about land
and about myself, too, erm.

83
00:14:09,175 --> 00:14:14,246
- Do you know that land is not
free? - Uh?

84
00:14:19,782 --> 00:14:23,061
If you agree to work for our UN forces...

85
00:14:23,062 --> 00:14:28,379
… you will get the land, and if you’re eager
enough, you will get lots of money.

86
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:35,129
Yes, mister commandant, I’m at your service.

87
00:14:56,549 --> 00:14:58,310
Have you remembered our words?

88
00:14:58,311 --> 00:15:01,064
Yes, I did. I remember them well.

89
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:04,805
- Captain!
- Yes?

90
00:15:04,806 --> 00:15:07,608
- We have 150 arrested.
- Yes!

91
00:15:12,065 --> 00:15:16,865
- All the communists must be killed this nights.
- It will be done, sir commandant.

92
00:15:24,011 --> 00:15:27,792
- Guard commandant should be strengthened!
- Yes, sir. Increase security.

93
00:15:29,576 --> 00:15:33,548
And look, captain, pay special attention
 to the communication.

94
00:15:33,549 --> 00:15:37,045
Good! It will be done, sir commandant.

95
00:15:47,876 --> 00:15:50,681
- First! Hello! Hello!

96
00:15:52,437 --> 00:15:55,946
Operator Moon.

97
00:16:02,307 --> 00:16:07,132
Yes? Fifty? Yes? Fifty? Yes? Eighty-fifth? I connect.

98
00:16:29,533 --> 00:16:32,435
- Hey! Stop!
- Hey! Girl!

99
00:17:40,323 --> 00:17:47,862
- Too many people were arrested, Mom!
- Hmm?

100
00:17:49,534 --> 00:17:52,295
How do you think, is Gil Yon gone?

101
00:17:52,296 --> 00:17:57,817
I don’t know. The special department evacuated 
employees. I think he managed to leave.

102
00:17:57,818 --> 00:18:09,035
Son, if someone will ask you,
tell that you know nothing.

103
00:18:09,036 --> 00:18:13,619
You bet! I won’t tell them anything!

104
00:18:14,697 --> 00:18:16,638
Stop! Here’s another one...

105
00:18:19,845 --> 00:18:22,566
Her son was a member of the Labour party.
They lived well.

106
00:18:22,567 --> 00:18:28,199
Now, perhaps, she doesn’t like it very much.
Everything comes to an end.

107
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:31,281
Where Yong Kil, answer quickly!

108
00:18:33,409 --> 00:18:37,048
How do we know. He left the house long ago,
I don’t know where he has gone.

109
00:18:37,065 --> 00:18:39,330
I warn you, I don’t believe this.
You’d better tell me everything you know.

110
00:18:42,013 --> 00:18:44,324
How can we know where brother is?

111
00:18:44,325 --> 00:18:49,792
I have nothing to say.

112
00:18:49,793 --> 00:19:02,549
Ha! He didn’t even call on his
mother to say goodbye?

113
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:05,203
I have nothing to say.

114
00:19:07,998 --> 00:19:13,430
Get her immediately! Now you’ll see!

115
00:19:15,137 --> 00:19:16,884
You have no right!...

116
00:19:20,286 --> 00:19:28,222
We need to teach her a lesson. 
She’s forgotten everything.

117
00:19:35,618 --> 00:19:37,740
Lucky hunt! Look, old chap, what a rooster I’ve got!

118
00:19:37,741 --> 00:19:43,251
You have a rooster, and I have a hen.
Soup and stew.

119
00:19:47,531 --> 00:19:49,986
- Do you see this? - Yeah!

120
00:19:52,363 --> 00:19:57,835
Hello, girl!
Hello! Stop! Stop!

121
00:19:57,836 --> 00:20:01,101
Hold on, babe!
Hello! Are you scared?

122
00:20:01,102 --> 00:20:06,664
Wait, wait, why hurry?
Oh! She’s impolite.

123
00:21:24,290 --> 00:21:30,542
We arrived in Korea by decision of the United Nations
and by orders of Commander MacArthur.

124
00:21:30,543 --> 00:21:35,614
From now on you will live freely and happily.
We have taken the security of your life.

125
00:21:35,615 --> 00:21:41,339
We brought a lot of products that 
we’ll distribute to your people.

126
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:45,128
In America we love freedom and order.

127
00:21:45,129 --> 00:21:54,609
Now we Americans have come to clean up
here in your land. But you should know ...

128
00:21:54,610 --> 00:22:03,219
We will sweep away anyone who interferes. 

129
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:36,565
We know that many of you enjoyed
living under the communist government.

130
00:22:36,566 --> 00:22:38,853
We know that many of you have always 
been on the communist side.

131
00:22:38,854 --> 00:22:41,035
To these people we will be merciless.

132
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:42,901
Scoundrels!

133
00:22:42,902 --> 00:22:46,846
Everyone of you have read my order
in which I worn you

134
00:22:47,247 --> 00:23:01,159
that everyone who confesses in their guilt
will get land, money and honour.

135
00:23:01,991 --> 00:23:10,422
But we will not have mercy upon those
who will stand against us.

136
00:23:10,423 --> 00:23:41,814
I appeal to you to help us in bringing an order here
just like in our free America.

137
00:23:43,774 --> 00:23:50,375
Americans are murderers! Everything
they write is a lie!

138
00:24:04,558 --> 00:24:11,935
- Neighbour! I’m looking for you!
It’s amazing! - What’s up?

139
00:24:11,936 --> 00:24:18,548
- Americans hung out a declaration. - Yeah.
- And someone wrote on it. - What?

140
00:24:18,549 --> 00:24:24,443
- Americans are murderers! - Of course
they are. They’re deceiving us.

141
00:24:24,444 --> 00:24:28,736
Yes! Their declarations and orders are lies!

142
00:24:28,737 --> 00:24:37,277
It’s all the guerillas. We’ve got to wait
a real thing from them now.

143
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:47,337
- Tell me, neighbour?
- Mm?

144
00:24:47,338 --> 00:24:50,025
Did you hear anything about Kil Yong’s family?

145
00:24:50,026 --> 00:24:54,246
I think I didn’t. Why?

146
00:24:54,247 --> 00:25:01,820
Americans arrested them. We should
get rid of Kang Tae-Sik.

147
00:25:48,224 --> 00:25:52,530
Don’t you want to say where’s your son?

148
00:25:57,244 --> 00:25:59,408
Why don’t you speak?

149
00:26:01,624 --> 00:26:06,837
What can I say? I know nothing.

150
00:26:17,994 --> 00:26:20,057
Well done!

151
00:26:20,719 --> 00:26:22,776
Does she still keep pretending?

152
00:26:26,341 --> 00:26:29,299
So? Don’t you want to speak with us?

153
00:26:46,831 --> 00:26:51,770
You will respond for all the crimes.
The day will come!

154
00:26:51,771 --> 00:27:02,110
Преступления? Это ты, ты растила такого
сына преступника, коммуниста.
Crimes? It’s you who grew such a son -
a criminal, a communist!

155
00:27:10,215 --> 00:27:12,180
Oh! Kil Yong!

156
00:27:19,295 --> 00:27:22,029
Well, so? Do you recognize your son? Uh?

157
00:27:36,473 --> 00:27:40,759
Kil Yong, my dear! What did they do to you?

158
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:46,702
Calm down! I’m not afraid of them.

159
00:27:46,703 --> 00:27:51,264
They can torture me and kill me,
but they won’t know anything.

160
00:27:51,265 --> 00:27:54,877
I’ve completed the task of the party.
No, mother, I’m not afraid to die.

161
00:27:54,878 --> 00:27:58,199
It’s only a pity for me that I won’t
live to see the day

162
00:27:59,929 --> 00:28:19,292
when Korean land will be free
from murderers and traitors.

163
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:26,781
Brother, remember, the Americans and Syngman Rhee
soldiers are the most cruel enemies of our people.

164
00:28:26,782 --> 00:28:31,136
All of them must be killed.

165
00:28:31,137 --> 00:28:34,339
Shut up! Take him away immediately!

166
00:28:36,005 --> 00:28:43,645
Scoundrels! You’re selling your Motherland!
American dogs!

167
00:28:43,646 --> 00:28:46,906
You can not escape from the judgement of our nation.

168
00:28:46,907 --> 00:28:49,627
The time will come and you will answer for
 all your crimes and treason.

169
00:28:49,628 --> 00:28:55,556
Jerk! He threatens you ... remove him!
What are you looking at?

170
00:29:06,768 --> 00:29:13,910
Well, he won’t have to speak anymore.

171
00:29:21,089 --> 00:29:25,023
He said it all. My son is a communist, 
he is not afraid of death.

172
00:29:25,024 --> 00:29:31,839
But you are afraid, you know that he's right, 
and you fear of the truth.

173
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:36,778
Shut up! Otherwise I’ll finish you, too!

174
00:29:36,779 --> 00:29:41,127
You can kill me, but you should know, 
I'm proud that I raised such a son,

175
00:29:41,128 --> 00:29:44,520
brave, courageous and 
devoted to his homeland.

176
00:29:44,521 --> 00:29:48,150
And you have sold yourself to Americans.
You will pay for that!

177
00:29:48,151 --> 00:29:50,494
Do you think that everything can be 
achieved with the force of arms?

178
00:29:54,764 --> 00:30:01,577
But all the people can not shoot.
Homeland will curse your name.

179
00:30:01,578 --> 00:30:08,465
You will be despised and hated
by all the pe...

180
00:30:12,175 --> 00:30:16,737
Mom! Mom! Mom!

181
00:31:26,903 --> 00:31:35,050
I’m standing on the mountain-ridge,
bloodstains everywhere...

182
00:31:35,557 --> 00:31:43,130
They follow every my step,
bloodstains everywhere

183
00:31:43,770 --> 00:31:52,698
Bloodstains on the helmets of those
who went to fight for Korea...

184
00:31:53,422 --> 00:32:01,619
Everyone sees these stains,
red signs of blood.

185
00:32:02,848 --> 00:32:09,905
O how do we love
the name of Changun!

186
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:20,044
Our native name of
Kim Il Sung, Changun!

187
00:36:25,962 --> 00:36:28,645
I saw how they shot my mother.

188
00:36:28,646 --> 00:36:31,549
They tortured our Kil Yong.

189
00:36:33,581 --> 00:36:38,201
He said nothing, he remained faithful 
to the people, even under torture.

190
00:36:38,202 --> 00:36:44,509
They came to our peaceful country and
they kill our fathers, our mothers, our brothers.

191
00:36:44,510 --> 00:36:50,933
Murderers! They bring death to our people.

192
00:36:50,934 --> 00:36:54,751
They destroyed the school that we loved.

193
00:36:54,752 --> 00:37:01,558
I will take revenge, friends, and 
I’ll fight to the last breath.

194
00:37:01,559 --> 00:37:09,947
I will take revenge knowing no rest, for my mother, 
for my brother, for our people. I will take revenge!

195
00:37:09,948 --> 00:37:17,653
You are right. We will fight aggressively, 
and the we have the power.

196
00:37:17,654 --> 00:37:21,312
But, guys, we should fight in an organized way.

197
00:37:21,313 --> 00:37:31,691
The most important is to accurately perform 
all the tasks of the elder guerrillas.

198
00:37:31,692 --> 00:37:35,281
And now let's talk together about 
how we should make our work.

199
00:37:35,282 --> 00:37:40,661
Guys, I suggest to choose 
Chan Yong as our commander.

200
00:37:40,662 --> 00:37:43,602
- That's right!
- That's right!

201
00:37:43,603 --> 00:37:49,610
Alright, guys! The Khan Chan guerilla squad
has started their work!

202
00:37:52,045 --> 00:37:55,564
First, in the squad we should have
the strictest discipline.

203
00:37:55,565 --> 00:38:00,623
Don’t forget that we are surrounded by enemies.

204
00:38:00,624 --> 00:38:04,713
Without the discipline the squad
will perish immediately.

205
00:38:04,714 --> 00:38:10,903
In the school you have seen the movie, called
“The Young Guard” about the soviet children.

206
00:38:10,904 --> 00:38:17,759
They struggled bravely for their Motherland, and
stayed devoted to it until the end, we should follow them.

207
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:22,059
We will keep secret sacredly. That’s the second clause.

208
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:28,067
And the third clause is to help our fellow
guerillas always and everywhere.

209
00:38:31,191 --> 00:38:34,596
It’s our honourable duty.

210
00:38:34,597 --> 00:38:38,907
So vow to fight, selfless hard, maintaining
 a strict discipline,

211
00:38:38,908 --> 00:38:43,331
helping the elders and
sacredly keeping the secret of the squad.

212
00:38:43,332 --> 00:38:52,038
- A squad of young guerrillas! We swear, guys!
- We swear! - We swear!

213
00:38:53,551 --> 00:38:55,801
We swear that we will
be true guerrillas.

214
00:38:55,802 --> 00:38:58,411
And now, planning.

215
00:38:58,412 --> 00:39:07,328
It is necessary to make friends with somebody
in the commandment

216
00:39:08,057 --> 00:39:14,501
to get information from there.

217
00:39:17,028 --> 00:39:19,697
We should gain their confidence.

218
00:39:21,967 --> 00:39:24,163
They should trust us very much.

219
00:39:25,263 --> 00:39:33,037
Organize a group of kids for 
cleaning yards and streets.

220
00:39:33,668 --> 00:39:48,730
I ask to entrust it to me.

221
00:40:10,247 --> 00:40:16,303
Here you are! Have a look, they clean it good. 
You can check it out.

222
00:40:17,156 --> 00:40:18,634
Cleanliness, order! You can not worry.

223
00:40:18,635 --> 00:40:19,968
You should clean several times a day.

224
00:40:19,969 --> 00:40:22,524
Of course! It's easy!

225
00:40:27,063 --> 00:40:32,062
Try to work as it should.
Well, sorry for the dust.

226
00:42:29,859 --> 00:42:34,644
Our valiant people's army retreated temporarily. 
The day is near when it will return.

227
00:42:34,645 --> 00:42:39,336
Curse of the traitors! They will not escape the court!
Not one handful of grain to the enemy!

228
00:43:38,353 --> 00:43:40,695
Such flyers appear in broad daylight!

229
00:43:40,696 --> 00:43:45,847
They write they’re not afraid! Well,
the Americans will get what they deserve soon!

230
00:45:17,058 --> 00:45:21,479
Commandment?

231
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:26,035
Write down. The password for this night - Han Gan.
Answer - Taedong.

232
00:45:26,036 --> 00:45:27,436
I repeat. Han Gan - Taedong.

233
00:45:44,197 --> 00:45:45,098
Stop! Password.

234
00:45:45,099 --> 00:45:49,310
- Han Gan.
- Taedong.

235
00:46:49,658 --> 00:46:55,495
- In the nearby village a bridge was blown up.
- It’s the guerrillas.

236
00:46:56,932 --> 00:46:58,829
They don’t let the Americans sleep well.

237
00:47:00,610 --> 00:47:05,736
It’s definitely the guerillas. We get new proclamations
everyday. It’s not without purpose.

238
00:47:05,737 --> 00:47:14,397
- You'll see, soon it all will end.
- They are afraid as hell even now.

239
00:47:25,451 --> 00:47:27,851
What are you talking about here?

240
00:47:27,852 --> 00:47:29,931
Is that forbidden?

241
00:47:31,789 --> 00:47:34,376
I’m asking you.

242
00:47:34,377 --> 00:47:37,122
Why are you bothering?

243
00:47:37,123 --> 00:47:41,128
You are tired of life, right?

244
00:47:41,129 --> 00:47:44,726
We were not talking about something illegal.

245
00:47:44,727 --> 00:47:48,851
You dare!

246
00:47:54,981 --> 00:47:57,229
You have few time for bullying.

247
00:48:02,011 --> 00:48:03,107
Yes, surely.

248
00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:08,304
It’s the communists, their work.

249
00:48:09,177 --> 00:48:12,991
Are you sleeping? Why can't you catch these communists?

250
00:48:14,110 --> 00:48:18,236
What does your police do?
Answer! You’re the chief!

251
00:48:18,669 --> 00:48:20,956
The police are at the communist side!

252
00:48:20,957 --> 00:48:25,177
Mr. Commandant! I swear ...

253
00:48:25,178 --> 00:48:30,083
I know everything. But now 
I can not believe you.

254
00:48:30,084 --> 00:48:33,536
I can’t trust the police, which is led by the nose!

255
00:48:33,537 --> 00:48:42,560
Telegraph doesn’t work again. Order number 18
hasn’t been transferred.

256
00:48:42,561 --> 00:48:45,356
Look! Who’s destroying the
connection every day?

257
00:48:45,357 --> 00:48:49,095
How to do now? What to do?

258
00:48:53,137 --> 00:49:01,644
You are responsible for the connection.
I’ll check it in 20 minutes. Go.

259
00:49:12,349 --> 00:49:14,924
Does it work?

260
00:49:14,925 --> 00:49:16,963
No, it doesn’t.

261
00:49:16,964 --> 00:49:23,230
I give you five minutes.
It’s the matter of your life.

262
00:49:28,745 --> 00:49:32,492
Yes?

263
00:49:43,125 --> 00:49:46,993
The line is not working yet. No.

264
00:49:57,041 --> 00:50:00,111
Stop being ceremonious.

265
00:50:00,651 --> 00:50:17,604
Liquidate the communists.

266
00:50:17,605 --> 00:50:24,481
Yes! I will take action immediately,
you can be sure.

267
00:50:24,644 --> 00:50:26,214
You will get a reward.

268
00:50:26,237 --> 00:50:27,632
Yes!

269
00:50:40,377 --> 00:50:43,457
They say, you keep connection
with the communists.

270
00:50:43,965 --> 00:50:49,459
Me? No, you’re joking.

271
00:50:50,819 --> 00:50:55,009
They’re dashing about the town.
Why aren’t you catching them?

272
00:50:58,081 --> 00:51:00,230
You said you knew them all.

273
00:51:00,231 --> 00:51:03,000
Yes, I did. And I do my best.

274
00:51:05,608 --> 00:51:14,042
Tell, why everyday the connection falls
and some leaflets appear?

275
00:51:14,043 --> 00:51:18,125
I know what to do, all the relatives
of the communists should be arrested.

276
00:51:18,126 --> 00:51:20,675
Good! That’s a good idea!

277
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:25,233
But if it doesn’t work, that’s your fatal problem.

278
00:51:25,234 --> 00:51:29,555
Good! I’ll try my best, you can trust me.

279
00:51:40,138 --> 00:51:45,315
- Guvnor! Where are you going? To arrest someone again?
- Yes! I’ve had not enough sleep..

280
00:51:45,316 --> 00:51:50,777
- Ah! And what street?
- Ask Kang Tae-Sik!

281
00:51:50,778 --> 00:51:55,837
- Run away everyone!
- Come on! Go!

282
00:51:55,838 --> 00:52:01,133
Leave! Quickly!
Go! Hurry!

283
00:52:01,134 --> 00:52:04,485
Come on! Why are you standing? Pass!

284
00:52:04,486 --> 00:52:11,678
- Murderers. But one can’t kill all the people.
- American rats, scoundrels!

285
00:52:11,679 --> 00:52:15,365
Don’t talk. Pass.

286
00:52:40,143 --> 00:52:46,845
Sit still. Otherwise you’ll be executed.

287
00:53:08,289 --> 00:53:11,346
- Did they torture you?
- Yes, they did.

288
00:53:14,950 --> 00:53:17,380
Silence! Silence! Comrades, please, be quiet!

289
00:53:17,381 --> 00:53:19,808
Did you hear what he said?

290
00:53:20,436 --> 00:53:23,316
Why did they take us?

291
00:53:23,924 --> 00:53:31,230
I don’t know, maybe because
I wasn’t licking his boots.

292
00:53:31,265 --> 00:53:34,906
They have few time,
our day is going to come.

293
00:53:34,941 --> 00:53:40,612
Be quiet. It’s going to come, that’s for sure.

294
00:53:44,486 --> 00:53:48,658
Forty people were shot.

295
00:53:48,879 --> 00:53:53,723
Barbarians!
What do you need in our land?

296
00:53:54,345 --> 00:54:00,836
Why did you come here?
Why did you kill my child?
Look at him!

297
00:54:00,837 --> 00:54:08,408
Let it be your shame forever.

298
00:54:14,450 --> 00:54:17,864
What? What do you want?
Isn’t it enough that I catch them?

299
00:54:17,865 --> 00:54:21,359
Why should I kill them, too?

300
00:54:23,637 --> 00:54:30,126
Nevermind! You’ll cope with that.
Don’t you think its difficult? It’s just “Bang!” - and it’s over.

301
00:54:39,007 --> 00:54:41,596
But you forgot the guerillas.

302
00:54:41,597 --> 00:54:45,677
You just sit to have a drink, and then they
appear out of nowhere - and you’re gone.

303
00:54:48,081 --> 00:54:52,739
I want to live well, to get my
mill and land.

304
00:56:16,326 --> 00:56:21,265
It happens to everyone who betrays
his Motherland and serves the Americans.

305
00:56:30,508 --> 00:56:33,710
- Are they coming?
- Yes, they’ve passed the turning.

306
00:56:34,294 --> 00:56:39,237
- Here they are.
Attention, guys! Get ready!

307
00:58:08,950 --> 00:58:11,815
Hurry up, comrades!
Go to the mountains, comrades...

308
00:58:11,816 --> 00:58:15,157
Hurry up, comrades! There’s no time to lose.
To the mountains!

309
00:58:15,158 --> 00:58:18,411
Run faster! Run faster!
Hurry, hurry, comrades.

310
00:58:18,412 --> 00:58:22,613
Hurry, comrades! To the mountains!
Hurry! Hurry! Run!

311
00:58:22,614 --> 00:58:28,900
Quickly run, hurry, comrades!
To the mountains!

312
00:59:01,749 --> 00:59:06,596
- Teacher!  - I’m glad to see you!
- Me too!

313
00:59:06,597 --> 00:59:11,523
- Are things going fine?  - Yes.
- Let’s go, tell me about it!

314
00:59:17,761 --> 00:59:23,586
Tell the guys that most of the people whom
you set free are in our guerilla squad.

315
00:59:25,075 --> 00:59:27,764
You were right about Kang Tae-Sik.

316
00:59:27,765 --> 00:59:34,320
Go on and on, you should know that
you help us very much.

317
00:59:34,321 --> 00:59:38,814
People of our squad thank you
for very brave action.

318
00:59:38,815 --> 00:59:43,526
The secretary of the Committee said
that he’s proud of such true guerillas as you.

319
00:59:43,527 --> 00:59:46,132
He wants you to connect with Moon Ying Sun -
- the telephone operator.  - Yes!

320
00:59:48,927 --> 00:59:57,700
They have a lot of grenades and machine guns.

321
00:59:59,136 --> 01:00:06,869
Everything the squad gets will be given to the guerillas.

322
01:00:06,981 --> 01:00:09,910
Good!

323
01:00:10,179 --> 01:00:16,839
It will be useful.

324
01:00:18,893 --> 01:00:22,639
But be careful. - Yes!

325
01:00:22,639 --> 01:00:23,639
It’s very dangerous.

326
01:00:23,640 --> 01:00:27,918
The guys shouldn’t get caught.

327
01:00:28,320 --> 01:00:34,221
Yes! I will check it myself.

328
01:00:34,640 --> 01:00:35,904
Good.

329
01:00:37,213 --> 01:00:43,889
Inform the people about the message
from the headquarters. 

330
01:00:44,321 --> 01:00:45,626
I will do that immediately!

331
01:00:47,120 --> 01:00:58,440
Listen! People’s Army have completely
destroyed six divisions of the enemy.

332
01:00:58,936 --> 01:01:06,316
Yes! The guys will be happy!
It means that the army is already close.

333
01:01:16,161 --> 01:01:19,496
Guvnor!

334
01:01:20,903 --> 01:01:22,636
Do you have a son?

335
01:01:24,506 --> 01:01:25,859
Shut up. I have no son.

336
01:01:25,860 --> 01:01:27,647
And do you have a mother?

337
01:01:27,648 --> 01:01:32,814
I have no one. Don’t bother me.
I want to have some sleep.

338
01:03:03,180 --> 01:03:09,050
Comrades, in the enemy’s rear our
guerilla squads

339
01:03:09,682 --> 01:03:18,019
have achieved serious success.

340
01:03:18,862 --> 01:03:34,061
Brave and fast actions of the guerillas
support our army greatly.

341
01:03:34,603 --> 01:03:47,294
Young guerilla squad of Hangu
helped us very much in these actions.

342
01:03:48,069 --> 01:03:56,693
Recently they’ve recaptured the arrestants
who were conducted to the execution.

343
01:03:57,334 --> 01:04:27,646
There are many our people in town’s prison,
we should save them at any price.

344
01:04:28,049 --> 01:04:47,377
Comrades! Guerillas! The military-political situation
has changed in our favour.

345
01:04:47,770 --> 01:04:56,196
We have already assumed the offensive. Don’t let the enemy
have any rest. Beat them and get them away from our land.

346
01:04:58,481 --> 01:04:59,487
Is it heavy?

347
01:04:59,488 --> 01:05:02,756
Nevermind! And to you?

348
01:05:02,757 --> 01:05:06,458
I wanted to carry twice more.

349
01:05:06,459 --> 01:05:12,180
Do you know how our guerillas will get happy
when we bring them this armour? And if Sin Khan will cope with his mission...

350
01:05:13,072 --> 01:05:16,720
I’m sure that he will definitely complete
his task and get the armour.

351
01:05:16,721 --> 01:05:18,790
Of course! He’s a brave guy!

352
01:05:20,105 --> 01:05:29,901
We will bring it and get back. And tomorrow we will
take some more and bring it again.

353
01:05:29,902 --> 01:05:34,356
Yes, we won’t even sleep!

354
01:09:14,036 --> 01:09:15,685
We should save him...

355
01:09:22,999 --> 01:09:26,775
We can’t help...

356
01:09:32,465 --> 01:09:36,213
Whatever happens, I’ll go there.

357
01:09:36,680 --> 01:09:38,847
But you won’t save him! You can’t!

358
01:09:41,840 --> 01:09:43,600
They are coming! Let’s go!

359
01:10:22,648 --> 01:10:24,104
Well, did he confess?

360
01:10:24,635 --> 01:10:28,560
No, he’s silent! He makes no sound!

361
01:10:30,863 --> 01:10:33,369
Did you cope with the boy?

362
01:10:33,370 --> 01:10:36,661
I couldn’t cope. We did everything we could.

363
01:10:38,240 --> 01:10:43,716
You can’t get anything with torture and
threat. There must be something different.

364
01:11:54,456 --> 01:11:59,165
You don’t want to speak?
Maybe you’ll tell me?

365
01:11:59,166 --> 01:12:08,258
Who teached you?
Well, don’t worry!

366
01:12:11,230 --> 01:12:19,106
Think again and tell me everything.
Don’t be stubborn.

367
01:12:19,107 --> 01:12:24,821
We know that you completed someone’s orders.

368
01:12:28,284 --> 01:12:35,739
I will order to free you now. I know, you’re
a honest boy, you will confess...

369
01:12:50,260 --> 01:12:58,110
Alright, stop pretending.
I know where I am.

370
01:13:00,220 --> 01:13:06,643
I’m a young pioneer of the Republic,
and you won’t get anything from me.

371
01:13:06,644 --> 01:13:11,159
Here you are! Well, you will feel sorry for that!
I think you’ve got not enough torture!

372
01:13:32,308 --> 01:13:34,276
So, how’s the boy?

373
01:13:34,277 --> 01:13:37,489
No result yet, but I hope...

374
01:13:37,490 --> 01:13:38,572
What does it mean you hope?

375
01:13:40,901 --> 01:13:44,132
They have agreed not to speak.
Even in case of torture.

376
01:13:44,808 --> 01:13:47,093
Ha! It seems you already like them!

377
01:13:47,094 --> 01:13:53,088
Why, captain? I’ve seen many
such lads.

378
01:13:53,089 --> 01:13:59,488
They’re not afraid of anything. They’re all the same.
They should be shot immediately.

379
01:14:12,487 --> 01:14:17,695
We should make him confess
where his accomplices are.

380
01:14:19,329 --> 01:14:22,203
You’ll have plenty of time to get him shot.

381
01:14:28,285 --> 01:14:32,036
Get him here.

382
01:15:06,017 --> 01:15:22,812
We, americans, like young people. Oh!
Sit down, please! Your leg hurts, doesn’t it?

383
01:15:31,623 --> 01:15:34,469
Do you want to be friends with me?

384
01:15:38,056 --> 01:15:46,945
Oh! I know you’ve been deceived.
Leave, if you want to.

385
01:15:46,946 --> 01:15:55,200
I let you go, but you must tell the truth. Who 
taught you? Do you understand me, boy?

386
01:16:01,694 --> 01:16:03,631
You must answer, when someone asks you a question.

387
01:16:07,825 --> 01:16:15,942
Yes, I took armour to beat
the enemy.

388
01:16:18,451 --> 01:16:21,506
Who’s your enemy, boy?

389
01:16:21,507 --> 01:16:24,291
Americans! You are the first one!

390
01:16:24,292 --> 01:16:26,261
Who told you so?

391
01:16:26,262 --> 01:16:33,098
Tortures and suffer, blood of our fathers
and mothers who were executed here.

392
01:16:33,705 --> 01:16:36,498
Did you act by yourself, boy?

393
01:16:36,499 --> 01:16:39,774
Yes! But I have friends!

394
01:16:43,275 --> 01:16:45,156
Who are your friends?

395
01:16:45,157 --> 01:16:54,264
All our people, we hate the occupants
and we will make them leave soon!

396
01:16:54,265 --> 01:16:56,186
How dare you!

397
01:17:02,186 --> 01:17:10,725
Leave! Hands of Korea! All! What do you need here?
Our people despise you!

398
01:17:10,726 --> 01:17:12,382
Be silent!

399
01:17:15,984 --> 01:17:20,164
We won’t get anything from this lad.

400
01:17:20,165 --> 01:17:25,326
You can do whatever you want,
don’t be ceremonious!

401
01:17:28,840 --> 01:17:31,496
Yes! Americans are asassins!

402
01:17:31,497 --> 01:17:36,814
Our people know that you’re not ceremonious,
but you’ll have to answer for that!

403
01:17:36,815 --> 01:17:41,454
Until all of you get out of here, you should
know, we’ll never get calm.

404
01:17:41,455 --> 01:17:49,956
I may die, but my people will take revenge for me.
You won’t leave alive!

405
01:18:25,436 --> 01:18:27,470
We didn’t rescue him.

406
01:18:31,132 --> 01:18:40,206
Don’t cry! There was no other way. We had no ability
to save him. What could we do? 

407
01:18:40,207 --> 01:18:42,694
We should take revenge for him...

408
01:19:00,540 --> 01:19:08,339
- A misfortune happened! - What’s up?
- Our comrade Sin Khan... - What?
- Was executed... - Ah!

409
01:19:26,067 --> 01:19:32,566
Sin Khan died as a true hero.
Killed by these assassins...

410
01:19:33,767 --> 01:19:49,851
He won’t see our victory, but
it’s no use to be cast down, friends!

411
01:19:51,357 --> 01:19:55,971
We will struggle with more strength and courage! 

412
01:20:03,427 --> 01:20:08,015
Yes! Listen, here’s the message from our teacher...

413
01:20:08,925 --> 01:20:16,341
Our troops and chinese volunteers
pushed the enemy past the Chhunihonchan river.

414
01:20:16,376 --> 01:20:20,921
Our troops are not far.

415
01:20:25,747 --> 01:20:28,640
In 100 kilometers.

416
01:20:29,653 --> 01:20:31,944
Now, guys, there will be more work.

417
01:20:34,022 --> 01:20:44,990
Guerilla troops are already moving towards.

418
01:20:45,602 --> 01:20:59,786
Our squad should get ready, too.

419
01:21:00,318 --> 01:21:04,640
Well, friends, we have few time to wait!

420
01:21:43,026 --> 01:21:45,945
- Wait! What are you doing?
- What do you mean?

421
01:21:45,946 --> 01:21:49,604
I’m beating your ace of spades with a trump card.
I have no spades.

422
01:21:49,605 --> 01:21:55,165
You are cheating! Isn’t that a spade?

423
01:21:55,166 --> 01:21:59,744
I won’t play with you! Why are you
looking in my cards?

424
01:21:59,745 --> 01:22:05,010
- Start another round now.
- How come? Game is over.

425
01:22:05,011 --> 01:22:12,125
No. How did you change my card the last time?
Start all over again.

426
01:22:29,419 --> 01:22:33,959
You are sleeping! While you are sleeping,
the commies are acting! The connection is broken!

427
01:22:33,960 --> 01:22:36,906
Yes! They broke our devices.

428
01:22:36,907 --> 01:22:42,218
How long will it go on?

429
01:22:44,531 --> 01:22:48,144
- Repair immediately!
- Yes, but how...

430
01:22:48,145 --> 01:22:53,405
Shut up! Carry out your orders!

431
01:22:53,406 --> 01:22:55,267
Yes! Sir commandant! 

432
01:23:10,775 --> 01:23:13,839
You are doing it so slowly!
Why can’t you do it faster?

433
01:23:13,840 --> 01:23:18,562
- We’re trying our best, captain.
- If you don’t want to work, you will fight.

434
01:23:18,563 --> 01:23:23,587
- We can’t do it faster.
- I’m not talking to you. It should be done in an hour.

435
01:23:23,588 --> 01:23:28,948
- Look what they’ve done!
- Don’t make any objections, idlers!

436
01:23:32,748 --> 01:23:41,596
The People’s army and Chinese volunteers are pressing
and destroying the troops of American invaders.

437
01:23:41,597 --> 01:23:45,663
Beat the retreating enemy to the end!

438
01:23:51,489 --> 01:23:58,520
- I have no more leaflets.
- Neither do I.
- We should wait for a sign.

439
01:24:00,082 --> 01:24:04,666
Break it up! I'll shoot!

440
01:24:06,454 --> 01:24:12,324
The People's Army is coming! 
Your slavery will end soon!

441
01:24:17,781 --> 01:24:25,880
- Our troops are not far!
- Yes, they should come in time to save the people.

442
01:25:19,847 --> 01:25:26,349
I’m from the headquarters. Today you should leave the town
before ten o’clock.

443
01:25:26,350 --> 01:25:32,884
Our army is threatened with encirclement by
the troops of the People’s army, Chinese volunteers and guerillas.

444
01:25:34,506 --> 01:25:38,077
Retreat!
You’re nuts!

445
01:25:38,078 --> 01:25:43,340
- Our army is encircled from three sides,
sir commandant. - Oh dear!

446
01:25:43,341 --> 01:25:55,056
- Only the south is free, hurry up!
- You could inform us earlier. - No!

447
01:25:57,939 --> 01:26:06,564
- Captain! - Yes!
- Did you hear? Give an order
for immediate retreat. - Yes!

448
01:26:07,274 --> 01:26:11,036
- Yes, just like this. - Yes!

449
01:26:11,037 --> 01:26:16,577
We have no time to lose. All the arrestants
should be executed immediately.

450
01:27:54,819 --> 01:27:57,577
Sir commander, the intelligence discovered that 
the town garrison is retreating.

451
01:27:57,578 --> 01:27:59,904
… the guerillas have cut down all the ways for a retreat.

452
01:27:59,905 --> 01:28:02,459
…there’s only the punitive squad that has the order

453
01:28:02,460 --> 01:28:08,818
to execute all the people in prison. There are
many children, women and old men.

454
01:28:09,230 --> 01:28:14,768
Well! Comrades chiefs of squads!
Attention! Listen to my command!

455
01:28:14,769 --> 01:28:27,500
- The first section comes in from north-east,
the second section from the north. The attack is by the sign.
- Yes!

456
01:28:27,501 --> 01:28:33,241
- The third section joins the guerilla squad and cut down
the ways for retreat and not let them go to the mountains. - Yes!

457
01:28:34,346 --> 01:28:38,608
- The fourth section follows me to the town. - Yes!

458
01:28:40,815 --> 01:28:48,448
Hey, you!  Get up!
Come out! We’re setting you free!

459
01:28:52,850 --> 01:29:02,082
Get out fast! Why are you messing around?

460
01:30:56,836 --> 01:31:06,515
Comrades! Comrades! Comrades!

461
01:31:06,516 --> 01:31:12,728
- Grandfather, do you recognize me?
- Erm. Is this you, darling?

462
01:31:12,729 --> 01:31:15,359
- Hello, my friend!

463
01:31:21,551 --> 01:31:25,022
- Comrade commander!
- Well! I said we’ll be back.

464
01:31:26,386 --> 01:31:30,058
- Hello, grandfather!
- Thank you so much for saving us!

465
01:31:30,842 --> 01:31:40,722
- You got here in time! They were planning to execute
all of us! - Yes, we know.

466
01:31:40,723 --> 01:31:49,315
Comrades! All the tortures and suffering, that
you have to live though during the American occupation, are over.

467
01:31:50,960 --> 01:31:58,039
You were set free by glorious fighters of
the People’s army and local guerilla squads from your town.

468
01:31:58,040 --> 01:32:01,485
Hooray! Hooray!

469
01:32:02,832 --> 01:32:07,315
Comrades! Korean People’s Army in cooperation with

470
01:32:07,316 --> 01:32:12,996
squads of Chinese volunteers surrounds the
enemy and destroys it.

471
01:32:12,997 --> 01:32:18,666
In some sectors of the front our army have already
assumed the offensive.

472
01:32:18,667 --> 01:32:21,909
Ура! Ура-а!
Hooray! Hooray!

473
01:32:21,910 --> 01:32:31,357
Comrades! Soon we’ll free all our land from the
American invaders! Forward to our victory!

474
01:32:31,358 --> 01:32:35,083
Hooray! Hooray! Hooray!

475
01:32:38,459 --> 01:32:43,205
- It’s the chief of the police!
- Got him! - Kill him, kill him!

476
01:32:43,206 --> 01:32:49,629
- Death! - Beat him!
- Kill!

477
01:32:49,630 --> 01:32:52,730
- Wait! We should settle it another way!
- Let me.

478
01:34:01,251 --> 01:34:08,688
- Well, now we will get the enemy off our land.
Will we meet? - Of course!

479
01:34:13,767 --> 01:34:15,907
- Mother! Faster, faster!

480
01:34:23,755 --> 01:34:26,278
Thank you!

481
01:34:28,350 --> 01:34:30,212
Goodbye, my friends!

482
01:34:40,642 --> 01:34:44,839
Stand! Dress! Attention!
To the left!

483
01:34:48,768 --> 01:34:50,660
Forward, march!

484
01:35:08,619 --> 01:35:14,775
Our secretary wants to see you.
He’s waiting. Let’s go!

485
01:35:20,623 --> 01:35:26,879
The county committee of our Labor Party
is grateful for the dedicated work
to the glorious squad of the young guerillas.

486
01:35:26,880 --> 01:35:40,351
Bold heroic struggle of your squad encourages
Korean youth. It will struggle with our enemies with more strength.

487
01:35:40,782 --> 01:35:47,304
It is painful to realize that Sin Khan is not with us today.
He is killed by these butchers.

488
01:35:47,305 --> 01:35:57,851
But his name will never be forgotten by our people,
and we will take revenge for him.

489
01:36:02,112 --> 01:36:10,433
Friends! Today we are assuming the attack, and
we won’t stop until enemy troops leave our land.

490
01:36:11,358 --> 01:36:28,405
You were good at war, but now you have to study more
and more. Exactly as it is demanded by our people and
our leader Kim Il Sung.

491
01:36:33,686 --> 01:36:43,485
Our squad is indebted to you, sir secretary,
the party committee and our teacher, who led us.

492
01:36:43,486 --> 01:36:54,497
Our squad has fought with the enemy in the name
of the Motherland. All the children of Korea want peace
and stand for peace in our land.

493
01:37:16,030 --> 01:37:18,989
The End.
