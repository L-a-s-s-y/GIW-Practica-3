THE GIRL
ON THE BROOMSTICK

3
00:00:33,367 --> 00:00:37,871
Saxana,
have more than one magic trick.

4
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:42,668
Saxana,
who is about to faint,

5
00:00:42,834 --> 00:00:47,089
Saxana,
should go without complaint.

6
00:00:51,093 --> 00:00:55,180
All those strange words will tell
how to catch a man most swell,

7
00:00:55,347 --> 00:00:59,810
be it a fighter in a ring
or a king.

8
00:01:00,435 --> 00:01:02,604
Take an owl eye so dear
and two widow tears

9
00:01:02,771 --> 00:01:09,194
boil and feed a dog who's near,
howling alone by a swing.

10
00:01:09,611 --> 00:01:14,157
Saxana,
books bound in leather slick,

11
00:01:14,324 --> 00:01:18,829
Saxana,
have more than one magic trick.

12
00:01:18,996 --> 00:01:23,584
Saxana,
who is about to faint,

13
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:28,714
Saxana,
should go without complaint.

14
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:36,054
Take a minute, find a message in it,
rhymes' power is infinite,

15
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:41,143
gone is the snow,
last year's snow.

16
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:45,606
It is all there, I say, how to turn
night into day, get yes from nay

17
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:50,527
and turn bad nights
into jolly bites.

18
00:01:50,694 --> 00:01:55,282
Saxana,
books bound in leather slick,

19
00:01:55,449 --> 00:02:00,037
Saxana,
have more than one magic trick.

20
00:02:00,203 --> 00:02:04,666
Saxana,
those rose petals, their smell,

21
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:09,880
Saxana,
do the magic better than a spell.

22
00:02:13,258 --> 00:02:17,804
Saxana,
books bound in leather slick,

23
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:22,726
Saxana,
have more than one magic trick.

24
00:02:22,893 --> 00:02:27,314
Saxana,
those rose petals, their smell,

25
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:32,944
Saxana,
do the magic better than a spell.

26
00:03:06,645 --> 00:03:10,107
Hurry,
the bell will be ringing!

27
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:28,458
The term ends soon.
Let's test your knowledge!

28
00:03:53,024 --> 00:03:56,153
What's going on back there?

29
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:03,744
-You're passing notes!
-Yes, ma'am.

30
00:04:07,706 --> 00:04:10,542
Stand up, Saxana!

31
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:18,592
I see!
The transformation of

32
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:22,763
an animate being into
an inanimate and vice versa.

33
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:27,517
You're trying to cheat?
Go up to the blackboard!

34
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:42,574
You will now show us
a transformation into a raven!

35
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:51,833
No prompting!
Do you know or don't you?

36
00:04:53,502 --> 00:04:57,589
Dexempo... vederex!

37
00:05:03,053 --> 00:05:05,222
Rebeke plex!

38
00:05:11,645 --> 00:05:16,066
-But...
-There now, just as I thought!

39
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:20,654
She doesn't even know
what a raven looks like.

40
00:05:22,864 --> 00:05:27,035
-Did you ring the bell, Miss?
-Bring me a raven from the office.

41
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:30,247
Please... I do know.

42
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:35,919
Well?

43
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:40,090
Dexempo... krumplex!

44
00:05:50,392 --> 00:05:55,897
Excuse me, Miss, we always used
to do cows in the outdoor class.

45
00:05:56,147 --> 00:06:01,278
This is what it happens
when students don't study.

46
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:06,408
You failed again!

47
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:11,788
My notebook!

48
00:06:11,955 --> 00:06:15,750
-Saxana, Saxana...
-She took advantage of the situation.

49
00:06:16,585 --> 00:06:19,254
Little basilisks or werewolves

50
00:06:19,421 --> 00:06:22,549
would be happy
to be allowed to study.

51
00:06:22,841 --> 00:06:26,303
-And you don't appreciate it?
-No.

52
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:33,935
No? But my dear child,
a witch has a very responsible job.

53
00:06:34,102 --> 00:06:38,565
She calls up hailstorms, casts evil
spells on cattle, serious matters.

54
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:42,527
She doesn't know the difference
between a cow and raven.

55
00:06:42,694 --> 00:06:47,407
There now. What happens when
more important problems come?

56
00:06:47,616 --> 00:06:51,036
Fattening up children,
placing them onto shovels,

57
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:53,747
roasting them, and so on...

58
00:06:53,997 --> 00:06:57,042
Schooling is indispensable
in this field!

59
00:06:57,292 --> 00:07:00,295
-It isn't any fun.
-Is that so”?

60
00:07:02,005 --> 00:07:05,383
-And who is your father?
-A bat.

61
00:07:06,176 --> 00:07:10,180
Ask him to fly to school
tomorrow morning.

62
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:14,351
-Well, he sleeps in the mornings.
-That's right.

63
00:07:15,352 --> 00:07:18,730
Well, ask somebody
to take a message home,

64
00:07:18,897 --> 00:07:23,693
that you'll be in detention
for three hundred years.

65
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:40,669
Dammit! Nothing but sulphur!
All those magic tricks!

66
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:45,799
-At least you're not bored stiff.
-My dear, three hundred years...

67
00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:52,764
-With people, some nine generations.
-Did you ever stay amongst people?

68
00:07:53,098 --> 00:07:58,353
Yeah, but that's a long time ago.
I drank a certain farmer's blood.

69
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:03,400
Now.
Okay then.

70
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:09,823
-What's it like out there?
-Out there?

71
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:14,536
The people all seem to be nuts.

72
00:08:15,245 --> 00:08:18,623
-Nuts?
-Yeah, really nuts.

73
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:21,501
For example:
Somebody steals something,

74
00:08:21,668 --> 00:08:26,631
and instead of becoming invisible
or changing into a carrot

75
00:08:26,798 --> 00:08:30,301
he stays as he is
and they catch him.

76
00:08:30,468 --> 00:08:32,512
The fool!

77
00:08:34,097 --> 00:08:35,765
But why?

78
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:40,186
They don't know how.
They're behind the times!

79
00:08:44,441 --> 00:08:48,445
Don't they study
how to do magic tricks?

80
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:55,577
How did you get there?

81
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:59,581
Well, there's a trick
in one of these books.

82
00:08:59,748 --> 00:09:05,170
Why do you ask? You'll learn
that in your 83rd grade!

83
00:09:05,712 --> 00:09:09,632
Isn't this a waste of time? I could
get some work done in advance!

84
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:14,971
That's the way!
I think that this is the one.

85
00:09:16,014 --> 00:09:18,933
The World of the Humans...

86
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:23,188
Yes, here it is.

87
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:26,649
We enter the World of the Humans
in five ways:

88
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:30,361
As a mouse, a frog,
a sheep, a crow or an owl.

89
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:34,240
These transformations allow for
a stay in the human world

90
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:38,953
of 44 hours.
Here, read it yourself.

91
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:45,126
Transformation into an owl:

92
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:49,214
Cross your arms at eye-level

93
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:53,468
and utter the spell:

94
00:09:53,802 --> 00:09:57,138
-Detereme...
-Don't say it out aloud!

95
00:09:57,305 --> 00:10:01,351
-...xydravoplax vebete...
-] said stop it!

96
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:03,228
...mexabo plex.

97
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:10,527
Oh, my!

98
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:16,199
A pretty kettle of fish!

99
00:10:16,491 --> 00:10:19,619
She must have done it
on purpose, sir!

100
00:10:20,245 --> 00:10:24,582
-Do you know what could happen?
-Such a silly fool. -Well.

101
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:29,546
But she'll be back
in 44 hours, right?

102
00:10:30,255 --> 00:10:34,175
What if she drank some
old hag's ear brew...

103
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:38,721
-Then she'd never come back.
-There, I forgot that.

104
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:43,268
You follow her and keep an eye
on her! And if she gets into trouble

105
00:10:43,685 --> 00:10:46,688
then you'd better
not come back either.

106
00:10:49,858 --> 00:10:52,026
How did she leave?

107
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:55,989
-As a sheep or as a frog?
-As an owl.

108
00:11:01,411 --> 00:11:04,664
Sir! Sir!

109
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:11,921
What shall we do with this owl?
It's just flown in. No papers.

110
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:14,549
-It's all wide-eyed.
-It's a young'un.

111
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:17,927
-Want to give it to Honza?
-Perfect timing.

112
00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:22,682
It's his birthday tomorrow.
Just look at those eyes!

113
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:37,071
-Hi, Dad. What's that?
-Open it!

114
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:40,867
-What is it?
-You'll see. I'll go get a cage.

115
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:44,454
We've got enough of a Zoo
at home already...

116
00:11:44,621 --> 00:11:47,665
Wait and see what it is!

117
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:51,294
Jeez-strike-a-light-hallelujah!

118
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:09,229
What do you think? Bring her
here, we'll put her in a cage!

119
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:12,232
A cage? No!

120
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:14,817
Hurry up!

121
00:12:18,655 --> 00:12:20,907
Dexempo vederex.

122
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:30,583
Was there a chicken in it too?

123
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:33,753
What are you staring at?
Where's the owl!?

124
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,714
-Lost your tongue?
-No.

125
00:12:39,634 --> 00:12:42,679
-There was no owl in there?
-No.

126
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:48,142
-Bauer sure messed this up.
-Jindrich, a chicken's in here.

127
00:12:48,393 --> 00:12:51,437
I know. I'm coming.

128
00:12:57,485 --> 00:13:00,947
What are we going to do
with it, Jindrich?

129
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:04,701
-I'll make a chicken stew tomorrow.
-No!

130
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:12,417
-You're not killing that chicken!
-Why not? We're no vegetarians.

131
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:15,837
You're an overzealous
animal lover...

132
00:13:16,004 --> 00:13:18,548
What if it isn't a chicken?

133
00:13:19,382 --> 00:13:23,303
What is it, then? A woodpecker?

134
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:29,726
Dad, I think it's... some girl.

135
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:33,563
Honza!

136
00:13:35,356 --> 00:13:38,026
My dear boy!

137
00:13:41,112 --> 00:13:45,825
-This is terrible.
-He's talking to that bird.

138
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:53,124
I refused to be in detention for
300 years and decided to run away.

139
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:57,420
But you said you have
to be back in 44 hours.

140
00:13:57,587 --> 00:14:02,175
In 38 hours now!
I've wasted six as an owl.

141
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:05,845
-What will you do then?
-I don't care.

142
00:14:06,012 --> 00:14:08,681
<i>-Something'| happen.
-Quiet!</i>

143
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:12,518
-Or we get jammed up!
-Jammed up?

144
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:19,400
That's better.

145
00:14:20,735 --> 00:14:23,905
-What is it?
-A radio.

146
00:14:24,072 --> 00:14:27,075
You've never seen one.

147
00:14:30,453 --> 00:14:33,414
The things you have here.

148
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:38,002
-Honza dear, some tea for you.
-Just a minute, Mom!

149
00:14:40,463 --> 00:14:44,717
Dexempo... dexempo...

150
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:50,014
-Come on, be a chicken!
-Dexempo... krumplex.

151
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:56,479
May I come in, Honza?
Take an aspirin.

152
00:14:56,646 --> 00:14:59,065
I'm letting nobody in!

153
00:14:59,857 --> 00:15:03,903
You're afraid
we'll take the chicken away?

154
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:10,118
-The way he's panting!
-Panting?

155
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:14,997
-That means he's furious.
-That's right.

156
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:22,004
One does pant when he's furious.
I'll see a psychiatrist tomorrow.

157
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:25,967
-Could I borrow some vinegar?
-Yes, of course.

158
00:15:26,134 --> 00:15:30,513
-Thank you. -How's Napoleon doing?
-My husband is restoring him.

159
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:34,058
-Has Honza told you he failed math?
-Again?

160
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:37,603
-What's on that boy's mind?
-Birds!

161
00:15:38,146 --> 00:15:42,984
You can't stay this way!
You can't even get through a door!

162
00:15:43,151 --> 00:15:45,403
And who will feed you?

163
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:49,407
Can't you change into
something more sensible?

164
00:15:49,574 --> 00:15:52,452
Remember that spell, dammit!

165
00:16:00,168 --> 00:16:02,086
Shhh!

166
00:16:03,337 --> 00:16:08,176
A classroom's no place for poultry.
Classrooms are for students.

167
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:13,181
-You'd better change into a student!
-What? -Nothing!

168
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:20,313
-Who's got a chicken in here?
-Do something, dammit!

169
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,274
-What did you say?
-Get off my back!

170
00:16:23,441 --> 00:16:26,027
What about Blaha?

171
00:16:38,164 --> 00:16:41,292
-Are you a new student?
-Yes.

172
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:46,130
-What is your name?
-Saxana.

173
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:48,925
And your last name?

174
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:53,596
You don't have one?

175
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:58,226
-Who is your father?
-A bat.

176
00:17:01,229 --> 00:17:05,399
- I won't have such talk!
-Her name's Kudlackova.

177
00:17:05,566 --> 00:17:07,610
She's from Pilsen.

178
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:10,988
I'll have to put your name
in the register.

179
00:17:11,322 --> 00:17:15,076
Interesting schools
you must have in Pilsen.

180
00:17:15,576 --> 00:17:19,455
-Where's the bird?
- haven't got one.

181
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:26,087
I'll give a little test.

182
00:17:32,093 --> 00:17:35,721
You scared me!
What a stink!

183
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:40,268
I'm sorry. I'm looking for
a girl named Saxana.

184
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:42,103
Don't know her.

185
00:17:42,395 --> 00:17:46,274
She may be an owl
or a chicken just now.

186
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:49,819
I heard a chicken in class 9.

187
00:17:50,111 --> 00:17:54,824
Would you be so kind?
I need to talk to her urgently.

188
00:18:00,454 --> 00:18:03,082
Somebody named
Saxana has a visitor.

189
00:18:03,249 --> 00:18:05,876
She's either
a girl or a chicken.

190
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:16,220
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

191
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:20,266
Look at the mess you've got me into!

192
00:18:20,433 --> 00:18:24,895
They sent me to keep an eye on you.
So no nonsense, you hear me?

193
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:30,901
Just remember never
to drink any old hag's ear brew.

194
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:34,905
Or you'll never return.
Now whisk off!

195
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:44,582
What I like here, my dear colleague,
is your advanced technique.

196
00:18:44,749 --> 00:18:49,295
-We do everything by hand at home.
-And where is that?

197
00:18:51,714 --> 00:18:54,050
That's confidential.

198
00:18:55,468 --> 00:19:02,266
-The insectivore include the mole...
-Could you get a hag's ear for me?

199
00:19:02,433 --> 00:19:05,561
-What?
-A hag's ear.

200
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:10,024
Are you insane?
You can't buy that.

201
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:16,197
You must get it for me.
If l get it I can stay here, see?

202
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:18,741
That's enough!

203
00:19:18,908 --> 00:19:22,953
Saxana, take your things
and come sit here!

204
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:30,795
-You don't have any schoolbooks?
-All her things are still in Pilsen.

205
00:19:30,961 --> 00:19:35,341
Don't keep answering for her!
She isn't dumb, is she? Sit down!

206
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:38,177
Hey!

207
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:42,723
Watch your behavior, Rousek!
You wait till the principal comes.

208
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:46,060
That Napoleon will cost you dear.

209
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:50,648
Stop making faces
and come to the blackboard.

210
00:19:52,483 --> 00:19:55,361
Name the rodents you know.

211
00:19:57,863 --> 00:20:03,786
The forest rodent, the water
rodent, called the tortoise...

212
00:20:03,953 --> 00:20:06,372
Stop and sit down!

213
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:11,127
Your fourth "F".

214
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:15,756
I see you're confused.
Let's write it down.

215
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:18,718
-Rodents also include:
-The old hag!

216
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:23,180
-The domestic rabbit...
-She's a hag? -Yeah.

217
00:20:25,391 --> 00:20:30,438
-Could you get me her ear?
-What? -Her ear.

218
00:20:30,688 --> 00:20:32,565
The hare...

219
00:20:32,732 --> 00:20:35,651
If you get it for me
I'll do anything for you.

220
00:20:35,818 --> 00:20:37,695
The muskrat...

221
00:20:37,862 --> 00:20:40,906
Yeah?
Swipe that notebook then!

222
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:44,618
Okay.

223
00:20:45,286 --> 00:20:47,621
The mouse...

224
00:20:48,748 --> 00:20:50,791
the rat...

225
00:20:53,169 --> 00:20:55,337
the squirrel...

226
00:20:57,590 --> 00:21:00,342
the ground-squirrel...

227
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:03,929
the marmot...

228
00:21:05,556 --> 00:21:07,933
and the beaver.

229
00:21:08,309 --> 00:21:13,355
Characteristics. Rodents
have teeth that are typical

230
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:18,194
-for the whole order.
-This is impossible.

231
00:21:19,069 --> 00:21:22,031
Why should it be impossible?

232
00:21:22,656 --> 00:21:26,327
This is what rodent's teeth
look like:

233
00:21:28,788 --> 00:21:32,750
The incisors... I have
all kinds of things in the lab,

234
00:21:32,917 --> 00:21:36,587
but not an example
of rodent's teeth. Too bad...

235
00:21:36,754 --> 00:21:39,381
-Rebeke mex.
-But...

236
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:44,970
-Do you see those teeth?
-Nice chiclets!

237
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:01,987
Comet in.

238
00:22:05,491 --> 00:22:07,451
Sit!

239
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:12,832
-What happened to you?
-We were doing rodents and...

240
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:17,294
Ah, a teaching aid! Good!
Excuse me?

241
00:22:19,922 --> 00:22:23,634
Rousek, Bujnoch, Adamek!

242
00:22:26,971 --> 00:22:30,140
You three will come
to the teachers' room at two!

243
00:22:30,307 --> 00:22:33,269
We shall talk about
the disgraceful damage done

244
00:22:33,435 --> 00:22:38,816
to the bust of Emperor Napoleon
who once spent a night in our town.

245
00:22:38,983 --> 00:22:43,237
You will be punished and
your parents will be notified.

246
00:22:43,404 --> 00:22:45,406
Sit down!

247
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:49,660
Our parents... Oh man...

248
00:22:57,293 --> 00:22:58,878
Saxana!

249
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:02,214
I'm busy. They promised
to get the ear for me!

250
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:05,259
You said it can't be done
and they say it can!

251
00:23:05,426 --> 00:23:10,639
-Come on! We're in a hurry!
-I'll come when I have the ear.

252
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:31,076
Come here, Mickey!

253
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:35,247
-I've heard some stuff. Is it true?
-It's all bull!

254
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:38,751
Someone dressed up to look like us.

255
00:23:38,918 --> 00:23:42,338
We didn't go near that statues
yesterday, did we?

256
00:23:42,504 --> 00:23:45,883
I'll find out the truth, my boy.

257
00:23:46,216 --> 00:23:52,514
In any case: You stay in today
and do your schoolwork!

258
00:23:53,724 --> 00:23:57,269
-Who's that girl?
-Kudlackova.

259
00:23:57,436 --> 00:24:00,356
-Kudlackova...
-We're tutoring her.

260
00:24:01,732 --> 00:24:03,067
In what...

261
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:09,865
No, no, no, it won't come back now,
we're rich and how...

262
00:24:10,032 --> 00:24:13,327
Stop it!
We're not in the mood.

263
00:24:13,494 --> 00:24:15,621
How come it plays?

264
00:24:15,788 --> 00:24:19,917
The teachers' meeting is soon
and we must think of something.

265
00:24:20,084 --> 00:24:24,254
That arm trick was cool,
but how do we use it?

266
00:24:24,421 --> 00:24:27,257
She knows more tricks, right?

267
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:32,930
-What if she wiped out the school?
-Could you do that?

268
00:24:33,931 --> 00:24:35,307
Hmm.

269
00:24:38,018 --> 00:24:40,813
So what? We'd have classes
somewhere else

270
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:43,816
and the teachers' meeting
would be tomorrow!

271
00:24:45,609 --> 00:24:47,820
That's true.

272
00:24:49,947 --> 00:24:53,492
Are you having your lunch?
I won't reheat that rabbit.

273
00:24:53,659 --> 00:24:56,745
-I'm busy.
-The more for us.

274
00:24:58,163 --> 00:25:00,833
Rabbit! Rabbit every day...

275
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:04,336
My aunt steals them from
the janitor, to save money.

276
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:09,049
Wait. What if she changed
the teachers into rabbits?

277
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:12,761
Would you know how?

278
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:17,057
Wow!

279
00:25:17,224 --> 00:25:21,061
Why not? If she's a witch,
nothing's a problem for her...

280
00:25:21,228 --> 00:25:22,896
Sure thing.

281
00:25:24,273 --> 00:25:28,193
we'll slip them into
the rabbit hutch and that's that.

282
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:31,030
-Could you do that?
-Hmm.

283
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:34,575
-And what about that ear?
-Right...

284
00:25:34,742 --> 00:25:38,912
-You'll have it this afternoon!
-You are nice.

285
00:25:39,163 --> 00:25:44,543
<i>-And whose ear will it be?
-My aunt's.</i>

286
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:53,594
-Could they be wisdom teeth?
-Just look at me!

287
00:25:55,304 --> 00:25:58,766
Do you have a squirrel
in the family?

288
00:25:58,932 --> 00:26:00,851
Please... Stop it.

289
00:26:01,018 --> 00:26:04,438
It's very useful
for demonstration purposes.

290
00:26:04,605 --> 00:26:07,858
And somebody please make coffee.

291
00:26:12,738 --> 00:26:16,325
Again? Have it fixed!

292
00:26:18,494 --> 00:26:22,372
-What is that you keep drinking?
-An excellent thing.

293
00:26:22,539 --> 00:26:26,210
My asthma you know...
Sage tea.

294
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:30,672
-My notebook.
-Call in those three boys!

295
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:35,552
You can go in now, and knock.

296
00:26:38,388 --> 00:26:41,934
Count to twenty
and then bust in.

297
00:26:45,062 --> 00:26:47,064
Comet in.

298
00:26:52,361 --> 00:26:57,825
One, two, three, four...

299
00:26:58,158 --> 00:27:01,829
It couldn't have been us,
we were babysitting yesterday.

300
00:27:01,995 --> 00:27:04,206
Right... You look it...

301
00:27:04,373 --> 00:27:09,253
Mr. Blaha from the Culture
Commission will tell us!

302
00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:12,131
Ah, here he is. Come in.

303
00:27:16,093 --> 00:27:18,220
What do you want?

304
00:27:18,387 --> 00:27:21,473
-Dexempo...
-Excuse me?

305
00:27:22,766 --> 00:27:26,270
-Dexempo...
-Dexempo? Who is this girl?

306
00:27:26,436 --> 00:27:29,648
-Look at her!
-A new girl in class 9.

307
00:27:29,815 --> 00:27:32,943
Go away, Saxana,
you shouldn't be here at all!

308
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:35,154
Dexempo...

309
00:27:36,238 --> 00:27:40,450
-...multo...
-Looks like she's not all there.

310
00:27:41,201 --> 00:27:44,621
-Take her out!
-Hurry!

311
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:49,334
How dare you, Rousek? Is that
the way to talk to your teacher?

312
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:52,796
Hurry up! They should be
turned into rabbits by now!

313
00:27:52,963 --> 00:27:56,633
What?
Turn us into rabbits?

314
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,553
Dexempo multo shumpoplex!

315
00:28:09,021 --> 00:28:13,066
-And they're rabbits! Great!
-What?

316
00:28:13,984 --> 00:28:16,778
She changed them into rabbits?

317
00:28:16,945 --> 00:28:19,907
-How's that possible?
-No problem.

318
00:28:20,073 --> 00:28:23,744
What are you waiting for?
Transform him.

319
00:28:28,165 --> 00:28:30,709
Before he does something stupid.

320
00:28:31,168 --> 00:28:35,172
Police? This is Blaha.
Yes, the Zoo.

321
00:28:35,714 --> 00:28:40,010
Yes, the manager of the Zoo.
No, this is not the Zoo...

322
00:28:40,177 --> 00:28:43,388
Dexempo multo shumpoplex!

323
00:28:45,015 --> 00:28:47,309
Hello, hello...

324
00:28:47,684 --> 00:28:51,980
Said this isn't the Zoo...
Cut it out! Quick!

325
00:28:55,192 --> 00:28:57,903
Look, the principal!

326
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:05,244
We can't leave this here.
It would be suspicious.

327
00:29:07,496 --> 00:29:10,624
We caught them on the school
grounds, so they must be yours.

328
00:29:11,208 --> 00:29:15,420
But I have 21 rabbits.

329
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:19,383
Actually, only 20. Somebody
stole one again yesterday.

330
00:29:19,549 --> 00:29:23,804
You see. They get stolen,
why not have these for free?

331
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:27,599
-What if somebody recognizes them?
-No way.

332
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:33,021
What makes you think so?
But they're all white and all alike.

333
00:29:34,398 --> 00:29:36,984
Xerylox buxanto!

334
00:29:39,444 --> 00:29:42,614
But...
They're not white at all!

335
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:46,868
-I've never seen this sort before.
-Some trick.

336
00:29:47,035 --> 00:29:50,539
Put them inside, then.
Goodness me...

337
00:29:54,334 --> 00:29:56,545
Some trick!

338
00:29:56,712 --> 00:30:01,675
Yeah, but our time's running out.
19 more hours and we're off...

339
00:30:01,842 --> 00:30:04,261
And what if not?

340
00:30:26,283 --> 00:30:30,245
Good afternoon. I heard
there was no meeting.

341
00:30:30,412 --> 00:30:34,666
Oh, yes, there was...
Well, there wasn't.

342
00:30:35,042 --> 00:30:39,379
Actually, there was,
but you see, then there wasn't.

343
00:30:39,546 --> 00:30:44,509
-They've all disappeared.
-Disappeared? Interesting...

344
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:50,724
Our Katie was telling us, there's
a girl called Saxophona in her class

345
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:56,355
-who's trying to get a human ear.
-She must be a bit...

346
00:30:56,730 --> 00:31:00,901
She looks rather eccentric.

347
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:03,070
Excuse me.

348
00:31:07,366 --> 00:31:10,035
And now the ear!

349
00:31:16,416 --> 00:31:18,877
You promised!

350
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:52,744
Quiet! Or I'll throw you out.
Where's Mickey?

351
00:31:53,036 --> 00:31:56,623
With his father.
We're waiting for him.

352
00:31:57,541 --> 00:32:00,585
-Why don't you tell her?
-Tell me what?

353
00:32:00,836 --> 00:32:02,838
Nothing, she's crazy.

354
00:32:03,296 --> 00:32:06,466
That's not true
and they promised!

355
00:32:06,633 --> 00:32:10,679
-Promised what?
-That I could have your ear.

356
00:32:10,846 --> 00:32:15,392
-I have to boil it.
-Your humor'll dry up, my dear.

357
00:32:15,559 --> 00:32:18,603
And ['ll tell Mickey's father
about the people he brings in.

358
00:32:22,524 --> 00:32:25,610
You're really not going
to get that ear for me?

359
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:27,988
Are you really that stupid?

360
00:32:30,157 --> 00:32:35,162
-But I did turn them into rabbits.
-Exactly.

361
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:39,249
You're off in a few hours and
nobody will ever know what happened.

362
00:32:39,416 --> 00:32:44,296
We'd be really nuts to
get it for you, you silly.

363
00:32:57,225 --> 00:32:59,311
Yes, cry, you'll feel better.

364
00:32:59,895 --> 00:33:03,148
Even worse than the basilisks.
You're horrid!

365
00:33:03,315 --> 00:33:06,526
Where I come from
monsters behave like monsters.

366
00:33:06,776 --> 00:33:09,029
Hey, monster.

367
00:33:10,947 --> 00:33:16,161
I'm not staying here,
it's worse than back home.

368
00:33:16,328 --> 00:33:18,288
There you go!

369
00:33:18,747 --> 00:33:22,125
But before I go I'll tell
Honza everything.

370
00:33:22,292 --> 00:33:23,835
Oh, no, you won't!

371
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:30,133
You can forget that.

372
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:09,381
Boxes hok!

373
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:24,104
Toxare rex!

374
00:34:32,112 --> 00:34:35,240
Bad news. They want
to put us in reform school.

375
00:34:35,407 --> 00:34:37,742
-Where's Saxana?
-In the closet.

376
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:42,581
-She was making a fuss, so...
-But we'll need her.

377
00:34:44,457 --> 00:34:46,501
Saxana...

378
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:52,716
She's gone. What if she's
changed into a mouse?

379
00:34:52,882 --> 00:34:55,385
And is telling everything
to Honza as we speak.

380
00:34:55,552 --> 00:34:57,637
Mice don't run that fast.

381
00:34:57,804 --> 00:35:01,683
we'll take a cab.
And we've got their keys.

382
00:35:03,727 --> 00:35:07,939
I don't know. We were doing
rodents and suddenly this.

383
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:11,109
-You were lucky, Marie.
-How's that?

384
00:35:11,276 --> 00:35:16,072
Really lucky! Just imagine
if you'd been doing the rhinos.

385
00:35:16,323 --> 00:35:18,533
You'd have a coat hanger
instead of a nose.

386
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:21,703
This whole thing is insane.

387
00:35:21,911 --> 00:35:26,666
Relax, you're home,
nothing can happen to you now.

388
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:29,502
Home is an oasis of peace...

389
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:38,178
-What is it? My head!
-What is this supposed to mean?

390
00:35:38,345 --> 00:35:42,307
Who's that? Oh! My leg.

391
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:45,935
Karel... Napoleon.

392
00:35:51,608 --> 00:35:56,488
I think I'll have to Kill you.
All that work...

393
00:35:58,114 --> 00:36:01,910
-My leg's broken.
-That's what we need now.

394
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:06,706
Pick up that statue, Saxana! Can't
you see I'm supporting my husband?

395
00:36:08,375 --> 00:36:12,504
Will you tell me how
that girl got in here?

396
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:19,803
On a broomstick.

397
00:36:21,262 --> 00:36:24,057
I'm beginning to understand!

398
00:36:24,224 --> 00:36:26,351
And what does she want here?

399
00:36:26,518 --> 00:36:30,522
Get up and tell us
what you're doing here!

400
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:36,361
I'm sorry.
My steering went wrong.

401
00:36:36,528 --> 00:36:41,950
I meant to land at the Blahas.
Could you untie me please?

402
00:36:44,619 --> 00:36:48,289
No way.
I don't give rides to punks.

403
00:36:50,417 --> 00:36:54,462
Don't play with us or
we'll turn you into a rabbit!

404
00:36:55,338 --> 00:36:57,382
-Dexempo...
-Multo...

405
00:36:57,549 --> 00:36:59,384
-Shupoplex!
-Shuplex!

406
00:36:59,551 --> 00:37:02,762
-Shuplex!
-Screw you, goons!

407
00:37:04,264 --> 00:37:06,933
What if a weasel gets
into the rabbit-hutch?

408
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:11,104
-I can't remember the formula.
-Oh, it hurts!

409
00:37:11,271 --> 00:37:13,982
I'll take you for an X-ray.

410
00:37:14,649 --> 00:37:16,609
Karel...

411
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:23,908
You stay here and try to remember!
They have families to support...

412
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:26,494
What color are the rabbits?
Black or white?

413
00:37:26,661 --> 00:37:27,829
Striped.

414
00:37:41,509 --> 00:37:45,805
-How did you get here?
-From the flat next door.

415
00:37:46,556 --> 00:37:48,933
You should be with Mickey.

416
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:52,270
And I'm busy, I'm going
to the movies with Dad!

417
00:37:52,687 --> 00:37:55,398
I don't know what
you mean by movies,

418
00:37:55,565 --> 00:38:00,779
but you won't be going anywhere
with your dad. He's a rabbit now.

419
00:38:00,945 --> 00:38:04,574
-What did you say he is?
-A rabbit.

420
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:14,042
Mr. Javorsky, Mr. Keprle...

421
00:38:15,752 --> 00:38:18,505
Ah, Mr. Marik!

422
00:38:29,557 --> 00:38:32,894
Just keep cool, gentlemen.

423
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:50,370
Why do you mind
having a rabbit for a father?

424
00:38:50,537 --> 00:38:53,873
Mine's a bat.
You'll get used to it.

425
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:57,877
But you look at everything
with different eyes.

426
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:03,299
Did your bat daddy
ever play with you?

427
00:39:05,593 --> 00:39:10,056
Did he ever explain, say,
what an airship is?

428
00:39:10,306 --> 00:39:13,643
He sleeps by day because
he flies around at night.

429
00:39:13,810 --> 00:39:17,522
There you go!
Sleeps by day, off by night...

430
00:39:17,689 --> 00:39:20,900
Some don't care if they've
got a father or a bat,

431
00:39:21,067 --> 00:39:25,488
but even though my dad
gets on my nerves sometimes,

432
00:39:25,655 --> 00:39:29,576
-he's great and I love him.
-What's that? -What?

433
00:39:29,826 --> 00:39:33,329
To love.
We never studied that.

434
00:39:33,538 --> 00:39:36,374
Well, that's a problem then.

435
00:39:42,297 --> 00:39:45,592
See this cup and the saucer?

436
00:39:45,758 --> 00:39:48,678
Without the saucer
the cup would feel lonely.

437
00:39:48,845 --> 00:39:50,680
That's why it's worried
when it's not in place.

438
00:39:50,847 --> 00:39:55,727
And if anything happened to
the saucer, then the cup would care,

439
00:39:55,894 --> 00:40:00,356
because they belong together.
Do you understand?

440
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:04,569
Yes. You're worried
about your father.

441
00:40:04,736 --> 00:40:09,574
Of course! What if Mrs.
Vondrackova decided to kill him.

442
00:40:09,741 --> 00:40:14,037
So that's what it means to love.
I'd like to try that.

443
00:40:14,203 --> 00:40:18,499
We don't have such things back home.
We just cast spells on people.

444
00:40:18,666 --> 00:40:22,378
-Let's go! -Where to?
-To get the rabbit.

445
00:40:27,675 --> 00:40:32,597
-Gently, or she'll get mad...
-What do we do when we catch her?

446
00:40:32,931 --> 00:40:35,016
I've got a plan!

447
00:40:35,183 --> 00:40:37,894
That's Mickey and the boys.
Hide!

448
00:40:38,061 --> 00:40:39,979
The balcony!

449
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:57,205
What do you want?
Where did you get the keys?

450
00:40:57,372 --> 00:41:01,125
-Where is Saxana?
-How should I know?

451
00:41:03,378 --> 00:41:06,005
We'll make you talk!

452
00:41:51,843 --> 00:41:56,055
I've looked everywhere.
The girl's not here.

453
00:41:56,264 --> 00:41:57,682
What are we gonna do?

454
00:41:57,849 --> 00:42:00,768
Beat him up until
he tells us where she is.

455
00:42:04,397 --> 00:42:06,399
Are you gonna tell us?

456
00:42:07,275 --> 00:42:09,444
Hoterex fade!

457
00:42:19,579 --> 00:42:22,123
-Look who's here.
-Hi, Saxana.

458
00:42:25,376 --> 00:42:27,378
There...

459
00:42:31,215 --> 00:42:33,843
and now I'll turn you into this.

460
00:42:34,969 --> 00:42:39,599
-Hokare to...
-Don't be silly.

461
00:42:40,725 --> 00:42:43,686
We've been looking for you.
We've got that ear.

462
00:42:43,853 --> 00:42:46,314
Or don't you need it anymore?

463
00:42:46,481 --> 00:42:50,193
The guys said you didn't want
to stay here anymore.

464
00:42:50,359 --> 00:42:53,112
I've changed my mind.

465
00:42:53,488 --> 00:42:59,202
You see, I want to know what
it means "to love" somebody.

466
00:42:59,368 --> 00:43:02,497
I see.
That's the right decision.

467
00:43:02,747 --> 00:43:06,250
"To love",
that's a great thing.

468
00:43:06,501 --> 00:43:09,837
It's worth staying here for.

469
00:43:17,345 --> 00:43:19,931
And where's the ear?

470
00:43:20,348 --> 00:43:24,477
We'll take you where they have
as many ears as you want.

471
00:43:24,644 --> 00:43:27,647
Give me that head!
And the rest too!

472
00:43:29,482 --> 00:43:33,569
- I said the rest too!
-Where can it be?

473
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:37,198
If you want that ear,
we'll have to hurry.

474
00:43:37,365 --> 00:43:40,368
All right, I'll find him later.

475
00:43:45,206 --> 00:43:48,709
I've been working with rabbits
for twenty years.

476
00:43:48,876 --> 00:43:51,045
You have to keep working
at those teeth.

477
00:43:51,212 --> 00:43:53,464
Or they'll be this long
in a week's time.

478
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:58,094
-But I eat, don't 1?
-You must gnaw and gnaw!

479
00:43:58,928 --> 00:44:01,430
Here, gnaw!

480
00:44:10,022 --> 00:44:14,110
You're responsible for
their safety. Just a few days.

481
00:44:14,277 --> 00:44:17,113
Mr. Javorsky,
Mr. Masek, Miss Koutna...

482
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:20,783
-Excuse me?
-My pet names for them.

483
00:44:20,950 --> 00:44:22,910
Some foreign strain, isn't it?

484
00:44:23,077 --> 00:44:25,705
Yes. Would you please take
special care of them.

485
00:44:25,872 --> 00:44:30,459
-We'll read them bed time stories.
-They'd prefer the classics.

486
00:44:38,259 --> 00:44:41,429
Here you can get what you like.
If you want a leg, a leg you get.

487
00:44:41,596 --> 00:44:43,639
-Let's go, then.
-You go ahead.

488
00:44:43,806 --> 00:44:45,474
I'll be home soon.

489
00:44:57,236 --> 00:44:59,572
Wait here.

490
00:45:01,949 --> 00:45:04,994
Good afternoon, Doctor.

491
00:45:16,339 --> 00:45:19,342
The leg's all right.

492
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:24,764
But my head.
I keep seeing things.

493
00:45:25,848 --> 00:45:28,851
-What are you doing here?
-I've come to get an ear.

494
00:45:29,810 --> 00:45:32,188
-PSYCHIATRIC WARD
-Here?

495
00:45:32,355 --> 00:45:35,858
It's a good thing you've brought
her. You can't be all bad

496
00:45:36,025 --> 00:45:38,569
if you care about
your classmate's health.

497
00:45:38,736 --> 00:45:43,157
What's wrong?
Overworked, eh?

498
00:45:43,324 --> 00:45:46,327
We'll keep the girl here.

499
00:45:46,494 --> 00:45:50,498
Looks like a serious disorder.

500
00:45:50,665 --> 00:45:53,292
Call her in, nurse!

501
00:45:58,339 --> 00:46:00,758
Kudlackova!

502
00:46:05,972 --> 00:46:10,184
-Hello.
-So you need an oldish ear, do you?

503
00:46:10,351 --> 00:46:14,021
Yes. If I don't find one,
I won't be able to stay here.

504
00:46:14,188 --> 00:46:17,775
Of course you'll stay here.
You'll wait for that ear...

505
00:46:17,942 --> 00:46:22,697
But it mustn't take too long!
Otherwise I turn into an owl.

506
00:46:23,656 --> 00:46:29,578
Ah, yes, of course. Nurse,
take the sister to her room now.

507
00:46:30,246 --> 00:46:35,376
Are we sisters?
Then your father's a bat too, eh?

508
00:46:43,634 --> 00:46:46,971
-This is Saxana Kudlackova.
-How do you do?

509
00:46:47,388 --> 00:46:51,350
-I'm the Queen of Spain.
-Really? I was originally a witch.

510
00:46:51,517 --> 00:46:53,602
-Here!
-Are you waiting for an ear too?

511
00:46:53,769 --> 00:46:56,731
No. I'm waiting for
Christopher Columbus!

512
00:46:56,897 --> 00:46:59,900
I see you two'll get along.

513
00:47:03,362 --> 00:47:06,365
-Where's the handle?
-There isn't one.

514
00:47:06,532 --> 00:47:08,909
So nobody escapes.

515
00:47:09,076 --> 00:47:13,164
Only they forgot that
Columbus'll be coming by boat.

516
00:47:13,331 --> 00:47:16,000
Through the water pipes.

517
00:47:19,462 --> 00:47:22,631
-They've locked us up!
-Hmm.

518
00:47:24,592 --> 00:47:28,137
-Is there a broom here somewhere?
-No.

519
00:47:28,304 --> 00:47:33,642
But we can play marbles.
If you've got a hole, we can play.

520
00:47:42,234 --> 00:47:45,446
-Oh, isn't he pretty!
-Don't touch!

521
00:47:45,988 --> 00:47:50,951
Zarache beteme valo ketax!

522
00:47:56,999 --> 00:48:02,463
I'm so glad it worked. Honza,
you must tell me what to do.

523
00:48:02,838 --> 00:48:07,134
What happened?
Where are my arms and legs?

524
00:48:11,597 --> 00:48:15,518
Looks like we're all going
into a straight-jacket.

525
00:49:13,868 --> 00:49:16,495
-Good afternoon.
-Hello.

526
00:49:16,662 --> 00:49:21,625
In a hurry to get onto your
pedestal? But the nose is not...

527
00:49:22,001 --> 00:49:24,920
WHERE IS SAXANA?

528
00:49:25,337 --> 00:49:28,549
In the hospital. Psych Ward.

529
00:49:34,513 --> 00:49:36,599
Such nonsense.

530
00:49:36,974 --> 00:49:39,685
I doubt I'll find that ear.

531
00:49:39,852 --> 00:49:43,230
Yes, you'll disappear.
But what about those rabbits?

532
00:49:43,397 --> 00:49:46,859
What shall I do?
I'd need that book.

533
00:49:47,026 --> 00:49:50,112
Tarzan and his Mate.
That's a lovely book.

534
00:49:50,279 --> 00:49:52,948
-Please leave us alone!
-Hush!

535
00:49:53,115 --> 00:49:55,868
-What book?
-The Lexicon of Magic Spells.

536
00:49:56,035 --> 00:49:59,663
-Everything's in it.
-And where is that Lexicon?

537
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:02,708
-Back home.
-Then get it.

538
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:06,629
-But how will I get there?
-Take the bus.

539
00:50:06,879 --> 00:50:09,757
Could you please leave us alone?

540
00:50:15,971 --> 00:50:20,476
-What's this? -Columbus.
He comes here in pieces.

541
00:50:20,643 --> 00:50:23,020
I've asked you to leave us alone.

542
00:50:24,563 --> 00:50:27,525
Jeez! It talks!

543
00:50:47,336 --> 00:50:51,549
Oh, my!
In there... Go quickly!

544
00:50:51,757 --> 00:50:55,052
Alone? I'll get Vilda!

545
00:50:56,178 --> 00:50:59,473
Vilda! Vilda! Vilda!

546
00:51:01,433 --> 00:51:06,564
You are overworked. When I get
that way I see sheep. Or cows.

547
00:51:06,814 --> 00:51:10,985
But the head talks, Doctor!
It's young Blaha's head!

548
00:51:11,193 --> 00:51:13,279
-Oh, boy!
-Calm down!

549
00:51:13,445 --> 00:51:15,906
As a physician
I know what's possible.

550
00:51:16,073 --> 00:51:19,076
But the head's talking
to the Kudlackova girl!

551
00:51:19,243 --> 00:51:22,246
-Shoot!
-Well, so what?

552
00:51:24,123 --> 00:51:26,917
Let's go look, then.

553
00:51:35,801 --> 00:51:38,512
-Does it fit?
-Yes.

554
00:51:39,638 --> 00:51:43,809
-I must be mad.
-Let's go, before someone comes.

555
00:51:43,976 --> 00:51:47,021
-Where are you going?
-Don't move!

556
00:51:47,187 --> 00:51:51,859
-Do something!
-Dexempo krumplex!

557
00:52:03,829 --> 00:52:07,499
This is what I call a loony house!

558
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:14,256
See? Cows! I'm overworked too.
That's quite normal.

559
00:52:17,801 --> 00:52:21,180
-Where is Saxana?
-Are you Christopher Columbus?

560
00:52:21,347 --> 00:52:23,682
Where's your ship?

561
00:52:23,891 --> 00:52:27,561
You see, nurse,
this head couldn't have spoken.

562
00:52:27,728 --> 00:52:32,441
Just as those cows aren't real.
Where's your common sense?

563
00:52:33,609 --> 00:52:38,030
It's not that bad here!
Listen, why go back now?

564
00:52:38,739 --> 00:52:44,495
-It's not fun here.
-But I won't be back till morning.

565
00:52:44,662 --> 00:52:46,747
I'm helping Mrs. Vondrackova
with the washing.

566
00:52:46,914 --> 00:52:50,751
She's got a washing machine.
Look!

567
00:52:51,085 --> 00:52:55,964
-So through a fireplace or a well.
-A fireplace or a well.

568
00:52:59,009 --> 00:53:00,969
Thanks.

569
00:53:05,349 --> 00:53:07,351
Go!

570
00:53:18,904 --> 00:53:20,989
There they are!

571
00:53:28,455 --> 00:53:32,000
-Where are they?
-Must have fallen in.

572
00:53:33,168 --> 00:53:37,923
-So that's that.
-Let's throw in the rabbits too.

573
00:53:44,596 --> 00:53:48,517
Just imagine, somebody stole
those striped rabbits!

574
00:53:48,684 --> 00:53:51,562
Well, there will
always be thieves...

575
00:53:51,729 --> 00:53:54,898
And they were so special!
I could cry.

576
00:53:55,065 --> 00:54:00,446
-Come on... Mrs. Vondrackova.
-My only pride and joy!

577
00:54:04,158 --> 00:54:06,910
Xerylox buxanta!

578
00:54:10,581 --> 00:54:13,751
Mrs. Vondrackova,
we've come to get those rabbits.

579
00:54:13,917 --> 00:54:18,756
-Somebody stole the striped ones.
-What are you saying?

580
00:54:22,009 --> 00:54:25,596
-Good heavens!
-Let us have them!

581
00:54:25,763 --> 00:54:29,308
No! I've got them,
I keep them!

582
00:54:29,475 --> 00:54:34,480
-We'll just take them, then.
-You get out of here, boys.

583
00:54:34,646 --> 00:54:38,776
-Or you'll make me angry.
-Mind your own business, old fart!

584
00:54:39,234 --> 00:54:43,405
You're asking for it...
Uxandra pruxa!

585
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:03,258
-You'll be sorry!
-Don't provoke him.

586
00:55:05,427 --> 00:55:09,640
I think these gentlemen
won't be hurrying home.

587
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:12,976
Aren't you clever?

588
00:55:21,235 --> 00:55:26,532
Good evening. Mr. Blaha says
we're staying here tonight.

589
00:55:26,698 --> 00:55:32,204
-Tonight... Why?
-He said he'd explain tomorrow.

590
00:55:32,371 --> 00:55:36,834
And he sends you his keys,
for you to believe us.

591
00:55:38,293 --> 00:55:40,921
That's weird...

592
00:55:41,505 --> 00:55:46,260
-Did you hear that, Granny?
-And is Honza with him?

593
00:55:46,426 --> 00:55:50,180
-Honza fell into the well.
-But we pulled him out. He's OK.

594
00:55:50,347 --> 00:55:53,308
And you got hurt?
Let me look at it.

595
00:55:53,475 --> 00:55:57,896
-No, it's nothing.
-Such brave boys.

596
00:56:15,455 --> 00:56:19,209
That is the braying class.
Let's go!

597
00:56:24,047 --> 00:56:26,049
Watch it!

598
00:56:27,509 --> 00:56:32,014
I'll show him! He thinks that as
his father's a dragon with ten heads,

599
00:56:32,180 --> 00:56:33,682
he doesn't have to work...

600
00:56:34,641 --> 00:56:38,854
He teaches us how to shrink.
He's very nice.

601
00:56:59,917 --> 00:57:01,543
Look!

602
00:57:02,753 --> 00:57:07,507
That's bad, really bad! I don't know
what you think will save you.

603
00:57:07,841 --> 00:57:10,844
Are you waiting for a Prince

604
00:57:11,011 --> 00:57:15,933
to turn you into a Princess
with a kiss? Sit down!

605
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:22,105
Come in!

606
00:57:30,822 --> 00:57:33,617
What can I do for you, Prince?

607
00:57:33,784 --> 00:57:36,078
Professor Bayaya says hello

608
00:57:36,244 --> 00:57:39,706
and asks to borrow
The Lexicon of Magic Spells.

609
00:57:39,873 --> 00:57:42,626
Yes of course.

610
00:57:48,548 --> 00:57:52,344
My best regards to the Professor.

611
00:57:53,387 --> 00:57:56,181
Thank you. Thank you...

612
00:58:01,186 --> 00:58:05,816
Back to your places!
It's not easy to become a Princess.

613
00:58:05,983 --> 00:58:09,444
I advise you to study.

614
00:58:09,611 --> 00:58:12,990
Haxipola, come to the front.

615
00:58:26,378 --> 00:58:31,133
Saxana! So you're back.
Which class are you from?

616
00:58:31,299 --> 00:58:32,676
Class nine.

617
00:58:32,843 --> 00:58:37,014
How come I don't know you?
What are you wearing!

618
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:39,891
-Hurry!
-What's that?

619
00:58:40,058 --> 00:58:42,269
-The Lexicon!
-Hold him!

620
00:58:42,436 --> 00:58:45,272
Warning!

621
00:58:47,190 --> 00:58:50,902
-How dare you?
-Hold on! Almost got it!

622
00:58:57,451 --> 00:59:00,871
Professor Quickeye!
Professor Long!

623
00:59:01,997 --> 00:59:08,211
-Warning! Warning! Warning!
-What is going on, sir?

624
00:59:08,378 --> 00:59:10,255
-I've got it!
-The pentacle!

625
00:59:10,422 --> 00:59:13,008
-The Lexicon!
-Call the dragon!

626
00:59:13,175 --> 00:59:16,887
-The one with two heads'll do.
-He's teaching gym class.

627
00:59:17,054 --> 00:59:21,391
Determe xydravoplax
vebete mexabo plex!

628
00:59:26,605 --> 00:59:31,318
-Why didn't you call the dragon?
-They are gone.

629
00:59:31,485 --> 00:59:34,529
You don't know how
to behave in an emergency.

630
00:59:34,696 --> 00:59:38,075
I can only do a cook, mug trick.

631
00:59:38,283 --> 00:59:40,660
Judo will be compulsory
from now on!

632
00:59:43,163 --> 00:59:46,374
We've got two extra owls again.

633
00:59:48,376 --> 00:59:50,587
Where did they come from?

634
00:59:50,754 --> 00:59:54,341
-What time is it? -Half past seven.
-Put them in a sack.

635
00:59:54,508 --> 00:59:58,095
I'll drop by Mr. Blaha's house.
He's usually here by now.

636
01:00:09,731 --> 01:00:14,027
Get up, boys!
You'll be late for school.

637
01:00:17,739 --> 01:00:21,451
Anna! Come here!

638
01:00:21,785 --> 01:00:24,955
-What's up?
-Is anything wrong?

639
01:00:31,670 --> 01:00:36,133
That's from the well.
A tumor, from an infection.

640
01:00:40,554 --> 01:00:44,141
Good morning, Mrs. Blahova.
Is the boss at home?

641
01:00:44,307 --> 01:00:48,603
My poor boy,
they'll have to trim them for you!

642
01:00:49,646 --> 01:00:52,190
My husband spent the night
at the Zoo. With Honza.

643
01:00:52,357 --> 01:00:57,279
I'd have to know about it. Good
morning. You've got a visitor I see.

644
01:00:57,445 --> 01:01:02,325
Here, untie it! You have
nimbler fingers. Come on!

645
01:01:04,035 --> 01:01:05,829
What's wrong with him?

646
01:01:05,996 --> 01:01:08,957
That's from pulling Honza
out of the well.

647
01:01:09,124 --> 01:01:13,086
-Out of the well?
-Where's my husband? And Honza?

648
01:01:14,421 --> 01:01:19,092
-Jeez-strike-a-light-hallelujah...
-Anna, look!

649
01:01:25,265 --> 01:01:26,725
Honza?

650
01:01:29,060 --> 01:01:33,815
Here you are!
The Lexicon, Honza!

651
01:01:38,570 --> 01:01:41,823
-Velo rex!
-THE LEXICON OF MAGIC SPELLS

652
01:01:42,365 --> 01:01:47,078
-What is it?
-You mean this? It's full of spells.

653
01:01:47,412 --> 01:01:51,041
I'm going to change
those boys into hot dogs...

654
01:01:51,208 --> 01:01:54,920
-Follow me, quick!
-He stole the Lexicon! Give it back!

655
01:01:55,086 --> 01:01:56,713
Come on, Honza!

656
01:01:58,924 --> 01:02:03,345
-They've locked us in!
-Something's going on?

657
01:02:21,613 --> 01:02:24,783
-They're gone.
-What can we do?

658
01:02:24,950 --> 01:02:28,954
What on earth,
rabbits and Napoleon?

659
01:02:29,120 --> 01:02:32,540
-What is going on?
-Please don't keep us, Mom!

660
01:02:32,707 --> 01:02:36,419
-Saxana will disappear at nine...
-I'll explain later.

661
01:02:36,586 --> 01:02:39,965
-A broom! -Where's the broom?
-Over there!

662
01:02:40,715 --> 01:02:44,636
But I've already
swept the floor, dear.

663
01:02:46,680 --> 01:02:51,184
Is it always so exciting here
in the morning? I'll come again.

664
01:02:58,733 --> 01:03:02,279
-Fuses, my weak spot.
-Honza!

665
01:03:07,534 --> 01:03:11,496
Go to the rabbit hutch and feed dad.
He hasn't had his breakfast yet.

666
01:03:11,663 --> 01:03:14,708
-Are you going to let him go?
-Toxare kex!

667
01:03:14,874 --> 01:03:17,752
It's in your own interest...

668
01:03:19,671 --> 01:03:22,215
I must be losing it!

669
01:03:24,509 --> 01:03:27,762
He's forgotten his scarf.
He'll catch cold.

670
01:03:44,154 --> 01:03:47,782
Why drive in such an old clunker.
Let's change the car.

671
01:03:47,949 --> 01:03:51,619
-Find it.
-Changes. "C"...

672
01:03:53,747 --> 01:03:57,584
-Change it into something decent.
-I've got it.

673
01:04:14,017 --> 01:04:15,852
Did you see that?

674
01:04:16,353 --> 01:04:18,813
This is cool.

675
01:04:19,397 --> 01:04:22,692
Did you break some rules?
The cops are behind us.

676
01:04:22,859 --> 01:04:25,904
-Two of them!
-They must be after us!

677
01:04:26,738 --> 01:04:30,033
Shoot...
Do something, quick!

678
01:04:55,308 --> 01:04:58,561
-Any problem?
-We didn't do anything.

679
01:04:58,728 --> 01:05:01,231
We're in a great hurry.

680
01:05:02,273 --> 01:05:06,277
I'm sorry, it's a mistake,
you may drive on.

681
01:05:11,074 --> 01:05:15,578
- I saw some boys in that car.
-Did you notice how they talked?

682
01:05:15,745 --> 01:05:18,915
Those voices... And in Czech.

683
01:05:20,542 --> 01:05:23,503
-Where are we going?
-To Switzerland.

684
01:05:23,670 --> 01:05:26,714
-All right!
-Those two are on our tail again.

685
01:05:26,881 --> 01:05:29,050
-Who?
-The cops.

686
01:05:29,217 --> 01:05:32,679
-We've got the Lexicon, don't we?
-That's right.

687
01:05:39,978 --> 01:05:42,647
It worked once,
but it's over now.

688
01:05:53,283 --> 01:05:55,493
What was that?

689
01:05:59,622 --> 01:06:01,541
Doesn't look like it.

690
01:06:21,060 --> 01:06:23,062
What is it?

691
01:06:23,980 --> 01:06:27,066
Nothing. Have a safe trip.

692
01:06:28,193 --> 01:06:31,446
Why are you bothering us?
We're on the way to Switzerland

693
01:06:31,613 --> 01:06:34,908
to consecrate a church!
Step on it, man!

694
01:06:40,079 --> 01:06:44,751
- I don't like it.
-Bishops in a Fiat 5007 Nonsense.

695
01:06:53,176 --> 01:06:56,596
Damn it, move over.
We're packed in here like sardines.

696
01:06:56,763 --> 01:06:59,307
What a stupid idea.

697
01:06:59,641 --> 01:07:03,520
-Wait! Let's try again.
-Hurry up!

698
01:07:12,946 --> 01:07:15,532
Go down! This is it.

699
01:07:15,698 --> 01:07:17,700
Hold on!

700
01:07:22,664 --> 01:07:25,500
We can't stay in these rags.

701
01:07:25,667 --> 01:07:30,171
Why not?
We're moving to a monastery.

702
01:07:31,798 --> 01:07:36,678
But we haven't eaten yet and
can't go into a pub like this.

703
01:07:36,970 --> 01:07:39,222
All right then.

704
01:07:46,020 --> 01:07:48,022
Watch it!

705
01:07:53,194 --> 01:07:54,529
Now!

706
01:07:55,822 --> 01:07:57,407
Good!

707
01:08:01,953 --> 01:08:04,205
What time is it?

708
01:08:04,372 --> 01:08:08,459
-We've got half an hour.
-We? You mean I have.

709
01:08:08,626 --> 01:08:09,961
We.

710
01:08:13,548 --> 01:08:17,885
-That's better.
-Check out these muscles.

711
01:08:18,303 --> 01:08:20,888
But we can't go to
Switzerland like this.

712
01:08:21,055 --> 01:08:24,809
We'll become elegant
diplomats at the border.

713
01:08:24,976 --> 01:08:27,395
Look, a pub! Let's eat!

714
01:08:27,562 --> 01:08:31,274
I wonder how much this body can eat.

715
01:08:59,677 --> 01:09:03,181
-You want to follow them in?
-Of course. No time to waste.

716
01:09:04,682 --> 01:09:08,102
-Goulash. Three times.
-Three times goulash.

717
01:09:09,270 --> 01:09:12,649
-Guess what for rafters!
-And you? -A tall beer!

718
01:09:12,815 --> 01:09:16,110
-We can do what we like now.
-Are you dumb?

719
01:09:16,277 --> 01:09:21,532
-We can even smoke.
-Chesterfields... -First the goulash.

720
01:09:22,617 --> 01:09:25,161
-What about the money?
-That's easy!

721
01:09:25,328 --> 01:09:28,164
-How much do you want?
-A lot, I'm hungry.

722
01:09:31,376 --> 01:09:38,174
Here it says: "Money",
see "Shake, Donkey!".

723
01:09:38,341 --> 01:09:40,843
What? Donkey?

724
01:09:42,762 --> 01:09:46,933
-Did three Indian men stop here?
-Or three Bishops?

725
01:09:47,225 --> 01:09:49,310
Only three moving men.

726
01:09:50,019 --> 01:09:53,690
Donkey or no donkey, the main
thing is we shake up the dough!

727
01:09:54,565 --> 01:09:57,610
Rytero xaperle bax!

728
01:09:59,779 --> 01:10:03,199
-Take it away!
-Put it down!

729
01:10:06,077 --> 01:10:10,039
I won't have it, gentlemen.
Get that animal down!

730
01:10:10,206 --> 01:10:13,000
Hide it, man!

731
01:10:13,459 --> 01:10:16,671
-This is not our fault.
-Now's your chance.

732
01:10:16,879 --> 01:10:19,549
We don't know who put it here.

733
01:10:19,966 --> 01:10:23,010
You'll pay for that table.
This is no stable.

734
01:10:23,219 --> 01:10:25,972
I'm telling you,
take the donkey down!

735
01:10:26,139 --> 01:10:29,809
Turn them into something.
Into violins, but quick.

736
01:10:32,520 --> 01:10:35,690
-Where's the book?
-What book?

737
01:10:36,065 --> 01:10:37,817
This one.

738
01:10:39,694 --> 01:10:43,030
-This is the end!
-No, it's the beginning!

739
01:10:43,489 --> 01:10:47,118
-Suxo plexo muxo!
-No! Don't do it!

740
01:10:47,910 --> 01:10:52,540
-They can't drive like this!
-That's against the law!

741
01:10:57,086 --> 01:10:59,505
I'll join the fire brigade.

742
01:11:07,430 --> 01:11:10,183
Stop! Stop!

743
01:11:19,192 --> 01:11:21,110
Rebeke plex!

744
01:11:21,277 --> 01:11:24,447
Hey, it's you?

745
01:11:24,614 --> 01:11:28,242
That was lucky! They were
taking us to slaughter.

746
01:11:28,409 --> 01:11:31,704
Quick!
Only twelve minutes left.

747
01:11:50,515 --> 01:11:54,727
-Ninth graders will move...
-Shut the door, it's drafty!

748
01:11:54,894 --> 01:12:00,817
...the others will remain in their
classrooms until further notice.

749
01:12:02,360 --> 01:12:04,487
There...

750
01:12:08,866 --> 01:12:11,994
Here they are, Inspector.

751
01:12:15,998 --> 01:12:19,001
This could be Jindrich.

752
01:12:20,086 --> 01:12:22,922
-Look at those cheek bones.
-Well...

753
01:12:23,089 --> 01:12:26,634
Don't take them away,
we must write a report.

754
01:12:26,801 --> 01:12:28,761
Someone's knocking...

755
01:12:28,970 --> 01:12:32,890
I have never seen
such a weird school.

756
01:12:33,349 --> 01:12:35,893
You're back?

757
01:12:37,103 --> 01:12:39,438
That's her!

758
01:12:40,481 --> 01:12:42,692
So it's you!

759
01:12:42,859 --> 01:12:47,029
You say these rabbits
are all teachers?

760
01:12:47,196 --> 01:12:48,614
And our Dad!

761
01:12:48,865 --> 01:12:52,743
-Is that so?
-You'll see. Here it is.

762
01:12:54,579 --> 01:12:58,040
Vexopuro nobleti he men ex!

763
01:12:58,624 --> 01:13:01,711
-Hello.
-Excuse me...

764
01:13:01,878 --> 01:13:03,796
Hello!

765
01:13:09,093 --> 01:13:14,015
Damn! Classes have already
started. And we are here.

766
01:13:14,932 --> 01:13:16,809
Where is the principal?

767
01:13:20,730 --> 01:13:26,277
-You hit me with a cleaver!
-I'd never dare, sir!

768
01:13:26,569 --> 01:13:30,615
Silence! You were going to
serve me with cream sauce.

769
01:13:30,781 --> 01:13:32,533
And cranberries.

770
01:13:38,831 --> 01:13:42,960
You're pulling our legs,
Kudlackova.

771
01:13:43,127 --> 01:13:46,464
-It's not working.
-Here they are!

772
01:13:47,882 --> 01:13:50,009
Jindrich!

773
01:13:50,176 --> 01:13:55,306
-Saxana! You did it!
-Yes, but I disappear in 5 minutes.

774
01:13:56,265 --> 01:13:59,769
-You want to go back?
-Where can we find a hag's ear?

775
01:13:59,936 --> 01:14:04,190
-Hag's ear?
- I have that in my botany collection!

776
01:14:04,357 --> 01:14:09,695
-Botany? An ear?
-Salvia Pratensis aka Hag's Ear.

777
01:14:09,862 --> 01:14:13,324
That's the old name,
used in the Giant Mountains...

778
01:14:13,491 --> 01:14:16,243
Get some, quickly!
We must make a brew.

779
01:14:17,870 --> 01:14:21,582
-We won't make it in time.
-We must!

780
01:14:21,749 --> 01:14:25,002
That's right.
We're not giving you up.

781
01:14:25,211 --> 01:14:27,505
Where's the principal?

782
01:14:27,755 --> 01:14:29,924
Sage!

783
01:14:38,224 --> 01:14:42,019
As a rabbit
I would have preferred...

784
01:14:43,688 --> 01:14:48,401
-Again, really...
-One and a half minutes left.

785
01:14:50,319 --> 01:14:55,241
What can we do...
I must at least fix those boys.

786
01:14:58,661 --> 01:15:02,123
Zarache beteme valo ketax!

787
01:15:02,707 --> 01:15:07,795
-Of course! You three again!
-Stay here, we want a word with you.

788
01:15:07,962 --> 01:15:12,133
-Class 9, the pick of the bunch.
-What's wrong with you?

789
01:15:12,299 --> 01:15:14,510
I apologize.

790
01:15:14,885 --> 01:15:18,556
I apologize.
I apologize to all of you.

791
01:15:18,723 --> 01:15:22,476
They have just crossed me
off the menu. Sorry for being late.

792
01:15:22,643 --> 01:15:26,731
I was doing my best.
My asthma... Excuse me.

793
01:15:30,317 --> 01:15:34,113
-Sage. Hag's Ear.
-Yes.

794
01:15:34,280 --> 01:15:36,866
Drink it up.

795
01:15:37,950 --> 01:15:41,162
Can you open it?

796
01:15:49,920 --> 01:15:52,673
-Here.
-Your teeth!

797
01:15:53,466 --> 01:15:55,634
Rudexe ux.

798
01:15:56,635 --> 01:15:58,596
Thank you.

799
01:16:00,264 --> 01:16:03,768
-Catch him!
-Catch Rousek!

800
01:16:04,435 --> 01:16:09,690
-It was all for nothing.
-You think so? 36 seconds left.

801
01:16:10,024 --> 01:16:12,985
-Kudlackova!
-Saxana!

802
01:16:14,153 --> 01:16:18,449
-Call an ambulance!
-Try landing on your toes!

803
01:16:19,492 --> 01:16:21,869
Box lox hox!

804
01:16:23,204 --> 01:16:27,666
-Bend your knees!
-Be careful!

805
01:16:29,502 --> 01:16:32,797
Give me a drop.
I want to stay too.

806
01:16:34,173 --> 01:16:35,966
Oh, no, the boss.

807
01:16:36,801 --> 01:16:41,347
Give me that!
If I could I'd burn you alive!

808
01:16:41,555 --> 01:16:44,600
But that's just what you can't now.

809
01:16:52,566 --> 01:16:55,611
-Brave girl.
-You did it.

810
01:16:55,778 --> 01:16:58,239
-Bravo, Saxana.
-Dear colleague...

811
01:16:58,405 --> 01:17:00,366
Welcome among the humans.

812
01:17:00,533 --> 01:17:06,163
As our new janitor
and a new student.

813
01:17:07,414 --> 01:17:09,625
She can't do magic tricks.

814
01:17:09,792 --> 01:17:13,212
To show you that I mean it,

815
01:17:13,379 --> 01:17:17,883
here's your application
to study at our school.

816
01:17:18,050 --> 01:17:20,261
Shut the door, it's drafty!

817
01:17:20,427 --> 01:17:23,806
-Saxana!
-This is the end!

818
01:17:25,141 --> 01:17:28,936
Saxana,

819
01:17:29,520 --> 01:17:33,482
those rose petals, their smell,

820
01:17:33,732 --> 01:17:38,529
Saxana
do the magic better than a spell.

821
01:17:38,696 --> 01:17:43,450
Saxana,
books bound in leather slick,

822
01:17:43,617 --> 01:17:48,122
Saxana,
have more than one magic trick.

823
01:17:48,372 --> 01:17:53,169
Saxana,
those rose petals, their smell,

824
01:17:53,335 --> 01:17:57,965
Saxana,
do the magic better than a spell.

825
01:18:01,844 --> 01:18:04,180
Take a minute,
find a message in I,

826
01:18:04,346 --> 01:18:11,103
rhymes' power is infinite,
gone is the snow, last year's snow.

827
01:18:11,353 --> 01:18:14,481
It is all there, I say,
how to turn night into day,

828
01:18:14,648 --> 01:18:20,654
get yes from nay and turn bad
nights into jolly bites.

829
01:18:20,821 --> 01:18:25,701
Saxana,
books bound in leather slick,

830
01:18:25,868 --> 01:18:30,414
Saxana,
have more than one magic trick.

831
01:18:30,581 --> 01:18:35,127
Saxana,
those rose petals, their smell,

832
01:18:35,294 --> 01:18:40,674
Saxana,
do the magic better than a spell.
