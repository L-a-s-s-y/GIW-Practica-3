Inspired by Georges Simenon's Novel

00:00:58,017 --> 00:01:00,186
<i>Mr. Hire's Engagement</i>

4
00:02:09,672 --> 00:02:14,927
<i>Ask for Paris</i> Soir!
<i>One franc! All the latest news!</i>

5
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:30,586
You can go and watch,
but don't get run over.

6
00:03:30,711 --> 00:03:31,754
Evening, Monsieur Hire.

7
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:34,465
And don't bring any fleas home!

8
00:03:36,717 --> 00:03:38,552
A carnival's all we need.

9
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:39,929
A ten-day nuisance.

10
00:03:40,054 --> 00:03:41,722
What'll it be today?

11
00:03:41,847 --> 00:03:44,517
One loin chop, thick and bloody.

12
00:03:44,642 --> 00:03:46,727
One chop and you're done.

13
00:03:47,395 --> 00:03:50,106
If you had eight children like me...

14
00:03:50,398 --> 00:03:53,317
The missus still isn't over
the last one.

15
00:03:54,193 --> 00:03:56,695
Mathilde, what's the doctor call it?

16
00:03:56,821 --> 00:03:59,115
Lymphatism in the organs.

17
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,950
Ever hear of that?

18
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,743
Oh, that's right.

19
00:04:02,868 --> 00:04:04,995
You don't have a wife either.

20
00:04:05,121 --> 00:04:07,581
Some like to keep life simple.

21
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:11,252
Now there's a prime cut!

22
00:04:11,377 --> 00:04:13,462
You said that yesterday
about my steak.

23
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:15,089
Good, but not enough blood.

24
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:16,715
Not enough blood?

25
00:04:16,841 --> 00:04:17,967
You'll like this one.

26
00:04:18,092 --> 00:04:21,011
Mathilde, 6.25 for Monsieur Hire.

27
00:04:21,595 --> 00:04:23,764
That carnival
will keep us up all night.

28
00:04:23,931 --> 00:04:26,767
And folks will stuff themselves
with candy.

29
00:04:26,892 --> 00:04:28,644
There oughta be a law.

30
00:04:28,769 --> 00:04:32,273
- 6.25, you said?
- That's right, monsieur.

31
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:35,359
- Good evening.
- Glad to be of service!

32
00:04:36,068 --> 00:04:39,113
Always so chatty.
Friendly, too.

33
00:04:55,379 --> 00:04:56,464
Hey, boss...

34
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:58,632
there's a fancy pair of shoes!

35
00:05:00,968 --> 00:05:03,512
Damn! With feet in them!

36
00:05:03,637 --> 00:05:05,222
Don't touch a thing!

37
00:05:05,347 --> 00:05:08,642
Kids, where's the police station?
- Dunno.

38
00:05:23,491 --> 00:05:25,659
Where's the police station?

39
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:27,703
There's a corpse in the empty lot!

40
00:05:27,828 --> 00:05:29,330
No! Man or woman?

41
00:05:29,455 --> 00:05:30,831
- A woman.
- Who is it?

42
00:05:30,956 --> 00:05:33,501
How do I know?
Imagine finding such a thing!

43
00:05:33,626 --> 00:05:35,169
Some carnival!

44
00:05:35,294 --> 00:05:37,922
- Where's the police station?
- Straight ahead.

45
00:05:39,757 --> 00:05:41,008
Good evening, Monsieur Hire.

46
00:05:41,175 --> 00:05:43,469
A camembert, runny and ripe.

47
00:05:43,594 --> 00:05:46,639
They're all quite ripe.
Choose one yourself.

48
00:05:46,764 --> 00:05:49,517
Jérôme, switch the lights on
so we can see.

49
00:05:49,975 --> 00:05:51,685
And for you, Madame Brochu?

50
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:54,021
There's a corpse in the vacant lot!

51
00:05:54,146 --> 00:05:56,815
Yes, a dead body!
- Jesus and Mary!

52
00:05:56,941 --> 00:05:59,276
Good Lord, I better go see!

53
00:05:59,401 --> 00:06:01,362
Jérôme, go see what's happening.

54
00:06:01,487 --> 00:06:02,863
Sure thing.

55
00:06:02,988 --> 00:06:05,991
Hear that, Monsieur Hire?
In our neighborhood!

56
00:06:06,116 --> 00:06:09,537
There's no morality
or religion anywhere.

57
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:12,665
Not ripe enough.
I wonder if the brie is better.

58
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:16,043
Look at that,
all of them hurrying over there.

59
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:18,837
Carrion always attracts flies,
dear madam.

60
00:06:19,838 --> 00:06:22,216
Keep back, keep back.

61
00:06:22,383 --> 00:06:26,303
The police will want
to examine the footprints.

62
00:06:26,595 --> 00:06:30,766
We'll need to identify the victim
and notify the family.

63
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:32,059
Give me the lamp.

64
00:06:32,226 --> 00:06:33,727
Stop shoving, kids!

65
00:06:33,852 --> 00:06:36,188
The men should remove their hats.

66
00:06:38,482 --> 00:06:40,025
It's a woman.

67
00:06:40,317 --> 00:06:42,987
I'd say it really looks like -

68
00:06:43,821 --> 00:06:46,156
It's Mademoiselle Noblet!
- Who?

69
00:06:46,282 --> 00:06:48,909
Mademoiselle Noblet,
a kind-hearted lady.

70
00:06:49,243 --> 00:06:51,245
Was she shot or stabbed?

71
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:52,913
The police will tell us.

72
00:07:00,713 --> 00:07:02,006
Step back!

73
00:07:02,131 --> 00:07:04,174
Move away.
It's not a sideshow.

74
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:08,178
I hope the police conduct
a forceful, diligent investigation.

75
00:07:08,596 --> 00:07:10,389
I tried to keep them back.

76
00:07:10,514 --> 00:07:11,515
You did well.

77
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,767
First, the doctor needs
to examine the body.

78
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:15,060
Permit me.

79
00:07:15,185 --> 00:07:18,063
Let the doctor through
for the official examination!

80
00:07:18,188 --> 00:07:20,649
Come on, let the doctor through!

81
00:07:21,609 --> 00:07:22,484
There.

82
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:23,611
Thank you.

83
00:07:23,736 --> 00:07:25,279
At your service, sir.

84
00:07:25,446 --> 00:07:26,947
This way, Doctor.

85
00:07:52,056 --> 00:07:54,516
- Hello, little Lucienne.
- Hello, Monsieur Hire.

86
00:07:54,642 --> 00:07:57,394
- Were you good at school?
- Yes, Monsieur Hire.

87
00:07:57,603 --> 00:07:59,980
- Do you want an apple?
- Sure.

88
00:08:01,565 --> 00:08:03,901
- What do you say?
- Thank you, Monsieur Hire.

89
00:08:04,026 --> 00:08:06,654
<i>Lucienne! Come here at once!</i>

90
00:08:13,994 --> 00:08:16,330
- Who gave you that?
- Monsieur Hire.

91
00:08:16,664 --> 00:08:21,168
Take any more gifts from him
and I'll lock you in the closet!

92
00:08:42,106 --> 00:08:43,774
Anybody here?

93
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:15,556
I saw one at my previous hotel.

94
00:09:15,681 --> 00:09:19,560
A drowned person is awful,
but she looked like she was asleep.

95
00:09:19,685 --> 00:09:22,104
Weird seeing
the edge of her petticoat.

96
00:09:22,229 --> 00:09:24,440
If she'd only known that one day...

97
00:09:24,565 --> 00:09:26,942
A generous lady.
She did a great deal for charity.

98
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:30,070
But no husband or kids.
And she ate like a bird.

99
00:09:30,195 --> 00:09:32,364
Not even half a pound
of meat a week.

100
00:09:32,489 --> 00:09:33,741
Still, a fine woman.

101
00:09:33,866 --> 00:09:35,159
I'll have a glass of red.

102
00:09:35,451 --> 00:09:37,244
She had no enemies.

103
00:09:37,411 --> 00:09:39,288
It was some burn or sadist!

104
00:09:39,413 --> 00:09:42,374
- Did they find her bag?
- She had no money.

105
00:09:42,499 --> 00:09:45,919
Think about it.
She wasn't killed for money.

106
00:09:46,044 --> 00:09:48,422
But a lady dressed in black...

107
00:09:48,881 --> 00:09:52,050
well into her 40s,
found in a vacant lot -

108
00:09:52,176 --> 00:09:53,761
strange, isn't it?

109
00:09:53,886 --> 00:09:55,721
Very peculiar, indeed.

110
00:09:55,846 --> 00:09:58,474
All these carnival folk,
where are they from?

111
00:09:58,599 --> 00:10:02,019
Like I said,
carnivals are bad for business.

112
00:10:03,395 --> 00:10:04,730
You don't know me.

113
00:10:04,855 --> 00:10:07,483
Meet me behind the church
in a half hour.

114
00:10:07,608 --> 00:10:10,027
Sensational developments!

115
00:10:10,194 --> 00:10:12,279
The inspector needs the phone!

116
00:10:12,404 --> 00:10:14,281
The booth's in back. A drink?

117
00:10:14,406 --> 00:10:15,991
How'd she die?

118
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:17,910
- Strangled.
- Any prints?

119
00:10:18,035 --> 00:10:20,454
- That's confidential.
- When did it happen?

120
00:10:20,621 --> 00:10:23,582
The victim struggled.
Her wristwatch was broken.

121
00:10:23,707 --> 00:10:25,083
A phone token, please.

122
00:10:25,209 --> 00:10:27,795
Her watch stopped at 8:20.
- So this morning.

123
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:30,798
- I'd say last night.
- While we played cards.

124
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:33,926
Which reminds me,
you owe me 36 francs.

125
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:36,970
- You'll be questioning everyone.
- Don't worry.

126
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:40,474
Allow me to introduce myself.
Adrien Sauvage, tax collector.

127
00:10:40,641 --> 00:10:42,684
I know everyone. Decent folk.

128
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:44,144
All terribly shaken.

129
00:10:44,311 --> 00:10:46,396
I'm a thoughtful man of experience.

130
00:10:46,522 --> 00:10:50,609
If you need information on any odd
individuals or likely suspects...

131
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:08,335
You...

132
00:11:09,086 --> 00:11:11,588
my darling Freddy.

133
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:13,257
It's you.

134
00:11:13,382 --> 00:11:14,758
I'm with you at last.

135
00:11:14,883 --> 00:11:16,218
Lili...

136
00:11:16,343 --> 00:11:18,011
My sweet Alice.

137
00:11:18,679 --> 00:11:21,265
No, hold me in your arms...

138
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:22,224
tight.

139
00:11:22,349 --> 00:11:24,518
- Listen...
- Don't say a word.

140
00:11:24,768 --> 00:11:27,855
I've waited 233 days for this moment...

141
00:11:28,105 --> 00:11:29,898
and 233 nights.

142
00:11:31,859 --> 00:11:34,194
Were you waiting for me, darling?

143
00:11:34,361 --> 00:11:36,864
Sure, but I didn't expect you so soon.

144
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:39,241
You haven't done anything silly?

145
00:11:39,366 --> 00:11:41,618
No, I've behaved myself.

146
00:11:42,202 --> 00:11:44,538
So much so, they released me early.

147
00:11:44,705 --> 00:11:46,123
I don't get it.

148
00:11:46,248 --> 00:11:48,125
Why so cautious?

149
00:11:48,584 --> 00:11:50,627
You obviously don't know them.

150
00:11:50,878 --> 00:11:53,797
Everything comes with a price.

151
00:11:54,089 --> 00:11:57,217
They made me promise to help them.

152
00:11:57,885 --> 00:12:00,721
I did, because
I so wanted to be with you.

153
00:12:00,846 --> 00:12:03,640
They're watching me.
- I've got nothing to hide.

154
00:12:03,765 --> 00:12:06,143
Really? You've got a job?

155
00:12:06,268 --> 00:12:08,020
I'll tell you all about it.

156
00:12:08,145 --> 00:12:11,356
I'd have been a heel
after everything you did.

157
00:12:11,481 --> 00:12:13,066
It was nothing.

158
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:17,738
What if I told you I liked my prison,
because I was there for you.

159
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:20,657
I even wished it was tougher.

160
00:12:20,782 --> 00:12:23,535
I wanted the guards to be nastier.

161
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:28,081
I wanted to suffer more
to show how much I love you.

162
00:12:29,499 --> 00:12:32,586
Understand, my little lost soldier boy?

163
00:12:52,189 --> 00:12:54,483
I adore church music.

164
00:13:02,574 --> 00:13:04,660
Like when I was a kid.

165
00:13:04,868 --> 00:13:06,453
So tell me...

166
00:13:06,787 --> 00:13:08,455
why are they still watching you?

167
00:13:08,789 --> 00:13:12,793
They know I took the rap
for someone in that robbery,

168
00:13:13,085 --> 00:13:15,170
so we must pretend to be strangers.

169
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:16,672
You can't leave me now!

170
00:13:16,797 --> 00:13:19,257
Why risk getting caught now?

171
00:13:20,217 --> 00:13:21,635
You know...

172
00:13:22,052 --> 00:13:24,304
I need to be patient too.

173
00:13:25,347 --> 00:13:27,182
Only until tomorrow.

174
00:13:27,307 --> 00:13:32,145
At the café, in front of everyone,
we'll pretend to meet for the first time.

175
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:35,524
You'll call me “mademoiselle”...

176
00:13:36,191 --> 00:13:39,152
and I'll play hard to get.

177
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:42,823
So who am I falling for?

178
00:13:43,782 --> 00:13:45,659
A guy named Alfred.

179
00:13:46,076 --> 00:13:48,453
He works in a garage with his pals.

180
00:13:48,578 --> 00:13:51,081
Everybody likes him.
He's always ready to help.

181
00:13:51,206 --> 00:13:53,125
Doesn't drink or gamble.

182
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:54,459
Never plays poker...

183
00:13:54,584 --> 00:13:55,836
only belote.

184
00:13:55,961 --> 00:13:56,920
No girlfriend?

185
00:13:57,045 --> 00:14:01,550
Impossible. He loves a girl
who's been away for a year.

186
00:14:01,675 --> 00:14:03,802
And who now has no place to live.

187
00:14:03,927 --> 00:14:05,804
I'll get a room at the hotel.

188
00:14:05,929 --> 00:14:08,098
I'll put in a word with the owner.

189
00:14:08,265 --> 00:14:09,850
No, we haven't met yet!

190
00:14:10,267 --> 00:14:11,518
Pity.

191
00:14:12,102 --> 00:14:13,353
So...

192
00:14:13,895 --> 00:14:15,689
see you tomorrow?

193
00:14:16,857 --> 00:14:19,943
I think it's going to be
love at first sight.

194
00:14:20,193 --> 00:14:21,862
My darling!

195
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:33,707
We better go.
I don't want to sleep outside.

196
00:14:33,957 --> 00:14:35,292
Me neither.

197
00:14:50,515 --> 00:14:51,558
What's going on?

198
00:14:51,725 --> 00:14:55,062
It's going to the morgue.
Some old maid was knocked off.

199
00:14:55,187 --> 00:14:56,688
Charming neighborhood!

200
00:14:56,813 --> 00:14:59,232
Good-bye, honey.
See you tomorrow.

201
00:14:59,566 --> 00:15:00,901
Good night!

202
00:15:36,978 --> 00:15:39,397
Not much of a view, but it's quiet.

203
00:15:39,523 --> 00:15:40,774
It'll be fine.

204
00:15:40,941 --> 00:15:42,734
Good night, mademoiselle.

205
00:15:42,859 --> 00:15:44,361
Good night.

206
00:15:50,492 --> 00:15:52,285
I don't need anything else.

207
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:54,121
Very well, madame.

208
00:17:09,196 --> 00:17:10,614
Mademoiselle...

209
00:17:10,739 --> 00:17:14,034
I've never approached a woman
like this, but last night -

210
00:17:14,201 --> 00:17:15,952
Oh, it was you!

211
00:17:16,494 --> 00:17:18,371
If you knew me better...

212
00:17:20,957 --> 00:17:22,667
Right here, Inspector.

213
00:17:22,792 --> 00:17:24,044
Yes, I see.

214
00:17:24,211 --> 00:17:27,005
Mademoiselle,
you didn't check in last night.

215
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:28,340
Sorry, it was late.

216
00:17:28,465 --> 00:17:31,218
With this murder,
it's best to obey the law.

217
00:17:31,384 --> 00:17:32,969
No matter when.

218
00:17:33,094 --> 00:17:35,513
That's what I meant, Inspector.

219
00:17:36,681 --> 00:17:38,058
You arrived yesterday?

220
00:17:38,225 --> 00:17:39,601
Yes, sir.

221
00:17:39,976 --> 00:17:42,646
- Where from?
- Rennes.

222
00:17:43,855 --> 00:17:45,273
Do you have a job?

223
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:49,444
Ready-to-wear.
I came to Paris to find work.

224
00:17:50,612 --> 00:17:53,865
Tell me, has anyone
checked in or out this week?

225
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:57,786
Our guests stay for months,
sometimes years.

226
00:17:57,911 --> 00:18:00,538
Take him.
He's been here three years.

227
00:18:00,664 --> 00:18:03,166
Lucky for him I had a vacancy.

228
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:04,793
A guest left suddenly?

229
00:18:04,918 --> 00:18:06,169
I'll say...

230
00:18:06,294 --> 00:18:07,504
Sudden heart attack.

231
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:10,632
Believe me, that guy's a cop.

232
00:18:10,757 --> 00:18:12,717
I can spot one a mile off.

233
00:18:12,842 --> 00:18:15,470
He's looking everywhere
for the murderer -

234
00:18:15,595 --> 00:18:18,598
in drawers, in the garbage,
even in the inkwell!

235
00:18:19,933 --> 00:18:22,477
Meanwhile, while the cop's searching
for his customer

236
00:18:22,602 --> 00:18:25,480
under a chest of drawers
or behind a wall,

237
00:18:25,605 --> 00:18:27,482
the murderers go to the races...

238
00:18:27,607 --> 00:18:29,192
or play cards...

239
00:18:29,317 --> 00:18:32,445
or dunk croissants in their coffee.

240
00:18:32,946 --> 00:18:35,156
Keep it down.
The walls have ears.

241
00:18:35,282 --> 00:18:37,409
I've got nothing to hide!

242
00:18:37,534 --> 00:18:39,786
If people listened -
- Oh, they do.

243
00:18:39,953 --> 00:18:41,621
And they understand.

244
00:18:41,746 --> 00:18:44,124
May I add
that my unpardonable crime

245
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:46,334
is to be impervious to your charms.

246
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:48,211
Impervious to my charms?

247
00:18:48,336 --> 00:18:49,879
But look at yourself!

248
00:18:50,005 --> 00:18:51,506
Monsieur Hire.

249
00:18:51,631 --> 00:18:53,633
Do you have a moment?

250
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:56,052
Gladly, Monsieur Breteuil.

251
00:19:00,348 --> 00:19:03,810
Insulting a woman minding
her own beeswax and they nab him!

252
00:19:03,977 --> 00:19:05,478
Bet it was him.

253
00:19:05,603 --> 00:19:08,106
Tell me, is your name Hire?

254
00:19:08,648 --> 00:19:10,984
Would you mind leaving us?

255
00:19:11,276 --> 00:19:12,694
All right.

256
00:19:14,821 --> 00:19:17,157
Hire is short for my real name.

257
00:19:17,282 --> 00:19:19,326
Désiré Alphonse Hirovitch.

258
00:19:19,451 --> 00:19:20,785
You're French?

259
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:23,038
Born in Paris, 14th arrondissement.

260
00:19:23,163 --> 00:19:24,664
Lived here for long?

261
00:19:24,873 --> 00:19:26,499
Three years and two months.

262
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:28,209
Profession?

263
00:19:28,335 --> 00:19:29,711
I'm in business.

264
00:19:29,836 --> 00:19:31,838
What kind of business?

265
00:19:32,005 --> 00:19:35,175
I sell hope, like priests.
And cures, like doctors.

266
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:36,134
You see?

267
00:19:36,259 --> 00:19:38,094
I'm asking the questions.

268
00:19:38,636 --> 00:19:40,597
Did you know
this Mademoiselle Noblet?

269
00:19:40,722 --> 00:19:41,848
Vaguely.

270
00:19:41,973 --> 00:19:43,683
Did you ever chat with her?

271
00:19:43,808 --> 00:19:45,852
I never chat with anyone.

272
00:19:45,977 --> 00:19:48,229
Where were you
at the time of the crime?

273
00:19:48,355 --> 00:19:53,193
Pray tell the date and hour
this person was killed.

274
00:19:53,318 --> 00:19:55,320
“Pray tell”!

275
00:19:55,862 --> 00:19:57,614
Friday night,
between 7:00 and 8:00.

276
00:19:57,739 --> 00:20:00,658
That's when I shop
for my dinner.

277
00:20:00,784 --> 00:20:03,453
- Alone?
- I'm always alone.

278
00:20:03,578 --> 00:20:04,537
The camera's yours?

279
00:20:04,662 --> 00:20:07,290
- It's mine.
- What do you do with it?

280
00:20:07,457 --> 00:20:08,875
I take photos.

281
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,668
What kind of photos?

282
00:20:11,002 --> 00:20:12,670
Human documents.

283
00:20:12,796 --> 00:20:14,172
Off the cuff.

284
00:20:14,464 --> 00:20:15,840
Any police record?

285
00:20:15,965 --> 00:20:17,008
Clean.

286
00:20:17,884 --> 00:20:19,469
Got any ID?

287
00:20:19,928 --> 00:20:22,764
I'm French.
I was unaware that -

288
00:20:22,889 --> 00:20:25,725
I mean, that I was obliged
to carry it on me.

289
00:20:25,892 --> 00:20:28,561
I just want to check
the spelling of your name.

290
00:20:28,728 --> 00:20:29,854
Voting card?

291
00:20:29,979 --> 00:20:31,106
I don't vote.

292
00:20:31,272 --> 00:20:32,690
Maybe some mail?

293
00:20:32,816 --> 00:20:34,734
I never receive mail.

294
00:20:35,819 --> 00:20:38,363
Not very sociable, are you?

295
00:20:38,613 --> 00:20:40,448
Meaning what, exactly?

296
00:20:40,573 --> 00:20:44,077
I was perfectly clear.
It appears you have no friends.

297
00:20:44,244 --> 00:20:47,414
I don't like men,
and policemen even less.

298
00:20:47,705 --> 00:20:49,707
Nor women either, so they say.

299
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:50,959
That depends.

300
00:20:51,501 --> 00:20:52,961
What are you writing?

301
00:20:53,086 --> 00:20:54,754
An interesting detail.

302
00:20:54,879 --> 00:20:56,089
Enough dawdling!

303
00:20:56,214 --> 00:20:59,050
Where were you Friday evening
between 7:00 and 8:00?

304
00:21:01,261 --> 00:21:03,179
And you, Monsieur Michelet?

305
00:21:03,304 --> 00:21:05,932
We're buying a wreath
for Mademoiselle Noblet.

306
00:21:06,057 --> 00:21:10,937
It's bad enough being strangled,
but to be buried without flowers...

307
00:21:11,104 --> 00:21:14,107
Care to kick in?
- Put me down for five francs.

308
00:21:14,232 --> 00:21:15,942
Thank you very much.

309
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:19,529
The florist will give us a discount.

310
00:21:19,863 --> 00:21:22,073
Cooking for yourself saves plenty.

311
00:21:22,198 --> 00:21:24,117
I'll show you the best shops.

312
00:21:24,242 --> 00:21:26,202
We girls gotta stick together.

313
00:21:26,327 --> 00:21:28,955
You'll see.
I'm easy to get along with.

314
00:21:29,247 --> 00:21:30,373
Oh, I get it!

315
00:21:30,498 --> 00:21:31,958
Women are all the same.

316
00:21:32,917 --> 00:21:35,128
Tell me, Monsieur Michelet...

317
00:21:35,628 --> 00:21:37,922
do you know that young lady?

318
00:21:38,131 --> 00:21:39,549
Not at all.

319
00:21:39,924 --> 00:21:41,134
Pretty, no?

320
00:21:41,259 --> 00:21:43,845
- You like him?
- Oh, come on.

321
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:48,099
Don't apologize, cutie.
I was like you when I first came here.

322
00:21:48,224 --> 00:21:51,478
He got me with a smile.
I wrote him off.

323
00:21:51,644 --> 00:21:55,148
Watch out, though.
He's got a technique all his own.

324
00:21:55,273 --> 00:21:57,734
First, a bit of flattery.

325
00:21:57,859 --> 00:21:59,736
Second, a drink.

326
00:21:59,986 --> 00:22:02,530
Third, a bit of canoodling,

327
00:22:02,655 --> 00:22:05,116
and before you know it,
you're hooked.

328
00:22:05,241 --> 00:22:07,327
But next day, you're a stranger.

329
00:22:07,452 --> 00:22:08,995
Thanks for the info.

330
00:22:09,162 --> 00:22:11,956
How about something
for the wreath, Marcelle?

331
00:22:12,081 --> 00:22:14,167
Business is slow these days.

332
00:22:14,334 --> 00:22:16,211
I'll give you two francs.

333
00:22:16,336 --> 00:22:18,213
- Thank you.
- Here.

334
00:22:18,338 --> 00:22:19,923
And you, mademoiselle?

335
00:22:20,423 --> 00:22:23,885
You're not from around here.
- She just got here yesterday.

336
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:27,180
I thought so,
or I'd have noticed you sooner.

337
00:22:27,305 --> 00:22:29,349
Here we go with the flattery.

338
00:22:29,474 --> 00:22:30,725
Introduce us.

339
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:33,811
Alfred, alias Fred, or Freddy.

340
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:35,021
Delighted.

341
00:22:35,146 --> 00:22:37,524
No funny stuff.
She's an old friend.

342
00:22:37,649 --> 00:22:39,651
What's your name again?
- Alice.

343
00:22:39,943 --> 00:22:42,904
Raphael, a glass of white
and two Picons with lemon.

344
00:22:43,029 --> 00:22:44,197
Coming up.

345
00:22:44,364 --> 00:22:46,366
- Isn't it strong?
- Smooth.

346
00:22:46,533 --> 00:22:48,409
Trust me, Mademoiselle Alice.

347
00:22:48,535 --> 00:22:52,038
Hey, quit the playacting.
You got here too late.

348
00:22:52,205 --> 00:22:55,041
Let's go to the carnival.
I love the carnival!

349
00:22:55,208 --> 00:22:57,335
My first fella was a lion tamer.

350
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:58,670
His name was Théo.

351
00:22:58,795 --> 00:23:00,380
What was yours called?

352
00:23:00,505 --> 00:23:03,299
- Alfred.
- Like him? What'd he do?

353
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:04,717
- Nothing.
- Nothing?

354
00:23:04,842 --> 00:23:06,886
That name's for losers.

355
00:23:07,011 --> 00:23:08,846
Enough putting me down.

356
00:23:08,972 --> 00:23:11,057
To you, Mademoiselle Alice.
- And to me.

357
00:23:50,054 --> 00:23:52,473
<i>Love, love</i>

358
00:23:52,682 --> 00:23:55,602
<i>The beauty of the world</i>

359
00:24:21,461 --> 00:24:23,296
Where to now?

360
00:24:23,546 --> 00:24:24,422
What's wrong?

361
00:24:24,547 --> 00:24:26,132
I'd like to lose that guy.

362
00:24:26,299 --> 00:24:27,508
Is he pestering you?

363
00:24:27,634 --> 00:24:29,802
Last night he was peeking
in my window.

364
00:24:29,927 --> 00:24:31,346
Lucky him.

365
00:24:31,471 --> 00:24:34,599
This morning he came on to me.
Now he's following me.

366
00:24:34,724 --> 00:24:36,976
Don't mind him. He's nuts.

367
00:24:38,478 --> 00:24:40,938
“Madame Blanche
sees all, tells all...

368
00:24:41,064 --> 00:24:44,484
past, present, tomorrow,
and the future.”

369
00:24:44,609 --> 00:24:47,111
Shall we?
- You want to know the past?

370
00:24:47,236 --> 00:24:48,655
No, “tomorrow and the future.”

371
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:51,658
She'll tell me
what horse to pick tomorrow.

372
00:24:54,243 --> 00:24:57,330
- May I speak in front of the gent?
- Sure.

373
00:24:57,664 --> 00:25:00,875
You've been in a sanatorium,
or a rest home.

374
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,043
No?

375
00:25:02,168 --> 00:25:02,960
In fact...

376
00:25:03,086 --> 00:25:05,922
I don't make it up.
It's in the cards.

377
00:25:06,464 --> 00:25:08,257
This gent with you...

378
00:25:08,508 --> 00:25:10,218
it's true love.

379
00:25:11,678 --> 00:25:12,970
But I see another man.

380
00:25:13,096 --> 00:25:15,765
Educated, dark hair...

381
00:25:16,015 --> 00:25:17,058
Any ideas?

382
00:25:17,183 --> 00:25:18,309
None.

383
00:25:18,434 --> 00:25:19,519
Be careful.

384
00:25:20,186 --> 00:25:22,271
I see trouble, complications...

385
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:25,441
over a small inheritance.

386
00:25:26,484 --> 00:25:28,444
Will I get married?

387
00:25:30,363 --> 00:25:33,199
The dark-haired gentleman again.
Tell me...

388
00:25:33,574 --> 00:25:35,868
is anyone in your family "I?

389
00:25:35,993 --> 00:25:37,078
I don't think so.

390
00:25:37,203 --> 00:25:38,538
Someone dying.

391
00:25:41,374 --> 00:25:44,210
Someone close to you.
Not him.

392
00:25:44,544 --> 00:25:46,212
Someone older.

393
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,340
Take my advice.

394
00:25:49,716 --> 00:25:51,217
Stay clear of boats.

395
00:25:51,634 --> 00:25:53,636
As for marriage...

396
00:25:55,388 --> 00:25:57,473
not for a while yet.

397
00:25:58,349 --> 00:25:59,892
Show me your hand.

398
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,397
Your lucky number is eight.

399
00:26:04,522 --> 00:26:06,649
And your stone is the ruby.

400
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,277
Beware of gossip...

401
00:26:09,402 --> 00:26:11,654
and of October.

402
00:26:12,697 --> 00:26:14,407
That'll be 20 francs.

403
00:26:20,371 --> 00:26:22,081
- Go out.
- What?

404
00:26:22,290 --> 00:26:23,624
Go on!

405
00:26:25,918 --> 00:26:27,795
Thanks very much.

406
00:26:29,046 --> 00:26:31,549
So who's this educated gent?

407
00:26:32,008 --> 00:26:33,593
Ah, well...

408
00:26:34,343 --> 00:26:35,428
Him again!

409
00:26:35,553 --> 00:26:36,846
I'll punch him out.

410
00:26:36,971 --> 00:26:38,723
Don't make a scene.

411
00:26:39,056 --> 00:26:40,224
All right.

412
00:26:40,349 --> 00:26:42,101
Let's try the bumper cars.

413
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:44,937
If he follows us,
we'll have some fun.

414
00:27:28,648 --> 00:27:30,733
Look at the old man, all alone!

415
00:27:42,495 --> 00:27:45,331
Look, the bearded guy's
really getting it!

416
00:27:45,998 --> 00:27:48,125
That guy over there!

417
00:27:57,802 --> 00:27:59,470
Get him!

418
00:28:23,035 --> 00:28:26,539
Ever been in a hunting party?

419
00:28:26,914 --> 00:28:29,458
I shoot partridge in October
with my brother-in-law.

420
00:28:29,584 --> 00:28:32,378
No, I mean a real hunt,
with hounds.

421
00:29:02,825 --> 00:29:05,328
See, your bogeyman's gone.

422
00:29:05,494 --> 00:29:07,163
Let's go watch the lady wrestlers.

423
00:29:07,288 --> 00:29:08,706
No, not tonight.

424
00:29:08,831 --> 00:29:11,584
- Leaving me again?
- Of course not!

425
00:29:11,834 --> 00:29:14,587
- Shall we go back together?
- No, I'll go first.

426
00:29:14,754 --> 00:29:17,590
Make sure no one sees you.
Scratch at my door.

427
00:29:17,757 --> 00:29:20,426
Don't go to the wrong room.
It's number 12.

428
00:29:20,593 --> 00:29:22,178
I'll wait five minutes.

429
00:29:22,303 --> 00:29:24,972
But I'm already scratching
at your door.

430
00:29:25,097 --> 00:29:26,766
I can already hear you.

431
00:29:30,436 --> 00:29:31,479
Mademoiselle...

432
00:29:31,604 --> 00:29:32,730
You again!

433
00:29:32,855 --> 00:29:34,690
Sorry for accosting you today,

434
00:29:34,815 --> 00:29:37,318
and mumbling things
you couldn't comprehend,

435
00:29:37,443 --> 00:29:39,111
but you must know -

436
00:29:39,278 --> 00:29:41,447
- You're wasting your time.
- Perhaps when -

437
00:29:41,572 --> 00:29:42,990
Stop or I'll call the police!

438
00:29:43,115 --> 00:29:45,493
Even if it's about your friend Alfred?

439
00:29:45,785 --> 00:29:46,786
Meaning what?

440
00:29:46,911 --> 00:29:48,871
Youth pursues youth.

441
00:29:49,121 --> 00:29:51,457
The world's full of stupid laws.

442
00:29:51,624 --> 00:29:53,459
Water flows to the river, sand...

443
00:29:53,584 --> 00:29:55,086
What's Alfred to you?

444
00:29:55,252 --> 00:29:58,464
Nothing, but I know
you're interested in him.

445
00:29:58,839 --> 00:30:00,967
When you see him tomorrow,

446
00:30:01,133 --> 00:30:03,803
ask him where he hid
Mademoiselle Noblet's purse.

447
00:30:04,136 --> 00:30:06,097
Mademoiselle Noblet's purse?

448
00:30:06,222 --> 00:30:08,307
The one containing 7,000 francs.

449
00:30:08,766 --> 00:30:13,145
You don't need a fortune teller
to know the future.

450
00:30:13,562 --> 00:30:16,691
Try someone serious,
my good friend Dr. Varga.

451
00:30:16,816 --> 00:30:18,651
Here's his address.

452
00:30:19,485 --> 00:30:22,989
For if sand needs water,
youth needs advice.

453
00:30:23,823 --> 00:30:25,533
Good night, mademoiselle.

454
00:31:08,242 --> 00:31:11,454
Didn't you hear me?
I scratched several times.

455
00:31:11,954 --> 00:31:14,040
- Don't show yourself.
- What's up?

456
00:31:14,206 --> 00:31:16,834
- He's at his window.
- Draw the curtains.

457
00:31:16,959 --> 00:31:20,004
- But he'll see your silhouette.
- So what?

458
00:31:20,212 --> 00:31:21,714
You're free, at home.

459
00:31:21,881 --> 00:31:23,758
Better to be careful.

460
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:28,512
Did he buttonhole you?

461
00:31:30,389 --> 00:31:31,640
Tell me.

462
00:31:32,558 --> 00:31:34,852
I left you full of passion.

463
00:31:34,977 --> 00:31:37,063
Now you're cold as ice.

464
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:39,982
What did he say?
- Nothing...

465
00:31:40,107 --> 00:31:43,819
So how come you didn't hear me
scratch three times?

466
00:31:45,571 --> 00:31:48,282
- You'll be angry if I tell you.
- Goon

467
00:31:48,574 --> 00:31:50,034
Well...

468
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:51,911
I felt cold.

469
00:31:53,079 --> 00:31:56,123
I only have a summer dress
and my raincoat.

470
00:31:58,292 --> 00:32:02,088
I know it's silly
to bother you with this, but...

471
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,590
I know of a good buy.

472
00:32:05,091 --> 00:32:07,885
A coat with a fur collar.

473
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:11,347
3,000 francs.
Can you lend it to me?

474
00:32:11,472 --> 00:32:13,265
3,000 francs!

475
00:32:13,432 --> 00:32:15,434
But Li", I don't have it.

476
00:32:16,102 --> 00:32:17,728
No savings?

477
00:32:17,853 --> 00:32:20,731
I'm not the type
to stash money away.

478
00:32:21,690 --> 00:32:23,859
But you said you got a good job.

479
00:32:23,984 --> 00:32:25,319
Only a month ago.

480
00:32:25,444 --> 00:32:28,364
Can't your friends lend it to you?

481
00:32:28,572 --> 00:32:30,991
It frightens me to be so cold.

482
00:32:31,117 --> 00:32:34,662
Poor Lili,
I feel really bad saying no, but -

483
00:32:34,912 --> 00:32:38,040
If I'd known you were coming so soon,
I'd have made plans.

484
00:32:38,165 --> 00:32:39,917
Know how much I've got?

485
00:32:40,751 --> 00:32:42,336
300 francs.

486
00:32:42,628 --> 00:32:43,796
That's all.

487
00:32:43,963 --> 00:32:46,132
- I love you!
- What?

488
00:32:46,257 --> 00:32:49,468
You wouldn't understand,
but I love you!

489
00:32:50,803 --> 00:32:52,179
Come.

490
00:32:52,638 --> 00:32:55,266
Why hide like rats?

491
00:32:56,142 --> 00:32:57,101
Come here.

492
00:32:57,268 --> 00:32:59,812
His lights are out,
but I feel his presence.

493
00:32:59,937 --> 00:33:01,564
Take me in your arms.

494
00:33:01,689 --> 00:33:03,524
Hold me tight!

495
00:33:03,649 --> 00:33:07,486
Remember the dark-haired man
who wants to harm us?

496
00:33:07,736 --> 00:33:08,988
It's him.

497
00:33:09,155 --> 00:33:11,240
Believe me, he's a real bastard.

498
00:33:11,365 --> 00:33:13,534
We've got nothing to hide.

499
00:33:13,659 --> 00:33:16,662
I want him to see me in your arms.

500
00:33:52,114 --> 00:33:53,407
You okay?

501
00:33:53,574 --> 00:33:55,242
Never felt better.

502
00:33:57,244 --> 00:33:58,996
Give me the cigarettes.

503
00:33:59,121 --> 00:34:00,706
Don't move.

504
00:34:14,678 --> 00:34:16,513
Know what I was thinking?

505
00:34:16,889 --> 00:34:18,224
Go on.

506
00:34:18,682 --> 00:34:22,353
I slept on a hard bed
with a straw mattress.

507
00:34:22,811 --> 00:34:25,564
I heard the women guards
prowling the corridors.

508
00:34:25,814 --> 00:34:28,234
The echo was blood-chilling.

509
00:34:29,318 --> 00:34:32,029
But I wouldn't have
changed places with anybody,

510
00:34:32,196 --> 00:34:34,198
knowing we'd be together.

511
00:34:34,323 --> 00:34:36,700
- You never resented me?
- Never.

512
00:34:40,704 --> 00:34:43,207
That coat with the fur collar...

513
00:34:45,417 --> 00:34:47,586
you can buy it, understand?

514
00:34:50,422 --> 00:34:53,842
I can't hold on to money
when you're shivering.

515
00:34:55,135 --> 00:34:58,597
I've got 7,000 francs
sewn into my mattress.

516
00:34:59,265 --> 00:35:01,475
It was Mademoiselle Noblet's.

517
00:35:01,850 --> 00:35:03,936
I'm the one who killed her.

518
00:35:04,937 --> 00:35:06,605
I wasn't expecting you.

519
00:35:07,356 --> 00:35:11,402
When I saw you walk in,
I thought it was just bad timing.

520
00:35:11,694 --> 00:35:13,570
Now I don't regret it.

521
00:35:13,696 --> 00:35:16,115
You deserve a whole new wardrobe.

522
00:35:16,949 --> 00:35:19,368
Mademoiselle Noblet was useless.

523
00:35:19,493 --> 00:35:22,788
She just went to heaven early.
80 what?

524
00:35:23,414 --> 00:35:25,082
You'll be warm now.

525
00:35:25,416 --> 00:35:27,042
Don't worry. No one knows.

526
00:35:27,167 --> 00:35:29,461
I was seeing her on the sly.

527
00:35:29,628 --> 00:35:31,630
Don't be jealous. She was ugly.

528
00:35:31,797 --> 00:35:34,800
Prying 100 francs out of her
was tough work.

529
00:35:35,009 --> 00:35:36,635
Night had fallen.

530
00:35:37,636 --> 00:35:41,598
She wouldn't give me 1,000 francs,
so I shoved her into the lot.

531
00:35:41,807 --> 00:35:45,853
She struggled a bit
and broke her watch when she fell.

532
00:35:46,061 --> 00:35:49,982
I set the hands back 30 minutes
and went to play cards in the café.

533
00:35:50,149 --> 00:35:52,067
It's a watertight alibi.

534
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:54,403
The police are baffled.

535
00:35:54,528 --> 00:35:58,741
When they don't find anything,
they'll close the case.

536
00:36:00,576 --> 00:36:03,912
Then we can move on,
and you'll have whatever you want.

537
00:36:04,038 --> 00:36:05,622
Sounds good, right?

538
00:36:05,998 --> 00:36:07,499
You scared?

539
00:36:07,791 --> 00:36:10,336
Like I said, no one knows.
No one!

540
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:23,599
TO MADEMOISELLE NOBLET
FROM HER NEIGHBORHOOD

541
00:36:23,724 --> 00:36:26,560
<i>Good It speaks volumes..</i>

542
00:36:26,685 --> 00:36:29,021
And we didn't cut corners.

543
00:36:29,188 --> 00:36:31,273
Monsieur Alfred,
straight from the heart.

544
00:36:31,398 --> 00:36:34,026
- We owe it to her.
- We're out of pocket.

545
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:37,363
Not every day
we have a nice funeral.

546
00:36:37,488 --> 00:36:39,656
Arthur, you'll miss the procession.

547
00:36:39,782 --> 00:36:41,950
Just watching Monsieur Hire.

548
00:36:42,076 --> 00:36:44,328
You'd think he'd act normal for once.

549
00:36:44,536 --> 00:36:47,289
While everyone's at the funeral,
he's at the bus stop.

550
00:36:47,498 --> 00:36:50,250
People say
he gives them the creeps.

551
00:36:50,542 --> 00:36:54,338
Others aren't that charitable.
- No gossiping at work.

552
00:36:54,463 --> 00:36:56,757
My black gloves?
- In your pocket.

553
00:36:56,882 --> 00:37:00,677
I'll have it delivered.
- No need. I'll take care of it.

554
00:37:01,345 --> 00:37:03,889
- We'll go together.
- Fine.

555
00:37:04,056 --> 00:37:05,933
Now where are my calling cards?

556
00:37:06,058 --> 00:37:07,810
Your other pocket.

557
00:37:07,935 --> 00:37:10,562
He'd forget the coffin
at his own funeral.

558
00:37:10,687 --> 00:37:12,981
You go first, Monsieur Alfred.

559
00:38:09,371 --> 00:38:11,081
There you go, Raphael!

560
00:38:13,917 --> 00:38:17,212
Excuse me, mademoiselle.
I'm the assistant inspector.

561
00:38:17,337 --> 00:38:19,923
I've got a summons
for you on my desk.

562
00:38:20,215 --> 00:38:22,176
I arrived the day after the murder.

563
00:38:22,301 --> 00:38:23,427
Yes, I know.

564
00:38:23,552 --> 00:38:25,471
I also know where you came from.

565
00:38:25,596 --> 00:38:28,223
And why you were there.
I've got your dossier.

566
00:38:28,348 --> 00:38:29,975
What more can I tell you?

567
00:38:30,142 --> 00:38:30,976
Who knows?

568
00:38:31,226 --> 00:38:35,063
You were innocent in that robbery,
covering up for someone?

569
00:38:35,189 --> 00:38:36,899
Ask the judge.

570
00:38:37,024 --> 00:38:40,068
It doesn't matter now.
The case is closed.

571
00:38:40,777 --> 00:38:42,654
So why the summons?

572
00:38:43,238 --> 00:38:46,366
When you were released,
you promised to help us.

573
00:38:46,492 --> 00:38:48,494
A pretty girl gets around.

574
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:53,499
So if you ever hear anything,
let us know.

575
00:38:53,749 --> 00:38:55,626
You'll always be welcome.

576
00:38:55,918 --> 00:38:58,253
Good-bye. Good luck.

577
00:39:18,524 --> 00:39:20,526
WORRIED ABOUT THE FUTURE?

578
00:39:20,692 --> 00:39:22,653
DOUBT YOURSELF OR OTHERS?

579
00:39:22,778 --> 00:39:24,863
LOST THE JOY OF LIFE?

580
00:39:25,155 --> 00:39:27,866
CONSULT DR. VARGA

581
00:39:43,715 --> 00:39:45,884
Dr. Varga, please.

582
00:39:47,219 --> 00:39:49,054
Dr. Varga, please!

583
00:39:49,263 --> 00:39:50,973
Second floor on the left!

584
00:40:21,169 --> 00:40:22,921
I should have known.

585
00:40:23,213 --> 00:40:24,840
You're very welcome.

586
00:40:25,090 --> 00:40:26,592
Come in.

587
00:40:33,432 --> 00:40:35,350
Strange place you have.

588
00:40:36,226 --> 00:40:38,937
And this ball, what's it for?

589
00:40:39,521 --> 00:40:42,941
Are you here to see
Dr. Varga or Monsieur Hire?

590
00:40:43,191 --> 00:40:45,235
I've never met Dr. Varga.

591
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:47,654
And I hardly know Monsieur Hire.

592
00:40:49,323 --> 00:40:54,786
Dr. Varga can tell you curious things
about your past and future.

593
00:40:55,037 --> 00:40:58,957
Could Monsieur Hire tell me where
he gets these stories he makes up?

594
00:40:59,082 --> 00:41:00,375
Makes up?

595
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:03,795
To amuse young ladies
or to frighten them?

596
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:05,631
What was it you told me?

597
00:41:05,756 --> 00:41:06,757
To be careful.

598
00:41:06,882 --> 00:41:08,383
Of Alfred?

599
00:41:09,259 --> 00:41:10,636
Why?

600
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:14,139
Do you know him?

601
00:41:16,725 --> 00:41:19,144
Today you're speechless?

602
00:41:24,983 --> 00:41:27,694
Sorry for being abrupt yesterday.

603
00:41:28,236 --> 00:41:30,405
You were joking, right?

604
00:41:30,906 --> 00:41:33,533
I've worked out your horoscope.

605
00:41:34,493 --> 00:41:37,996
See these lines, these curves,
these intersections?

606
00:41:38,163 --> 00:41:40,123
Those are the stages of your life,

607
00:41:40,248 --> 00:41:43,877
a series of milestones
that reveal everything.

608
00:41:44,586 --> 00:41:46,588
You know nothing about me.

609
00:41:46,713 --> 00:41:49,257
Born August 8, 1912, in Paris.

610
00:41:49,883 --> 00:41:53,178
That's no magic.
I saw the hotel register...

611
00:41:53,553 --> 00:41:56,682
while a policeman bombarded me
with stupid questions.

612
00:41:56,848 --> 00:41:58,850
What time were you born?

613
00:41:59,184 --> 00:42:03,438
So you can make up more stories
about the guy I met two days ago?

614
00:42:04,231 --> 00:42:05,649
Two days ago?

615
00:42:07,401 --> 00:42:09,945
Your parents abandoned you, right?

616
00:42:10,112 --> 00:42:14,449
A miserable childhood
with a poor relative, whom you left.

617
00:42:14,741 --> 00:42:17,953
Now it gets interesting.
See this conjunction of stars?

618
00:42:18,078 --> 00:42:19,621
It's very rare.

619
00:42:19,746 --> 00:42:23,625
One man, only one, in your life
for the past three years.

620
00:42:25,085 --> 00:42:27,045
So here we are.

621
00:42:28,088 --> 00:42:30,465
And what kind of man?

622
00:42:30,966 --> 00:42:33,176
A clerk? An artist?

623
00:42:33,552 --> 00:42:35,387
A bad boy?

624
00:42:35,721 --> 00:42:37,431
Maybe a criminal?

625
00:42:37,556 --> 00:42:40,267
On that,
Dr. Varga can't enlighten you.

626
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:42,436
What about Monsieur Hire?

627
00:42:43,061 --> 00:42:45,439
You're not interested
in Monsieur Hire.

628
00:42:45,564 --> 00:42:49,985
Last night Monsieur Hire talked to me
about Mademoiselle Noblet's purse.

629
00:42:50,110 --> 00:42:51,570
What was he getting at?

630
00:42:51,820 --> 00:42:54,114
Why ask me about that affair?

631
00:42:54,322 --> 00:42:57,284
Monsieur Alfred already told you
all the details.

632
00:42:57,576 --> 00:42:59,870
Look at me, my child.

633
00:42:59,995 --> 00:43:02,664
You know
as much as I do about that.

634
00:43:03,123 --> 00:43:04,750
Yes, it's true.

635
00:43:05,333 --> 00:43:08,378
For three years
he's taken advantage of me.

636
00:43:09,254 --> 00:43:11,506
He's a thief, a cheat.

637
00:43:12,007 --> 00:43:14,259
Yes, he's a murderer.

638
00:43:15,302 --> 00:43:18,180
Because of him, I went to prison.

639
00:43:19,055 --> 00:43:22,100
Because of him, I may go back.

640
00:43:22,350 --> 00:43:25,145
I'm giving you terrible weapons
to use against me.

641
00:43:25,270 --> 00:43:27,272
But I feel I can trust you.

642
00:43:27,397 --> 00:43:28,315
Help me.

643
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:31,693
If you don't, I'm done for.
What should I do?

644
00:43:31,902 --> 00:43:34,404
To lose Alfred or to save him?

645
00:43:34,946 --> 00:43:37,407
No one ever cared about me.

646
00:43:37,616 --> 00:43:40,243
It's true.
I had an awful childhood.

647
00:43:40,410 --> 00:43:43,288
When I ran away,
the only one I found was Alfred.

648
00:43:43,413 --> 00:43:44,915
I didn't know.

649
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:47,793
I've never met anyone
who was strong and kind.

650
00:43:48,627 --> 00:43:50,921
It's easy to get rid of Alfred.

651
00:43:51,046 --> 00:43:53,423
One letter to the police
and they'll lock him up.

652
00:43:54,299 --> 00:43:55,634
But they'll need proof.

653
00:43:56,301 --> 00:43:57,302
I have it.

654
00:43:59,471 --> 00:44:02,224
Absolutely real proof?

655
00:44:02,891 --> 00:44:04,309
Irrefutable.

656
00:44:05,644 --> 00:44:07,229
What is it?

657
00:44:10,565 --> 00:44:11,900
Trust me.

658
00:44:13,151 --> 00:44:15,821
So, this letter...
- To the police?

659
00:44:15,987 --> 00:44:17,364
No, don't do it.

660
00:44:17,489 --> 00:44:19,866
Not me. How could I?

661
00:44:19,991 --> 00:44:21,827
To get rid of a rival?

662
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:25,413
My child, my ideas
about the world and our society

663
00:44:25,539 --> 00:44:28,083
prevent me
from taking such measures.

664
00:44:28,333 --> 00:44:31,294
But you're being threatened.
You have a right to do it.

665
00:44:31,419 --> 00:44:32,838
I can't.

666
00:44:32,963 --> 00:44:36,174
He made me an accomplice
to have a hold on me.

667
00:44:36,299 --> 00:44:38,593
You'd be turning me in as well.

668
00:44:38,718 --> 00:44:41,346
Then you want to save him again.

669
00:44:41,596 --> 00:44:43,431
No, I'm thinking of myself.

670
00:44:43,682 --> 00:44:45,684
And that's to his advantage.

671
00:44:45,851 --> 00:44:48,937
I don't want to see him anymore.
He's polite in public...

672
00:44:49,062 --> 00:44:51,481
then for no reason at all,
he gets violent.

673
00:44:51,606 --> 00:44:52,732
Here.

674
00:44:52,858 --> 00:44:54,025
Look.

675
00:44:54,150 --> 00:44:59,030
Look at the bruises on my shoulders.
- Dr. Varga takes your word for it.

676
00:44:59,197 --> 00:45:02,367
And Monsieur Hire doesn't need
any proof of your beauty.

677
00:45:03,034 --> 00:45:04,703
Yes, you're beautiful.

678
00:45:05,412 --> 00:45:09,249
Last night at my window,
I suddenly felt unhappy.

679
00:45:09,708 --> 00:45:13,211
Now something has happened
that fills me with great hope.

680
00:45:14,254 --> 00:45:17,716
Hope's a strange word on my lips,
and yet it's true.

681
00:45:17,883 --> 00:45:19,509
Now listen to me.

682
00:45:19,634 --> 00:45:21,386
You're in danger!

683
00:45:21,678 --> 00:45:23,471
That's all that matters.

684
00:45:24,264 --> 00:45:26,057
Go back to your place.

685
00:45:26,349 --> 00:45:28,894
Stay away from Alfred
as much as you can.

686
00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:32,898
I wish I could take you away
from all this right now.

687
00:45:33,148 --> 00:45:35,483
What would the police inspector think?

688
00:45:35,650 --> 00:45:39,237
And the neighbors already accuse me
of so many transgressions.

689
00:45:39,404 --> 00:45:40,989
I'm afraid for you!

690
00:45:41,114 --> 00:45:42,741
I tremble for you.

691
00:45:42,908 --> 00:45:46,119
Promise me you'll be alone tonight.

692
00:45:46,620 --> 00:45:49,581
I'll keep an eye on you
from my window.

693
00:45:51,082 --> 00:45:52,626
I promise.

694
00:46:01,468 --> 00:46:03,553
Thank you so much.

695
00:47:09,494 --> 00:47:12,080
- So he's Varga?
- Of course.

696
00:47:12,706 --> 00:47:14,332
- He knows something?
- Everything.

697
00:47:15,875 --> 00:47:17,460
What did he say?

698
00:47:17,711 --> 00:47:20,046
He's trickier than we thought.

699
00:47:20,672 --> 00:47:21,923
He has proof?

700
00:47:22,048 --> 00:47:23,258
Definitely.

701
00:47:23,383 --> 00:47:25,093
But who knows what?

702
00:47:25,468 --> 00:47:28,555
I tried everything: charm, promises.

703
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:29,889
He wants to blackmail you.

704
00:47:30,015 --> 00:47:31,307
I don't think so.

705
00:47:31,433 --> 00:47:34,352
For now, he's generous,
full of noble sentiments.

706
00:47:34,519 --> 00:47:37,355
But if he gets upset,
he might spill the beans.

707
00:47:39,566 --> 00:47:41,443
What's his place like?

708
00:47:41,568 --> 00:47:45,572
Across the courtyard,
second floor.

709
00:47:46,239 --> 00:47:49,909
No concierge,
just a noisy carpentry shop.

710
00:48:03,673 --> 00:48:05,925
<i>Good-bye, Doctor..</i>

711
00:48:11,473 --> 00:48:14,476
If it's all right, Doctor,
I'll send some friends over.

712
00:48:14,601 --> 00:48:17,228
Neglected, misunderstood women.
There are so many.

713
00:48:17,395 --> 00:48:19,981
They don't dare come by,
but I'll encourage them.

714
00:48:20,106 --> 00:48:21,191
Many thanks.

715
00:48:21,316 --> 00:48:23,151
I thank you.

716
00:48:27,864 --> 00:48:29,532
Well...

717
00:48:29,657 --> 00:48:33,328
you didn't come here
just to stand outside my door.

718
00:48:33,536 --> 00:48:35,246
Come in.

719
00:48:59,854 --> 00:49:03,399
Did you beat her up
to get my address?

720
00:49:04,901 --> 00:49:07,112
Threaten her with something?

721
00:49:10,406 --> 00:49:13,368
Your explanation is welcome,
so let's have it.

722
00:49:13,493 --> 00:49:15,620
I'm listening.
Tell me everything.

723
00:49:17,580 --> 00:49:19,249
Nothing to say?

724
00:49:20,041 --> 00:49:23,503
Perhaps you have something
to do with your hands?

725
00:49:24,045 --> 00:49:25,964
Like with Mademoiselle Noblet?

726
00:49:26,089 --> 00:49:27,549
With a knife?

727
00:49:27,674 --> 00:49:29,342
With a revolver?

728
00:49:29,592 --> 00:49:31,427
Careful. That'll be noisy.

729
00:49:31,636 --> 00:49:34,389
And after I bleed on the carpet,
what about my corpse?

730
00:49:34,514 --> 00:49:38,393
Did you bring a sack or a suitcase
to carry me away?

731
00:49:39,018 --> 00:49:40,937
You lack foresight, young man!

732
00:49:41,062 --> 00:49:42,897
And you're pale.

733
00:49:43,398 --> 00:49:44,983
Deathly pale.

734
00:49:45,733 --> 00:49:48,236
Care for a glass of water
with a sugar cube?

735
00:49:48,361 --> 00:49:50,655
Or do you want some advice?

736
00:49:50,989 --> 00:49:54,617
If you dispose of me,
in the stairwell or elsewhere,

737
00:49:54,909 --> 00:49:57,370
I warn you:
I've taken some precautions.

738
00:49:57,662 --> 00:50:01,332
The next day, a letter will reach
the necessary people.

739
00:50:01,541 --> 00:50:03,501
It will spell capital trouble for you.

740
00:50:03,626 --> 00:50:04,961
“Capital.”

741
00:50:05,086 --> 00:50:07,005
Get my little joke?

742
00:50:07,130 --> 00:50:09,299
But you're in no joking mood.

743
00:50:09,465 --> 00:50:10,758
You're hesitating.

744
00:50:11,301 --> 00:50:13,011
Should I or shouldn't I?

745
00:50:13,678 --> 00:50:16,681
Careful. Mademoiselle Noblet
was anemic and powerless.

746
00:50:16,848 --> 00:50:19,142
But I'm as solid as an oak.

747
00:50:19,350 --> 00:50:20,852
It would be easy to throw you

748
00:50:21,019 --> 00:50:23,521
down the stairwell
by the scruff of your neck.

749
00:50:24,355 --> 00:50:25,565
I pity you.

750
00:50:25,690 --> 00:50:30,195
Looking at you and wondering how
this finely dressed man

751
00:50:30,612 --> 00:50:32,864
is adored by the woman I love,

752
00:50:33,031 --> 00:50:35,116
I can't take you seriously.

753
00:50:35,617 --> 00:50:39,370
No force, no vision, no guts.

754
00:50:40,288 --> 00:50:41,998
You're sickening.

755
00:50:42,332 --> 00:50:44,334
Has no one ever told you that?

756
00:50:44,709 --> 00:50:50,048
Seeing you here is becoming
aesthetically unbearable.

757
00:50:50,965 --> 00:50:53,176
I must ask you to clear out.

758
00:50:53,301 --> 00:50:55,470
If you don't leave here immediately,

759
00:50:55,595 --> 00:50:58,514
an unexpected tragedy
is going to happen.

760
00:51:08,858 --> 00:51:10,151
Moron!

761
00:51:11,152 --> 00:51:12,570
You little punk!

762
00:51:13,321 --> 00:51:14,906
You dared do it!

763
00:51:15,448 --> 00:51:18,243
You're pathetic.
Go on, pick up the knife.

764
00:51:18,660 --> 00:51:22,914
Should you harm a single hair
on her head, here's a warning!

765
00:51:23,039 --> 00:51:25,917
For her! For me! For Noblet!

766
00:51:26,459 --> 00:51:28,002
Now beat it!

767
00:52:08,126 --> 00:52:09,502
Waiter?

768
00:52:10,044 --> 00:52:11,587
Waiter?

769
00:52:29,689 --> 00:52:32,066
- Three lagers.
- Coming.

770
00:52:44,746 --> 00:52:46,456
Straighten your tie.

771
00:52:46,581 --> 00:52:47,582
So?

772
00:52:47,707 --> 00:52:50,626
Nothing happened.
It was a mistake going there.

773
00:52:50,752 --> 00:52:53,713
As soon as you left, I knew it.
I couldn't breathe.

774
00:52:53,838 --> 00:52:54,839
Tell me -

775
00:52:54,964 --> 00:52:56,299
What Will it be?

776
00:52:56,758 --> 00:52:59,010
- I don't care.
- Neither do I.

777
00:52:59,177 --> 00:53:00,636
A beer.

778
00:53:01,429 --> 00:53:02,722
Well?

779
00:53:02,847 --> 00:53:04,682
We had it out.

780
00:53:04,807 --> 00:53:06,392
It was pointless.

781
00:53:06,517 --> 00:53:09,187
He's clever
at not giving anything away.

782
00:53:09,354 --> 00:53:12,357
He'll keep quiet if he thinks
he has a chance with you.

783
00:53:12,482 --> 00:53:15,860
I can lead him on for a while,
but we need something else.

784
00:53:16,027 --> 00:53:18,446
- Lager or brown ale?
- Lager.

785
00:53:22,283 --> 00:53:26,454
What's he know?
Suppose he saw me and he talks.

786
00:53:27,080 --> 00:53:31,000
Who's accusing us?
A guy nobody can stand.

787
00:53:31,125 --> 00:53:32,710
We'll be patient.

788
00:53:32,877 --> 00:53:35,713
I'll lie low
while you make a play for him.

789
00:53:35,838 --> 00:53:38,758
Tongues will wag.
We'll help them along.

790
00:53:38,883 --> 00:53:41,511
But he says
he has proof against you.

791
00:53:41,636 --> 00:53:43,262
We need proof against him.

792
00:53:43,388 --> 00:53:44,472
But what?

793
00:53:51,646 --> 00:53:55,441
I took the cash
and hid the purse behind the fence.

794
00:53:56,901 --> 00:53:58,820
Careful of the carnies.

795
00:54:24,512 --> 00:54:26,055
Should be around here.

796
00:54:26,180 --> 00:54:27,723
Lie down there.

797
00:54:37,316 --> 00:54:39,277
Should be here somewhere.

798
00:54:43,573 --> 00:54:45,032
Got it.

799
00:54:48,077 --> 00:54:50,079
What should I do with it?

800
00:54:52,457 --> 00:54:54,333
If I'm caught with it -

801
00:54:54,459 --> 00:54:56,210
Give it to me.

802
00:54:56,794 --> 00:55:00,381
I won't keep it long.
I'll plant it in his room.

803
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:13,978
Who is it?

804
00:55:14,103 --> 00:55:15,897
<i>It's me, Alice..</i>

805
00:55:16,022 --> 00:55:18,483
<i>I need to speak to you right away.</i>

806
00:55:19,317 --> 00:55:20,985
Forgive me.

807
00:55:22,653 --> 00:55:24,697
I wasn't expecting anyone.

808
00:55:29,118 --> 00:55:30,411
Good evening.

809
00:55:30,536 --> 00:55:31,662
May I come in?

810
00:55:31,787 --> 00:55:34,373
Not now. The place is a mess.

811
00:55:34,749 --> 00:55:36,959
I've got to talk to you.

812
00:55:37,084 --> 00:55:39,295
Kick me out when you get sleepy.

813
00:55:39,420 --> 00:55:40,838
Some other time.

814
00:55:40,963 --> 00:55:42,673
I'd be embarrassed.

815
00:55:42,798 --> 00:55:44,592
I came by to apologize.

816
00:55:45,343 --> 00:55:47,929
He beat me to make me talk.

817
00:55:48,179 --> 00:55:50,348
I had to tell him your address.

818
00:55:50,556 --> 00:55:52,308
I thought as much.

819
00:55:53,017 --> 00:55:57,396
I'm afraid to go to bed in my room.
I only feel safe in your place.

820
00:55:57,813 --> 00:55:59,524
And you won't have me.

821
00:55:59,649 --> 00:56:03,611
Don't say that.
But tonight's out of the question.

822
00:56:04,028 --> 00:56:05,988
I'll take you back to your room

823
00:56:06,113 --> 00:56:08,324
and spend the night on a chair
in front of your door.

824
00:56:08,449 --> 00:56:10,368
No, forgive me.

825
00:56:10,535 --> 00:56:13,371
I was nervous.
It isn't worth it.

826
00:56:14,330 --> 00:56:17,291
If anything happens,
I'll call you through the window.

827
00:56:17,416 --> 00:56:18,960
Nothing's going to happen.

828
00:56:19,085 --> 00:56:20,378
Good night.

829
00:56:20,878 --> 00:56:21,963
Alice...

830
00:56:22,088 --> 00:56:23,673
May I call you Alice?

831
00:56:23,798 --> 00:56:24,966
Sure.

832
00:56:25,091 --> 00:56:27,134
I want tomorrow to be special.

833
00:56:27,301 --> 00:56:32,181
I'll show you a place I want you to see.
Then you won't be scared anymore.

834
00:56:32,306 --> 00:56:33,766
Will you come?

835
00:56:34,350 --> 00:56:36,018
You're so sweet.

836
00:56:36,352 --> 00:56:37,895
Tomorrow at 2:00...

837
00:56:38,020 --> 00:56:40,231
by the bookstalls
in front of the Institute?

838
00:56:40,398 --> 00:56:41,732
All right.

839
00:56:41,899 --> 00:56:43,401
Till tomorrow.

840
00:56:57,999 --> 00:56:59,166
Am I late?

841
00:56:59,292 --> 00:57:00,585
Forgive me.

842
00:57:00,710 --> 00:57:04,046
I got here early
to enjoy waiting for you.

843
00:57:04,338 --> 00:57:06,716
Shall we?
- Where are we going?

844
00:57:06,841 --> 00:57:08,092
Just outside the city.

845
00:57:08,259 --> 00:57:09,552
Shall we take a taxi?

846
00:57:09,677 --> 00:57:12,471
- Like lovers do?
- Like lovers do.

847
00:57:13,222 --> 00:57:14,390
Taxi!

848
00:57:27,945 --> 00:57:29,530
Wait here.

849
00:57:31,449 --> 00:57:34,118
- We're here?
- Yes, this is it.

850
00:57:34,577 --> 00:57:36,704
It's known as Wolves Island.

851
00:57:45,921 --> 00:57:49,133
- What's that creepy house?
- That's where I'm taking you.

852
00:57:49,258 --> 00:57:49,967
Come.

853
00:58:03,481 --> 00:58:05,107
So how do you know?

854
00:58:05,232 --> 00:58:07,193
This is strictly between us.

855
00:58:07,568 --> 00:58:11,030
The police don't care,
so I called on Dr. Varga myself.

856
00:58:11,364 --> 00:58:13,199
Books everywhere...

857
00:58:13,783 --> 00:58:15,493
with strange titles.

858
00:58:16,077 --> 00:58:18,454
Some contraption to hypnotize you.

859
00:58:18,663 --> 00:58:20,206
And machines...

860
00:58:21,415 --> 00:58:23,918
They're probably used
for strange things.

861
00:58:24,043 --> 00:58:25,670
I saw them.

862
00:58:25,795 --> 00:58:27,463
So what's he up to?

863
00:58:27,588 --> 00:58:31,676
For example, you bring him a photo
of someone you can't stand.

864
00:58:31,801 --> 00:58:33,886
Like a creditor,
or your sweetheart's husband,

865
00:58:34,011 --> 00:58:35,721
or a rich uncle.

866
00:58:36,055 --> 00:58:38,891
Hire has these special pins.

867
00:58:39,141 --> 00:58:41,102
He sticks them into the photo.

868
00:58:42,228 --> 00:58:45,106
If it's the gut,
the guy gets cramps and vomits.

869
00:58:45,648 --> 00:58:48,651
If it's his head, he gets migraines
a doctor can't cure.

870
00:58:48,901 --> 00:58:51,570
Another pinprick,
the guy is bedridden.

871
00:58:51,696 --> 00:58:55,282
But if it's stuck in his heart,
he kicks the bucket

872
00:58:55,408 --> 00:58:58,536
before he even has time
to write home.

873
00:59:00,788 --> 00:59:03,624
If it was true,
they'd use it in slaughterhouses.

874
00:59:03,749 --> 00:59:04,917
It's no joke.

875
00:59:05,042 --> 00:59:06,752
A doc can hypnotize a guy,

876
00:59:06,877 --> 00:59:10,548
telling him to walk naked
down the Champs-Elysées at 6:00,

877
00:59:10,673 --> 00:59:12,967
or to murder
his four kids with an ax.

878
00:59:13,092 --> 00:59:15,636
The guy wakes up and has no clue.

879
00:59:15,761 --> 00:59:17,638
At 5:55, he's normal,

880
00:59:17,763 --> 00:59:19,849
and five minutes later,
he's naked,

881
00:59:19,974 --> 00:59:22,101
or killing his kids with an ax.

882
00:59:22,226 --> 00:59:23,811
My Lord!

883
00:59:25,312 --> 00:59:26,981
That's what Hire does?

884
00:59:27,106 --> 00:59:28,774
He's free as a bird.

885
00:59:28,899 --> 00:59:31,026
No wonder the florist looks jaundiced,

886
00:59:31,152 --> 00:59:33,154
or your wife suffers depression.

887
00:59:34,155 --> 00:59:37,074
Why's he always got that camera
around his neck?

888
00:59:37,199 --> 00:59:39,160
The guy's a public menace!

889
00:59:39,535 --> 00:59:42,538
So the Noblet lady -
- I'm not accusing anyone.

890
00:59:42,663 --> 00:59:43,914
It's just a hunch.

891
00:59:44,081 --> 00:59:45,374
Don't get worked up.

892
00:59:45,499 --> 00:59:48,586
If he can kill people long-distance,
why strangle them?

893
00:59:48,753 --> 00:59:51,005
True, but people have strange ways.

894
00:59:51,130 --> 00:59:52,423
Take Noblet...

895
00:59:52,548 --> 00:59:55,426
Getting a woman like her
into a vacant lot

896
00:59:55,551 --> 00:59:56,927
took special powers.

897
00:59:57,094 --> 00:59:59,638
It's like the snake
hypnotizing the rabbit.

898
00:59:59,764 --> 01:00:01,766
He has a funny look in his eye.

899
01:00:01,891 --> 01:00:03,768
I'm not farming the flames,

900
01:00:03,893 --> 01:00:06,437
but you know what
he always says about the meat?

901
01:00:06,604 --> 01:00:07,605
It isn't bloody enough!

902
01:00:26,916 --> 01:00:28,459
Come in.

903
01:00:28,793 --> 01:00:30,711
There's no one here.

904
01:00:32,963 --> 01:00:34,965
But whose house is this?

905
01:00:35,090 --> 01:00:35,966
It's mine.

906
01:00:36,425 --> 01:00:37,802
Sit down.

907
01:00:44,308 --> 01:00:46,227
You had it all planned out.

908
01:00:46,393 --> 01:00:49,146
These cups have been waiting
for you for years.

909
01:00:49,563 --> 01:00:53,484
I left here abruptly many years ago.

910
01:00:53,818 --> 01:00:55,444
Please sit down.

911
01:00:57,154 --> 01:01:00,950
It was autumn and getting cold,
like today.

912
01:01:01,659 --> 01:01:04,370
The same logs
are still in the fireplace.

913
01:01:04,912 --> 01:01:07,248
A fire will warm up the place.

914
01:01:08,165 --> 01:01:10,417
I never came back.

915
01:01:10,876 --> 01:01:13,128
A caretaker comes occasionally.

916
01:01:13,838 --> 01:01:15,673
I was about to have tea.

917
01:01:16,006 --> 01:01:16,841
With whom?

918
01:01:17,007 --> 01:01:20,302
It was a long time ago.
Don't make me think about it.

919
01:01:20,427 --> 01:01:23,013
Look at this while I make the tea.

920
01:01:23,472 --> 01:01:25,850
I've always loved photography.

921
01:01:26,642 --> 01:01:28,811
A charming but abominable art.

922
01:01:28,936 --> 01:01:31,021
It explains many things though.

923
01:01:31,146 --> 01:01:32,398
Look.

924
01:01:32,731 --> 01:01:35,192
The kitchen's next door.
I'll be right back.

925
01:01:35,317 --> 01:01:36,902
Take a look.

926
01:01:44,159 --> 01:01:46,161
Sure you've lost your appetite.

927
01:01:46,287 --> 01:01:47,538
It's not my fault.

928
01:01:47,663 --> 01:01:49,790
You're tired, you get hot flashes.

929
01:01:49,915 --> 01:01:51,333
The doctor is stumped.

930
01:01:51,458 --> 01:01:54,587
- You know what he says.
- Your doctor's a jerk!

931
01:01:55,004 --> 01:01:56,714
Quiet at the table!

932
01:01:57,882 --> 01:01:59,508
Lymphatism.

933
01:02:00,134 --> 01:02:02,636
He blames everything on lymphatism.

934
01:02:05,055 --> 01:02:07,016
Your illness is inexplicable.

935
01:02:07,141 --> 01:02:09,602
Whenever that guy comes
into the shop -

936
01:02:09,727 --> 01:02:11,812
Mr. Hire's got nothing to do with it.

937
01:02:11,937 --> 01:02:17,401
Can't you see that those pinpricks
are planned-out, scientific stuff?

938
01:02:17,526 --> 01:02:20,154
You wouldn't argue about catechism.

939
01:02:20,279 --> 01:02:22,323
Your health is your own affair.

940
01:02:22,448 --> 01:02:25,159
But the kids are another matter!

941
01:02:25,284 --> 01:02:28,996
From now on, not one steak or kidney
for Monsieur Hire, got it?

942
01:02:29,121 --> 01:02:30,831
And if he insists...

943
01:02:31,165 --> 01:02:32,333
out the door!

944
01:02:32,458 --> 01:02:34,001
A customer's in the shop.

945
01:02:34,251 --> 01:02:36,629
If it's him, you're in for a laugh!

946
01:02:42,468 --> 01:02:44,553
Hello, Monsieur Capoulade.

947
01:02:44,678 --> 01:02:46,138
Any scraps for my cat?

948
01:02:46,263 --> 01:02:47,806
All ready.

949
01:02:47,932 --> 01:02:49,516
Nice of you.

950
01:02:49,642 --> 01:02:51,518
Isn't your wife well this morning?

951
01:02:51,644 --> 01:02:54,313
- It's not that. I'm hot.
- Hm?

952
01:02:54,438 --> 01:02:56,231
Under the collar.

953
01:02:56,357 --> 01:02:59,860
Folks around here are scared
to put their foot down.

954
01:03:00,027 --> 01:03:02,488
One crime
always leads to another.

955
01:03:02,613 --> 01:03:05,824
If there's a black sheep in your flock,
you slaughter it!

956
01:03:05,950 --> 01:03:07,952
Or you pass it off to your neighbor.

957
01:03:08,118 --> 01:03:09,370
Talking about Monsieur Hire?

958
01:03:09,495 --> 01:03:11,121
Can you put up with him?

959
01:03:11,246 --> 01:03:12,748
Hello, Monsieur Capoulade.

960
01:03:12,873 --> 01:03:15,793
Ask Mademoiselle Dubois
and Monsieur Sauvage.

961
01:03:15,918 --> 01:03:16,794
What is it?

962
01:03:16,919 --> 01:03:20,547
How often have I complained
about Monsieur Hire on the stairwell,

963
01:03:20,673 --> 01:03:22,800
the way he treats Lucienne?

964
01:03:22,967 --> 01:03:24,134
That's absolutely right.

965
01:03:24,468 --> 01:03:25,469
It's true.

966
01:03:25,594 --> 01:03:27,429
What's he want with the girl?

967
01:03:27,554 --> 01:03:31,183
He's always giving her apples,
squeezing her into corners.

968
01:03:31,976 --> 01:03:33,769
Well, let's see...

969
01:03:33,936 --> 01:03:35,771
Come here, my dear.

970
01:03:35,980 --> 01:03:37,940
Do you know Monsieur Hire well?

971
01:03:38,065 --> 01:03:39,858
He gives me sweets.

972
01:03:39,984 --> 01:03:41,360
Fancy that.

973
01:03:41,485 --> 01:03:43,654
And does he speak to you?

974
01:03:43,779 --> 01:03:44,905
He says hello.

975
01:03:45,030 --> 01:03:48,075
- Anything else?
- He calls me “pretty little Lucienne.”

976
01:03:53,080 --> 01:03:54,665
Come with me.

977
01:04:01,130 --> 01:04:03,507
You love veal cutlets, don't you?

978
01:04:03,632 --> 01:04:05,300
This is a beautiful one.

979
01:04:05,426 --> 01:04:08,971
It's yours if you tell me the truth,
the whole truth.

980
01:04:09,096 --> 01:04:12,057
Did he ever ask you into his room?

981
01:04:13,267 --> 01:04:15,602
No cutlets for liars!

982
01:04:15,853 --> 01:04:18,022
Did he ever say...

983
01:04:18,230 --> 01:04:21,358
“Come up to my room
for some candy”?

984
01:04:24,945 --> 01:04:29,491
Well, Madame Arnaud,
that was a close call.

985
01:04:29,658 --> 01:04:32,286
The lawyer dressed in robes is me.

986
01:04:32,619 --> 01:04:34,663
Years ago I practiced law.

987
01:04:34,788 --> 01:04:38,792
I knew the law
and prepared my cases we”.

988
01:04:38,917 --> 01:04:40,878
Yet I wasn't a success.

989
01:04:41,587 --> 01:04:45,466
My clients didn't find me
optimistic enough.

990
01:04:46,508 --> 01:04:48,761
I worried them
instead of inspiring confidence.

991
01:04:48,886 --> 01:04:50,387
There's my mother.

992
01:04:50,554 --> 01:04:52,056
An excellent woman.

993
01:04:52,556 --> 01:04:54,892
But she always preferred my brother.

994
01:04:55,017 --> 01:04:56,310
He was better-looking.

995
01:04:58,145 --> 01:05:01,315
People never liked me.
Not even my parents.

996
01:05:01,857 --> 01:05:07,321
At school, in the army, and at college,
I was always excluded.

997
01:05:07,571 --> 01:05:10,324
I didn't choose a life of solitude.

998
01:05:10,491 --> 01:05:12,576
Others just avoided me.

999
01:05:13,535 --> 01:05:15,079
And yet I got married.

1000
01:05:15,370 --> 01:05:16,872
Your wife?

1001
01:05:16,997 --> 01:05:18,582
She was lovely!

1002
01:05:19,500 --> 01:05:21,710
All these pictures have
the same caption:

1003
01:05:21,835 --> 01:05:23,378
“Happiness.”

1004
01:05:23,754 --> 01:05:27,883
Biarritz, Monte Carlo,
Brittany, Holland.

1005
01:05:28,008 --> 01:05:29,927
She's in all of them.

1006
01:05:30,094 --> 01:05:31,845
And always beautiful.

1007
01:05:32,805 --> 01:05:35,557
I'm not in this one. I took it.

1008
01:05:36,141 --> 01:05:39,853
That's how I brought her and him
together for the first time.

1009
01:05:39,978 --> 01:05:41,480
A friend of yours?

1010
01:05:41,730 --> 01:05:43,857
My first and only friend.

1011
01:05:44,525 --> 01:05:45,818
Is that it?

1012
01:05:45,943 --> 01:05:48,153
It all stops there abruptly.

1013
01:05:49,404 --> 01:05:53,158
Life wasn't meant to bring me
what's most precious:

1014
01:05:53,283 --> 01:05:55,452
a great love and a great friend.

1015
01:05:55,577 --> 01:05:57,287
I lost them both at once.

1016
01:05:57,412 --> 01:05:59,414
But there are other photos.

1017
01:05:59,540 --> 01:06:02,751
Quite different.
A museum of horrors.

1018
01:06:03,710 --> 01:06:06,922
A bum, frozen to death,
by the Arc de Triomphe.

1019
01:06:07,047 --> 01:06:11,468
A little laughing girl who went insane
after a poker struck her behind the ear.

1020
01:06:11,635 --> 01:06:13,554
A drunken woman.

1021
01:06:14,221 --> 01:06:17,975
Faces of misery, shame,
vice, and crime.

1022
01:06:18,267 --> 01:06:22,020
A charming set of snapshots I took,
printed, and mounted myself.

1023
01:06:22,146 --> 01:06:24,565
My family album.
- But why?

1024
01:06:24,815 --> 01:06:28,193
A reminder to never again
be moved by pity.

1025
01:06:29,236 --> 01:06:31,738
For ten years, I've lived in books

1026
01:06:31,864 --> 01:06:34,199
and consorted only with the dead.

1027
01:06:34,408 --> 01:06:36,368
They never betray you.

1028
01:06:37,035 --> 01:06:39,997
I thought I was safe,
out of reach, then...

1029
01:06:41,123 --> 01:06:43,000
Then I met you.

1030
01:06:43,542 --> 01:06:45,711
I don't know what happened.

1031
01:06:48,130 --> 01:06:49,423
Alice...

1032
01:06:50,257 --> 01:06:52,885
would you like
this house to be yours?

1033
01:06:53,051 --> 01:06:54,553
Forgive me.

1034
01:06:55,262 --> 01:06:57,973
I misjudged you, like the others.

1035
01:06:58,098 --> 01:07:00,100
I have nothing against them.

1036
01:07:00,225 --> 01:07:02,895
I never tried to tell them who I am.

1037
01:07:03,020 --> 01:07:05,230
They rush to judgment
based on appearances.

1038
01:07:05,355 --> 01:07:07,232
It's different with you.

1039
01:07:07,524 --> 01:07:09,818
Don't feel sorry for me.

1040
01:07:10,611 --> 01:07:13,238
Think it over carefully
before you answer.

1041
01:07:13,530 --> 01:07:15,032
Don't hurt me unnecessarily.

1042
01:07:15,449 --> 01:07:18,035
You are gentle and kind.

1043
01:07:18,202 --> 01:07:21,455
And I've lived enough
to know what that means.

1044
01:07:21,747 --> 01:07:24,333
So tidy up your room this evening.

1045
01:07:24,458 --> 01:07:26,376
I'll bring you my answer.

1046
01:07:26,501 --> 01:07:29,087
I'll scratch at your door
like a little mouse.

1047
01:07:29,254 --> 01:07:31,256
Can you wait till tonight?

1048
01:07:36,511 --> 01:07:39,640
Suppose there's a problem
in a neighborhood:

1049
01:07:39,765 --> 01:07:41,767
gas pressure too low,

1050
01:07:41,975 --> 01:07:45,020
stinking fumes from a factory,
you name it.

1051
01:07:45,479 --> 01:07:48,273
The residents get together
and write a letter.

1052
01:07:48,398 --> 01:07:49,900
- A petition!
- Exactly.

1053
01:07:50,025 --> 01:07:52,277
We'll petition to get rid of this guy.

1054
01:07:52,402 --> 01:07:54,446
A private individual? No chance.

1055
01:07:54,571 --> 01:07:56,198
You're all cowards!

1056
01:07:56,323 --> 01:07:58,575
The owner should just throw him out.

1057
01:07:58,700 --> 01:08:02,246
I wish all my guests paid up
on time like him.

1058
01:08:02,454 --> 01:08:03,747
Pass.

1059
01:08:03,872 --> 01:08:05,916
Was that aimed at me?

1060
01:08:06,041 --> 01:08:07,376
- Heart.
- Spade.

1061
01:08:07,542 --> 01:08:10,712
All you morons enjoy talking
about my reputation.

1062
01:08:10,837 --> 01:08:13,757
Sure, I have trouble
making ends meet.

1063
01:08:13,924 --> 01:08:17,803
But you know where my dough comes from.
Where does he get his?

1064
01:08:17,928 --> 01:08:19,513
From the empty lot.

1065
01:08:19,638 --> 01:08:21,431
A pack of Gauloises, please.

1066
01:08:21,598 --> 01:08:24,142
Monsieur Michelet,
how's the investigation going?

1067
01:08:24,268 --> 01:08:26,103
Are the police going to act?

1068
01:08:26,228 --> 01:08:28,772
I'm a respected storekeeper
with a large family,

1069
01:08:28,897 --> 01:08:30,440
and we all want to know -

1070
01:08:30,565 --> 01:08:33,277
Calm down.
Don't be unfair and ridiculous.

1071
01:08:33,443 --> 01:08:35,279
You're waiting for more victims?

1072
01:08:35,445 --> 01:08:36,905
Let's beat him up!

1073
01:08:37,030 --> 01:08:38,782
At last!

1074
01:08:38,907 --> 01:08:39,783
So...

1075
01:08:39,908 --> 01:08:41,243
who's going to do it?

1076
01:08:41,368 --> 01:08:42,828
We need a man!

1077
01:08:42,953 --> 01:08:45,497
And men don't grow on trees,
believe me.

1078
01:08:45,622 --> 01:08:46,790
Me!

1079
01:08:46,957 --> 01:08:48,292
Oh, you'll chicken out.

1080
01:08:48,458 --> 01:08:51,128
First I'll say, “We're honest folk.

1081
01:08:51,253 --> 01:08:53,171
You don't belong here.”

1082
01:08:53,297 --> 01:08:54,464
Fine words!

1083
01:08:54,589 --> 01:08:57,801
Second, “I'm a man of experience
with good sense.

1084
01:08:58,135 --> 01:09:02,222
Pack up your gadgets and potions
and clear out.”

1085
01:09:02,347 --> 01:09:03,807
Hear! Hear!

1086
01:09:04,266 --> 01:09:05,642
Third, I'd say -

1087
01:09:05,809 --> 01:09:07,144
Monsieur Breteuil...

1088
01:09:09,479 --> 01:09:10,939
Sorry to disturb you.

1089
01:09:11,064 --> 01:09:12,482
No problem, Monsieur Hire.

1090
01:09:12,816 --> 01:09:15,068
Do you have a bottle of champagne?

1091
01:09:15,235 --> 01:09:17,654
- Champagne?
- A good brand, if possible.

1092
01:09:17,779 --> 01:09:19,656
Yes, but it's rather expensive.

1093
01:09:19,781 --> 01:09:22,492
- It doesn't matter.
- Right away, Monsieur Hire.

1094
01:09:26,288 --> 01:09:29,166
So what about
your “first” and “second”?

1095
01:09:35,505 --> 01:09:36,631
Monsieur Hire...

1096
01:09:36,757 --> 01:09:38,008
Monsieur.

1097
01:09:38,633 --> 01:09:40,135
Monsieur Hire...

1098
01:09:40,510 --> 01:09:42,137
I'm listening.

1099
01:09:42,262 --> 01:09:44,014
Everyone is listening.

1100
01:09:45,265 --> 01:09:49,227
Careful, the counter is wet.
You might stain your sleeve.

1101
01:09:49,478 --> 01:09:51,313
That's 80 francs.

1102
01:09:51,688 --> 01:09:52,898
Thank you, Monsieur Hire.

1103
01:09:53,023 --> 01:09:55,150
- Give the change to Raphael.
- Thank you.

1104
01:09:55,275 --> 01:09:56,735
Thank you, Monsieur Hire.

1105
01:09:56,860 --> 01:09:58,695
Good-bye, Monsieur Breteuil.

1106
01:09:58,987 --> 01:10:00,697
My regards, monsieur.

1107
01:10:04,201 --> 01:10:08,330
Monsieur Breteuil, a chamomile tea
for the heroic tax man!

1108
01:10:08,455 --> 01:10:10,582
The terror of the block!

1109
01:10:10,707 --> 01:10:12,542
His stare threw me off.

1110
01:10:12,667 --> 01:10:16,338
What else can I say?
You're a disgrace to my clients!

1111
01:10:32,896 --> 01:10:34,648
May I come in tonight?

1112
01:10:35,565 --> 01:10:36,942
Of course.

1113
01:10:38,443 --> 01:10:39,736
You got flowers?

1114
01:10:39,986 --> 01:10:41,321
For you.

1115
01:10:44,866 --> 01:10:47,077
So this is where you watch me.

1116
01:10:47,536 --> 01:10:49,496
A good vantage point.

1117
01:10:50,664 --> 01:10:52,749
You promised me an answer.

1118
01:10:53,083 --> 01:10:54,626
Yes? No?

1119
01:10:55,210 --> 01:10:57,254
I showed up, didn't I?

1120
01:10:58,588 --> 01:11:01,049
You're kind, you're unhappy.

1121
01:11:01,174 --> 01:11:03,260
It was an easy decision.

1122
01:11:04,761 --> 01:11:07,931
Let's celebrate
our engagement solemnly.

1123
01:11:08,598 --> 01:11:09,891
Solemnly?

1124
01:11:10,016 --> 01:11:12,269
I've got some champagne on ice.

1125
01:11:12,686 --> 01:11:14,396
Take off your coat. Sit down.

1126
01:11:20,694 --> 01:11:25,365
Does it bother you that I shared
the house with someone else?

1127
01:11:25,615 --> 01:11:28,201
We could redecorate it to your taste,

1128
01:11:28,368 --> 01:11:30,120
or sell it.

1129
01:11:30,871 --> 01:11:33,748
My only ambition is to see you smile.

1130
01:11:37,627 --> 01:11:39,671
You look happy for the first time.

1131
01:11:39,796 --> 01:11:41,381
But I am.

1132
01:11:42,132 --> 01:11:43,925
- Allow me.
- Thank you.

1133
01:11:46,470 --> 01:11:49,097
Goodness! I forgot the ring.

1134
01:11:49,389 --> 01:11:51,808
It doesn't matter.
We have time.

1135
01:11:51,933 --> 01:11:53,477
All our lives.

1136
01:11:55,103 --> 01:11:57,314
I don't even know your first name.

1137
01:11:57,481 --> 01:11:59,483
I was unlucky with that too.

1138
01:11:59,608 --> 01:12:00,567
Désiré.

1139
01:12:00,692 --> 01:12:02,652
Désiré? But it's charming!

1140
01:12:04,946 --> 01:12:08,992
And so to your desires,
to your good fortune, Désiré.

1141
01:12:28,512 --> 01:12:31,681
- Good morning, Monsieur Michelet.
- Hello, gentlemen.

1142
01:12:41,733 --> 01:12:43,401
Who is it?

1143
01:12:43,610 --> 01:12:45,612
The assistant inspector.

1144
01:12:56,206 --> 01:12:59,334
I'd have come later
if I knew you slept till noon.

1145
01:12:59,459 --> 01:13:01,127
It's noon already?

1146
01:13:01,878 --> 01:13:03,713
My apologies, Monsieur Michelet.

1147
01:13:04,047 --> 01:13:05,757
Come in, please.

1148
01:13:07,217 --> 01:13:10,345
Last night we had a party,

1149
01:13:10,720 --> 01:13:12,639
and I got home very late.

1150
01:13:14,057 --> 01:13:17,143
- Aren't you needed at the garage?
- That's just it.

1151
01:13:17,394 --> 01:13:19,354
I was outwith my bosses.

1152
01:13:19,479 --> 01:13:21,231
They really like me.

1153
01:13:21,773 --> 01:13:26,069
A nice, quiet job that pays enough
to party now and then.

1154
01:13:26,570 --> 01:13:27,904
Exactly.

1155
01:13:29,447 --> 01:13:32,742
And yesterday
I had a hot tip for the track.

1156
01:13:35,287 --> 01:13:37,706
Razibus, a 12-to-1 long shot.

1157
01:13:37,831 --> 01:13:41,418
- You play the horses a lot?
- No, can't afford it.

1158
01:13:41,626 --> 01:13:42,919
Of course.

1159
01:13:43,420 --> 01:13:48,091
Tell me, do you recall what you
were doing the day of the murder?

1160
01:13:48,758 --> 01:13:50,927
I was at the garage till 8:00.

1161
01:13:51,094 --> 01:13:53,263
Lucky for you
you were working that day.

1162
01:13:53,388 --> 01:13:54,222
Well...

1163
01:13:54,347 --> 01:13:56,057
Ask my bosses.

1164
01:13:56,349 --> 01:13:59,561
- They like you, right?
- What are you getting at?

1165
01:13:59,686 --> 01:14:01,938
Everybody saw me
playing cards after that.

1166
01:14:02,063 --> 01:14:04,941
I know.
Just wanted to make sure.

1167
01:14:05,775 --> 01:14:08,695
When did you say
Razibus won at the track?

1168
01:14:08,820 --> 01:14:10,113
Yesterday, third race.

1169
01:14:10,280 --> 01:14:11,948
Thank you.
See you, Monsieur Alfred.

1170
01:14:12,115 --> 01:14:14,367
Any time, Monsieur Michelet.

1171
01:14:16,036 --> 01:14:17,704
Bye, Monsieur Michelet.

1172
01:14:25,170 --> 01:14:26,963
Going to see your friend?

1173
01:14:27,339 --> 01:14:28,340
Yes.

1174
01:14:28,465 --> 01:14:31,259
I'm looking for work,
and he knows lots of people.

1175
01:14:31,384 --> 01:14:33,678
Yesterday he said he had a lead.

1176
01:14:33,803 --> 01:14:36,348
Him too?
Well, good luck, mademoiselle.

1177
01:14:36,473 --> 01:14:37,766
Thanks.

1178
01:14:41,770 --> 01:14:45,565
- I looked for you last night.
- I was outwith the boys.

1179
01:14:45,690 --> 01:14:49,277
It's all set up.
The handbag's behind his radiator.

1180
01:14:49,402 --> 01:14:50,612
You're great!

1181
01:14:50,737 --> 01:14:52,739
- It was quite a job.
- I bet.

1182
01:14:52,864 --> 01:14:54,532
But time's running out.

1183
01:14:54,658 --> 01:14:57,327
Seems so.
Did you run into Michelet?

1184
01:14:57,494 --> 01:14:58,828
Precisely.

1185
01:14:58,995 --> 01:15:01,039
We thought his head
was in the clouds,

1186
01:15:01,164 --> 01:15:03,416
but he's a hound
sniffing everywhere.

1187
01:15:03,541 --> 01:15:04,751
We need to act.

1188
01:15:04,876 --> 01:15:06,503
But we stick to the plan.

1189
01:15:06,753 --> 01:15:08,588
Let the others get worked up.

1190
01:15:09,297 --> 01:15:12,676
They're already hot.
One spark and they'll explode.

1191
01:15:14,469 --> 01:15:16,388
It's going to get nasty.

1192
01:15:17,097 --> 01:15:18,556
Don't tell me...

1193
01:15:19,015 --> 01:15:20,809
You feel sorry for him?

1194
01:15:20,934 --> 01:15:22,352
Me?

1195
01:15:22,727 --> 01:15:26,356
I love you.
That's my answer to everything.

1196
01:15:32,862 --> 01:15:35,365
Now listen:
I'll tell Fernand and Marco.

1197
01:15:35,532 --> 01:15:38,493
While we watch the fights,
they'll get to work.

1198
01:15:40,286 --> 01:15:44,374
On my left, Olga the Romanian
versus Vali the Belgian.

1199
01:15:44,541 --> 01:15:47,210
185 pounds against 210 pounds!

1200
01:15:47,377 --> 01:15:50,672
Jenny the Redhead
against Rachel, Arms of Steel!

1201
01:15:50,797 --> 01:15:54,718
The real deal!
No fake boobs, no false calves!

1202
01:15:54,884 --> 01:15:58,346
Not afraid of a slap to the face!
No holds barred!

1203
01:15:58,471 --> 01:16:02,600
In addition to a man's strength,
these international champions

1204
01:16:02,726 --> 01:16:04,894
bring a woman's wiles,

1205
01:16:05,061 --> 01:16:08,231
not to mention the cunning
of the inferior sex...

1206
01:16:08,481 --> 01:16:09,899
Get going...

1207
01:16:10,024 --> 01:16:12,152
and remember, behind the radiator.

1208
01:16:12,444 --> 01:16:13,903
Keep us posted.

1209
01:16:17,782 --> 01:16:20,577
Step up, ladies and gentlemen!

1210
01:16:23,830 --> 01:16:25,790
We don't want any trouble.

1211
01:16:25,915 --> 01:16:28,543
We're just looking out for everyone.

1212
01:16:28,918 --> 01:16:30,754
In that case, I'm in.

1213
01:16:31,463 --> 01:16:32,505
Mathilde...

1214
01:16:32,630 --> 01:16:34,090
mind the store!

1215
01:16:35,258 --> 01:16:37,635
<i>So long, Monsieur Sauvage.
See you soon.</i>

1216
01:16:37,761 --> 01:16:40,764
Monsieur Sauvage, we're closing out
Monsieur Hire's account.

1217
01:16:40,889 --> 01:16:43,808
- Are you in?
- Yes, but aren't there enough of you?

1218
01:16:43,933 --> 01:16:46,603
We need an eloquent,
authoritative spokesman.

1219
01:16:46,770 --> 01:16:48,354
Then I'm in! Let's go!

1220
01:16:48,480 --> 01:16:49,814
Coming, Monsieur Fortin?
- Sure!

1221
01:16:49,939 --> 01:16:51,608
I'll be right back.

1222
01:16:54,152 --> 01:16:56,321
What about you, Monsieur Brochu?

1223
01:16:56,446 --> 01:16:57,864
Coming?
- Where to?

1224
01:16:57,989 --> 01:16:59,240
To serve justice.

1225
01:16:59,365 --> 01:17:01,159
Sure, I've got nothing better to do.

1226
01:17:01,451 --> 01:17:03,119
So let's go.

1227
01:17:07,123 --> 01:17:09,542
- Is Simon Breteuil here?
- On the stairs.

1228
01:17:09,667 --> 01:17:11,961
This way, gentlemen.

1229
01:17:13,213 --> 01:17:15,298
There he is.

1230
01:17:19,469 --> 01:17:21,137
Monsieur Breteuil.

1231
01:17:21,304 --> 01:17:23,431
Yes? What is it?

1232
01:17:24,766 --> 01:17:26,518
There's plenty of you.

1233
01:17:27,227 --> 01:17:28,144
What's going on?

1234
01:17:28,269 --> 01:17:31,022
On behalf of the neighborhood,

1235
01:17:31,231 --> 01:17:34,984
for the last time,
we urge the management -

1236
01:17:35,151 --> 01:17:36,945
I already told you,
there's no reason.

1237
01:17:37,070 --> 01:17:38,238
What?

1238
01:17:38,363 --> 01:17:39,489
You think so?

1239
01:17:39,614 --> 01:17:43,034
If you refuse to comply
with our legitimate request -

1240
01:17:43,159 --> 01:17:45,328
- Then what?
- Then...

1241
01:17:47,747 --> 01:17:49,415
I don't know.

1242
01:17:49,541 --> 01:17:51,543
The committee didn't think of that.

1243
01:17:51,835 --> 01:17:54,587
- What now?
- Don't let him stand in our way.

1244
01:17:54,712 --> 01:17:55,797
You're right!

1245
01:17:55,922 --> 01:17:57,799
We refuse to accept this!

1246
01:18:02,011 --> 01:18:04,180
We're going to evict Monsieur Hire!

1247
01:18:04,305 --> 01:18:05,348
He's at work.

1248
01:18:05,473 --> 01:18:08,393
Let's go. When he returns,
his stuff will be on the sidewalk.

1249
01:18:08,518 --> 01:18:10,562
No one's going into his room!

1250
01:18:10,687 --> 01:18:12,063
Give us the key or -

1251
01:18:12,188 --> 01:18:13,356
Don't try it!

1252
01:18:13,523 --> 01:18:15,024
Here it is!

1253
01:18:18,695 --> 01:18:21,281
If you touch his things,
I'll call the police!

1254
01:18:21,406 --> 01:18:22,365
The police!

1255
01:18:22,490 --> 01:18:25,243
Get lost!
For once we're having some fun!

1256
01:18:27,704 --> 01:18:29,038
What the hell!

1257
01:18:34,836 --> 01:18:37,380
Come on, let's empty the dresser!

1258
01:18:37,755 --> 01:18:39,549
Pass me that stuff.

1259
01:18:48,850 --> 01:18:50,560
Ah, a suitcase.

1260
01:18:50,894 --> 01:18:52,228
Come on.

1261
01:18:53,438 --> 01:18:55,064
Pass me that stuff.

1262
01:18:57,942 --> 01:18:59,777
- Here.
- Thanks.

1263
01:18:59,903 --> 01:19:01,446
No nudies?

1264
01:19:01,571 --> 01:19:03,197
Pass me the clothes.

1265
01:19:05,909 --> 01:19:07,785
At last!

1266
01:19:08,077 --> 01:19:09,913
Bravo, gentlemen!

1267
01:19:13,249 --> 01:19:15,293
There's something back there.

1268
01:19:17,253 --> 01:19:20,465
Oh great, a handbag!
Mine's falling apart.

1269
01:19:20,590 --> 01:19:21,758
Let me see.

1270
01:19:21,925 --> 01:19:24,135
Look at the initials: “A. N.”

1271
01:19:24,969 --> 01:19:26,137
“A. N.”?

1272
01:19:26,262 --> 01:19:29,140
That's Aurore Noblet!
It's her handbag!

1273
01:19:29,390 --> 01:19:30,975
Then he's the murderer!

1274
01:19:31,100 --> 01:19:32,393
I found the murderer?

1275
01:19:32,518 --> 01:19:34,562
I found the murderer!

1276
01:19:35,605 --> 01:19:37,357
I found the murderer!
- Hire?

1277
01:19:37,482 --> 01:19:39,192
- Yes!
- I knew it.

1278
01:19:40,610 --> 01:19:42,028
I found Noblet's handbag!

1279
01:19:42,153 --> 01:19:43,947
Hire's the murderer!

1280
01:19:44,072 --> 01:19:45,365
- I thought so!
- What?

1281
01:19:45,490 --> 01:19:47,325
She found the bag!

1282
01:19:48,576 --> 01:19:51,496
Hire's the murderer! It's him!
It's Hire!

1283
01:19:51,621 --> 01:19:52,789
Hire's the murderer!

1284
01:19:55,458 --> 01:19:58,461
Can you believe it?
I found the murderer!

1285
01:20:37,375 --> 01:20:38,668
Alfred!

1286
01:20:38,835 --> 01:20:39,711
Hey!

1287
01:20:39,836 --> 01:20:40,837
Alfred!

1288
01:20:41,212 --> 01:20:43,172
They found Noblet's murderer!

1289
01:20:43,297 --> 01:20:45,174
What's he saying?

1290
01:20:45,299 --> 01:20:47,677
He says they found Noblet's murderer.

1291
01:20:47,844 --> 01:20:49,971
Someone just got killed!

1292
01:20:54,809 --> 01:20:56,728
- What is it? A fire?
- What?

1293
01:20:56,853 --> 01:20:58,521
- What's going on?
- Why are they leaving?

1294
01:20:58,646 --> 01:20:59,689
Let's go!

1295
01:20:59,814 --> 01:21:01,107
Fire! Run for your life!

1296
01:21:24,881 --> 01:21:26,382
- What's going on?
- The murderer!

1297
01:21:26,549 --> 01:21:28,217
- Where?
- Not here, the hotel!

1298
01:21:28,384 --> 01:21:29,177
Which hotel?

1299
01:21:29,302 --> 01:21:32,638
You know, the guy with the beard,
who never says hello.

1300
01:21:32,764 --> 01:21:36,100
He killed that little girl, Lucienne.
It's dreadful!

1301
01:21:36,225 --> 01:21:38,061
He's holed up in the hotel!

1302
01:21:38,227 --> 01:21:39,771
The police refuse to act.

1303
01:21:39,896 --> 01:21:41,731
Let's take care of him ourselves!

1304
01:21:42,774 --> 01:21:43,900
What's going on?

1305
01:21:44,067 --> 01:21:46,069
Noblet's murderer has been arrested!

1306
01:21:46,194 --> 01:21:47,570
Oh my God!

1307
01:22:02,627 --> 01:22:05,588
- What's happening?
- A crime at the hotel!

1308
01:22:07,882 --> 01:22:09,926
It's time to get him here.

1309
01:22:10,384 --> 01:22:11,219
Now?

1310
01:22:11,344 --> 01:22:12,637
They'll cool off by tonight.

1311
01:22:12,762 --> 01:22:15,807
Know how to reach him?
- I've got his emergency number.

1312
01:22:15,932 --> 01:22:17,391
Come on, you gotta do it.

1313
01:22:17,517 --> 01:22:18,434
Really?

1314
01:22:18,559 --> 01:22:20,186
Do you love me?

1315
01:22:21,771 --> 01:22:23,356
Let's go.

1316
01:22:50,842 --> 01:22:52,552
Dr. Varga!

1317
01:22:54,053 --> 01:22:55,012
What is it?

1318
01:22:55,138 --> 01:22:57,056
Your fiancée, on the phone.

1319
01:22:57,223 --> 01:22:58,349
Coming!

1320
01:22:59,350 --> 01:23:01,227
Quit shaking.

1321
01:23:02,019 --> 01:23:03,479
What are they shouting?

1322
01:23:03,604 --> 01:23:04,730
Nothing...

1323
01:23:04,856 --> 01:23:06,107
“Kill him.”

1324
01:23:06,232 --> 01:23:07,358
Hello?

1325
01:23:08,025 --> 01:23:10,069
Is that you, Désiré?

1326
01:23:10,653 --> 01:23:11,988
Listen...

1327
01:23:12,155 --> 01:23:14,031
something awful has happened.

1328
01:23:14,157 --> 01:23:16,993
I told Alfred it was over.

1329
01:23:17,493 --> 01:23:18,911
He's acting crazy.

1330
01:23:19,036 --> 01:23:20,872
You must come right away.

1331
01:23:21,164 --> 01:23:23,040
Right away, you hear?

1332
01:23:23,166 --> 01:23:25,293
It's better if you come here.

1333
01:23:25,418 --> 01:23:27,879
You'll be safe here, my darling.

1334
01:23:29,088 --> 01:23:30,173
Impossible?

1335
01:23:30,298 --> 01:23:32,091
I'll explain later.

1336
01:23:32,216 --> 01:23:33,593
Come now.

1337
01:23:33,926 --> 01:23:35,178
What?

1338
01:23:35,386 --> 01:23:36,721
The métro?

1339
01:23:36,929 --> 01:23:38,055
No, no.

1340
01:23:38,181 --> 01:23:40,391
No, not the métro. Take a taxi.

1341
01:23:41,058 --> 01:23:44,228
Yes, I'll wait for you in the square.

1342
01:23:46,647 --> 01:23:48,274
See you soon.

1343
01:23:53,529 --> 01:23:55,448
Come on, it's over.

1344
01:23:55,573 --> 01:23:58,618
That's the last thing
I'll ask you to do.

1345
01:23:58,784 --> 01:24:00,369
So?

1346
01:24:00,494 --> 01:24:02,246
- He'll be here in five minutes.
- Here?

1347
01:24:02,371 --> 01:24:04,790
- Coming by Rue de Paris.
- Rue de Paris!

1348
01:24:13,883 --> 01:24:15,551
What's going on over there?

1349
01:24:15,676 --> 01:24:17,511
They found
Mademoiselle Noblet's handbag.

1350
01:24:17,637 --> 01:24:19,013
- Where?
- In Hire's room.

1351
01:24:19,138 --> 01:24:20,890
That creep at the hotel.

1352
01:24:21,140 --> 01:24:24,060
Move out. Disperse the crowd.

1353
01:24:32,318 --> 01:24:34,403
<i>Get me Quad des Orfèvres..</i>

1354
01:24:34,904 --> 01:24:37,198
- Hello, Fortin!
- Hello.

1355
01:24:37,657 --> 01:24:39,784
Is it true he's barricaded himself in?

1356
01:24:39,909 --> 01:24:42,870
We're looking for him.
There's gonna be trouble!

1357
01:24:43,037 --> 01:24:46,249
Who'd have thought it?
Such a quiet man.

1358
01:24:46,582 --> 01:24:48,668
I cleaned his room every day!

1359
01:24:48,793 --> 01:24:51,712
How exciting!
It's giving me goose bumps.

1360
01:24:51,837 --> 01:24:53,089
Move along!

1361
01:24:53,256 --> 01:24:55,174
Monsieur Michelet!

1362
01:25:05,643 --> 01:25:08,729
He's not in right now.
Probably at his office.

1363
01:25:08,854 --> 01:25:12,108
Move along! Ladies and gentlemen,
please cooperate!

1364
01:25:12,233 --> 01:25:14,193
Ladies, go home.

1365
01:25:14,318 --> 01:25:16,237
Let the police do their job!

1366
01:25:16,362 --> 01:25:18,656
We just want to see.

1367
01:25:18,823 --> 01:25:21,158
Go home, please, madam.

1368
01:25:21,284 --> 01:25:23,953
Come on, kids, go home.

1369
01:25:24,078 --> 01:25:25,871
Move along, everyone.

1370
01:25:25,997 --> 01:25:27,707
As a civil servant...

1371
01:25:27,832 --> 01:25:32,003
may I add my encouragements
to those of Monsieur Michelet?

1372
01:25:32,128 --> 01:25:36,465
We must remain calm
and let justice take its course.

1373
01:25:36,590 --> 01:25:40,803
Oh, shut up, mustache!
Mind your own business!

1374
01:25:41,012 --> 01:25:44,473
That's the guy
who sends me a tax form!

1375
01:25:44,640 --> 01:25:46,017
And he talks about justice!

1376
01:25:46,142 --> 01:25:49,186
Now, Mademoiselle Marcelle,
you're usually so understanding.

1377
01:25:49,312 --> 01:25:52,398
But you're different.
I could never refuse you.

1378
01:25:52,565 --> 01:25:54,817
Now please go home calmly,
everyone.

1379
01:25:54,942 --> 01:25:57,611
Clear the square.
This is a dangerous man.

1380
01:25:57,737 --> 01:25:59,113
He may be armed.

1381
01:25:59,238 --> 01:26:01,115
What? He's armed?

1382
01:26:01,240 --> 01:26:04,160
Better go, Madame Capoulade.
There's no point taking any risks.

1383
01:26:04,285 --> 01:26:07,121
You think 30?
Come on, go home, children!

1384
01:26:10,916 --> 01:26:14,337
Arthur, we might get shot,
and you're working the market tomorrow.

1385
01:26:14,462 --> 01:26:15,838
But Amélie...

1386
01:26:16,756 --> 01:26:19,258
A free show.
That's unfair competition.

1387
01:26:19,383 --> 01:26:21,260
Better close down.

1388
01:26:25,348 --> 01:26:28,351
No point giving them free music.

1389
01:26:31,979 --> 01:26:34,357
Please, Doctor, set a good example.

1390
01:26:34,482 --> 01:26:36,734
- Where can we go?
- Behind the rides.

1391
01:26:36,859 --> 01:26:39,278
- What a mess, Monsieur Michelet.
- Yeah.

1392
01:26:39,487 --> 01:26:41,155
Did you find the bag?
- No such luck.

1393
01:26:41,280 --> 01:26:43,032
We were at the matinee.

1394
01:26:43,991 --> 01:26:45,659
Go on home now.

1395
01:26:46,327 --> 01:26:47,578
Get going.

1396
01:26:49,538 --> 01:26:52,124
Hey boss, we're not leaving yet.

1397
01:26:52,249 --> 01:26:53,918
But we've got customers.

1398
01:26:54,043 --> 01:26:55,878
I don't want to miss the action.

1399
01:26:56,128 --> 01:26:57,630
Up here!

1400
01:26:58,005 --> 01:26:59,799
We've got a great view!

1401
01:26:59,924 --> 01:27:01,717
Coming, Madame Sauvage?

1402
01:27:02,343 --> 01:27:04,095
- He'll be coming that way.
- So?

1403
01:27:04,220 --> 01:27:05,388
Nothing.

1404
01:27:05,888 --> 01:27:08,349
Hey, there's a taxi coming!

1405
01:27:21,821 --> 01:27:23,114
How much?

1406
01:27:23,989 --> 01:27:26,575
- Fourteen francs.
- There you are.

1407
01:28:28,637 --> 01:28:30,890
What's all this?
What do they want?

1408
01:28:31,015 --> 01:28:33,642
Monsieur Michelet,
I demand the protection of the law.

1409
01:28:33,809 --> 01:28:35,436
You're coming with us.

1410
01:28:35,561 --> 01:28:38,189
Fine, but why are my bags
on the sidewalk?

1411
01:28:38,314 --> 01:28:39,690
Move along.

1412
01:28:42,151 --> 01:28:44,028
I can't handle three of you.

1413
01:28:44,153 --> 01:28:46,864
But I'll take you on one at a time!

1414
01:28:46,989 --> 01:28:48,324
Bastard!

1415
01:28:48,491 --> 01:28:49,867
Murderer!

1416
01:28:50,117 --> 01:28:51,660
Kill the murderer!

1417
01:28:51,785 --> 01:28:53,412
Kill the murderer!

1418
01:29:35,079 --> 01:29:37,164
Watch out!
He's going to shoot!

1419
01:30:06,402 --> 01:30:08,112
I haven't done anything!

1420
01:30:08,237 --> 01:30:09,989
I don't know what they want!

1421
01:30:32,511 --> 01:30:33,429
What happened?

1422
01:30:33,554 --> 01:30:36,932
Hire had the handbag in his room.
He fled up into that building.

1423
01:30:37,099 --> 01:30:40,102
We'll search the building.
You guys, come with me.

1424
01:30:51,780 --> 01:30:52,698
What is it?

1425
01:30:52,823 --> 01:30:54,867
Are you the pharmacist?
We need to get up there.

1426
01:30:54,992 --> 01:30:58,037
Take the back stairs.
It's more direct.

1427
01:31:22,561 --> 01:31:23,979
Where is he?

1428
01:32:33,298 --> 01:32:34,883
They can't do it.

1429
01:32:35,008 --> 01:32:37,010
Call the firemen to bring their ladder.

1430
01:32:42,683 --> 01:32:45,018
It's the police!
On the square, now!

1431
01:32:45,144 --> 01:32:47,020
The big ladder! And hurry!

1432
01:34:18,821 --> 01:34:20,447
Is the doctor here?

1433
01:34:20,572 --> 01:34:21,907
Doctor!

1434
01:34:22,157 --> 01:34:23,700
Dr. Philippon!

1435
01:34:31,458 --> 01:34:34,002
Hold on for five more minutes.

1436
01:34:37,297 --> 01:34:38,799
He's dead.

1437
01:34:40,259 --> 01:34:41,677
Get the van.

1438
01:35:24,261 --> 01:35:26,597
Move along, everybody.

1439
01:35:26,889 --> 01:35:28,974
Move along! It's all over.

1440
01:35:29,683 --> 01:35:31,435
Go home.

1441
01:35:32,227 --> 01:35:34,646
Understand, madam?
Move along!

1442
01:35:36,732 --> 01:35:39,943
Go home.
It's all over, monsieur!

1443
01:35:40,277 --> 01:35:42,988
Start the music!
You're losing money.

1444
01:35:43,113 --> 01:35:44,114
Start it up, Charles!

1445
01:35:44,239 --> 01:35:45,240
Move along, folks!

1446
01:36:04,426 --> 01:36:05,928
Let's get going.

1447
01:36:06,053 --> 01:36:08,055
Careful! We're being watched!

1448
01:36:10,432 --> 01:36:12,017
To the roller coaster!

1449
01:36:47,302 --> 01:36:50,222
Well, that's settled.

1450
01:36:50,806 --> 01:36:52,307
What's that?

1451
01:36:52,432 --> 01:36:54,935
- Monsieur Hire's testament.
- What?

1452
01:36:55,477 --> 01:36:59,564
“Photo of Mademoiselle Noblet's murder
by Alfred Chartier.

1453
01:36:59,773 --> 01:37:04,236
Taken September <i>5</i> at dusk
in a vacant lot south of the square,

1454
01:37:04,361 --> 01:37:07,990
where I had wandered
to answer a call of nature.”

1455
01:37:09,825 --> 01:37:11,326
Damn!

1456
01:37:29,261 --> 01:37:30,971
Come on, let's get him.

1457
01:37:31,096 --> 01:37:33,473
Oh, let him finish his last ride.

1458
01:37:36,101 --> 01:37:40,981
<i>...such a profound joy</i>

1459
01:37:41,356 --> 01:37:46,778
<i>One day, all around the world</i>

<i>One day, maybe all of mankind</i>

1461
