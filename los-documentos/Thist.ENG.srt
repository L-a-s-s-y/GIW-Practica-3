1
00:01:47,356 --> 00:01:48,441
- No, no, no!

2
00:02:39,909 --> 00:02:42,912
<i>Superb, she is responding</i>

3
00:02:42,912 --> 00:02:44,413
<i>remarkably well.</i>

4
00:02:44,413 --> 00:02:47,166
<i>But are you quite
sure it's safe, Mrs. Barker?</i>

5
00:02:47,166 --> 00:02:48,793
<i>I'm no medical man but it seems to me</i>

6
00:02:48,793 --> 00:02:50,878
<i>that she's on the verge of insanity.</i>

7
00:02:50,878 --> 00:02:54,548
<i>No, it's
standard conditioning procedure.</i>

8
00:02:54,548 --> 00:02:55,841
<i>You will not be deprived of what you</i>

9
00:02:55,841 --> 00:02:57,218
<i>want Mr. Hodge.</i>

10
00:02:58,386 --> 00:03:00,721
<i>Just see how the process is working.</i>

11
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:03,265
<i>Totally different woman from the one</i>

12
00:03:03,265 --> 00:03:05,601
<i>we were observing a week ago.</i>

13
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:31,377
- Hello Mugs.

14
00:03:33,212 --> 00:03:34,755
Haven't you been fed yet, eh?

15
00:03:34,755 --> 00:03:35,631
- Hello Miss Davis.

16
00:03:35,631 --> 00:03:36,507
- Hello Lori.

17
00:03:36,507 --> 00:03:37,758
- I've marinated the steak.

18
00:03:37,758 --> 00:03:39,135
- Oh good.

19
00:03:39,135 --> 00:03:40,344
- And Mr. Pervine from Los Angeles—

20
00:03:40,344 --> 00:03:41,220
- Oh yes?

21
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:42,096
- Said he'd call back at 10.

22
00:03:42,179 --> 00:03:43,514
- All right.

23
00:03:43,514 --> 00:03:44,932
- All the packing is
finished, your bags are ready.

24
00:03:44,932 --> 00:03:46,434
- Oh thank you Lori,
well you can go home now.

25
00:03:46,434 --> 00:03:48,352
I'll see you in four weeks.

26
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:49,228
Have you got the keys to the house?

27
00:03:49,228 --> 00:03:50,646
Yes.

28
00:03:50,646 --> 00:03:51,480
Have a lovely holiday, Miss Davis.

29
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,773
- Thank you Lori.

30
00:03:52,773 --> 00:03:53,816
Come on.

31
00:03:56,986 --> 00:03:58,946
There you are, baby.

32
00:04:01,031 --> 00:04:03,617
And you, Mr. Curt, can wait till morning.

33
00:04:04,618 --> 00:04:05,453
Come on.

34
00:04:25,014 --> 00:04:26,140
I prayed you'd called.

35
00:04:27,892 --> 00:04:29,518
- Why didn't you call
me for Christ's sake?

36
00:04:29,518 --> 00:04:30,936
- I did, last bust up.

37
00:04:30,936 --> 00:04:32,813
Was your turn this time.

38
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:18,150
- Her habits are reasonably regular.

39
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:19,443
As Miss Daintree said earlier,

40
00:05:19,443 --> 00:05:21,612
she works most of the time, either at

41
00:05:21,612 --> 00:05:22,738
the office or at home.

42
00:05:24,782 --> 00:05:27,117
The man friend is an
architect, Derek Whitelaw.

43
00:05:28,327 --> 00:05:30,079
Over the past month he's seen her

44
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:31,622
three times a week.

45
00:05:31,622 --> 00:05:34,333
And on each occasion,
has shared her bedroom

46
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:35,751
with her for the evening.

47
00:05:35,751 --> 00:05:37,169
- You've definitely established that

48
00:05:37,169 --> 00:05:38,879
Miss Davis has no relatives?

49
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:40,089
- Correct, Mrs. Barker.

50
00:05:40,965 --> 00:05:43,425
The last remaining relative, an aunt,

51
00:05:43,425 --> 00:05:45,219
passed away last year.

52
00:05:45,219 --> 00:05:48,013
- But soon, I trust,
I shall be her relative.

53
00:05:48,013 --> 00:05:49,849
What a mating that will be.

54
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:52,142
The two greatest families reunited.

55
00:05:53,185 --> 00:05:54,395
- Only with her consent.

56
00:05:58,607 --> 00:05:59,441
- She'll consent.

57
00:06:04,071 --> 00:06:06,490
- The final thing is the holiday.

58
00:06:08,576 --> 00:06:10,035
- Is the architect going with her?

59
00:06:10,035 --> 00:06:13,873
- No sir, he can't get away.
- Then we have four weeks,

60
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:14,957
whatever her reaction.

61
00:06:16,625 --> 00:06:17,626
- It'll be positive.

62
00:06:19,295 --> 00:06:21,380
With a family as noble as hers,

63
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:22,423
I'm sure the old,

64
00:06:23,382 --> 00:06:26,635
the old thirst will not have died out.

65
00:06:26,635 --> 00:06:28,971
- Do stop deceiving yourself, Dr. Fraser.

66
00:06:28,971 --> 00:06:30,389
She's a strong willed woman.

67
00:06:31,307 --> 00:06:33,100
We may have to use force.

68
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:54,204
- There you are.

69
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,085
Okay, okay, just a minute.

70
00:07:12,681 --> 00:07:13,599
Yes.

71
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:15,267
<i>Hi.</i>

72
00:07:15,267 --> 00:07:16,727
- Oh hi.

73
00:07:16,727 --> 00:07:17,728
<i>When's your plane?</i>

74
00:07:17,728 --> 00:07:19,063
- Well I don't have to leave the house

75
00:07:19,063 --> 00:07:20,648
till about 12.

76
00:07:22,024 --> 00:07:24,693
Derek, could you
come over for a while?

77
00:07:24,693 --> 00:07:27,446
- Oh look, I could think
of nothing nicer, but

78
00:07:27,446 --> 00:07:28,948
I've gotta finish these plans.

79
00:07:30,532 --> 00:07:32,910
Look, I'm well aware that
it's Saturday morning.

80
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:37,269
Katie...

81
00:07:37,293 --> 00:07:38,999
how've you got your hair?

82
00:07:38,999 --> 00:07:39,833
- Up.

83
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:41,752
- Freckles?

84
00:07:42,711 --> 00:07:43,545
- Still there.

85
00:07:45,756 --> 00:07:48,175
- Look, now you have a
good holiday, all right?

86
00:07:48,175 --> 00:07:51,261
And rest, no work, you understand?

87
00:07:51,261 --> 00:07:52,179
- Don't go yet.

88
00:07:52,179 --> 00:07:53,931
- Look, I have all this
work to get through.

89
00:07:53,931 --> 00:07:56,350
<i>Oh, the bloody
cat, look all right.</i>

90
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:57,184
<i>Bye.</i>

91
00:07:58,644 --> 00:07:59,478
- Bye.

92
00:08:04,483 --> 00:08:06,276
- All right Mugs, what are you up to?

93
00:08:08,487 --> 00:08:09,655
Jesus.

94
00:08:18,414 --> 00:08:21,166
What are you doing, get out, go on!

95
00:08:21,166 --> 00:08:22,334
Get out of it.

96
00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:42,688
Stop that!

97
00:09:52,257 --> 00:09:54,676
- I knew the reaction would be negative.

98
00:09:54,676 --> 00:09:56,178
She should have gone under conditioning

99
00:09:56,178 --> 00:09:57,638
from the start.

100
00:09:57,638 --> 00:10:00,015
- Conditioning has nothing to do with it.

101
00:10:00,015 --> 00:10:01,433
She's just strong willed.

102
00:10:02,684 --> 00:10:04,353
Probably end up spending a fortune on her,

103
00:10:04,353 --> 00:10:06,063
achieving nothing.

104
00:10:06,063 --> 00:10:07,815
Except, perhaps, drive her insane.

105
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:57,739
<i>Kate, this is our symbol.</i>

106
00:10:57,739 --> 00:10:59,199
Does it mean anything to you?

107
00:11:04,746 --> 00:11:06,832
- Of course it doesn't.

108
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:09,960
- I wonder, Kate, whether
you're evading the issue.

109
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,378
Whether you begin to suspect why

110
00:11:11,378 --> 00:11:12,254
we brought you here.

111
00:11:12,254 --> 00:11:14,131
- That's exactly what I want to know.

112
00:11:16,758 --> 00:11:19,428
- Tell me all you know
about your ancestry.

113
00:11:19,428 --> 00:11:20,262
- Look I've had enough.

114
00:11:20,262 --> 00:11:22,055
Now tell me what I'm doing here and

115
00:11:22,055 --> 00:11:22,973
what you want from me.

116
00:11:22,973 --> 00:11:26,351
- All right, Kate, I'll explain to you.

117
00:11:27,686 --> 00:11:30,105
You're unaware that your
great, great-grandfather's

118
00:11:30,105 --> 00:11:31,440
name was Dotkin?

119
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,316
- So what?

120
00:11:32,316 --> 00:11:34,985
- And that he changed it to Davis in 1850

121
00:11:34,985 --> 00:11:37,237
when the family went to settle in Boston.

122
00:11:38,155 --> 00:11:41,158
And that Herr Dotkin
was a direct descendent

123
00:11:41,158 --> 00:11:43,327
of Countess Elizabeth Báthory?

124
00:11:47,289 --> 00:11:50,292
- There's a legacy, that's it, isn't it?

125
00:11:50,292 --> 00:11:51,793
Look, you can have it.

126
00:11:51,793 --> 00:11:53,086
Please take it.

127
00:11:55,756 --> 00:11:58,175
- Yes there is a legacy, to you from

128
00:11:58,175 --> 00:11:59,801
Elizabeth Báthory.

129
00:11:59,801 --> 00:12:01,011
Your ancestress.

130
00:12:05,557 --> 00:12:06,391
Do you see her medallion?

131
00:12:06,391 --> 00:12:10,479
Hyma, the Greek sign for human blood.

132
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:14,816
Welcome to the brotherhood, Miss Davis.

133
00:12:15,734 --> 00:12:16,526
Baroness.

134
00:12:36,546 --> 00:12:38,548
- This is not happening.

135
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:03,115
Good morning.

136
00:13:07,869 --> 00:13:09,288
How do we feel today?

137
00:13:17,838 --> 00:13:18,964
Careful it's hot.

138
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:44,531
- You bitch.

139
00:13:45,741 --> 00:13:47,159
You rotten bitch.

140
00:14:01,673 --> 00:14:02,591
- Vampires,

141
00:14:04,968 --> 00:14:06,053
we dislike that word.

142
00:14:07,763 --> 00:14:10,057
The brotherhood is something far nobler

143
00:14:10,057 --> 00:14:12,517
than peasant superstitions
give me credit for.

144
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:16,855
There's nothing
supernatural about us Kate.

145
00:14:16,855 --> 00:14:20,025
- No, we're simply a
superior race of people

146
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:22,152
who, over the centuries, have proved

147
00:14:22,152 --> 00:14:24,863
that the drinking of
the vital human essence

148
00:14:24,863 --> 00:14:27,240
confers youth, power.

149
00:14:28,533 --> 00:14:30,452
It's the ultimate aristocratic act.

150
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,251
<i>Would any member</i>

151
00:14:38,251 --> 00:14:40,921
<i>of groups R, S, and T who have not yet</i>

152
00:14:40,921 --> 00:14:43,090
<i>reported for their tranquillizer shots,</i>

153
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:45,509
<i>please do so immediately.</i>

154
00:14:45,509 --> 00:14:47,094
<i>Groups R, S, and T.</i>

155
00:14:57,646 --> 00:14:58,980
- 70,000 of you?

156
00:15:00,148 --> 00:15:03,110
- Of us, Kate, all round the world.

157
00:15:22,712 --> 00:15:25,257
- Where does it all come from, your drink?

158
00:15:30,846 --> 00:15:32,681
- These are our donors.

159
00:15:33,849 --> 00:15:36,935
Does the truth still frighten you so much?

160
00:15:36,935 --> 00:15:39,521
This is a farm, Kate,
in the fullest sense.

161
00:15:39,521 --> 00:15:41,189
One of many farms.

162
00:15:43,942 --> 00:15:45,861
- You're all mad.

163
00:15:49,239 --> 00:15:51,616
- I see reason is not enough.

164
00:15:51,616 --> 00:15:53,743
There's only one way.

165
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:11,219
- Ow, oh, ow.

166
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:23,148
- Kate?

167
00:16:24,691 --> 00:16:27,986
Kate, can you hear me?

168
00:16:31,573 --> 00:16:33,408
- Yes.

169
00:16:33,408 --> 00:16:36,286
- You're going on a little journey now.

170
00:16:38,705 --> 00:16:39,998
- Where?

171
00:16:39,998 --> 00:16:42,000
<i>You'll wake up there.</i>

172
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,836
<i>It's a place where bad girls go.</i>

173
00:16:46,379 --> 00:16:48,256
<i>Bad girls go.</i>

174
00:17:16,034 --> 00:17:17,285
- Good evening.

175
00:17:57,284 --> 00:17:58,535
<i>Closer.</i>

176
00:18:02,789 --> 00:18:06,084
- Superb, she is responding

177
00:18:07,502 --> 00:18:08,837
remarkably well.

178
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:15,260
- Are you quite sure
it's safe, Mrs. Barker?

179
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:18,763
I'm no medical man, but it seems to me

180
00:18:18,763 --> 00:18:20,473
that she's on the verge of insanity.

181
00:18:20,473 --> 00:18:22,559
- No it's standard conditioning procedure.

182
00:18:24,102 --> 00:18:25,937
You will not be deprived of what you want,

183
00:18:25,937 --> 00:18:26,938
Mr. Hodge.

184
00:18:34,112 --> 00:18:35,322
A totally different woman from the one

185
00:18:35,322 --> 00:18:36,906
we were observing a week ago.

186
00:18:51,171 --> 00:18:52,964
- Who authorized this?

187
00:18:52,964 --> 00:18:53,798
- I did.

188
00:18:54,841 --> 00:18:56,968
When you're away
Dr. Fraser, I'm in charge.

189
00:19:00,055 --> 00:19:01,139
- Let her out.

190
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:02,974
You could've killed her.

191
00:19:02,974 --> 00:19:05,018
No, she's resilient.

192
00:19:05,894 --> 00:19:07,395
- It's absolutely
unnecessary, there is no need

193
00:19:07,395 --> 00:19:09,814
to subject her to that kind of indignity.

194
00:19:13,401 --> 00:19:14,235
Kate?

195
00:19:15,695 --> 00:19:16,529
Kate?

196
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:20,283
It's all right.

197
00:19:20,283 --> 00:19:22,243
Someone will come and let you
out at once.

198
00:19:28,249 --> 00:19:29,292
- Look what gives you the right

199
00:19:29,292 --> 00:19:30,335
to put me through this?

200
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:33,546
- Kate, I am deeply sorry
for what's happened.

201
00:19:33,546 --> 00:19:34,964
But the most important thing
at the moment

202
00:19:34,964 --> 00:19:36,508
is that you get as much rest as you can.

203
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:37,550
- Don't give me that.

204
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:39,219
What were they trying to do to me?

205
00:19:40,261 --> 00:19:41,096
- Look.

206
00:19:42,555 --> 00:19:45,475
Look, I realise there
must be a lot of things

207
00:19:45,475 --> 00:19:47,394
that you find difficult to understand.

208
00:19:48,269 --> 00:19:49,187
and I will explain...

209
00:19:51,439 --> 00:19:52,857
in time.

210
00:19:55,193 --> 00:19:58,196
- But I don't want to be here.

211
00:19:58,196 --> 00:20:00,615
- I also promise you that what you've

212
00:20:00,615 --> 00:20:03,535
been through I will never
allow to happen again.

213
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:04,369
Just trust me.

214
00:20:05,453 --> 00:20:06,705
- Why should I trust you?

215
00:20:08,248 --> 00:20:10,041
- Look around, everybody's happy here.

216
00:20:10,041 --> 00:20:13,086
The farm's a bit like a commune, really.

217
00:20:15,964 --> 00:20:17,215
It's all right Kate.

218
00:20:17,215 --> 00:20:18,800
I wouldn't have it any other way.

219
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,427
- Are they free to leave?

220
00:20:20,427 --> 00:20:21,553
- They can't leave.

221
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:22,387
- Why not?

222
00:20:23,763 --> 00:20:25,348
- It's essential that they stay.

223
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:29,894
Come on.

224
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:17,942
- You're very lucky.

225
00:21:19,277 --> 00:21:20,528
Dr. Gauss has taken

226
00:21:20,528 --> 00:21:23,323
a real liking to you.

227
00:21:57,065 --> 00:21:58,733
<i>Attention please.</i>

228
00:21:58,733 --> 00:22:00,443
<i>Attention please.</i>

229
00:22:00,443 --> 00:22:01,820
<i>Would all members of groups</i>

230
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:05,824
<i>A, J, L, and Q</i>

231
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:07,325
<i>please enter the vans.</i>

232
00:22:08,243 --> 00:22:11,329
<i>Attention please, attention please.</i>

233
00:22:12,705 --> 00:22:15,875
<i>Groups A, J, L, and Q.</i>

234
00:22:18,336 --> 00:22:21,965
<i>Groups A, J, L, and Q.</i>

235
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:26,928
<i>Attention please, attention please.</i>

236
00:22:26,928 --> 00:22:30,098
<i>Groups A, J, L, and Q</i>

237
00:22:30,098 --> 00:22:31,850
<i>please enter the vans.</i>

238
00:22:41,651 --> 00:22:43,444
<i>Attention all process workers</i>

239
00:22:43,444 --> 00:22:46,281
<i>shift change in 15 minutes.</i>

240
00:22:46,281 --> 00:22:48,575
<i>Attention all process workers</i>

241
00:22:48,575 --> 00:22:51,286
<i>attention all process workers</i>

242
00:22:51,286 --> 00:22:53,580
<i>shift change in 15 minutes.</i>

243
00:23:54,432 --> 00:23:56,517
- Dr. Gauss I must talk to you.

244
00:23:59,354 --> 00:24:00,688
- Check with sterilization.

245
00:24:03,441 --> 00:24:05,443
- Dr. Fraser's program of so-called

246
00:24:05,443 --> 00:24:06,778
persuasion will fail.

247
00:24:06,778 --> 00:24:08,446
As I insisted from the start, there's only

248
00:24:08,446 --> 00:24:09,614
one solution.

249
00:24:09,614 --> 00:24:11,157
- Under no circumstances.

250
00:24:13,785 --> 00:24:15,161
- Eric you must admit there have

251
00:24:15,161 --> 00:24:16,871
been no signs of change.

252
00:24:16,871 --> 00:24:18,373
- Call a committee meeting.

253
00:24:18,373 --> 00:24:19,624
I insist on a vote.

254
00:24:22,335 --> 00:24:23,962
- Look,

255
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:25,546
if she comes to us of her own accord

256
00:24:25,546 --> 00:24:27,465
she'll be ours much, much, much

257
00:24:27,465 --> 00:24:28,383
more wholeheartedly.

258
00:24:28,383 --> 00:24:30,301
Now you must unlock her door.

259
00:24:46,734 --> 00:24:48,736
- Look, you let me out and I walk.

260
00:24:48,736 --> 00:24:50,154
That doesn't mean I accept what you're

261
00:24:50,154 --> 00:24:50,989
doing here.

262
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:56,202
- Listen Kate, I bought
time for you this morning.

263
00:24:57,161 --> 00:24:58,079
Use it wisely.

264
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:02,083
Just go anywhere you like, get to know us.

265
00:26:00,641 --> 00:26:02,477
- Where are those people going?

266
00:26:03,561 --> 00:26:05,605
- I expect they're shiners.

267
00:26:05,605 --> 00:26:08,608
I've been privileged to
have your people drink here.

268
00:26:08,608 --> 00:26:09,484
- My People?

269
00:26:11,611 --> 00:26:14,739
- Excuse me, I'm David.

270
00:26:16,324 --> 00:26:17,158
Leah and I,

271
00:26:18,493 --> 00:26:20,244
Leah and I are friends.

272
00:26:21,454 --> 00:26:25,750
Leah, the other day when you
came through,

273
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:27,460
the one you chose.

274
00:26:29,295 --> 00:26:31,130
- I never chose anyone.

275
00:26:33,841 --> 00:26:35,009
- We all assumed.

276
00:26:37,095 --> 00:26:39,055
They took her away right after.

277
00:26:42,975 --> 00:26:44,393
I just had to tell you.

278
00:26:46,479 --> 00:26:48,064
She's not very strong.

279
00:26:50,108 --> 00:26:54,028
Please, don't drink too much.

280
00:29:00,821 --> 00:29:03,616
- Excuse me, do you have a phone?

281
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:05,076
My car's broken down.

282
00:29:06,994 --> 00:29:09,497
Or, look, can you drive
me to the nearest town?

283
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:15,253
I'll pay, I'll pay a lot.

284
00:29:18,297 --> 00:29:19,507
Can I buy that truck?

285
00:29:21,634 --> 00:29:23,678
Do you hear me?

286
00:29:25,513 --> 00:29:28,808
I'll pay you $5,000.

287
00:29:28,808 --> 00:29:30,518
Please.

288
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:32,687
Please?

289
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:04,737
Hey!

290
00:32:17,935 --> 00:32:19,770
- You all right?

291
00:32:22,064 --> 00:32:24,525
- Yes thank you, I'm just filling up.

292
00:32:25,651 --> 00:32:26,944
- Are you from the farm?

293
00:32:26,944 --> 00:32:29,321
- Yes, yes I am.

294
00:32:29,321 --> 00:32:30,698
- Sure I can't help you sister?

295
00:32:30,698 --> 00:32:32,950
- Ah, no thank you,
I'm just finishing off.

296
00:32:34,243 --> 00:32:37,246
- Okay, hope we see you at the festival.

297
00:32:37,246 --> 00:32:38,414
<i>Okay.</i>

298
00:33:57,826 --> 00:33:59,245
- Kate, how nice.

299
00:34:01,622 --> 00:34:03,666
She was on her way to greet the convoy.

300
00:34:03,666 --> 00:34:05,543
Ride back with us.

301
00:34:24,186 --> 00:34:27,356
I'll ask a man to return the truck.

302
00:34:27,356 --> 00:34:30,818
Wasn't it kind of
Mr. Dichter to lend it to you?

303
00:34:30,818 --> 00:34:32,736
Not our Dichter?

304
00:34:33,821 --> 00:34:35,656
Yes.

305
00:34:43,747 --> 00:34:44,957
- Who are those people?

306
00:34:44,957 --> 00:34:46,834
- They're our visitors for the festival.

307
00:34:46,834 --> 00:34:48,544
They come here from all over the world.

308
00:34:48,544 --> 00:34:49,753
- Tonight's the opening ceremony

309
00:34:49,753 --> 00:34:51,505
and I'll be ofﬁciating.

310
00:34:51,505 --> 00:34:53,132
You're, ah,

311
00:34:53,132 --> 00:34:54,466
you're more than welcome to come.

312
00:34:54,466 --> 00:34:55,884
- Yes you must join us, Kate.

313
00:34:57,094 --> 00:34:58,637
<i>Attention please,</i>

314
00:34:58,637 --> 00:35:00,431
<i>attention please.</i>

315
00:35:00,431 --> 00:35:02,099
<i>Would all visitors wishing to tour</i>

316
00:35:02,099 --> 00:35:04,602
<i>the processing complex
please board the bus.</i>

317
00:35:12,109 --> 00:35:13,277
- Chief reason for the establishment

318
00:35:13,277 --> 00:35:16,196
of the dairy in 1939 was the brotherhood's

319
00:35:16,196 --> 00:35:18,949
growing concern about the
health of its members.

320
00:35:18,949 --> 00:35:21,785
Such diseases as malaria, hepatitis,

321
00:35:21,785 --> 00:35:23,746
and anaphylactic shock,
which is the result

322
00:35:23,746 --> 00:35:25,914
of drinking blood
containing allergy-producing

323
00:35:25,914 --> 00:35:28,917
penicillin, but common
amongst traditional drinkers.

324
00:35:33,130 --> 00:35:35,382
The dairy brings our lifestyle up to date.

325
00:35:36,675 --> 00:35:38,677
Each carefully selected blood cow

326
00:35:38,677 --> 00:35:40,137
is accompanied to the village by

327
00:35:40,137 --> 00:35:41,430
an elaborate medical file.

328
00:35:42,306 --> 00:35:44,808
Before the blood is tapped and cartonned,

329
00:35:44,808 --> 00:35:47,269
each donor is placed on a stringent diet

330
00:35:47,269 --> 00:35:50,272
and subjected to scrupulous
hematological tests

331
00:35:50,272 --> 00:35:51,940
for any blood contaminants.

332
00:35:53,609 --> 00:35:55,277
We ensure that all packaged blood

333
00:35:55,277 --> 00:35:58,238
is absolutely free from
anti-tetanus serum,

334
00:35:58,238 --> 00:36:00,949
pollens, and antibiotics, any of which

335
00:36:00,949 --> 00:36:02,701
may produce hyper-immune reactions

336
00:36:02,701 --> 00:36:03,702
to certain drinkers.

337
00:36:07,623 --> 00:36:08,874
Move along now please.

338
00:38:34,311 --> 00:38:36,146
- You were invited to that ceremony,

339
00:38:36,146 --> 00:38:38,440
we'd have prepared you for it.

340
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:40,526
Increasingly Kate you seem determined

341
00:38:40,526 --> 00:38:41,985
to create difficulties.

342
00:38:41,985 --> 00:38:44,613
- We should leave her
alone, she needs time.

343
00:38:44,613 --> 00:38:46,532
- Already you've come dangerously close

344
00:38:46,532 --> 00:38:48,116
to spoiling things for others.

345
00:38:48,116 --> 00:38:50,494
Mr. Dichter, for example,
at the chicken farm.

346
00:38:50,494 --> 00:38:52,788
The Hodge's chose him
for our highest honor.

347
00:38:52,788 --> 00:38:54,581
If they'd even suspected that he tried

348
00:38:54,665 --> 00:38:55,791
to help you to escape.

349
00:38:58,001 --> 00:38:59,670
- I stole that truck.

350
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:01,421
- You must understand that the merest

351
00:39:01,421 --> 00:39:03,882
question mark would have
disqualified him.

352
00:39:03,882 --> 00:39:06,176
Happily I was able to
keep the incident quiet.

353
00:39:08,470 --> 00:39:10,514
- If I made trouble for that old man,

354
00:39:15,143 --> 00:39:15,978
I'm sorry.

355
00:39:18,438 --> 00:39:20,107
- Now you're being constructive.

356
00:39:54,641 --> 00:39:55,893
Don't feel sorry for him.

357
00:39:56,894 --> 00:39:59,605
It's the highest service
a prisoner can render,

358
00:39:59,605 --> 00:40:02,816
to be exsanguinated, drained.

359
00:40:08,447 --> 00:40:09,531
- Let me out!

360
00:40:12,784 --> 00:40:14,161
Orderly.

361
00:40:15,537 --> 00:40:17,205
<i>Get off me!</i>

362
00:40:34,264 --> 00:40:36,058
They're from Dr. Fraser.

363
00:40:39,645 --> 00:40:41,855
- Put them down and wait.

364
00:40:53,909 --> 00:40:56,370
If only you'd talk things out.

365
00:40:56,370 --> 00:40:57,579
You would've come to understand

366
00:40:57,579 --> 00:40:59,039
why you're flying so violently

367
00:40:59,039 --> 00:41:00,749
in the face of your instincts.

368
00:41:02,209 --> 00:41:04,336
And they are your instincts.

369
00:41:08,173 --> 00:41:10,258
We've done a lot of research on you, Kate.

370
00:41:10,258 --> 00:41:11,927
You holidayed at your uncle's pig farm

371
00:41:11,927 --> 00:41:13,261
when you were 11, remember?

372
00:41:14,596 --> 00:41:16,390
And you saw pigs slaughtered?

373
00:41:17,766 --> 00:41:20,560
What emotion did that arouse in you,

374
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:22,479
when you saw throats slashed?

375
00:41:23,355 --> 00:41:24,189
Blood.

376
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:32,364
- It made me feel sick.

377
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:34,950
- Your reaction was normal.

378
00:41:36,284 --> 00:41:37,953
All of our people brought up outside

379
00:41:37,953 --> 00:41:41,123
have difficulty accepting
their natural feelings.

380
00:41:41,123 --> 00:41:43,917
So they hide them beneath
a mask of revulsion.

381
00:42:04,396 --> 00:42:05,230
- Ah!

382
00:42:27,586 --> 00:42:30,380
- I'm going to help you in two ways, Kate.

383
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:33,216
Not just to live with your instincts

384
00:42:33,216 --> 00:42:34,176
but to enjoy—

385
00:42:35,577 --> 00:42:36,553
<i>I can't breathe.</i>

386
00:42:36,553 --> 00:42:37,929
- Don't be frightened Kate.

387
00:42:40,182 --> 00:42:41,808
What do you see?

388
00:42:42,934 --> 00:42:44,227
Who?

389
00:42:44,227 --> 00:42:46,563
- Derek.
<i>- You want Derek?</i>

390
00:42:47,814 --> 00:42:49,941
<i>I'll send for him if you like.</i>

391
00:42:49,941 --> 00:42:50,776
Help!

392
00:42:50,776 --> 00:42:53,278
<i>Derek,
Kate's calling for you.</i>

393
00:43:01,411 --> 00:43:03,330
We've edited her two days of reminiscence

394
00:43:03,330 --> 00:43:06,291
into a fairly representative 90 minutes.

395
00:43:06,291 --> 00:43:07,834
Before I play it through, Dr. Gauss will

396
00:43:07,834 --> 00:43:10,087
take you over the psychometer chart.

397
00:43:10,087 --> 00:43:12,214
This shows the chief areas of weakness,

398
00:43:12,214 --> 00:43:14,424
how we intend to exploit them.

399
00:43:14,424 --> 00:43:15,258
<i>You can't put her through</i>

400
00:43:15,258 --> 00:43:16,635
<i>that in two weeks.</i>

401
00:43:16,635 --> 00:43:18,303
<i>The dangers
of psychic engineering</i>

402
00:43:18,303 --> 00:43:19,679
<i>are exaggerated.</i>

403
00:43:19,763 --> 00:43:21,306
<i>The New York experiments have shown</i>

404
00:43:21,306 --> 00:43:23,266
<i>that the relief periods which precede</i>

405
00:43:23,266 --> 00:43:25,644
<i>each intensification, do generally keep</i>

406
00:43:25,644 --> 00:43:27,062
<i>the patient's sanity intact.</i>

407
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:30,440
<i>She's still in narcosis?</i>

408
00:43:53,964 --> 00:43:54,798
Hi.

409
00:43:56,091 --> 00:43:57,008
It's lunchtime.

410
00:44:07,060 --> 00:44:09,146
- Where is this?
- Hm,

411
00:44:09,146 --> 00:44:10,522
what are you talking about?

412
00:44:13,650 --> 00:44:15,068
- I've got a headache.

413
00:44:16,862 --> 00:44:18,321
And my arm stings.

414
00:44:20,198 --> 00:44:21,324
Well I couldn't blame an ant

415
00:44:21,324 --> 00:44:22,576
for having a bite of you.

416
00:44:30,959 --> 00:44:32,586
- Derek!

417
00:44:32,586 --> 00:44:33,420
- Kate.

418
00:44:38,258 --> 00:44:39,426
- I thought...

419
00:45:50,330 --> 00:45:52,582
Derek, you always forget the salt.

420
00:45:52,582 --> 00:45:53,583
I didn't forget it.

421
00:45:53,583 --> 00:45:55,543
Don't you know it's poisonous?

422
00:45:55,543 --> 00:45:56,836
- Hypochondriac.

423
00:46:01,967 --> 00:46:02,801
-Ah.

424
00:46:05,345 --> 00:46:06,221
- Where's the car?

425
00:46:07,138 --> 00:46:08,473
- It's where we left it.

426
00:46:08,473 --> 00:46:10,558
- Funny I don't remember us driving here.

427
00:46:13,478 --> 00:46:14,312
What day is it?

428
00:46:16,398 --> 00:46:17,440
- You all right Kate?

429
00:46:19,359 --> 00:46:20,360
- Oh, it's weird.

430
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:21,611
I thought I'd lost you.

431
00:46:22,696 --> 00:46:25,282
- Hm, hm, now, now we eat.

432
00:46:59,399 --> 00:47:00,984
- Derek?

433
00:47:00,984 --> 00:47:02,652
<i>It's good, Kate.</i>

434
00:47:02,652 --> 00:47:04,738
Drink it.

435
00:47:04,738 --> 00:47:06,406
It's love.

436
00:47:07,991 --> 00:47:10,577
It's youth.

437
00:47:10,577 --> 00:47:12,537
It's power.

438
00:47:19,961 --> 00:47:21,129
- Derek?

439
00:47:41,274 --> 00:47:43,026
- You have honored me

440
00:47:46,905 --> 00:47:47,739
Baroness.

441
00:49:49,486 --> 00:49:51,613
- Miss Davis, what's happened?

442
00:49:51,613 --> 00:49:53,239
You're frozen, come in.

443
00:49:53,239 --> 00:49:55,074
I put the heater on.

444
00:50:00,371 --> 00:50:01,915
Come, come Miss Davis.

445
00:50:03,333 --> 00:50:05,376
We must get you out of those wet clothes.

446
00:50:05,376 --> 00:50:06,211
- Lori.

447
00:50:07,545 --> 00:50:09,005
How long have I been away?

448
00:50:10,798 --> 00:50:12,258
- Beg pardon miss?

449
00:50:12,258 --> 00:50:14,135
- How many days?

450
00:50:14,135 --> 00:50:15,386
- Let me get a doctor.

451
00:50:16,346 --> 00:50:17,931
I don't want a doctor.

452
00:50:18,890 --> 00:50:23,061
- But miss, you only left
the house an hour ago

453
00:50:23,061 --> 00:50:23,895
for work.

454
00:50:30,610 --> 00:50:32,946
- Oh Lori, it really is you.

455
00:50:34,948 --> 00:50:36,074
- Oh miss.

456
00:50:37,367 --> 00:50:38,368
Come, come.

457
00:50:40,787 --> 00:50:43,331
You go ahead miss, I'll
get you some dry clothes.

458
00:52:27,477 --> 00:52:30,063
You mustn't be ashamed miss.

459
00:52:30,063 --> 00:52:32,649
You're getting the thirst, that's all.

460
00:52:32,649 --> 00:52:34,901
The thirst is in all of us.

461
00:52:38,696 --> 00:52:41,324
- Not in me.

462
00:52:41,324 --> 00:52:43,493
Not me.

463
00:52:43,493 --> 00:52:45,411
Not me.

464
00:52:51,250 --> 00:52:53,169
<i>Don't be upset, Kate.</i>

465
00:52:54,087 --> 00:52:55,546
<i>You'll love boarding school.</i>

466
00:52:56,923 --> 00:52:59,676
<i>Lots of other five year olds to play with.</i>

467
00:52:59,676 --> 00:53:01,094
<i>And mummy will come and see you</i>

468
00:53:01,094 --> 00:53:02,345
<i>whenever she can.</i>

469
00:53:41,634 --> 00:53:42,468
<i>Kate.</i>

470
00:53:43,803 --> 00:53:44,721
<i>Wake up, Kate.</i>

471
00:53:51,018 --> 00:53:53,104
<i>I'm so sorry to tell you this Kate,</i>

472
00:53:54,313 --> 00:53:55,148
<i>but your mother,</i>

473
00:53:56,524 --> 00:53:58,609
<i>your mother won't be coming back.</i>

474
00:54:01,154 --> 00:54:01,988
<i>She died.</i>

475
00:54:42,278 --> 00:54:43,362
- Mother?

476
00:54:43,362 --> 00:54:44,822
<i>You must forget the past</i>

477
00:54:44,822 --> 00:54:45,656
<i>now, Kate.</i>

478
00:54:46,491 --> 00:54:48,868
<i>Cut your ties with the past.</i>

479
00:54:58,878 --> 00:55:00,588
- Mother?

480
00:55:09,347 --> 00:55:11,307
Mother?

481
00:55:29,951 --> 00:55:32,370
<i>Your mother is dead, Kate.</i>

482
00:55:32,370 --> 00:55:34,038
<i>The past is dead.</i>

483
00:55:36,749 --> 00:55:37,667
- Mrs. Barker!

484
00:55:40,878 --> 00:55:41,921
Where are you?

485
00:55:43,214 --> 00:55:44,048
Please?

486
00:55:47,093 --> 00:55:48,678
I know you're watching me.

487
00:56:00,022 --> 00:56:01,023
Miss Davis?

488
00:56:02,567 --> 00:56:05,486
Miss Davis, drink.

489
00:56:23,671 --> 00:56:24,505
- Lori!

490
00:56:25,464 --> 00:56:27,049
Lori I know you're here.

491
00:56:30,303 --> 00:56:31,470
Lori.

492
00:56:31,470 --> 00:56:32,388
- Yes Miss Davis?

493
00:56:33,723 --> 00:56:35,725
- Lori please help me.

494
01:01:37,860 --> 01:01:39,361
This is happening.

495
01:02:06,442 --> 01:02:07,973
<i>Kate.</i>

496
01:03:35,269 --> 01:03:38,147
- Gentlemen, on the 14th and final day

497
01:03:38,147 --> 01:03:40,691
of programming, she has no memory

498
01:03:40,691 --> 01:03:42,651
of her previous experiences.

499
01:03:43,652 --> 01:03:46,280
But as you can see,
she's deeply conditioned.

500
01:03:46,280 --> 01:03:49,116
Notice the reflex cupping of the hands,

501
01:03:49,116 --> 01:03:50,534
the questing.

502
01:03:50,534 --> 01:03:52,870
She now senses that somewhere there is

503
01:03:52,870 --> 01:03:54,830
a key to her dilemma without being

504
01:03:54,830 --> 01:03:56,332
aware of what it is.

505
01:03:56,332 --> 01:03:58,500
When that key is presented to her,

506
01:03:58,500 --> 01:04:00,878
she now recognizes it, Dr. Fraser,

507
01:04:00,878 --> 01:04:02,963
rejoices in it.

508
01:04:02,963 --> 01:04:06,592
- Hm, well, let us hope that in spite

509
01:04:06,675 --> 01:04:09,845
of all this we're still
able to earn her respect.

510
01:07:11,568 --> 01:07:13,445
- This is your destiny, Kate.

511
01:07:13,445 --> 01:07:14,279
Destiny.

512
01:07:56,613 --> 01:07:58,073
- Hyma perpetuis.

513
01:09:51,728 --> 01:09:53,772
- Destiny Kate, destiny.

514
01:11:48,011 --> 01:11:49,387
<i>I'm by no means convinced</i>

515
01:11:49,387 --> 01:11:50,555
<i>that she is ours yet.</i>

516
01:11:52,516 --> 01:11:55,227
<i>The real test is how her
indoctrination stands up</i>

517
01:11:55,227 --> 01:11:56,895
<i>in the outside world.</i>

518
01:11:56,895 --> 01:11:58,939
- Miss Pearson from the office, miss.

519
01:11:58,939 --> 01:12:00,398
- Oh thank you Lori.

520
01:12:00,398 --> 01:12:01,608
Martha, hello.

521
01:12:01,608 --> 01:12:04,027
- I expected to find you in bed.

522
01:12:04,027 --> 01:12:05,779
- What with all this work I've got to do?

523
01:12:05,779 --> 01:12:08,031
- Well it was supposed to be a sick call,

524
01:12:08,031 --> 01:12:10,617
but I brought this just in case.

525
01:12:10,617 --> 01:12:12,227
<i>I think you know me too well.</i>

526
01:12:13,912 --> 01:12:15,330
- What does the doctor say?

527
01:12:15,330 --> 01:12:17,582
- Oh he thinks I've
got some sort of virus.

528
01:12:17,582 --> 01:12:19,709
I just don't feel like eating anything.

529
01:12:19,709 --> 01:12:21,628
Yet at the same time I feel hunger.

530
01:12:21,628 --> 01:12:24,339
I don't even feel like I've had a holiday.

531
01:12:24,339 --> 01:12:25,882
And I keep having these dreams.

532
01:12:29,970 --> 01:12:31,263
It's almost as if,

533
01:12:34,683 --> 01:12:35,767
hey Martha,

534
01:12:37,185 --> 01:12:39,771
how long has Lori worked for me?

535
01:12:42,440 --> 01:12:43,900
- A year.

536
01:12:48,947 --> 01:12:50,031
- Back to work.

537
01:12:50,031 --> 01:12:51,867
Most urgently to Ted Hearst.

538
01:12:51,867 --> 01:12:53,577
Now can you please send us the new

539
01:12:53,577 --> 01:12:56,580
lipstick pack designs and color charts?

540
01:13:28,486 --> 01:13:29,988
Right, these bunch seem fine to me.

541
01:13:29,988 --> 01:13:32,240
They can be sent off to
the legal department.

542
01:13:33,408 --> 01:13:34,242
- Right.

543
01:13:36,453 --> 01:13:38,955
- Oh Martha, we've been
working for two hours

544
01:13:38,955 --> 01:13:40,916
and I haven't even offered you coffee.

545
01:13:40,916 --> 01:13:41,750
- I'll get some.

546
01:13:41,750 --> 01:13:43,084
- No, no, I'm the hostess here.

547
01:14:37,597 --> 01:14:40,100
- Miss Davis, shall I send a copy

548
01:14:40,100 --> 01:14:41,685
of the contract with this letter?

549
01:14:43,603 --> 01:14:44,521
Miss Davis?

550
01:15:17,012 --> 01:15:19,347
Is there something you want?

551
01:15:37,574 --> 01:15:39,159
What are you doing?

552
01:16:31,252 --> 01:16:32,879
- Let me see, let me see!

553
01:16:39,969 --> 01:16:42,347
- Oh I had another bad dream.

554
01:16:45,517 --> 01:16:47,477
Was it a dream?

555
01:16:52,774 --> 01:16:54,192
- Come on.

556
01:16:56,152 --> 01:16:59,531
Come on, I'll get you a
warm drink or something.

557
01:16:59,531 --> 01:17:02,200
- No Derek, stay with me.

558
01:17:07,038 --> 01:17:07,914
No!

559
01:17:07,914 --> 01:17:09,707
Leave it on.

560
01:17:19,759 --> 01:17:21,219
<i>Good night.</i>

561
01:17:22,178 --> 01:17:23,096
<i>I love you.</i>

562
01:17:52,125 --> 01:17:54,294
- Oh Derek, I'm sorry.

563
01:17:54,294 --> 01:17:56,796
Please forgive me, I'm sorry.

564
01:18:08,892 --> 01:18:10,685
- We have failed.

565
01:18:10,685 --> 01:18:13,229
She remains in a state of confusion.

566
01:18:13,229 --> 01:18:14,564
- As long as her feelings are mixed

567
01:18:14,564 --> 01:18:17,150
she's liable to run to
someone and confess.

568
01:18:17,150 --> 01:18:20,486
Everything that we've built
up here would be lost.

569
01:18:20,486 --> 01:18:22,947
Even for the descendent
of so noble a family

570
01:18:22,947 --> 01:18:24,949
the risk isn't worth taking.

571
01:18:24,949 --> 01:18:27,452
We must start on more
conditioning immediately.

572
01:18:28,912 --> 01:18:31,206
- I won't allow that.

573
01:18:31,206 --> 01:18:32,957
I don't think she could take it.

574
01:18:32,957 --> 01:18:34,500
- Save your arguments for tomorrow's

575
01:18:34,500 --> 01:18:36,044
committee meeting.

576
01:18:36,044 --> 01:18:38,004
The chairman will be there.

577
01:18:38,004 --> 01:18:38,838
He'll decide.

578
01:18:42,175 --> 01:18:43,885
- Another danger?

579
01:18:43,885 --> 01:18:46,512
- No, Derek's all right.

580
01:18:47,388 --> 01:18:48,306
He'll come around.

581
01:19:07,867 --> 01:19:09,535
- Where's Derek?

582
01:19:09,535 --> 01:19:13,331
- It's all right, he's being looked after.

583
01:19:13,331 --> 01:19:14,832
Why don't you get into bed.

584
01:19:14,832 --> 01:19:15,667
Hm?

585
01:19:20,129 --> 01:19:22,507
Let's have a look at you.

586
01:19:22,507 --> 01:19:23,883
- What's happening to Derek?

587
01:19:25,760 --> 01:19:27,011
- Kate, they're not satisfied with the way

588
01:19:27,011 --> 01:19:28,805
that the conditioning's been going.

589
01:19:28,805 --> 01:19:29,764
They're having a meeting tomorrow

590
01:19:29,764 --> 01:19:31,432
and I think the vote will go against you.

591
01:19:31,432 --> 01:19:32,976
I'm going to try and get you out.

592
01:19:32,976 --> 01:19:34,185
- You'd go against them?

593
01:19:35,770 --> 01:19:37,063
- It's a clear choice.

594
01:19:37,063 --> 01:19:38,189
Either with the will of the rebel

595
01:19:39,274 --> 01:19:40,566
or serve.

596
01:19:40,566 --> 01:19:42,527
- I'm not leaving here without Derek.

597
01:19:43,444 --> 01:19:45,780
- That's impossible, it's
already too much of a risk.

598
01:19:50,618 --> 01:19:52,245
All right, I'll come
for you in the morning.

599
01:20:01,629 --> 01:20:02,547
And get some rest.

600
01:20:29,032 --> 01:20:31,451
- Dr. Fraser, good morning.

601
01:20:31,451 --> 01:20:32,285
- Morning.

602
01:20:32,285 --> 01:20:33,953
Thought you'd be finished by now.

603
01:20:33,953 --> 01:20:34,954
- Well I just have, actually.

604
01:20:34,954 --> 01:20:36,414
Mrs. Barker is still working.

605
01:20:36,414 --> 01:20:37,957
I was coming to phone you.

606
01:20:37,957 --> 01:20:39,584
I just wanted you to know that, ah,

607
01:20:39,584 --> 01:20:40,835
I'll be voting on your side.

608
01:20:40,835 --> 01:20:41,753
- Can we discuss this later?

609
01:20:41,753 --> 01:20:43,504
I've got a patient.

610
01:20:54,891 --> 01:20:56,017
It's all right, it's all right.

611
01:20:56,017 --> 01:20:56,976
- Who are you?

612
01:20:56,976 --> 01:20:58,478
- There's a hut in the bush.

613
01:20:58,478 --> 01:20:59,854
I'm gonna take and hide you there.

614
01:20:59,854 --> 01:21:01,064
Kate will join us later.

615
01:21:02,315 --> 01:21:03,941
- Why, why are you helping me?

616
01:21:03,941 --> 01:21:04,901
- I'm helping Kate.

617
01:21:08,029 --> 01:21:08,863
Okay, come on.

618
01:21:35,890 --> 01:21:38,059
You stay as close to me as you can.

619
01:21:38,059 --> 01:21:38,893
Come on.

620
01:23:06,647 --> 01:23:10,067
- Well, well, well, Dr. Fraser.

621
01:23:11,694 --> 01:23:13,029
A bit early to be taking the prisoner

622
01:23:13,029 --> 01:23:14,572
for his morning walk, isn't it?

623
01:23:20,786 --> 01:23:23,289
This man is an A security prisoner.

624
01:23:23,289 --> 01:23:25,625
Show me his release authorization.

625
01:23:29,670 --> 01:23:30,505
- Run!

626
01:23:51,817 --> 01:23:52,902
- Help, help!

627
01:25:15,860 --> 01:25:18,154
- Dr. Fraser, there's a
blockage in No. 3 vat.

628
01:25:19,113 --> 01:25:21,699
- Yes, all right, contact Dr. Gauss.

629
01:25:21,699 --> 01:25:24,994
Tell him that... tell him
I'll be here in two minutes.

630
01:25:38,215 --> 01:25:40,051
- Eric, Eric!

631
01:25:40,051 --> 01:25:41,636
They need you back in the dairy.

632
01:25:41,636 --> 01:25:43,804
There's a block in the main vat.

633
01:25:43,804 --> 01:25:45,431
You can't take her!

634
01:25:45,431 --> 01:25:46,349
- Get back!

635
01:26:53,916 --> 01:26:55,126
- Mr. Hodge, I've found it,

636
01:26:55,126 --> 01:26:57,461
what's causing the blockage.

637
01:27:35,416 --> 01:27:37,293
- Where are we going now?

638
01:27:37,293 --> 01:27:38,502
- Well we have to stay undercover.

639
01:27:38,502 --> 01:27:39,336
I have a place.

640
01:27:42,673 --> 01:27:43,507
- Dr. Fraser,

641
01:27:47,803 --> 01:27:48,637
thank you.

642
01:27:51,474 --> 01:27:52,516
- You'll find that there
are a lot of people

643
01:27:52,516 --> 01:27:53,392
like me who are

644
01:27:55,144 --> 01:27:57,146
willing to serve.

645
01:27:58,189 --> 01:27:59,106
You'll see Derek very soon.

646
01:27:59,106 --> 01:28:01,358
The house is just over here.

647
01:28:10,659 --> 01:28:12,536
This is my secret retreat.

648
01:28:12,536 --> 01:28:14,121
Had it for 10 years.

649
01:28:14,121 --> 01:28:14,955
Through there.

650
01:28:26,717 --> 01:28:27,551
<i>Derek?</i>

651
01:28:30,054 --> 01:28:31,222
<i>It's all right,
we'll be with him shortly.</i>

652
01:28:49,031 --> 01:28:49,865
- Derek?

653
01:28:57,706 --> 01:28:59,083
Derek?

654
01:29:23,107 --> 01:29:25,192
- And no one but you

655
01:29:25,192 --> 01:29:27,778
shall drink a drop of him.

656
01:29:36,954 --> 01:29:38,581
- No.

657
01:29:48,841 --> 01:29:50,593
Turn that off.

658
01:29:50,593 --> 01:29:53,012
I said turn that off!

659
01:29:54,680 --> 01:29:56,640
Derek, Derek.

660
01:29:56,640 --> 01:29:59,018
Now get out.

661
01:29:59,018 --> 01:30:01,812
Get out!

662
01:30:01,812 --> 01:30:04,857
Derek, Derek, I'm sorry.

663
01:30:04,857 --> 01:30:07,902
I'm sorry Derek, Derek.

664
01:30:07,902 --> 01:30:11,322
I'm sorry, Derek.

665
01:30:11,322 --> 01:30:13,574
Derek.

666
01:30:14,825 --> 01:30:16,160
I'm sorry Derek.

667
01:31:42,788 --> 01:31:43,622
Please.

668
01:31:47,710 --> 01:31:50,087
Please give me another chance.

669
01:31:53,424 --> 01:31:55,259
- Photis vanium

670
01:31:56,218 --> 01:31:59,346
Disirupt hyma.

671
01:32:07,438 --> 01:32:08,439
- Please, let me,

672
01:32:13,110 --> 01:32:14,570
let me be one of you.

673
01:32:21,660 --> 01:32:23,370
I am.

674
01:32:30,335 --> 01:32:31,670
I am one of you.

675
01:33:04,203 --> 01:33:05,579
I am one of you.

676
01:33:07,998 --> 01:33:11,335
<i>I am one of you,
at last.</i>

677
01:33:12,419 --> 01:33:13,962
I knew your conditioning program

678
01:33:13,962 --> 01:33:15,798
would succeed in the end, Dr. Fraser.

679
01:33:17,174 --> 01:33:19,468
As head of the Hodge family, I will be

680
01:33:19,468 --> 01:33:21,053
forever indebted to you.

681
01:33:21,053 --> 01:33:23,889
As a result of your work, our two greatest

682
01:33:23,889 --> 01:33:26,809
families will be permanently united.

683
01:33:26,809 --> 01:33:29,019
You have my deepest
admiration, Dr. Fraser.

684
01:33:29,978 --> 01:33:31,438
<i>I did only
that which was necessary</i>

685
01:33:31,438 --> 01:33:34,066
<i>to ensure her happiness.</i>
