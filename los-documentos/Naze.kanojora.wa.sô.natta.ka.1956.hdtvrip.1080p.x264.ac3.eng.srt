<i>Every girl in this school</i>

18
00:01:59,063 --> 00:02:01,636
<i>has fallen into bad habits.</i>

19
00:02:01,989 --> 00:02:06,126
<i>These children have arisen from
the chaos at the end of the war.</i>

20
00:02:07,577 --> 00:02:09,776
<i>One girl is a kleptomaniac,</i>

21
00:02:09,876 --> 00:02:14,569
<i>one has the habit of lying,
another is addicted to stimulants.</i>

22
00:02:15,266 --> 00:02:17,266
<i>One girl wants to see the world.</i>

23
00:02:17,668 --> 00:02:20,681
<i>One can't help gambling
or is a pyromaniac.</i>

24
00:02:20,903 --> 00:02:23,593
<i>And one sold herself to get money...</i>

25
00:02:25,183 --> 00:02:27,579
<i>Let's not expose any more.</i>

26
00:02:28,183 --> 00:02:32,162
<i>They are not naturally bad.</i>

27
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:37,841
<i>After coming here</i>

28
00:02:38,144 --> 00:02:41,161
<i>their improvement is remarkable.</i>

29
00:02:41,939 --> 00:02:46,697
<i>It is like a sick person
trying to get out of bed...</i>

30
00:02:46,954 --> 00:02:51,560
<i>and who rapidly gets better.</i>

31
00:02:53,951 --> 00:02:57,377
<i>They are good as long as they are here.</i>

32
00:02:57,963 --> 00:03:00,430
<i>But, when they go out into the world,</i>

33
00:03:00,941 --> 00:03:05,361
<i>many of them return here heartbroken.</i>

34
00:03:08,106 --> 00:03:10,057
<i>As for life in this school,</i>

35
00:03:10,485 --> 00:03:14,928
<i>in the morning they study
according to their level.</i>

36
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:19,448
<i>However, there are those
who do not wish to study.</i>

37
00:03:20,262 --> 00:03:23,286
<i>And we do not force them.</i>

38
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:29,435
<i>In the afternoon,
they do piecework.</i>

39
00:03:30,497 --> 00:03:35,080
<i>The girls here no longer know how to laugh
from the bottom of their hearts.</i>

40
00:03:36,311 --> 00:03:37,513
<i>Then</i>

41
00:03:37,613 --> 00:03:40,956
<i>we got them this job
hand painting okame masks.</i>

42
00:03:41,485 --> 00:03:43,056
<i>Because we hope</i>

43
00:03:43,829 --> 00:03:47,922
<i>they will laugh some day
just like an okame.</i>

44
00:03:50,072 --> 00:03:55,145
<i>They divide up their earnings:</i>

45
00:03:56,024 --> 00:03:58,182
<i>One third is for food.</i>

46
00:03:58,963 --> 00:04:02,461
<i>One third for clothing
and daily necessities.</i>

47
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:06,373
<i>The rest they save.</i>

48
00:04:06,676 --> 00:04:09,743
<i>Or some send money to their families.</i>

49
00:04:13,469 --> 00:04:16,513
<i>They cook by turns.</i>

50
00:04:16,805 --> 00:04:20,012
<i>There are always
five girls on duty.</i>

51
00:04:26,133 --> 00:04:29,709
<i>From now on, we will try to describe</i>

52
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:34,381
<i>events inspired by a true story.</i>

53
00:04:36,613 --> 00:04:39,119
<i>Hiroko HATA   Birth: 25 May 1938
Feb - May 1955:

54
00:04:39,219 --> 00:04:45,235
<i>Removal of household goods, staying out
without permission, smoking, vagrancy.</i>

55
00:04:45,632 --> 00:04:49,718
Many of the girls in this school
are from poor families.

56
00:04:49,985 --> 00:04:53,402
But you come from
a wealthy, well-known family in Iyo.

57
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:56,439
Why did you run away from home?

58
00:04:56,539 --> 00:04:58,090
It's true.

59
00:04:58,397 --> 00:05:01,231
You have your parents.

60
00:05:03,795 --> 00:05:06,139
Why do you feel need to run away?

61
00:05:08,104 --> 00:05:10,297
Your father and
mother love you, right?

62
00:05:12,022 --> 00:05:14,078
Then, do you have a problem
with your brothers?

63
00:05:18,785 --> 00:05:22,295
Your parents love you, there's
no problem with your brothers.

64
00:05:23,112 --> 00:05:24,981
Then, what is your problem?

65
00:05:32,921 --> 00:05:37,806
Well, you should become
a good girl as soon as possible,

66
00:05:37,906 --> 00:05:40,657
and then your family can stop worrying.

67
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:46,126
Please take her and
introduce her to the other girls.

68
00:05:46,383 --> 00:05:48,424
Let's go, Hiroko.

69
00:06:20,475 --> 00:06:21,795
Everyone.

70
00:06:22,369 --> 00:06:26,229
From today, Hiroko Hata
will be one of us.

71
00:06:26,987 --> 00:06:28,841
I hope you can be good friends.

72
00:06:29,401 --> 00:06:31,594
I'm Hiroko Hata.

73
00:06:32,466 --> 00:06:35,452
- Yone, she'll be with you.
- Yes.

74
00:06:35,861 --> 00:06:40,478
And can someone
help her with her luggage?

75
00:06:49,407 --> 00:06:50,841
Please take the Futon.

76
00:06:51,086 --> 00:06:53,165
- What a nerve.
- Right.

77
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:02,405
It looks like a wedding.

78
00:07:09,575 --> 00:07:11,576
- Bring it in here, please.
- Yes.

79
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:25,862
Please put her luggage here.

80
00:07:30,386 --> 00:07:32,641
Yone, please help her.

81
00:07:33,034 --> 00:07:36,103
Hiroko, you can ask her
for anything you need.

82
00:07:37,455 --> 00:07:39,234
I'll leave everything to you.

83
00:07:45,546 --> 00:07:46,756
Please.

84
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:49,076
Here.

85
00:07:55,588 --> 00:07:57,500
Oh, a tip.

86
00:07:58,016 --> 00:08:01,836
Long time no see.
Thank you.

87
00:08:03,914 --> 00:08:06,489
Why were you sent to this school?

88
00:08:09,112 --> 00:08:11,726
This [theft]?
Or this [drugs]?

89
00:08:11,826 --> 00:08:13,640
Why did you come here?

90
00:08:14,202 --> 00:08:17,164
I didn't "enter",
I was sent here.

91
00:08:17,403 --> 00:08:19,432
Then, why were you sent here?

92
00:08:20,136 --> 00:08:21,139
This?

93
00:08:21,259 --> 00:08:22,457
Or this?

94
00:08:24,527 --> 00:08:27,944
How dare you. I'm here longer than you.
You should show me some respect.

95
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:29,882
So, what?

96
00:08:30,451 --> 00:08:32,247
- You hit me.
- Yes, I did.

97
00:08:38,587 --> 00:08:41,418
Please come. It's awful.

98
00:08:57,375 --> 00:08:59,975
What are you doing?

99
00:09:00,536 --> 00:09:02,401
What happened?

100
00:09:07,247 --> 00:09:12,737
She's so shameless. She used gestures
like "This or this" to me. Damn her.

101
00:09:13,452 --> 00:09:16,554
You used gestures like "This or this"
to me first. Damn you.

102
00:09:16,811 --> 00:09:21,394
You can stop quarreling. Yone, everyone,
go back to your places. OK?

103
00:09:43,644 --> 00:09:47,469
I won't lose to her.
I'm a newcomer, so I held back.

104
00:09:47,589 --> 00:09:49,302
Damn it, she's a bad one.

105
00:10:02,587 --> 00:10:03,877
Look.

106
00:10:04,326 --> 00:10:05,830
How fierce you are.

107
00:10:06,892 --> 00:10:08,326
Why not smile.

108
00:10:36,146 --> 00:10:38,409
You see? How pretty you are.

109
00:12:17,663 --> 00:12:19,036
Why are you here?

110
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:24,767
I like you very much.

111
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:34,170
I...

112
00:12:35,184 --> 00:12:36,749
Give me a hug.

113
00:13:20,037 --> 00:13:21,145
I...

114
00:13:22,556 --> 00:13:24,154
I'm the daughter of mistress.

115
00:13:34,298 --> 00:13:37,342
I was taken in by my foster mother
after I was born.

116
00:13:39,049 --> 00:13:40,570
No one has told me

117
00:13:41,661 --> 00:13:44,588
if my real mother is alive or dead.

118
00:13:46,058 --> 00:13:47,119
I...

119
00:13:48,107 --> 00:13:50,306
so want to see my real mother.

120
00:14:08,052 --> 00:14:10,937
You should become a good girl
as soon as possible.

121
00:14:12,183 --> 00:14:15,772
I'll take care of you
instead of your real mother. OK?

122
00:14:21,285 --> 00:14:22,762
Now then,

123
00:14:23,264 --> 00:14:25,448
you can go back to your bed.

124
00:14:26,649 --> 00:14:28,610
Give me one hug more.

125
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:39,430
But, if you are found out,
you'll be in trouble.

126
00:14:40,927 --> 00:14:42,852
You understand, don't you?

127
00:14:46,071 --> 00:14:47,917
Let's go, alright?

128
00:15:01,322 --> 00:15:03,346
You need to go quietly, right?

129
00:15:12,711 --> 00:15:15,289
- Good night.
- Good night.

130
00:16:25,567 --> 00:16:27,212
Where are we going?

131
00:16:28,115 --> 00:16:29,364
Follow me.

132
00:16:44,943 --> 00:16:46,902
What can I do for you?

133
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:51,888
Last night, where did you go?

134
00:16:54,697 --> 00:16:55,981
Wherever.

135
00:16:57,420 --> 00:17:00,650
I won't ask you again.
Just give me a cigarette.

136
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:02,641
I don't have any.

137
00:17:03,243 --> 00:17:04,398
Don't lie.

138
00:17:05,786 --> 00:17:07,276
Look here.

139
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:09,792
You have nicotine-stained fingers.

140
00:17:19,208 --> 00:17:23,639
The girls who smoke most probably
bring in hidden cigarettes.

141
00:17:35,158 --> 00:17:36,892
Come on, give.

142
00:17:38,843 --> 00:17:40,397
You won't?

143
00:17:41,061 --> 00:17:43,479
Then, I'll expose your secret to all.

144
00:17:49,392 --> 00:17:51,276
I have them in my pyjama pocket.

145
00:17:51,376 --> 00:17:52,794
Really?

146
00:18:08,714 --> 00:18:11,173
You can get a cigarette
during work hours.

147
00:18:15,106 --> 00:18:16,718
Let's go back.

148
00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:52,433
What are you doing?

149
00:18:56,755 --> 00:18:59,471
I know what you're looking for.

150
00:19:01,721 --> 00:19:04,477
What was in your pyjama pocket.

151
00:19:10,715 --> 00:19:14,084
You don't need them any more.

152
00:19:14,184 --> 00:19:16,742
That's why you left them
for me last night, right?

153
00:19:16,842 --> 00:19:18,880
Is that right?

154
00:19:19,436 --> 00:19:20,897
Am I right?

155
00:19:22,883 --> 00:19:25,220
Miss, I'm sorry.

156
00:20:06,574 --> 00:20:08,405
The teacher took them.

157
00:20:09,496 --> 00:20:11,210
I'll buy you some.

158
00:20:12,031 --> 00:20:14,964
So, please don't tell anybody
about last night.

159
00:20:31,779 --> 00:20:33,797
Yone, please come.

160
00:20:57,071 --> 00:20:58,355
This.

161
00:20:58,455 --> 00:21:00,229
It was in the closet.

162
00:21:00,488 --> 00:21:02,412
You were eating it, weren't you?

163
00:21:05,029 --> 00:21:07,151
I've seen this once before.

164
00:21:18,831 --> 00:21:23,105
I thought I'd ask you.

165
00:21:25,859 --> 00:21:27,060
Yone.

166
00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:32,743
You can talk to me about anything.
Feel free to discuss anything.

167
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:37,213
Yone.

168
00:21:38,568 --> 00:21:41,052
Don't take it all on yourself.

169
00:21:47,789 --> 00:21:50,553
You can tell me anything. Right?

170
00:21:51,323 --> 00:21:53,850
It's OK. I won't do anything bad.

171
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:04,932
If it's as I imagine,
sooner or later we'll all find out

172
00:22:05,032 --> 00:22:07,252
Please tell me before it's too late.

173
00:22:07,655 --> 00:22:09,813
Yone, please.

174
00:22:15,015 --> 00:22:16,585
I have nothing to tell you.

175
00:22:18,897 --> 00:22:20,098
Yone.

176
00:22:26,143 --> 00:22:28,725
- I found it in her closet.
- Again?

177
00:22:29,304 --> 00:22:32,359
I think it's just as you said.

178
00:22:32,479 --> 00:22:36,114
- What did she say?
- That she'd nothing to tell us.

179
00:22:45,763 --> 00:22:47,195
What do you want?

180
00:22:47,484 --> 00:22:51,882
Your behaviour has really thrown me.
Teacher suspects me now.

181
00:22:51,982 --> 00:22:54,961
- What? About the cigarettes?
- No, it's not that.

182
00:22:55,061 --> 00:22:58,127
Don't get carried away.
And don't spoil everything.

183
00:22:58,521 --> 00:23:02,879
I got it. You're angry because
teacher found your summer orange.

184
00:23:03,194 --> 00:23:04,826
Shut up. Clear off.

185
00:23:12,533 --> 00:23:15,463
- What happened?
- I don't understand a thing.

186
00:23:16,852 --> 00:23:19,232
I think she's misunderstood something.

187
00:26:05,798 --> 00:26:07,877
Yone. Yone.

188
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:10,556
Please, pick her up.

189
00:26:10,656 --> 00:26:15,570
Yone, pull yourself together.
Oh my God. Are you OK?

190
00:26:22,824 --> 00:26:25,066
Tomiko MIYAI
Birth: 11 Nov 1938

191
00:26:25,166 --> 00:26:29,968
8 Mar 1955: Removing household goods,
9 May 1955: 3 counts of theft with vagrancy

192
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:34,944
I've heard news from Mrs. Oda
that your father isn't feeling well.

193
00:26:35,599 --> 00:26:40,643
Recently you've been doing well,
so we thought we'd let you go back home.

194
00:26:40,743 --> 00:26:42,416
What do you think?

195
00:26:42,637 --> 00:26:44,535
Miss, can I go home?

196
00:26:45,198 --> 00:26:46,329
Really?

197
00:26:48,848 --> 00:26:53,084
Even if you do return, you shouldn't
defy your mother. Do you understand?

198
00:26:53,508 --> 00:26:58,289
Even if she is your step-mother,
she will love you if you behave.

199
00:26:58,692 --> 00:27:01,315
When you are with me,
you behave yourself.

200
00:27:01,643 --> 00:27:03,683
If you obey your mother,
everything will be fine.

201
00:27:03,783 --> 00:27:07,310
Do you understand?
You shouldn't revert to old habits.

202
00:27:08,155 --> 00:27:11,310
Then, this is your bank book.

203
00:27:12,094 --> 00:27:13,503
And...

204
00:27:14,472 --> 00:27:18,486
This 500 yen is for your train fare
and to buy a present for your father.

205
00:27:18,679 --> 00:27:22,417
- Don't lose this money, please.
- Thank you very much.

206
00:27:37,794 --> 00:27:38,947
Everyone.

207
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:41,203
They let me go back home.

208
00:27:45,735 --> 00:27:49,562
You should become good girls
and not revert to old habits.

209
00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:54,135
They said so to me just now.

210
00:28:14,969 --> 00:28:17,414
Miss, can I write you a letter?

211
00:28:17,534 --> 00:28:18,967
Of course.

212
00:28:22,289 --> 00:28:26,398
However, if you are fine,
it's better not to write to me.

213
00:28:26,699 --> 00:28:29,296
But, if you have any problems,

214
00:28:29,550 --> 00:28:32,616
you must write or come
to the school to consult with me.

215
00:28:33,125 --> 00:28:36,509
Anyway, do the best you can.
You have nothing to lose.

216
00:28:48,714 --> 00:28:51,375
- Tomiko. You've come back.
- Yes.

217
00:28:53,846 --> 00:28:56,950
Really. You have to try the best you can.

218
00:29:25,623 --> 00:29:26,758
Miss.

219
00:29:26,858 --> 00:29:28,433
Can we go this way?

220
00:29:54,393 --> 00:29:55,711
Hello.

221
00:29:58,249 --> 00:29:59,553
Welcome.

222
00:30:01,890 --> 00:30:04,573
What has Tomiko done this time?

223
00:30:05,205 --> 00:30:07,841
She has become a good girl
and is very well behaved.

224
00:30:08,468 --> 00:30:12,611
I heard her father was sick,
so, I've brought her.

225
00:30:13,046 --> 00:30:18,993
Ah, I see. Thank you for
taking care of my daughter.

226
00:30:19,693 --> 00:30:21,920
- Please come in.
- Thank you.

227
00:30:22,846 --> 00:30:24,848
How is her father doing?

228
00:30:26,014 --> 00:30:27,687
He went to hospital.

229
00:30:28,054 --> 00:30:31,387
The doctor said he has a stomach ulcer,
so he's quite upset.

230
00:30:31,953 --> 00:30:35,918
Anyway, he drinks too much.

231
00:30:36,578 --> 00:30:39,037
Please come in.

232
00:30:39,137 --> 00:30:41,330
No, thank you.
I must be leaving now.

233
00:30:43,684 --> 00:30:47,058
Please, love Tomi.

234
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:53,567
Tomi.

235
00:30:54,925 --> 00:30:58,675
You must listen to what your mother says.
And she will love you.

236
00:31:00,082 --> 00:31:01,763
You know what I mean.

237
00:31:04,978 --> 00:31:08,779
I should leave now. Please give
my best regards to her father.

238
00:31:09,185 --> 00:31:12,720
I'm sorry I couldn't
have entertained you better.

239
00:31:13,085 --> 00:31:16,278
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

240
00:31:19,801 --> 00:31:21,390
Why not say goodbye?

241
00:31:21,882 --> 00:31:23,010
Goodbye.

242
00:31:23,130 --> 00:31:24,239
Goodbye.

243
00:31:44,648 --> 00:31:45,716
Mother...

244
00:31:45,991 --> 00:31:47,744
This is a present.

245
00:31:48,467 --> 00:31:50,771
What? You brought a present?

246
00:31:52,362 --> 00:31:54,270
What a waste of money.

247
00:32:21,829 --> 00:32:22,932
Tomiko.

248
00:32:23,362 --> 00:32:25,685
How long are you sitting there for?

249
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:27,975
You're not a visitor.

250
00:32:28,629 --> 00:32:30,669
It's time to prepare dinner.

251
00:32:37,612 --> 00:32:40,110
Who told you your father was sick?

252
00:32:40,210 --> 00:32:42,165
He sent me a letter.

253
00:32:42,504 --> 00:32:43,995
Your father?

254
00:32:45,363 --> 00:32:47,163
Look what he's done.

255
00:32:47,263 --> 00:32:50,812
He had no need to write
to someone in such a school.

256
00:32:51,927 --> 00:32:53,422
And, you.

257
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:59,882
If you had let me know in advance you were
coming back, I'd have found you a job.

258
00:33:01,866 --> 00:33:06,440
Suddenly you come back, and if you
stay here, what will people think?

259
00:33:13,217 --> 00:33:17,626
If you stay home,
I'll be too embarrassed to go out.

260
00:33:18,762 --> 00:33:20,348
What are you doing?

261
00:33:20,448 --> 00:33:22,108
We're not cooking this.

262
00:33:32,293 --> 00:33:34,890
Tomiko, you came back.

263
00:33:36,516 --> 00:33:39,017
You sent her a letter
to tell her you were sick.

264
00:33:39,178 --> 00:33:42,701
Letter? I didn't write her to come back.

265
00:33:42,992 --> 00:33:45,556
I wrote to tell her
to be a good girl.

266
00:33:45,742 --> 00:33:49,366
While I was at it,
I wrote I was ill.

267
00:33:49,678 --> 00:33:51,547
That's of no concern.

268
00:33:52,085 --> 00:33:54,114
What are you going to do with her?

269
00:33:54,214 --> 00:33:56,381
Will you keep her here
as long as she wants?

270
00:33:56,501 --> 00:33:58,668
I don't know what to say.

271
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,459
She's your daughter,
so she can stay.

272
00:34:03,169 --> 00:34:08,396
But if she goes back to her old ways,
we shan't be able to show our faces.

273
00:34:08,782 --> 00:34:10,443
It'll be too embarrassing.

274
00:34:10,543 --> 00:34:14,687
But, she came back as a good girl.

275
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:17,116
Who knows?

276
00:34:17,528 --> 00:34:22,542
Even the teachers may be saying
that they've gotten rid of a nuisance.

277
00:34:22,642 --> 00:34:23,812
Mother.

278
00:34:24,375 --> 00:34:27,190
I'm a good girl,
that's why I'm back.

279
00:34:27,290 --> 00:34:29,622
I'll listen to everything you say.

280
00:34:30,179 --> 00:34:32,880
I won't lie,
I won't do anything bad.

281
00:34:33,157 --> 00:34:35,141
So, please let me stay home.

282
00:34:41,511 --> 00:34:43,471
Please, mother, please.

283
00:34:43,830 --> 00:34:45,705
Please.

284
00:34:49,435 --> 00:34:52,058
Mother.
Please.

285
00:34:54,322 --> 00:34:55,987
Father, please ask her.

286
00:34:59,081 --> 00:35:00,303
I'm back.

287
00:35:02,214 --> 00:35:06,053
Just what I thought,
you've come home.

288
00:35:13,145 --> 00:35:14,428
See.

289
00:35:14,528 --> 00:35:16,822
Already everyone
in the neighborhood knows.

290
00:35:17,454 --> 00:35:19,114
How embarrassing.

291
00:35:31,622 --> 00:35:33,472
That's all you can say.
So what.

292
00:35:33,776 --> 00:35:36,348
I'm getting out of here right now.

293
00:36:34,863 --> 00:36:37,030
Hey, Tomiko.

294
00:36:38,968 --> 00:36:40,365
What are you doing?

295
00:36:41,414 --> 00:36:43,869
Did you run away from there too?

296
00:36:45,121 --> 00:36:48,702
I was given permission to go home
because my father is sick.

297
00:36:49,062 --> 00:36:51,208
Then, what are you doing here?

298
00:36:51,431 --> 00:36:52,470
I...

299
00:36:52,787 --> 00:36:55,211
What happened?

300
00:36:55,964 --> 00:36:57,386
Tell me.

301
00:36:57,623 --> 00:36:59,751
They made me feel uncomfortable.

302
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:01,524
So, I left home.

303
00:37:04,201 --> 00:37:06,004
Why not stay with me.

304
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:10,042
We'll go round the pachinko halls.
We'll get by.

305
00:37:10,777 --> 00:37:13,717
Anyway, where are you staying?

306
00:37:14,067 --> 00:37:17,336
Don't worry about accommodation.
Leave it to me.

307
00:37:18,692 --> 00:37:21,656
You haven't had dinner
yet either, have you?

308
00:37:23,341 --> 00:37:26,302
I know a good Ramen restaurant.
Let's go.

309
00:37:32,671 --> 00:37:35,585
I'm thinking of going to Osaka soon.

310
00:37:36,156 --> 00:37:37,944
Why don't you come with me?

311
00:37:38,044 --> 00:37:39,095
Osaka?

312
00:37:39,754 --> 00:37:41,883
What'll you do in Osaka?

313
00:37:42,143 --> 00:37:44,573
It'll be great if we go there.

314
00:37:44,931 --> 00:37:47,544
And there is someone I can trust.

315
00:37:47,934 --> 00:37:50,912
I was thinking of going far away.

316
00:37:51,591 --> 00:37:54,072
- But I don't have any travel money.
- Money?

317
00:37:54,303 --> 00:37:56,292
Don't worry about it.

318
00:37:56,584 --> 00:37:58,409
Leave it to me.

319
00:38:15,876 --> 00:38:17,379
Yes, that's right.

320
00:38:20,058 --> 00:38:21,300
Tomiko Miyai.

321
00:38:23,488 --> 00:38:24,982
I see.

322
00:38:31,391 --> 00:38:36,003
Then, I'll go pick her up right away.
Thank you for calling.

323
00:39:15,773 --> 00:39:18,206
Excuse me, I just got a call.

324
00:39:18,326 --> 00:39:19,896
Thank you for coming.

325
00:39:20,385 --> 00:39:21,384
Please.

326
00:39:36,305 --> 00:39:37,889
What happened, Tomi?

327
00:40:11,742 --> 00:40:15,560
I haven't painted in ages, my hands
are shaking, I can't draw at all.

328
00:40:17,797 --> 00:40:20,280
How about this?
Will this pass inspection?

329
00:40:22,127 --> 00:40:24,412
What's that?
It's only got one eye.

330
00:40:24,532 --> 00:40:26,655
- It's a wink.
- It's a funny wink.

331
00:40:27,213 --> 00:40:30,491
- I thought it was crying.
- What's that?

332
00:40:30,877 --> 00:40:32,195
You're just a newbie.

333
00:40:32,295 --> 00:40:33,771
What? Newbie?

334
00:40:34,043 --> 00:40:36,679
If I'm a newbie,
you're a "re-newbie".

335
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:39,387
What? Say that again.

336
00:40:43,151 --> 00:40:45,710
Go on, Aki. I'll help you.

337
00:40:49,473 --> 00:40:51,155
I'll help you, too.

338
00:40:52,831 --> 00:40:56,055
I agree. If we don't teach her a lesson now,
it'll become a habit.

339
00:40:56,690 --> 00:40:59,129
You always flatter teachers.
Damn it.

340
00:41:00,403 --> 00:41:01,520
What?

341
00:41:02,899 --> 00:41:04,379
Do you want to fight?

342
00:41:14,424 --> 00:41:15,723
Listen, everyone.

343
00:41:16,688 --> 00:41:19,942
- Good news.
- What is it?

344
00:41:20,514 --> 00:41:23,599
The owner of the paper fan shop
came to talk with the principal.

345
00:41:23,822 --> 00:41:27,612
He says they're busy, so he wants
two of us to work at his place.

346
00:41:43,647 --> 00:41:45,357
I'm just a dead loss anyway.

347
00:41:46,308 --> 00:41:47,395
Kimi.

348
00:41:48,661 --> 00:41:49,841
You are too.

349
00:41:50,473 --> 00:41:52,389
Your marks are lousy.

350
00:41:53,730 --> 00:41:56,353
If it's oldest first,
then that means me.

351
00:42:05,695 --> 00:42:09,776
If they work well,
I'll come ask for more.

352
00:42:10,391 --> 00:42:15,323
If that happens,
it will only encourage them.

353
00:42:15,756 --> 00:42:18,130
Miss Oda, which girl would you chose?

354
00:42:26,384 --> 00:42:28,953
Who is the most suitable
according to the results?

355
00:42:29,339 --> 00:42:33,026
Tomi was just the right person,
but there's that business with her.

356
00:42:34,386 --> 00:42:38,440
Aya is good
and Toshi is also.

357
00:42:41,684 --> 00:42:46,724
If you work hard,
others can also work there.

358
00:42:46,953 --> 00:42:48,665
Please work hard for them.

359
00:42:49,268 --> 00:42:54,007
That's right. You have a responsibility,
since you are our representatives

360
00:42:54,380 --> 00:42:59,898
Fortunately there are no men there.
You can be friends, but don't fight, OK?

361
00:43:01,151 --> 00:43:04,945
- If you don't understand something,
you should ask politely. - Yes.

362
00:43:50,690 --> 00:43:54,276
Why all of a sudden
do you want to quit today?

363
00:43:54,376 --> 00:43:57,790
What don't you understand?
You know what I mean.

364
00:43:57,890 --> 00:43:59,769
Anyway, we're leaving.

365
00:43:59,869 --> 00:44:02,652
Impossible.
It would be a disaster.

366
00:44:02,968 --> 00:44:06,464
We're chock full of orders,
so we'll be busy from now on.

367
00:44:06,564 --> 00:44:08,933
No matter how busy we get,
we...

368
00:44:09,313 --> 00:44:11,772
don't want to work with those girls.

369
00:44:13,111 --> 00:44:17,079
They came because they
have good marks at the school.

370
00:44:17,468 --> 00:44:19,407
There is nothing to worry about.

371
00:44:20,005 --> 00:44:21,693
That may be true,

372
00:44:21,793 --> 00:44:25,026
- but we'd be in trouble if people
thought we were the same as them.

373
00:44:25,126 --> 00:44:26,532
Excuse me.

374
00:44:27,133 --> 00:44:30,947
They are the best
students in the school.

375
00:44:31,047 --> 00:44:33,548
They won't be any bother to you.

376
00:44:33,648 --> 00:44:36,684
Please let them work with you.

377
00:44:37,028 --> 00:44:39,211
I don't mind working with them,

378
00:44:39,311 --> 00:44:42,490
but there are many
unmarried girls working here.

379
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:44,763
They have made an effort to be good,

380
00:44:44,863 --> 00:44:47,747
and they are glad
to be working in the real world.

381
00:44:47,847 --> 00:44:51,121
Please let them work here,
in order to help them.

382
00:44:52,272 --> 00:44:56,284
The teacher is asking you to do this,
please try to understand.

383
00:44:56,814 --> 00:44:59,267
Anyway, let me think about it.

384
00:45:16,491 --> 00:45:17,744
Excuse me.

385
00:45:23,908 --> 00:45:25,415
Please.

386
00:45:25,668 --> 00:45:28,238
Please work with them.

387
00:45:29,113 --> 00:45:30,443
Please. Can you do that?

388
00:45:39,622 --> 00:45:40,640
Excuse me.

389
00:45:57,766 --> 00:45:58,948
Excuse me.

390
00:45:59,674 --> 00:46:00,925
I'm sorry.

391
00:46:04,143 --> 00:46:06,983
No, it can't be helped.

392
00:46:07,171 --> 00:46:09,766
If another opportunity arises,
I'd appreciate your consideration.

393
00:46:09,866 --> 00:46:11,390
We'll return to the school.

394
00:46:11,644 --> 00:46:12,858
Thank you.

395
00:46:35,317 --> 00:46:37,648
This is only a small present.

396
00:46:39,751 --> 00:46:42,407
Thank you for your kindness.
You can take it.

397
00:46:43,346 --> 00:46:46,304
I'm really sorry.
I didn't want to hurt your feelings.

398
00:46:46,404 --> 00:46:49,083
I'll handle it better next time.

399
00:46:49,807 --> 00:46:52,809
- Thank you very much.
- Bye.

400
00:46:58,489 --> 00:47:00,087
I understand.

401
00:47:09,762 --> 00:47:11,421
This is...

402
00:47:12,282 --> 00:47:13,993
the reality you face.

403
00:47:17,167 --> 00:47:19,313
But, stay strong.

404
00:47:59,193 --> 00:48:00,927
Hana, how was it?

405
00:48:01,729 --> 00:48:04,999
- They said a hair salon wanted
to hire someone.    - How nice.

406
00:48:06,217 --> 00:48:07,707
But, I refused.

407
00:48:07,807 --> 00:48:11,255
- Why? Don't waste the chance.
- Why won't you work there?

408
00:48:18,242 --> 00:48:22,502
I don't want to be like Aya and Toshi.

409
00:48:23,706 --> 00:48:25,396
I know but...

410
00:48:25,813 --> 00:48:30,086
- Masa. Masa, the teacher
is calling you. - Really?

411
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:32,232
Why won't she work there?

412
00:48:35,882 --> 00:48:37,269
- Please come.
- Yes.

413
00:48:53,547 --> 00:48:56,458
A hair salon wants to hire someone.
Do you want to work there?

414
00:48:56,558 --> 00:48:58,870
The salary is 2.000 yen, live-in.

415
00:48:59,390 --> 00:49:02,458
I'd like to stay here for a while.

416
00:49:02,578 --> 00:49:04,003
Why?

417
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:07,501
You said you'd work anywhere.

418
00:49:07,601 --> 00:49:11,285
You've been doing well recently
and the requirements are normal.

419
00:49:12,919 --> 00:49:15,369
I would still rather stay here.

420
00:49:16,041 --> 00:49:19,033
Are you afraid of being
like Toshi and Aya?

421
00:49:27,032 --> 00:49:29,514
Don't be like that.
How long have you been here?

422
00:49:32,149 --> 00:49:35,066
It doesn't matter. If you don't want,
you needn't work there.

423
00:49:35,672 --> 00:49:39,187
However, you can't just
stay here as long as you like.

424
00:49:39,614 --> 00:49:40,728
Yes.

425
00:49:45,441 --> 00:49:48,942
Miss Oda, this matter
is a real problem.

426
00:50:11,281 --> 00:50:13,169
Masa, are you going to work there?

427
00:50:13,409 --> 00:50:14,915
I refused.

428
00:50:18,243 --> 00:50:21,636
Even though they said
I shouldn't plan on staying here forever.

429
00:50:21,907 --> 00:50:24,671
But you can stay.

430
00:50:24,998 --> 00:50:28,309
If someone's looking for a wife,
I'll go marry him anytime.

431
00:50:31,892 --> 00:50:35,231
In order of results,
it's Chiyo's turn next.

432
00:50:36,374 --> 00:50:38,541
Chiyo, do you want to go to work?

433
00:50:39,009 --> 00:50:41,780
My mother is in poor health

434
00:50:42,116 --> 00:50:44,433
and I have a lot of
younger brothers and sisters.

435
00:50:44,533 --> 00:50:47,159
I want to go back home and work.

436
00:50:47,362 --> 00:50:52,077
What's more, when my mother
finds a job, she'll come for me.

437
00:50:52,334 --> 00:50:55,072
It's nice to have a home to go to.

438
00:50:56,117 --> 00:51:00,374
If someone would be responsible for me
and protect me, I'd go home.

439
00:51:01,006 --> 00:51:04,011
But, in my case,

440
00:51:04,255 --> 00:51:06,241
I have no one at all.

441
00:51:15,551 --> 00:51:17,589
<i>I am contacting you urgently.</i>

442
00:51:18,315 --> 00:51:21,862
<i>Please tell the teacher you
are my aunt and please pick me up.</i>

443
00:51:22,236 --> 00:51:23,992
<i>Please do it immediately.</i>

444
00:51:25,347 --> 00:51:26,355
<i>Kiyoko.</i>

445
00:51:30,232 --> 00:51:32,768
I'm Kiyoko Tanaka's aunt.

446
00:51:33,035 --> 00:51:35,276
Thank you for your help.

447
00:51:35,539 --> 00:51:39,571
I had no idea
she'd been here so long.

448
00:51:39,671 --> 00:51:42,539
I'm really sorry to hear that.

449
00:51:42,811 --> 00:51:44,675
- You are her aunt.
- Yes.

450
00:51:44,925 --> 00:51:48,090
Today I went to her house.

451
00:51:48,465 --> 00:51:53,748
I've just found out she is here
and I was so surprised.

452
00:51:53,848 --> 00:51:55,549
I see.

453
00:51:55,757 --> 00:51:59,388
Then, I talked to her family.

454
00:51:59,508 --> 00:52:03,291
I wondered if
she'd be staying here for ever.

455
00:52:03,526 --> 00:52:07,949
We decided that
I would supervise her.

456
00:52:08,181 --> 00:52:12,026
So, I came here.

457
00:52:12,850 --> 00:52:18,205
Thank you for coming.
She is now of marriageable age.

458
00:52:18,418 --> 00:52:22,993
She cannot always be here, so,
we were just wondering what to do.

459
00:52:23,113 --> 00:52:26,680
Oh, really. Then I came
at just the right moment.

460
00:52:26,874 --> 00:52:28,443
I'll take care of her.

461
00:52:28,543 --> 00:52:34,382
I'd like you to handle this matter
at your own discretion.

462
00:52:34,502 --> 00:52:37,600
- Please wait a moment, I'll fetch her.
- Thank you.

463
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:18,834
Kiyo, please come.

464
00:53:19,028 --> 00:53:19,963
Yes.

465
00:53:31,226 --> 00:53:32,748
Let's go see.

466
00:53:45,104 --> 00:53:46,286
Kiyo.

467
00:53:46,873 --> 00:53:48,510
What have you been up to?

468
00:53:49,193 --> 00:53:52,218
I was so surprised
when I heard about you.

469
00:53:52,987 --> 00:53:58,331
Anyway, you can't stay here forever.
so I've come to pick you up.

470
00:53:59,353 --> 00:54:02,272
- You should do your best.
- Yes.

471
00:54:02,372 --> 00:54:03,732
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

472
00:54:03,852 --> 00:54:05,369
Is that right?

473
00:54:08,087 --> 00:54:13,536
Why didn't you write to me before?
All this time at that useless school.

474
00:54:13,839 --> 00:54:18,826
But I was trying to become
a respectable woman.

475
00:54:19,103 --> 00:54:20,346
Nonsense.

476
00:54:20,643 --> 00:54:26,633
But, "Bad habits are hard to break".
And I can't live there forever.

477
00:54:27,207 --> 00:54:29,430
- That's why I sent you the letter.
- Really.

478
00:54:29,979 --> 00:54:34,510
It's all the same to me. Firstly,
you should go to a beauty salon.

479
00:54:35,182 --> 00:54:36,569
I know.

480
00:54:36,999 --> 00:54:41,563
- But I'd rather have Tonkatsu than that.
- Tonkatsu? OK, let's go.

481
00:54:48,316 --> 00:54:50,137
Yone.

482
00:54:51,872 --> 00:54:53,801
Yone.

483
00:55:06,541 --> 00:55:08,600
Yone is always giving us trouble.

484
00:55:18,236 --> 00:55:21,249
That's strange.
I'm not sure she was at dinner.

485
00:55:21,748 --> 00:55:24,870
She was but she didn't eat anything.

486
00:55:31,932 --> 00:55:35,364
- Miss, I can't find her anywhere.
- Have you looked in the backyard?

487
00:55:35,787 --> 00:55:37,821
- I'll go see.
- Thank you.

488
00:55:37,921 --> 00:55:39,870
I'll come with you.

489
00:55:47,929 --> 00:55:51,669
- Are her kimono and things in her room?
- Yes, and her shoes, too.

490
00:55:52,341 --> 00:55:53,864
That's strange.

491
00:55:53,964 --> 00:55:55,866
Did you look there?

492
00:56:08,646 --> 00:56:10,811
I'm scared. I'm going back.

493
00:56:34,671 --> 00:56:36,200
Miss.

494
00:56:36,514 --> 00:56:38,705
I heard a groan from the storage shed.

495
00:56:39,759 --> 00:56:41,114
Hurry.

496
00:57:04,130 --> 00:57:06,005
Yone. Yone.

497
00:57:10,113 --> 00:57:12,509
Please call a midwife.

498
00:57:13,763 --> 00:57:15,389
Please bring the principal here.

499
00:57:18,392 --> 00:57:19,508
Yone.

500
00:57:20,072 --> 00:57:21,286
Keep calm, now.

501
00:57:26,931 --> 00:57:29,208
- Please boil some water.
- Yes.

502
00:57:32,233 --> 00:57:35,572
Hello. Hello.

503
00:57:37,957 --> 00:57:40,092
Yone, hang on in.

504
00:57:40,949 --> 00:57:42,434
Someone, shine a light.

505
00:57:43,282 --> 00:57:45,526
Yone, you can do it.

506
00:57:47,011 --> 00:57:49,761
Someone, please come here and help me.

507
00:57:50,187 --> 00:57:51,531
I'll do it.

508
00:57:53,361 --> 00:57:55,318
Hold her shoulders.

509
00:57:55,898 --> 00:57:59,382
Yone, hold on.

510
00:58:00,234 --> 00:58:01,329
Yone.

511
00:58:02,131 --> 00:58:03,301
Move aside.

512
00:58:04,638 --> 00:58:07,597
Come on, stay over there.

513
00:58:21,833 --> 00:58:24,662
Hold on. The midwife
will be here soon.

514
00:58:29,771 --> 00:58:31,425
Someone please come.

515
00:58:45,207 --> 00:58:46,855
Don't move.

516
00:58:47,170 --> 00:58:48,384
Yone.

517
00:58:55,039 --> 00:58:57,767
The baby. Hold its head.

518
00:59:11,154 --> 00:59:14,742
The midwife is coming,
do your best.

519
00:59:16,267 --> 00:59:19,020
Will the midwife arrive
or will the baby be born first?

520
01:00:41,314 --> 01:00:43,308
Try harder.

521
01:00:45,466 --> 01:00:48,024
Yone, hold on.

522
01:02:13,719 --> 01:02:16,548
I knitted these,
but they are different sizes.

523
01:02:16,815 --> 01:02:20,284
Thank you.
I don't mind, thank you.

524
01:02:23,091 --> 01:02:24,196
Yone.

525
01:02:24,478 --> 01:02:27,615
Is it true that you are going to leave
the baby in a children's home?

526
01:02:27,860 --> 01:02:29,378
Who said so?

527
01:02:30,056 --> 01:02:33,666
The director has gone
to see a family court judge.

528
01:02:34,929 --> 01:02:36,105
No way.

529
01:02:43,518 --> 01:02:44,569
What is it?

530
01:02:47,116 --> 01:02:49,883
- He's so happy today, he's smiling.
- That's good.

531
01:02:51,611 --> 01:02:54,075
What a cutie.

532
01:02:56,359 --> 01:02:58,858
I'll give him some milk soon.
Please take care of him.

533
01:03:11,359 --> 01:03:15,067
Is it true you're going to leave
my baby in a children's home?

534
01:03:23,152 --> 01:03:27,553
The director went to see
a family court judge about this.

535
01:03:30,055 --> 01:03:31,141
Miss.

536
01:03:32,520 --> 01:03:33,571
Please.

537
01:03:34,037 --> 01:03:36,888
Please don't take away my baby.

538
01:03:37,698 --> 01:03:39,983
I'll raise him no matter what.

539
01:03:41,459 --> 01:03:43,139
Please let me raise my baby.

540
01:03:47,996 --> 01:03:50,326
I know I've been bad.

541
01:03:51,681 --> 01:03:53,416
But since he's been born,

542
01:03:54,543 --> 01:03:56,700
I want to be a good mother.

543
01:04:00,227 --> 01:04:02,141
Please let me raise my baby.

544
01:04:03,978 --> 01:04:06,247
And please let me be a good mother.

545
01:05:00,229 --> 01:05:01,796
I'm so happy

546
01:05:02,170 --> 01:05:04,511
that you think this way.

547
01:05:13,757 --> 01:05:14,842
Yone.

548
01:05:15,720 --> 01:05:18,259
We will try our best
to meet your expectations.

549
01:05:18,831 --> 01:05:21,151
So please make sure
to be a good mother.

550
01:05:25,349 --> 01:05:26,623
Come on.

551
01:05:57,520 --> 01:06:01,769
When I'm a good girl and go out from here,
I want to have lots of children.

552
01:06:01,889 --> 01:06:04,852
- A lot?
- Well, two or three.

553
01:06:05,600 --> 01:06:10,099
- One child would be enough for me.
- If I have children, I want to have lots.

554
01:06:12,478 --> 01:06:15,806
- I'd prefer a boy.
- I want a girl first, and then a boy.

555
01:07:05,736 --> 01:07:10,504
I have never heard a lullaby
from my real mother.

556
01:08:16,727 --> 01:08:23,502
Goodbye. Good luck.

557
01:08:44,088 --> 01:08:45,616
Chiyo.

558
01:08:51,675 --> 01:08:53,296
This is from teacher.

559
01:08:59,459 --> 01:09:02,218
Goodbye.

560
01:10:07,478 --> 01:10:09,060
Please check it.

561
01:10:09,787 --> 01:10:10,925
Ten thousand yen.

562
01:10:11,839 --> 01:10:13,403
Twenty thousand.

563
01:10:13,931 --> 01:10:15,377
Thirty thousand.

564
01:10:22,151 --> 01:10:23,170
Correct?

565
01:10:24,384 --> 01:10:25,755
Correct, right?

566
01:10:26,714 --> 01:10:28,167
Then, please, your seal.

567
01:10:29,077 --> 01:10:30,397
Here, please.

568
01:10:40,051 --> 01:10:41,233
Mother.

569
01:10:43,015 --> 01:10:44,120
Mother.

570
01:10:44,836 --> 01:10:49,051
I'll look for a job right away,
please let me live here.

571
01:10:49,941 --> 01:10:54,301
I'll do any hard work,
please let me stay here.

572
01:10:55,173 --> 01:10:56,333
Please.

573
01:10:57,564 --> 01:10:58,739
But...

574
01:11:03,293 --> 01:11:06,805
Please. Please.

575
01:11:07,835 --> 01:11:09,830
Please return the money.

576
01:11:16,738 --> 01:11:18,592
We'll return your money.

577
01:11:20,044 --> 01:11:21,237
Alright.

578
01:11:22,760 --> 01:11:25,069
Then, when you start work,

579
01:11:25,622 --> 01:11:29,372
you can support your large family.

580
01:11:30,517 --> 01:11:34,583
To tell the truth,
Kiyo told me about you.

581
01:11:37,141 --> 01:11:39,493
I felt sorry for you and your family.

582
01:11:40,009 --> 01:11:41,863
So, I came here.

583
01:11:43,565 --> 01:11:46,578
I talked it over with your mother.

584
01:11:46,834 --> 01:11:51,170
If you work for me, it will be a great
help. So we agreed on it.

585
01:11:51,409 --> 01:11:54,010
And your mother
came looking for you.

586
01:11:55,199 --> 01:11:58,766
I hoped that you could live here.

587
01:11:59,188 --> 01:12:02,004
But when your brothers
and sisters are hungry,

588
01:12:02,285 --> 01:12:06,480
if you do something bad again,
I'll be the one in trouble.

589
01:12:06,979 --> 01:12:09,873
And you'll be back at that place.

590
01:12:10,808 --> 01:12:15,387
Even if you stay here, it will be hard,
getting funny looks from the neighbors.

591
01:12:15,712 --> 01:12:20,579
And your brothers and sisters
will feel humiliated.

592
01:12:21,186 --> 01:12:24,980
That's why it was
so kind of her to come.

593
01:12:25,100 --> 01:12:26,475
That's right.

594
01:12:26,993 --> 01:12:29,410
If possible, I'll send enough money

595
01:12:29,681 --> 01:12:32,392
for your family each month.

596
01:14:38,094 --> 01:14:40,004
Come on, everyone.
Let's hurry.

597
01:14:41,790 --> 01:14:43,755
Pay no attention, let's go.

598
01:14:59,661 --> 01:15:02,143
What's wrong? Come on.

599
01:15:55,726 --> 01:15:56,853
Miss.

600
01:16:00,485 --> 01:16:04,322
I just saw a girl there.
I think it's Chiyo.

601
01:16:05,293 --> 01:16:07,613
- Chiyo?
- She looked strange.

602
01:16:14,340 --> 01:16:16,703
It looks like Chiyo was there,
I'll go check.

603
01:16:27,842 --> 01:16:28,937
Chiyo.

604
01:17:03,998 --> 01:17:05,147
Chiyo.

605
01:17:10,537 --> 01:17:11,903
Oh, Miss.

606
01:17:13,339 --> 01:17:14,553
Mother.

607
01:17:40,671 --> 01:17:41,777
Chiyo.

608
01:18:01,985 --> 01:18:03,539
Don't take the mask off.

609
01:18:10,020 --> 01:18:13,358
If you want to see a made-up face,
there are plenty of other girls.

610
01:18:14,085 --> 01:18:16,277
I'd feel sorry for her
if you take off her mask.

611
01:18:18,254 --> 01:18:21,365
If you feel sorry for her,
why make her do this?

612
01:18:22,124 --> 01:18:23,512
You are angry.

613
01:18:25,062 --> 01:18:27,203
Chiyo, let's go home.

614
01:18:27,744 --> 01:18:28,784
Miss.

615
01:18:29,424 --> 01:18:30,649
Please wait.

616
01:18:32,080 --> 01:18:34,052
You can take her if you like.

617
01:18:34,887 --> 01:18:37,214
But, I spent a lot of money on her.

618
01:18:37,994 --> 01:18:40,555
I need to send her family
money each month.

619
01:18:40,914 --> 01:18:42,913
Her family is a large one to support.

620
01:18:43,013 --> 01:18:46,363
Is there any other way
of earning enough money?

621
01:18:50,734 --> 01:18:54,734
Or, if you can look after
her whole family,

622
01:18:55,092 --> 01:18:57,022
you can take her anywhere.

623
01:19:29,228 --> 01:19:31,092
Can you serve her tea?

624
01:20:18,367 --> 01:20:22,421
<i>What should we do
with girls like these?</i>

625
01:20:23,895 --> 01:20:26,638
<i>Without the welcoming
cooperation of society,</i>

626
01:20:27,035 --> 01:20:29,472
<i>the number of
delinquent girls will increase.</i>

627
01:20:31,165 --> 01:20:32,517
<i>Everyone,</i>

628
01:20:33,026 --> 01:20:37,232
<i>I thank you
for your warm support.</i>

629
01:20:50,072 --> 01:20:55,595
THE END
