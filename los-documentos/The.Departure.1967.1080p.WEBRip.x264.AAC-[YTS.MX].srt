3
00:05:08,515 --> 00:05:10,914
-He's leaving for the weekend.
-What?

4
00:05:10,995 --> 00:05:13,714
It's not a tragedy,
we'll find a different solution.

5
00:05:15,635 --> 00:05:16,914
Shit!

6
00:05:17,795 --> 00:05:19,875
Shit!

7
00:05:27,075 --> 00:05:28,354
There's another solution.

8
00:05:29,115 --> 00:05:30,354
Maharajah!

9
00:05:37,594 --> 00:05:43,474
His Excellence asks if this is
the best reseller in Brussels.

10
00:05:43,555 --> 00:05:45,275
-Yes, your excellence.
-Very well.

11
00:05:47,515 --> 00:05:53,714
His Excellence desires to buy
a black car that's extremely fast.

12
00:05:54,675 --> 00:05:56,755
Here it is, a black car.

13
00:06:07,714 --> 00:06:11,914
His Excellence can see
that the car is black,

14
00:06:12,755 --> 00:06:15,635
but is it also extremely fast?

15
00:06:45,395 --> 00:06:48,714
His Excellence would prefer
that I'm the one who drives.

16
00:06:49,555 --> 00:06:50,594
Sure.

17
00:07:29,714 --> 00:07:32,234
His Excellence is visiting the Ambassador.

18
00:07:32,995 --> 00:07:34,714
Later he thinks
he'll show him the vehicle.

19
00:07:35,315 --> 00:07:39,914
It would be better if it's you
who shows it to his Excellence.

20
00:07:41,075 --> 00:07:42,635
I'm not the driver.

21
00:07:42,714 --> 00:07:47,435
You've driven it with such ability,
despite it being your first time.

22
00:07:49,275 --> 00:07:51,275
I'm just his secretary.

23
00:07:51,354 --> 00:07:54,955
We wouldn't do any better, believe me.
Here is my card.

24
00:07:55,835 --> 00:07:57,154
Thank you.

25
00:07:57,234 --> 00:08:01,075
We are open until six.
A telephone call will do.

26
00:08:06,034 --> 00:08:07,154
Taxi!

27
00:08:19,914 --> 00:08:22,115
Hurry up. The porter asked
too many questions.

28
00:08:27,315 --> 00:08:28,635
You rascal!

29
00:08:29,714 --> 00:08:31,555
You're happy, aren't you?

30
00:08:33,434 --> 00:08:37,395
You owed me 200 for the Mercedes,
plus this 500, that makes 700.

31
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:39,635
Help yourself. Let's close our business.

32
00:08:42,154 --> 00:08:43,595
-Is it a deal?
-It's a gift!

33
00:08:43,674 --> 00:08:46,434
Go, take what you want!

34
00:08:46,515 --> 00:08:48,395
The only thing left is this lousy wallet.

35
00:08:49,755 --> 00:08:50,875
Take it as a gift.

36
00:08:52,515 --> 00:08:54,355
-What for?
-It's for your collection.

37
00:08:55,875 --> 00:09:00,194
-I'm not convinced…
-No, it's just that your job is over.

38
00:09:00,275 --> 00:09:03,954
-Do you have a big deal?
-No, I'm done, nothing else.

39
00:09:05,035 --> 00:09:08,434
-Will you drive the 2CV back?
-Can't you do it by yourself?

40
00:09:08,515 --> 00:09:10,434
No, I have too many appointments
this afternoon.

41
00:09:12,194 --> 00:09:13,155
Hurry up!

42
00:09:14,675 --> 00:09:16,915
With this one and that one.

43
00:09:24,475 --> 00:09:29,194
-Come on, get lost.
-Cool down.

44
00:09:39,915 --> 00:09:40,795
Hey!

45
00:09:45,875 --> 00:09:47,434
Hey!

46
00:09:47,515 --> 00:09:49,475
The gasoline!

47
00:11:18,995 --> 00:11:20,915
Here you go, ma'am. Sorry for being late,

48
00:11:20,995 --> 00:11:22,755
-I had a flat tire…
-Wait a moment.

49
00:11:36,675 --> 00:11:38,314
-Here it is.
-Thanks, ma'am.

50
00:12:07,795 --> 00:12:10,595
Take the lift,

51
00:12:10,675 --> 00:12:13,515
-or else Oscar keeps on going upstairs.
-Relax!

52
00:12:15,035 --> 00:12:18,395
Come here, Oscar.
Take your bone!

53
00:12:19,074 --> 00:12:23,675
Come, my love.
Take your bone!

54
00:12:23,755 --> 00:12:24,795
Oscar.

55
00:12:25,675 --> 00:12:27,475
Come, Oscar.

56
00:12:29,355 --> 00:12:33,515
Come, I'll put you on your little coat.

57
00:12:33,595 --> 00:12:36,434
Come, my little Oscar.

58
00:12:36,515 --> 00:12:40,755
Come, so your mum puts you
on your little coat.

59
00:12:40,834 --> 00:12:44,675
-Please, Mrs. Van de Put?
-What?

60
00:12:44,755 --> 00:12:47,834
-Mrs. Van de Put!
-Michelle has just come out.

61
00:12:48,755 --> 00:12:52,355
-Ma'am, please… Hey!
-Miss, please.

62
00:12:54,755 --> 00:12:57,475
-Sorry for being late.
-You are not late at all.

63
00:12:59,074 --> 00:13:02,635
I had a flat tire, that's why I'm late.
You're very kind.

64
00:13:03,355 --> 00:13:05,434
I'm being nice
because this box isn't for me.

65
00:13:05,515 --> 00:13:07,594
I'll go and see if
Mrs. Van de Put is still home.

66
00:13:09,515 --> 00:13:13,995
If you're frightened by Oscar,
I'll put a muzzle on him.

67
00:13:15,275 --> 00:13:17,035
I'm deaf and he's toothless.

68
00:13:17,115 --> 00:13:19,355
What do you want me to do?
Where shall I put this?

69
00:13:19,434 --> 00:13:22,115
-Well done, do a good deed.
-Come here, little doggie.

70
00:13:36,755 --> 00:13:40,275
I don't know if Oscar's too small
or the coat is too large,

71
00:13:40,355 --> 00:13:43,834
-but in any case, it hurts.
-Give it to Mrs. Van de Put.

72
00:13:45,714 --> 00:13:48,594
Do you think he has rabies?

73
00:13:49,475 --> 00:13:51,675
No, I don't think so,
unless Mrs. Van de Put has bitten him.

74
00:13:52,555 --> 00:13:54,035
-Does it burn?
-No.

75
00:13:54,995 --> 00:13:56,155
Doesn't it burn?

76
00:13:57,915 --> 00:14:00,475
-Ah!
-Perfect, I have to go.

77
00:14:45,194 --> 00:14:46,915
Do you want to taste a delicious sausage?

78
00:14:46,995 --> 00:14:49,194
-Here it is, for your sausage.
-Thanks!

79
00:14:59,474 --> 00:15:00,555
It's for the engine.

80
00:15:03,074 --> 00:15:04,155
It's the car who pays.

81
00:15:09,915 --> 00:15:12,834
Don't you think the sausage here is tasty?
We don't come around often.

82
00:15:12,915 --> 00:15:14,714
I often pass this way in the afternoon.

83
00:17:56,955 --> 00:17:58,235
Sorry, are you Paul Frére?

84
00:18:01,555 --> 00:18:03,115
May I ask you a question?

85
00:18:03,195 --> 00:18:05,675
How did you get your first car
for your first rally?

86
00:18:06,874 --> 00:18:09,475
I don't remember any more.
I did it somehow.

87
00:18:09,555 --> 00:18:11,115
Did you apply without a car?

88
00:18:11,835 --> 00:18:14,995
Yes, this one isn't mine
and I don't have money to rent one.

89
00:18:15,075 --> 00:18:16,555
I can't wait to drive in this rally.

90
00:18:16,634 --> 00:18:19,595
That's a problem,
but you caught me a little off guard.

91
00:18:20,275 --> 00:18:22,075
Don't you have a friend
whom you can ask for money?

92
00:18:22,154 --> 00:18:24,435
-Give me some advice, please?
-I don't know.

93
00:18:24,515 --> 00:18:27,755
No, I don't have any and I have to
take part in this rally.

94
00:18:27,835 --> 00:18:30,515
I'm putting all my…
I don't know how to explain.

95
00:18:30,595 --> 00:18:36,315
It's not only about the start.
The real hard part is to achieve results.

96
00:18:36,394 --> 00:18:40,835
To be successful, to compete at
a high level, make a name for yourself.

97
00:18:41,634 --> 00:18:45,035
Can't you help me at all?
Don't you know what I could do?

98
00:18:45,115 --> 00:18:47,755
The rally begins the day after tomorrow
and I don't even have a car.

99
00:18:48,835 --> 00:18:51,795
No, but I hope you get through it.
Good luck!

100
00:19:15,755 --> 00:19:17,874
Are you crazy? Let me go.

101
00:19:19,035 --> 00:19:24,154
-Let me go. What's got into you?
-Your friend told me everything!

102
00:19:24,235 --> 00:19:27,115
You're a bastard!

103
00:19:27,195 --> 00:19:30,874
Let me go! Let me go!

104
00:19:30,955 --> 00:19:34,195
Don't touch the number plate!

105
00:19:34,275 --> 00:19:38,795
Don't touch the number plate!

106
00:19:40,555 --> 00:19:42,275
He told me everything!

107
00:19:46,955 --> 00:19:49,075
I don't care about the plate!

108
00:19:58,674 --> 00:20:00,075
What now?

109
00:20:00,154 --> 00:20:02,634
I could go to prison!

110
00:20:02,715 --> 00:20:05,515
Let me go!

111
00:20:05,595 --> 00:20:09,075
-Go away!
-Yes, I will go away!

112
00:20:09,154 --> 00:20:11,634
You bastard!

113
00:20:18,835 --> 00:20:21,315
See you in a quarter of hour,
at the Porsche. I'll arrive first.

114
00:20:33,275 --> 00:20:35,715
Miss, has the selection been done already?

115
00:20:35,795 --> 00:20:37,394
Yes, the list of participants
is over there.

116
00:20:37,475 --> 00:20:39,115
-Where?
-Over there.

117
00:20:45,035 --> 00:20:46,355
Number nine.

118
00:20:46,435 --> 00:20:50,555
Sorry, I've applied with a Porsche
and I'd like to know if…

119
00:20:50,634 --> 00:20:52,795
-Over there…
-Can't you show me?

120
00:20:52,874 --> 00:20:54,755
-Sir, are you Paul Deriviere?
-Yeah.

121
00:20:54,835 --> 00:20:57,435
I have applied with a Porsche,
I'm number nine.

122
00:20:57,515 --> 00:20:59,795
I'd like to know if it's possible
to change my vehicle.

123
00:20:59,874 --> 00:21:02,475
If you chose a Porsche,
you have to keep the same category.

124
00:21:02,555 --> 00:21:06,835
But look, it's badly parked,
and its brakes don't work.

125
00:21:06,914 --> 00:21:10,235
May I start in a Mustang or a Jaguar?

126
00:21:10,315 --> 00:21:13,515
-With one of these two?
-Yes, I wanted to know, just in case…

127
00:21:13,595 --> 00:21:16,235
If it's just in case,
have your brakes repaired.

128
00:21:16,315 --> 00:21:17,235
Shit!

129
00:22:33,115 --> 00:22:35,115
You're the cause of the crash,
then you blame the others!

130
00:22:35,195 --> 00:22:36,595
-That's not true!
-I saw you!

131
00:22:36,674 --> 00:22:39,434
He overtook me then cut me up!

132
00:22:39,515 --> 00:22:42,595
You imbecile! He saw that too.

133
00:22:42,674 --> 00:22:44,515
He saw that too, yeah.

134
00:22:56,394 --> 00:22:58,075
I'll knock you out!

135
00:22:58,154 --> 00:23:00,515
If you hit me, I'll break your face.

136
00:23:00,595 --> 00:23:02,674
You idiot, take that!

137
00:23:02,755 --> 00:23:04,315
Stop it!

138
00:23:48,434 --> 00:23:50,154
Officer!

139
00:23:50,235 --> 00:23:53,835
Look, he's a road hog, officer!

140
00:23:55,715 --> 00:23:58,515
He drives around with that old crock!

141
00:23:58,595 --> 00:24:00,995
CLOCK REPAIRS

142
00:24:09,755 --> 00:24:12,755
He cut me up!

143
00:24:12,835 --> 00:24:13,755
It was you!

144
00:24:28,195 --> 00:24:31,315
Come and see.
I have to show you something.

145
00:24:31,394 --> 00:24:35,315
Give me the paper turban, idiot.
Get out of here!

146
00:24:35,394 --> 00:24:37,154
Idiot!

147
00:24:50,394 --> 00:24:51,755
Hello.

148
00:24:51,835 --> 00:24:54,995
I'm returning this old crock.
Its brakes are messed up.

149
00:24:55,075 --> 00:24:57,275
But it's an exceptional car.

150
00:24:57,355 --> 00:24:59,394
Exceptional? Do you want a nut?

151
00:24:59,475 --> 00:25:02,315
No? You don't want one?

152
00:25:02,394 --> 00:25:03,795
Well.

153
00:25:03,874 --> 00:25:06,434
Goodbye! Don't you want to see me again?

154
00:25:06,515 --> 00:25:07,674
Bye.

155
00:25:15,115 --> 00:25:17,035
Sir, you lost your number nine.

156
00:25:29,035 --> 00:25:30,075
You!

157
00:25:30,715 --> 00:25:32,835
For heaven's sake! How long should I wait?

158
00:25:34,075 --> 00:25:37,914
Actually, it's the same thing
wherever you go. Always like that.

159
00:25:38,715 --> 00:25:41,755
Just picture it.
The other hair-dresser burnt me!

160
00:25:41,835 --> 00:25:44,275
-He burned your hair? That's a shame!
-Yeah!

161
00:25:44,355 --> 00:25:47,674
By the way, some days ago
a hospice caught fire.

162
00:25:47,755 --> 00:25:51,914
-Yeah, 20 people died.
-More than 80, actually.

163
00:25:51,995 --> 00:25:53,795
Did you read it in the newspaper?

164
00:25:55,235 --> 00:25:58,595
-Well, if you read it in a newspaper…
-Yeah, I don't know.

165
00:25:59,355 --> 00:26:01,275
It said someone was naked.

166
00:26:02,595 --> 00:26:05,394
And I read that someone caught a cold.

167
00:26:05,475 --> 00:26:07,555
For sure. They were all wearing pajamas.

168
00:26:07,634 --> 00:26:10,035
They were sleeping. Someone was naked.

169
00:26:10,115 --> 00:26:11,715
-Imbecile!
-Excuse me?

170
00:26:11,795 --> 00:26:12,995
Nothing, ma'am.

171
00:26:14,475 --> 00:26:15,595
-Ma'am.
-Yeah?

172
00:26:16,914 --> 00:26:18,835
I'll wait for you
so we can continue our little talk.

173
00:26:18,914 --> 00:26:19,914
-Okay!
-Excuse me.

174
00:26:29,995 --> 00:26:33,835
What do you think about
when washing my hair?

175
00:26:35,795 --> 00:26:37,434
I think of my mom.

176
00:26:40,914 --> 00:26:42,715
And are you always thinking of her?

177
00:26:45,194 --> 00:26:47,315
I'm not here for thinking, ma'am.

178
00:27:03,315 --> 00:27:05,874
When you think of something,
what do you think of?

179
00:27:07,955 --> 00:27:11,674
Just between us,
I'm always thinking about cars.

180
00:27:12,955 --> 00:27:13,955
That's better!

181
00:27:17,914 --> 00:27:21,755
You've already come here with a Porsche.

182
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:24,555
And so what?

183
00:27:28,795 --> 00:27:29,995
Nothing.

184
00:27:30,795 --> 00:27:32,555
I just wanted to know
if you still have it.

185
00:27:36,555 --> 00:27:38,475
If it really has to be a Porsche,

186
00:27:40,515 --> 00:27:41,914
there are three solutions.

187
00:27:43,394 --> 00:27:45,674
Buy one, rent one…

188
00:27:47,355 --> 00:27:49,355
things that seem to be ruled out,

189
00:27:50,434 --> 00:27:54,595
or by being kind to someone who has one.

190
00:28:00,835 --> 00:28:02,355
How much does it cost to rent one?

191
00:28:06,154 --> 00:28:08,434
You'd better call
someone who owns a Porsche.

192
00:28:11,275 --> 00:28:12,795
This way, ma'am. Have a seat.

193
00:28:15,995 --> 00:28:18,035
When you get a tip,
at least say thank you.

194
00:28:18,115 --> 00:28:20,475
It wasn't a tip,
it was the address of a clairvoyant.

195
00:28:41,355 --> 00:28:43,995
Hello? I'm calling for
the renting of a Porsche.

196
00:28:44,075 --> 00:28:45,434
Yeah.

197
00:28:47,315 --> 00:28:48,914
No, it's just for a few days.

198
00:28:49,995 --> 00:28:52,315
How much for the rental? What?

199
00:28:52,394 --> 00:28:54,634
But that's not possible! No!

200
00:28:54,715 --> 00:28:58,275
Is it the same for just one day?

201
00:28:58,355 --> 00:28:59,755
That's impossible!

202
00:29:03,914 --> 00:29:06,315
Tomorrow I'll steal something
at the car showroom to make some money.

203
00:29:06,394 --> 00:29:10,275
Are you crazy?
Go there at night-time with a girl.

204
00:29:11,275 --> 00:29:12,434
Give me a sausage.

205
00:29:16,315 --> 00:29:18,475
-Will you give me a sausage?
-They're all sold.

206
00:29:21,795 --> 00:29:25,914
Ah, that's why. This morning
I made a fool of you.

207
00:29:26,795 --> 00:29:28,355
But you're a fool!

208
00:29:29,194 --> 00:29:30,795
Nobody has forced you.

209
00:29:30,874 --> 00:29:34,275
I gave you 20 francs to put
a sausage in the car's muffler.

210
00:29:35,995 --> 00:29:37,075
Come on, give me a sausage!

211
00:29:41,595 --> 00:29:43,434
You want a sausage?

212
00:29:45,075 --> 00:29:48,874
Then, inflate my tires.

213
00:30:06,194 --> 00:30:08,874
I have money to buy me a sausage.

214
00:30:11,475 --> 00:30:16,194
Those people gave me money
to buy your good sausages.

215
00:30:17,475 --> 00:30:18,995
I've come here as you asked.

216
00:30:21,835 --> 00:30:24,475
This is my private mode of transport,
it's quite responsive.

217
00:30:24,555 --> 00:30:26,914
It's much faster than a Porsche
in the traffic.

218
00:30:28,194 --> 00:30:29,115
Yeah?

219
00:30:32,315 --> 00:30:33,315
Come here!

220
00:30:34,194 --> 00:30:36,194
It's faster.

221
00:30:36,275 --> 00:30:42,115
Ah, I get it! You prefer the old ones.
Those with a big belly.

222
00:30:42,194 --> 00:30:43,115
You whore!

223
00:34:46,595 --> 00:34:48,515
Come on, get in!

224
00:34:54,355 --> 00:34:56,634
We are closing, hurry up!

225
00:34:58,635 --> 00:35:01,274
-It's beautiful, isn't it?
-Yeah.

226
00:35:01,355 --> 00:35:02,635
Did you get the catalog?

227
00:35:03,555 --> 00:35:04,915
There is one in the boot.

228
00:35:07,355 --> 00:35:08,715
Here it is!

229
00:35:18,075 --> 00:35:20,515
We are closing! Get out, please!

230
00:35:37,355 --> 00:35:38,435
And so?

231
00:35:40,955 --> 00:35:42,075
And so what?

232
00:35:43,235 --> 00:35:44,235
What do we do now?

233
00:35:45,155 --> 00:35:46,314
Nothing!

234
00:35:50,834 --> 00:35:53,955
"Miss, I invite you to pass
the evening in the trunk of a car."

235
00:35:55,555 --> 00:35:57,754
If you'd told me so
I would have thought you were crazy.

236
00:36:00,395 --> 00:36:03,435
Miss, I invite you to pass the evening
in the trunk of a car.

237
00:36:04,875 --> 00:36:06,314
Am I crazy?

238
00:36:08,515 --> 00:36:10,235
What were you talking about on your moped?

239
00:36:12,395 --> 00:36:13,395
Nothing.

240
00:36:15,675 --> 00:36:16,754
Random things.

241
00:36:17,515 --> 00:36:18,715
Which things?

242
00:36:21,475 --> 00:36:23,555
-Didn't you hear anything?
-No, nothing!

243
00:36:27,314 --> 00:36:30,395
-So why did you get off?
-Because you played your cards right.

244
00:36:35,875 --> 00:36:37,314
I said you're a bitch!

245
00:36:38,955 --> 00:36:40,435
Yeah, I said you're horrible.

246
00:36:40,515 --> 00:36:43,475
Because a man with a Porsche
who wants to sleep with you

247
00:36:43,555 --> 00:36:45,794
is worth more than a man with a moped.

248
00:36:54,354 --> 00:36:55,754
The man on the moped is beautiful!

249
00:36:57,555 --> 00:36:58,595
I'm hungry.

250
00:37:01,195 --> 00:37:03,515
Then why did you come here with me?

251
00:37:05,075 --> 00:37:07,274
Is that all you have to tell me?

252
00:37:07,354 --> 00:37:09,675
Why? Isn't that enough?

253
00:37:10,435 --> 00:37:11,995
Yes, that's true, you're right.

254
00:37:12,834 --> 00:37:17,115
I've been hit on by guys with cars,
others on foot…

255
00:37:22,075 --> 00:37:23,675
I'm the first on a moped!

256
00:37:32,314 --> 00:37:33,354
I love you.

257
00:37:35,595 --> 00:37:38,354
Isn't it good? It's a perfect alibi
if they catch me!

258
00:37:38,435 --> 00:37:40,555
-A romantic love!
-It's perfect.

259
00:37:41,595 --> 00:37:43,314
Are you here to flatten the tires?

260
00:37:44,995 --> 00:37:46,635
To commit arson? Steal a Rolls?

261
00:37:47,955 --> 00:37:51,155
No, I'm here to steal some spare parts,
I need 15,000 francs.

262
00:37:51,235 --> 00:37:53,195
To steal valuable parts!

263
00:37:53,274 --> 00:37:56,155
-Can't you just steal?
-I'm not a thief.

264
00:37:56,955 --> 00:37:58,035
And I'm not an alibi.

265
00:38:00,235 --> 00:38:01,794
Don't touch me!

266
00:38:01,875 --> 00:38:05,754
-Let me get out or I'll slap you!
-Try it!

267
00:38:16,115 --> 00:38:17,155
Stop it.

268
00:38:19,834 --> 00:38:20,915
Stop it!

269
00:38:24,955 --> 00:38:26,115
I'm hungry.

270
00:38:56,075 --> 00:38:57,754
I didn't come here to steal, sir!

271
00:38:57,834 --> 00:39:00,715
I have no money for a hotel and
my mom doesn't want me home.

272
00:39:00,794 --> 00:39:02,715
There's a girl in the trunk.

273
00:39:03,875 --> 00:39:06,875
Are you scared? No.

274
00:39:06,955 --> 00:39:08,155
I'll get to work.

275
00:39:09,995 --> 00:39:13,235
No, wait. Trust me.
I'll find the 15,000 francs.

276
00:39:16,515 --> 00:39:17,595
How are you going to?

277
00:39:18,274 --> 00:39:20,195
-Let's go.
-Let's wait for the morning.

278
00:41:10,115 --> 00:41:11,794
ENTRANCE

279
00:42:06,834 --> 00:42:07,715
Once more.

280
00:42:08,675 --> 00:42:11,075
Come on, once more, but stronger!

281
00:42:11,155 --> 00:42:12,995
I can't punch you!

282
00:42:13,075 --> 00:42:16,235
-Yes, just do it!
-Let me go.

283
00:42:16,314 --> 00:42:18,595
-Do it!
-Leave me!

284
00:42:18,675 --> 00:42:19,955
Hit me!

285
00:42:22,354 --> 00:42:24,155
-Hit me!
-No!

286
00:42:24,235 --> 00:42:26,515
Give me a punch!

287
00:42:26,595 --> 00:42:28,915
-Do you really want it?
-Yes!

288
00:42:28,995 --> 00:42:30,875
-You asked for it!
-Hit me!

289
00:42:40,155 --> 00:42:42,395
Go and find him!

290
00:42:43,435 --> 00:42:46,155
Go get the boss!

291
00:43:04,274 --> 00:43:05,274
Wet it.

292
00:43:30,794 --> 00:43:34,715
Stay seated, if it doesn't get better,
I'll call a doctor, okay?

293
00:43:40,915 --> 00:43:44,314
I have something else to sell
and I will get some big notes.

294
00:43:44,395 --> 00:43:45,635
Who and how much?

295
00:43:47,155 --> 00:43:48,314
It doesn't matter!

296
00:43:49,115 --> 00:43:51,675
You take 3,000 and we leave and win.

297
00:43:54,995 --> 00:43:58,035
Why are you still thinking?
This time it's done.

298
00:43:58,555 --> 00:44:01,075
Yesterday was the same, but the money
of the maharajah is gone.

299
00:44:01,155 --> 00:44:02,155
Hey, listen!

300
00:44:02,715 --> 00:44:07,035
You're a fool, you'll end up in trouble
because of this rally.

301
00:44:07,955 --> 00:44:11,115
Even if you had that damned car,
I wouldn't leave with you.

302
00:44:12,195 --> 00:44:13,235
Cut it out, idiot.

303
00:44:14,635 --> 00:44:15,995
The pilot sends you to hell.

304
00:44:16,075 --> 00:44:19,314
I'd give you the 15,000 francs,
but I wouldn't leave with you.

305
00:44:20,115 --> 00:44:23,475
You're crazy, if you want it, go alone.

306
00:44:23,555 --> 00:44:25,915
It's better to live as a hairdresser
than a dead driver.

307
00:44:34,235 --> 00:44:37,995
I want to be good with you,
I'll give you my lighter

308
00:44:39,515 --> 00:44:40,754
and my pencil case,

309
00:44:42,435 --> 00:44:43,675
and also my watch too.

310
00:44:43,754 --> 00:44:47,035
Sell them all, start and break your bones.

311
00:44:47,874 --> 00:44:48,955
The notebook.

312
00:44:52,794 --> 00:44:54,314
You're feeling better.

313
00:44:55,435 --> 00:44:57,395
Go back to work, change your overalls.

314
00:45:10,595 --> 00:45:12,475
Mark, you're a jerk.

315
00:45:14,834 --> 00:45:17,155
Take it, here it is, your notebook,

316
00:45:18,035 --> 00:45:21,794
the moped is valued at 1,000 francs,
the clothes are 1,000 at best.

317
00:45:23,035 --> 00:45:24,515
You're completely crazy.

318
00:45:25,754 --> 00:45:28,115
Here, take this one too,
it is worth 10,000.

319
00:45:28,195 --> 00:45:29,955
But next Monday,
you'll deal with the boss.

320
00:45:39,155 --> 00:45:42,155
Wait just a moment, I'll get you the coat.

321
00:45:43,075 --> 00:45:44,274
There you go.

322
00:45:47,035 --> 00:45:50,435
Please, have a seat,
I'll be with you in a second.

323
00:46:07,635 --> 00:46:09,475
Hello, I'd like to talk to Michelle.

324
00:46:11,354 --> 00:46:13,395
No, I'd like to talk to Michelle.

325
00:46:19,635 --> 00:46:20,635
Hello, Michelle?

326
00:46:21,635 --> 00:46:22,874
No, it's nothing!

327
00:46:22,955 --> 00:46:26,395
Yeah, we should carry the wigs
to Mrs. Van de Put immediately.

328
00:46:26,475 --> 00:46:27,595
Yeah.

329
00:46:28,794 --> 00:46:29,834
No, it's nothing!

330
00:46:29,915 --> 00:46:33,555
Call here and ask to get
the wigs delivered immediately, got it?

331
00:46:34,874 --> 00:46:35,915
Yeah.

332
00:46:37,354 --> 00:46:39,874
Yes, soon. Got it? Okay.

333
00:46:51,035 --> 00:46:53,475
-What are you doing?
-Excuse me, ma'am.

334
00:47:00,595 --> 00:47:04,314
You need to deliver this wig
to Mrs. Van de Put immediately.

335
00:47:04,395 --> 00:47:05,955
Sorry, ma'am. Excuse me.

336
00:47:06,035 --> 00:47:07,035
Got it.

337
00:47:10,834 --> 00:47:15,754
-Marc is feeling better and I…
-Are you sick now too?

338
00:47:16,475 --> 00:47:19,314
Go when you've finished and
come back in half an hour.

339
00:48:16,274 --> 00:48:18,314
Hey sir, can you please hold my moped?

340
00:49:12,915 --> 00:49:15,754
-Are you nuts?
-Shut up!

341
00:49:18,435 --> 00:49:19,515
Old witch.

342
00:50:15,155 --> 00:50:18,394
-Well, how much for this original?
-It's a good copy.

343
00:50:18,475 --> 00:50:20,995
Copy? This is the original!

344
00:50:21,075 --> 00:50:22,235
You're "original".

345
00:50:23,235 --> 00:50:25,754
Excuse me, will you help me
get this mirror in?

346
00:50:25,834 --> 00:50:30,794
-How much? It's original.
-Help the lady, the price won't change.

347
00:50:47,394 --> 00:50:48,475
Well.

348
00:50:48,555 --> 00:50:50,035
For the used clothes?

349
00:50:50,955 --> 00:50:52,115
Two hundred francs.

350
00:50:52,915 --> 00:50:55,915
For the used shoes, 100 francs.

351
00:50:56,834 --> 00:50:58,754
For the globe, 100 francs.

352
00:50:59,754 --> 00:51:05,075
For that copy, 300 francs
and that makes 900 for everything.

353
00:51:06,515 --> 00:51:09,794
-But it's the original!
-Yeah, 900 for all!

354
00:51:10,754 --> 00:51:11,715
How much for the mirror?

355
00:51:13,595 --> 00:51:15,235
-I'll give you my watch too.
-The watch?

356
00:51:15,314 --> 00:51:16,314
Yeah.

357
00:51:17,354 --> 00:51:19,435
-Three hundred.
-For the watch?

358
00:51:20,555 --> 00:51:22,235
-But it's a real watch!
-Yeah, 300.

359
00:51:22,314 --> 00:51:23,915
-No.
-No!

360
00:51:23,995 --> 00:51:24,834
How much for the mirror?

361
00:51:25,595 --> 00:51:27,235
No, 350!

362
00:51:27,314 --> 00:51:28,715
-No.
-Well, 300.

363
00:51:28,794 --> 00:51:29,675
Okay, 300 francs.

364
00:51:31,195 --> 00:51:32,115
How much for the mirror?

365
00:51:36,595 --> 00:51:39,195
-Be indifferent, like playing poker.
-What's your opinion?

366
00:51:39,274 --> 00:51:41,155
Who cares about my opinion?

367
00:51:41,235 --> 00:51:44,314
I'm an old man consumed by work,
I'm too good at heart.

368
00:51:44,394 --> 00:51:46,475
Besides, it's not my mirror.

369
00:51:46,555 --> 00:51:49,555
-I have a fantastic moped!
-So go and take a ride with it.

370
00:51:51,955 --> 00:51:54,235
You, instead, you grew up
in front of the mirror.

371
00:51:57,314 --> 00:52:00,715
First, standing up on your tiptoes
to see that nice little face.

372
00:52:02,354 --> 00:52:04,075
Later, to learn how to tie your ribbon.

373
00:52:05,314 --> 00:52:07,754
And it's up to me?
It's up to me to say the price?

374
00:52:11,195 --> 00:52:12,955
Here it is. This is the moped.

375
00:52:13,794 --> 00:52:15,235
I'm not finished yet here.

376
00:52:20,235 --> 00:52:22,035
I wouldn't do this price
even for my daughter.

377
00:52:34,715 --> 00:52:35,915
Including the projector?

378
00:52:40,235 --> 00:52:41,394
What are you waiting for?

379
00:52:41,475 --> 00:52:43,435
I'm waiting for you two to finish
so we can leave.

380
00:52:46,195 --> 00:52:49,155
I can't take care of you.
I have no time to lose.

381
00:52:51,834 --> 00:52:53,715
What, 1,000 francs? Just for the mirror?

382
00:52:53,794 --> 00:52:56,475
The mirror is worth 300
and the moped 2,000.

383
00:52:56,555 --> 00:52:58,635
I'm paying half of it.
If you don't like it…

384
00:52:58,715 --> 00:53:01,195
Okay, whatever, you greedy old man!

385
00:53:06,435 --> 00:53:07,874
That wasn't too bad.

386
00:53:09,394 --> 00:53:11,235
And now let's go for the plait.

387
00:54:16,115 --> 00:54:17,995
Hello. Good morning ma'am, it's me.

388
00:54:18,075 --> 00:54:21,555
Yes, you gave your telephone number.

389
00:54:21,635 --> 00:54:24,595
I have a wonderful red wig.
Do you want it?

390
00:54:25,274 --> 00:54:27,995
What? Hello?
Okay.

391
00:54:30,715 --> 00:54:33,874
She'll come back home tonight…
Very good.

392
00:54:33,955 --> 00:54:35,955
Not earlier? Okay.

393
00:54:36,915 --> 00:54:37,995
I'm sorry. Bye.

394
00:56:22,155 --> 00:56:23,874
You rascal, I'll break your face!

395
00:56:33,754 --> 00:56:34,754
Out!

396
00:56:49,075 --> 00:56:51,595
-Are you mad at me?
-Because that's not your business!

397
00:56:51,675 --> 00:56:52,515
But why me?

398
00:57:01,475 --> 00:57:04,394
Calm down and wait for me at the bar.

399
00:57:04,475 --> 00:57:07,155
We'll have a drink and sort this out.

400
00:57:17,515 --> 00:57:19,274
Well, give me a coke.

401
00:57:20,555 --> 00:57:24,075
Better yet, give me a Porto.

402
00:57:25,235 --> 00:57:28,635
No, give me an aperitif.

403
00:57:28,715 --> 00:57:29,794
Yeah, that's it.

404
00:57:34,075 --> 00:57:36,635
No, give me a cocktail.

405
00:57:40,195 --> 00:57:42,675
-Which one, mister?
-A cocktail.

406
00:57:44,515 --> 00:57:45,754
For a young lady!

407
00:57:47,075 --> 00:57:48,195
Tenerissimo.

408
00:58:00,035 --> 00:58:01,675
How much do I owe you?

409
00:58:02,475 --> 00:58:03,515
Is that enough?

410
00:59:10,715 --> 00:59:11,754
How did you guess?

411
00:59:14,274 --> 00:59:15,794
I know lots of little things.

412
00:59:17,035 --> 00:59:18,195
Tenerissimo.

413
00:59:19,354 --> 00:59:21,075
And for example, what now?

414
00:59:23,995 --> 00:59:25,035
Another one?

415
00:59:25,914 --> 00:59:29,035
You're not so foolish.
Even if you go around with a wig.

416
00:59:34,354 --> 00:59:36,675
It's just a pretext, I guess.

417
00:59:36,754 --> 00:59:37,914
You're not such a fool.

418
00:59:39,675 --> 00:59:40,715
Another one.

419
00:59:41,914 --> 00:59:43,435
The first one has been paid, ma'am.

420
00:59:44,115 --> 00:59:45,155
Thank you.

421
00:59:49,235 --> 00:59:51,874
What can I offer you? Ice cream?

422
00:59:53,274 --> 00:59:56,555
Cakes? Cinema?

423
01:00:15,754 --> 01:00:18,435
Forget the wig, take it,
here's the notebook.

424
01:00:18,515 --> 01:00:20,754
-What is it?
-Read it, you'll become a racing driver.

425
01:00:20,834 --> 01:00:23,675
-Where are you going?
-Don't worry, I'll be back with the money.

426
01:00:27,834 --> 01:00:30,394
-Do you know where the brake pedal is?
-I also know where the accelerator is.

427
01:00:32,354 --> 01:00:33,635
Then you drive.

428
01:01:15,874 --> 01:01:17,035
Not bad.

429
01:01:19,675 --> 01:01:21,475
With a Porsche, it would be better.

430
01:01:25,675 --> 01:01:27,715
Because with a Porsche…

431
01:02:43,314 --> 01:02:46,075
Are you hoping I'll add a Porsche
to your number plates?

432
01:02:46,995 --> 01:02:49,354
I didn't ask you for anything.

433
01:02:53,115 --> 01:02:54,874
Was it by chance that
we met at the fashion show?

434
01:02:55,555 --> 01:02:57,354
Or was it by chance that
you had the wig with you?

435
01:02:58,834 --> 01:03:01,155
Sometimes it's good luck,
sometimes it's bad.

436
01:03:01,235 --> 01:03:02,555
This time, it was unlucky.

437
01:03:04,195 --> 01:03:05,195
That was your plan!

438
01:03:06,115 --> 01:03:09,435
You smile and when she asks you
what you want,

439
01:03:09,515 --> 01:03:13,555
you answer: "I requested a Porsche,
but I just have the number plates".

440
01:03:14,075 --> 01:03:16,874
Please, may I ask you to
take me back to the fashion show?

441
01:03:17,515 --> 01:03:21,914
Because down there,
there's a a friend with a car.

442
01:03:23,675 --> 01:03:24,914
How much do you need?

443
01:03:27,354 --> 01:03:28,955
You know, that doesn't matter anymore.

444
01:03:31,155 --> 01:03:34,075
Does it have to be
a Porsche 1600 or a 912?

445
01:03:36,675 --> 01:03:39,874
No, it's a 911 S.

446
01:03:40,754 --> 01:03:44,955
Okay, you come to my place
and we'll talk about it quietly.

447
01:03:53,274 --> 01:03:58,235
Try to understand. First of all,
I have to win the rally!

448
01:04:01,515 --> 01:04:02,635
Hey.

449
01:04:16,995 --> 01:04:18,235
Can we go now?

450
01:04:20,394 --> 01:04:22,595
It's too late now, the shop is closed.

451
01:04:44,075 --> 01:04:47,314
Yes, I know, but the deposit
is my guarantee!

452
01:04:47,394 --> 01:04:49,955
Here's some money,
plus these wigs are worth plenty.

453
01:04:50,035 --> 01:04:52,874
-Sorry, what are you saying?
-They're worth 10,000 francs!

454
01:04:52,955 --> 01:04:53,834
I'm not denying it.

455
01:04:53,914 --> 01:04:56,955
I want to rent a Porsche,
here's the money and the hair.

456
01:04:58,515 --> 01:05:00,195
Is it your sister's
or your girlfriend's money?

457
01:05:00,274 --> 01:05:04,874
They're valued at 10,000 francs,
call any hairdresser, they'll tell you.

458
01:05:04,955 --> 01:05:07,035
As far as the money's concerned,
here it is!

459
01:05:07,595 --> 01:05:11,115
I'm sorry, sir, to rent a car
you'd need to be at least 23 years old.

460
01:05:11,195 --> 01:05:14,314
I have a driver's license.
Isn't there any other way?

461
01:05:14,394 --> 01:05:15,515
Nothing you can do?

462
01:05:24,834 --> 01:05:27,274
Be careful not to lose your 10,000 francs.

463
01:05:41,794 --> 01:05:43,955
Then, won't you ask me how it went?

464
01:05:44,914 --> 01:05:47,515
-We could go to the cinema.
-No!

465
01:05:49,515 --> 01:05:51,115
-I'll steal a car!
-Are you crazy?

466
01:05:51,195 --> 01:05:52,955
I'm not crazy, it's the only solution.

467
01:06:07,595 --> 01:06:08,955
That imbecile closed it.

468
01:06:10,235 --> 01:06:12,075
We'll find an unlocked Porsche.

469
01:06:46,354 --> 01:06:47,635
I'm tired!

470
01:07:12,794 --> 01:07:13,834
Fill her up.

471
01:07:17,434 --> 01:07:19,834
Hey, the money!

472
01:07:21,754 --> 01:07:22,874
Give me the money.

473
01:07:46,834 --> 01:07:48,754
Wait for me!

474
01:07:48,834 --> 01:07:51,595
Michelle, wait for me!

475
01:07:51,675 --> 01:07:54,595
Michelle, wait!

476
01:08:08,155 --> 01:08:10,475
-It's over!
-Why?

477
01:08:10,555 --> 01:08:13,235
Because a dog is a dog and a car is a car.

478
01:08:23,634 --> 01:08:24,715
What's the matter?

479
01:08:38,514 --> 01:08:39,915
I'm calling the gas station.

480
01:08:40,995 --> 01:08:42,394
Do you want me to talk?

481
01:08:44,434 --> 01:08:46,875
-You know what to say?
-Give it to me.

482
01:08:50,354 --> 01:08:51,554
Hello?

483
01:08:51,634 --> 01:08:54,875
My brother has borrowed a car.

484
01:08:55,594 --> 01:08:58,795
Yes, next to you,
he found it, there's a dog inside.

485
01:08:58,875 --> 01:09:01,554
It was a stupid prank.

486
01:09:01,634 --> 01:09:02,955
It's not a big crime.

487
01:09:04,155 --> 01:09:05,514
You can inform the owner.

488
01:10:28,435 --> 01:10:31,115
Have a seat, ma'am. Please.

489
01:10:32,514 --> 01:10:33,795
This is a comb.

490
01:10:36,275 --> 01:10:38,115
I have to use it with my right hand.

491
01:10:39,875 --> 01:10:43,195
I have to use it with extreme gentleness.

492
01:10:44,715 --> 01:10:47,355
It has to be lustrous, very lustrous.

493
01:10:48,955 --> 01:10:49,995
Too lustrous.

494
01:10:52,435 --> 01:10:55,634
I have to bear every change in your mood.

495
01:10:57,475 --> 01:10:58,674
I dress in white.

496
01:10:59,554 --> 01:11:02,315
To signify that I'm clean enough
to get next to you.

497
01:11:04,155 --> 01:11:05,395
It's my stage costume

498
01:11:06,915 --> 01:11:08,395
and I know my role very well.

499
01:11:17,715 --> 01:11:20,355
-My boss!
-Is he coming upstairs?

500
01:11:20,435 --> 01:11:22,435
I don't know what they asked him to do.

501
01:12:06,514 --> 01:12:08,115
-Take this!
-Why?

502
01:12:08,195 --> 01:12:09,275
Take it!

503
01:12:13,514 --> 01:12:15,554
-Get in.
-Why?

504
01:12:15,634 --> 01:12:16,634
Get in!

505
01:12:47,795 --> 01:12:50,634
-What did you write?
-And what do you care?

506
01:12:50,715 --> 01:12:53,795
You could be kind. I'm doing you a favor.

507
01:12:58,634 --> 01:13:01,355
I wrote to my boss
that I borrowed his Porsche

508
01:13:01,435 --> 01:13:04,035
to participate in
tomorrow's rally with it.

509
01:13:04,995 --> 01:13:06,155
That's what I wrote.

510
01:13:08,875 --> 01:13:11,155
I didn't understand anything
written on the notebook.

511
01:13:11,235 --> 01:13:12,155
Wear your helmet!

512
01:13:12,235 --> 01:13:15,075
-Why are you telling me to wear a helmet?
-Listen to me, wear it!

513
01:14:14,475 --> 01:14:16,554
Great, we have still some time left.

514
01:14:18,235 --> 01:14:21,275
-We're only 100 meters from the hotel.
-We can't spend money.

515
01:14:21,355 --> 01:14:25,155
-If we don't sleep, we are done.
-It's you who needs to sleep, go.

516
01:14:30,395 --> 01:14:31,755
Pass, pass…

517
01:14:57,155 --> 01:14:59,155
Shut up, the old women will hear it.

518
01:15:18,674 --> 01:15:19,835
You're a good driver.

519
01:15:22,435 --> 01:15:24,395
-And you?
-A good co-driver?

520
01:15:28,435 --> 01:15:29,674
I don't know.

521
01:15:32,915 --> 01:15:33,915
Tomorrow we'll see.

522
01:15:38,554 --> 01:15:40,554
You should be faster in signaling me.

523
01:15:41,795 --> 01:15:44,115
You're very good at saying
"attention", "bend",

524
01:15:45,634 --> 01:15:47,714
you pause too much when reading the speed,

525
01:15:48,554 --> 01:15:50,315
but some bends can be…

526
01:15:51,634 --> 01:15:54,795
-Don't think about it.
-It's very important.

527
01:15:56,634 --> 01:15:57,674
No.

528
01:16:01,634 --> 01:16:04,235
What's more important?

529
01:16:27,955 --> 01:16:29,155
It's the…

530
01:16:31,955 --> 01:16:33,514
It's the bathroom.

531
01:18:12,195 --> 01:18:13,634
I have nothing to get shaved.

532
01:18:20,035 --> 01:18:22,195
Did you see how I counter steer?

533
01:18:39,915 --> 01:18:41,634
The main thing is
to keep your arms extended.

534
01:18:43,634 --> 01:18:45,075
It's by the principle
of centrifugal force.

535
01:18:45,755 --> 01:18:47,075
Stop being silly, come here.

536
01:18:53,835 --> 01:18:55,355
Do you want a nut?

537
01:18:57,714 --> 01:18:58,755
Here it is!

538
01:19:00,634 --> 01:19:01,755
Turn off the light.

539
01:19:20,594 --> 01:19:21,915
You're all wet!

540
01:19:21,995 --> 01:19:24,634
In this filthy hotel, there aren't
any towels and water is frozen.

541
01:19:27,155 --> 01:19:28,155
Take the suitcase.

542
01:19:46,275 --> 01:19:47,514
Take your sweater off.

543
01:20:01,355 --> 01:20:02,355
Turn round.

544
01:20:29,275 --> 01:20:32,475
You're getting a chance to see me naked.

545
01:20:32,554 --> 01:20:34,795
It was a beautiful day in autumn.

546
01:20:36,275 --> 01:20:40,315
My first dog. Me and my mom
fed him by baby's bottle.

547
01:20:41,995 --> 01:20:43,514
Is he still alive?

548
01:20:44,634 --> 01:20:46,315
No. Clearly you haven't had a dog before.

549
01:20:48,195 --> 01:20:49,755
He died a long time ago.

550
01:20:49,835 --> 01:20:54,634
That's my first professional photo,
I used to be a model.

551
01:20:54,714 --> 01:20:57,714
-I'm the one on the left, of course.
-Are you still a model?

552
01:20:57,795 --> 01:20:59,435
No, now it's over.

553
01:21:00,475 --> 01:21:03,674
I forced myself to dance.

554
01:21:03,755 --> 01:21:05,955
It was half dance and half gym.

555
01:21:07,155 --> 01:21:10,435
-That is my first cover.
-And your first bike.

556
01:21:10,514 --> 01:21:14,395
No! We have painted the background.

557
01:21:17,235 --> 01:21:19,755
They told me to wear the hats as well.

558
01:21:19,835 --> 01:21:23,235
This is a make up test.

559
01:21:23,315 --> 01:21:25,075
You'd have been happy!

560
01:21:25,915 --> 01:21:30,475
That is my first appearance
in front of a television camera.

561
01:21:30,554 --> 01:21:33,115
The first and the last, for TV.

562
01:21:35,674 --> 01:21:39,755
I was interviewed to know
what I thought about a soap.

563
01:21:39,835 --> 01:21:42,035
-Which soap?
-Just a soap…

564
01:21:42,115 --> 01:21:47,155
Here, I was becoming aware
of the end of my career.

565
01:21:47,235 --> 01:21:51,795
I was sad because for me it was fun,

566
01:21:53,554 --> 01:21:55,195
it was something extraordinary.

567
01:21:57,554 --> 01:21:59,835
There I'm…

568
01:22:02,395 --> 01:22:04,355
-Nothing…
-Who is he?

569
01:22:04,435 --> 01:22:06,235
Just a guy.

570
01:22:07,475 --> 01:22:09,115
And what are you doing with him there?

571
01:22:09,195 --> 01:22:13,035
Nothing,
it's just a picture, he was a model.

572
01:22:15,035 --> 01:22:16,514
And that one?

573
01:22:18,514 --> 01:22:19,554
Are you sleeping?

574
01:22:21,514 --> 01:22:23,355
Are you asleep? Answer me.

575
01:23:46,514 --> 01:23:47,995
What's happening?

576
01:23:54,594 --> 01:23:56,795
-Nothing.
-Didn't you wake up?

577
01:24:03,315 --> 01:24:04,315
No.

578
01:24:06,634 --> 01:24:07,674
Get up.

579
01:24:20,355 --> 01:24:21,315
Get up!
