1
00:00:10,248 --> 00:00:16,248
After pondering the situation in the worldand in our empire,

2
00:00:16,349 --> 00:00:22,049
...we have decided to resort to
an extraordinary measure.

3
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:27,050
Loyal subjects, we have ordered
our government...

4
00:00:27,051 --> 00:00:31,051
...to communicate tothe USA, Great Britain,

5
00:00:31,052 --> 00:00:34,052
...China and the USSR,

6
00:00:34,053 --> 00:00:38,053
...our acceptance of
the provisions...

7
00:00:38,054 --> 00:00:41,054
...of their Joint Declaration.

8
00:00:43,055 --> 00:00:48,055
To strive for the security and
well-being of our subjects...

9
00:00:48,056 --> 00:00:52,056
...and for the prosperity and happiness
of all nations, is a....

10
00:00:52,057 --> 00:00:58,557
...solemn obligation handed down by
our imperial ancestors.

11
00:00:59,558 --> 00:01:03,558
We declared war on
the USA and Britain...

12
00:01:03,559 --> 00:01:08,559
...out of a desire to ensure
the self-preservation of Japan...

13
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,560
...and the stability of
East Asia.

14
00:01:11,561 --> 00:01:13,561
To violate the sovereignty of others...

15
00:01:13,562 --> 00:01:16,562
...or to embark on
territorial aggrandizement,

16
00:01:16,563 --> 00:01:20,563
...was far from our
thoughts.

17
00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:24,607
Relax.

18
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,411
Gently. Or it will bemore difficult.

19
00:01:30,656 --> 00:01:33,682
Open your mouth when I tell you.

20
00:01:33,792 --> 00:01:36,693
Keep it closed now.

21
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:41,556
You are doing fine, just fine.

22
00:01:41,667 --> 00:01:44,158
The pain is coming back?

23
00:01:44,603 --> 00:01:47,834
Close your mouth.

24
00:01:49,108 --> 00:01:51,303
Do you feel the needfor a bowel movement?

25
00:01:51,577 --> 00:01:52,271
Do you?

26
00:01:52,511 --> 00:01:57,278
Is that what it feels like?
Well, squeeze tightly then.

27
00:02:05,023 --> 00:02:08,390
Prepare the water!

28
00:02:27,913 --> 00:02:29,039
Hurry!

29
00:02:48,467 --> 00:02:50,731
The light has come on again. At last.

30
00:03:27,739 --> 00:03:32,233
It's a boy...
Congratulations.

31
00:03:37,234 --> 00:03:42,234
On August 15 1945. Japan announced
its unconditional surrender.

32
00:03:42,235 --> 00:03:47,235
Taiwan was liberated following
51 years of Japanese occupation.

33
00:03:47,236 --> 00:03:52,136
The wife of older brother,
Lin Wen-heung, gave birth to a son.

34
00:03:52,237 --> 00:03:56,237
They named him Kang-ming,
which means Light.

35
00:04:00,235 --> 00:04:09,235
CITY OF SADNESS
Directed by Hou Hsiao-hsien

36
00:04:32,638 --> 00:04:35,732
Going already?
Sorry for the mess.

37
00:04:36,608 --> 00:04:38,041
We didn't give you a proper welcome.

38
00:04:38,377 --> 00:04:40,072
Come again.

39
00:04:43,382 --> 00:04:46,715
- Ah, hello.
- A small gift for you.

40
00:04:47,486 --> 00:04:49,613
Go and play over there.

41
00:04:50,622 --> 00:04:54,683
Behave or grandfather will
take a stick to you.

42
00:04:57,262 --> 00:04:59,890
Yes, it's me.

43
00:05:00,532 --> 00:05:02,124
Thank you, thank you.

44
00:05:02,567 --> 00:05:03,829
I don't want to inconvenience you.

45
00:05:03,935 --> 00:05:05,698
I am sorry to trouble you.

46
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:08,897
Thanks.

47
00:05:10,309 --> 00:05:12,539
Until this evening then.

48
00:05:12,911 --> 00:05:16,403
I'll be waiting for you.

49
00:05:23,622 --> 00:05:24,520
Wen-heung,

50
00:05:25,324 --> 00:05:29,385
...did you tell your brother
you were coming?

51
00:05:31,029 --> 00:05:32,553
I wrote to Wen-ching.

52
00:05:32,931 --> 00:05:35,195
He is too busy to come.

53
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:36,631
He can't come?

54
00:05:36,902 --> 00:05:40,929
So who will take
the photos?

55
00:05:41,206 --> 00:05:45,973
Don't worry, father.
I've arranged everything.

56
00:05:46,078 --> 00:05:47,807
Who did you ask?

57
00:05:47,913 --> 00:05:51,849
A photographer friend
of old Gao-kun.

58
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:54,510
He's a top-knotch photographer.

59
00:05:54,786 --> 00:05:56,083
The best in the district.

60
00:05:56,188 --> 00:05:57,780
Not as good as Wen-ching.

61
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:01,457
Mr Xu is here.
Show him in.

62
00:06:19,678 --> 00:06:23,011
To business and to our
future prosperity.

63
00:06:23,115 --> 00:06:25,208
To prosperity!

64
00:06:38,609 --> 00:06:40,609
LITTLE SHANGHAI

65
00:06:46,204 --> 00:06:49,196
Stay still, don't move.

66
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:51,850
Don't move.

67
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,700
Smile, please.

68
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,150
Ready?

69
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,500
Thanks!

70
00:07:08,226 --> 00:07:11,992
20 years and 11 months of
the Showa Emperor.

71
00:07:12,297 --> 00:07:14,527
Good weather, with clouds.

72
00:07:15,934 --> 00:07:18,494
I took the letter of recommendation
from my father...

73
00:07:18,837 --> 00:07:22,068
...to look for work at the
Kimguishiu Miners Hospital.

74
00:07:22,741 --> 00:07:24,470
My brother was giving classes and...

75
00:07:24,643 --> 00:07:27,612
...sent his friend Wen-ching
to pick me up.

76
00:07:29,347 --> 00:07:31,747
It was cool in the mountains...

77
00:07:31,917 --> 00:07:33,714
...and the view was lovely.

78
00:07:34,519 --> 00:07:38,615
From now on, I will see it
every day

79
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:41,281
I feel so happy.

80
00:08:21,666 --> 00:08:22,690
A photograph.

81
00:08:44,289 --> 00:08:45,256
Beautiful.

82
00:09:47,057 --> 00:09:51,057
Photographs of two of my older
brothers before the war.

83
00:09:51,558 --> 00:09:56,558
They have still not returned. Someone in
Shanghai saw my third brother.

84
00:09:56,559 --> 00:10:01,559
But we have had no news of the second,
who was sent to the Philippines.

85
00:10:33,598 --> 00:10:35,395
This is the studio of Wen-ching.

86
00:10:36,396 --> 00:10:38,396
Hinoe says that this is the
studio of Wen-ching.

87
00:10:40,405 --> 00:10:41,463
Why isn't he here?

88
00:10:46,978 --> 00:10:47,808
Where is Wen-ching?

89
00:10:47,912 --> 00:10:49,880
At the back, taking photos.

90
00:10:50,749 --> 00:10:52,011
Come in, please.

91
00:11:33,012 --> 00:11:35,012
- After you.
- No, after you.

92
00:11:39,431 --> 00:11:40,625
Are all these books yours?

93
00:11:41,766 --> 00:11:43,757
Mine and Wen-ching's.

94
00:11:43,868 --> 00:11:45,460
We are real
book worms.

95
00:11:47,038 --> 00:11:48,266
Are you reading Marx?

96
00:11:49,174 --> 00:11:50,732
Very progressive, eh?

97
00:11:50,842 --> 00:11:53,504
They are all interesting, and so
we are studying them.

98
00:12:03,354 --> 00:12:06,551
Mr Lin, do you remember Wen-ching?

99
00:12:07,092 --> 00:12:09,026
The deaf man.

100
00:12:10,662 --> 00:12:11,526
Wen-ching.

101
00:12:12,731 --> 00:12:13,720
Let me introduce...

102
00:12:14,899 --> 00:12:15,831
...Mr Lin.

103
00:12:16,032 --> 00:12:16,832
Pleased to meet you.

104
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:18,661
My mentor.

105
00:12:20,839 --> 00:12:22,534
We've heard a lot about you.

106
00:12:26,978 --> 00:12:28,775
It's a pleasure.

107
00:12:30,215 --> 00:12:31,705
Mr Ho, a journalist.

108
00:12:32,717 --> 00:12:33,706
From the mainland.

109
00:12:41,626 --> 00:12:43,093
Please sit down.

110
00:12:50,034 --> 00:12:52,093
Are you familiar with China?

111
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:55,430
There's a lot for me to learn.

112
00:12:55,573 --> 00:12:57,473
China is in a mess
at present.

113
00:12:57,742 --> 00:12:59,573
Ever since Chen Yi became
governor of Taiwan,

114
00:12:59,711 --> 00:13:05,038
...things have changed.
He thinks differently from the Japanese.

115
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:06,539
In what way?

116
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:10,540
He manages things differently
from the Japanese.

117
00:13:11,241 --> 00:13:15,241
Our Japanese director had an
attack this morning...

118
00:13:15,242 --> 00:13:19,242
...but he insisted on going out
after he'd had an injection.

119
00:13:19,243 --> 00:13:22,243
His daughter Shizuko is very sad.

120
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:35,900
During the past 3 days,
dad has been...

121
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:43,400
...threatening to go to the south of Taiwan.
He said that Mr Chen would take him.

122
00:13:44,835 --> 00:13:48,950
But he died years ago.

123
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:52,950
Dad was at his funeral.

124
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:02,750
The other day, the Japanese
Repatriation Office told us...

125
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:07,620
...that a boat would be coming to
Keelung to pick us up.

126
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:11,100
They told us not to go
too far away.

127
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:18,650
But this morning dad packed
his bags and left.

128
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:26,780
We are all very worried.

129
00:14:57,195 --> 00:14:58,492
A pain... in the head.

130
00:14:59,097 --> 00:15:00,792
A pain... in the head.

131
00:15:05,236 --> 00:15:07,136
A pain... in the stomach.

132
00:15:07,605 --> 00:15:09,937
A pain... in the stomach.

133
00:15:15,847 --> 00:15:18,077
Where does it hurt?

134
00:15:54,519 --> 00:15:55,713
Don't worry.

135
00:15:56,554 --> 00:15:58,215
I don't think it's serious.

136
00:15:58,890 --> 00:16:01,222
Thank goodness he came back.

137
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:03,887
He can recover here.

138
00:16:13,871 --> 00:16:16,931
Perhaps my mother's grave is
in an unlucky location.

139
00:16:17,909 --> 00:16:21,606
She died leaving four children.

140
00:16:23,548 --> 00:16:26,278
My younger brother
disappeared in the Phillippines.

141
00:16:26,951 --> 00:16:28,782
The youngest is deaf.

142
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:32,111
The third came back from the war but
is mad.

143
00:16:37,528 --> 00:16:39,325
Wen-leung, what are you doing?

144
00:16:53,311 --> 00:16:55,472
Wen-leung, quiet!

145
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:58,546
Let me be!

146
00:17:05,014 --> 00:17:06,014
Wen-leung, you're mad!

147
00:17:15,014 --> 00:17:16,014
Wen-leung, calm down!

148
00:17:19,804 --> 00:17:21,704
Wen-leung, calm down!

149
00:17:24,275 --> 00:17:25,606
Wen-leung, calm down!

150
00:17:30,014 --> 00:17:32,014
Quiet! Quiet!

151
00:17:57,014 --> 00:18:00,014
It's OK.

152
00:18:58,636 --> 00:19:00,263
He'll be fine now.

153
00:19:00,872 --> 00:19:03,534
When Taiwan was returned
to China,

154
00:19:03,641 --> 00:19:06,508
...they told us we'd change flags.

155
00:19:06,611 --> 00:19:09,375
The Japanese flag is white
with a red circle in the middle.

156
00:19:09,514 --> 00:19:13,450
You can hang it in a way that's...

157
00:19:13,551 --> 00:19:17,214
...different from the Chinese flag.

158
00:19:17,321 --> 00:19:20,188
The people held discussions. Should the sun
be on the top or the bottom?

159
00:19:20,291 --> 00:19:22,350
But the mayor was adamant.
It had to be on the bottom.

160
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:25,461
At daybreak, the sky is red and so
the sun had to be at the bottom.

161
00:19:25,863 --> 00:19:27,524
Everyone had to have it
as he said.

162
00:19:27,665 --> 00:19:30,725
But he sent someone to check.

163
00:19:30,835 --> 00:19:33,861
The first people he checked had
hung it correctly,

164
00:19:33,971 --> 00:19:37,498
...but not in the mountains.

165
00:19:37,708 --> 00:19:40,040
Most people put the sun
on the bottom.

166
00:19:40,144 --> 00:19:41,000
And so the mayor felt
vindicated.

167
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:44,050
But during the day,a man arrived from the city...

168
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:47,048
...and said he was wrong,

169
00:19:47,151 --> 00:19:50,609
...and that they'd shoot him for it.

170
00:19:50,721 --> 00:19:53,849
The mayor landed and gave new orders,

171
00:19:53,991 --> 00:19:56,425
...but it was already sunset.

172
00:19:56,527 --> 00:19:58,222
The sky was completely red.

173
00:19:58,930 --> 00:20:01,421
It's extraordinary. Suddenly Japanese flags...

174
00:20:01,532 --> 00:20:03,659
...were no use any more.

175
00:20:03,801 --> 00:20:05,928
Only as underpants for children.

176
00:20:06,037 --> 00:20:08,335
They all have red bums.

177
00:20:08,573 --> 00:20:10,837
Like monkeys.

178
00:20:10,975 --> 00:20:13,739
Wu too has one.

179
00:20:13,844 --> 00:20:15,150
Mind what you say.

180
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:17,541
This man
is a reporter from the mainland.

181
00:20:17,648 --> 00:20:19,750
Can your wife do something
with my flag?

182
00:20:19,850 --> 00:20:21,256
I'll write that all the teachers...

183
00:20:21,519 --> 00:20:25,478
...in Taiwan have red backsides.

184
00:20:25,623 --> 00:20:28,820
Let's stop talking
and drink.

185
00:20:28,926 --> 00:20:30,757
Cheers.

186
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,000
Let's change the subject.

187
00:20:34,198 --> 00:20:36,792
Now that the war is over,
how are things inTaiwan?

188
00:20:36,901 --> 00:20:39,461
Everything's fine.

189
00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:43,768
We are under the Chinese flag
once more.

190
00:20:44,141 --> 00:20:45,938
Reunited with the motherland.

191
00:20:46,043 --> 00:20:49,501
It's a good feeling.

192
00:20:50,348 --> 00:20:51,940
But to tell the truth,

193
00:20:52,383 --> 00:20:55,409
...Governor Chen Yi
is a bandit...

194
00:20:55,786 --> 00:20:58,152
...and I don't trust
the Nationalist government.

195
00:20:58,256 --> 00:21:00,747
Enough politics!
Let's drink!

196
00:21:01,159 --> 00:21:02,726
Let's drink.

197
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,500
Raise your glasses.

198
00:21:59,016 --> 00:22:00,278
They are singing
"The Song of the Exiles".

199
00:22:00,851 --> 00:22:02,375
Yes, that's right.

200
00:22:02,486 --> 00:22:06,149
We mainlanders
have heard it on the radio.

201
00:22:08,526 --> 00:22:09,151
Let's join in.

202
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:10,784
Yes, let's.

203
00:22:11,385 --> 00:22:13,285
September 18...

204
00:22:14,186 --> 00:22:16,286
September 18...

205
00:22:17,935 --> 00:22:22,031
Ever since that tragic day...

206
00:22:25,232 --> 00:22:27,132
September 18...

207
00:22:28,533 --> 00:22:30,533
September 18...

208
00:22:31,982 --> 00:22:36,009
Ever since that tragic day...

209
00:22:38,756 --> 00:22:43,216
...I have been far from my home.

210
00:22:44,462 --> 00:22:50,765
I abandoned a wealth of treasure...

211
00:22:52,236 --> 00:22:55,569
...and began my wanderings...

212
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:58,431
...began my wanderings.

213
00:22:59,343 --> 00:23:05,077
Far from home...

214
00:23:06,083 --> 00:23:08,483
...I began my wanderings...

215
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:11,650
...began my wanderings.

216
00:23:13,157 --> 00:23:16,251
In what year...

217
00:23:16,394 --> 00:23:19,022
...or in what month...

218
00:23:19,964 --> 00:23:30,670
...will I commence my return
to my beloved home?

219
00:23:31,776 --> 00:23:34,210
In what year...

220
00:23:34,945 --> 00:23:37,573
...or in what month...

221
00:23:38,349 --> 00:23:49,192
...will I commence my return
to my beloved home?

222
00:25:22,464 --> 00:25:23,814
Good day, Miss Shizuko.

223
00:25:23,914 --> 00:25:25,014
Good day.

224
00:25:25,914 --> 00:25:27,164
Is Hinomi here?

225
00:25:27,314 --> 00:25:29,080
She's on duty.

226
00:25:29,250 --> 00:25:30,854
I'm sorry.

227
00:25:32,014 --> 00:25:37,114
- Hello, can I help ypu?
- I'd like to speak to Hinomi.

228
00:25:39,003 --> 00:25:40,630
She's in the surgery.

229
00:25:40,738 --> 00:25:42,035
Maybe she's finished.

230
00:25:42,239 --> 00:25:43,536
Shall I find out for you?

231
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:46,550
Wait a moment, please.

232
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:04,400
This sword was the most precious
possession of my dead brother.

233
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:09,600
It's no use to him now.

234
00:26:11,350 --> 00:26:13,850
Please, give it to Hinoe.

235
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:18,900
I know my brother
will treasure it.

236
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:27,600
This is a poem my brother wrote.

237
00:26:28,150 --> 00:26:32,300
Hinoe was there
when he wrote it.

238
00:26:33,650 --> 00:26:38,050
Please give it to him with the sword
as a memento.

239
00:26:38,570 --> 00:26:40,370
Thank you.

240
00:26:45,850 --> 00:26:47,600
This is for you, Hinomi.

241
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,100
For me?

242
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:01,150
A kimono?

243
00:27:06,090 --> 00:27:07,800
It's lovely,

244
00:27:10,290 --> 00:27:13,800
...but I can't accept it.

245
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:17,300
It's your most precious possession.

246
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:19,750
Please accept it.

247
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:22,050
When I am back in Japan,

248
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:25,070
...you'll think of you whenever you use it.

249
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:28,870
Shizuko...

250
00:27:34,910 --> 00:27:39,400
Hinoe has been so nice
to us all these years.

251
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:52,400
We must never forget
each other.

252
00:28:03,901 --> 00:28:12,801
The dragonfly, red in
the sunset.

253
00:28:13,702 --> 00:28:22,802
Did I see you the other day?

254
00:28:24,003 --> 00:28:33,603
When I was picking
mulberries in the fields,

255
00:28:35,604 --> 00:28:44,404
...did I see you or was
it only a dream?

256
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:25,500
I'll always remember you.

257
00:29:25,550 --> 00:29:27,550
The flowers are blown hither
and thither.

258
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:29,750
I'll soon follow them.

259
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:31,950
The same will come to pass for us all.

260
00:29:58,896 --> 00:30:02,889
The Japanese love the sight
of cherry trees.

261
00:30:03,267 --> 00:30:05,827
First, in bloom...

262
00:30:07,371 --> 00:30:10,397
...and then, when the flowers fall
to earth.

263
00:30:12,242 --> 00:30:16,042
They believe life
too is like that.

264
00:30:17,650 --> 00:30:19,150
In the Meiji Era...

265
00:30:19,190 --> 00:30:21,700
...a woman killed herself
by flinging herself into a waterfall.

266
00:30:22,319 --> 00:30:23,581
In the Meiji Era...

267
00:30:23,954 --> 00:30:26,479
...a woman killed herself
by flinging herself into a waterfall.

268
00:30:27,925 --> 00:30:31,827
She wasn't tired of life. She hadn't
lost the will to live.

269
00:30:32,696 --> 00:30:35,221
She just couldn't face the loss
of her youth.

270
00:30:35,532 --> 00:30:39,400
Once lost, nothing
means anything.

271
00:30:40,537 --> 00:30:42,562
Why not imitate
the cherry blossom...

272
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:45,135
...and fall when in the fullness
of our beauty?

273
00:30:45,275 --> 00:30:47,470
Carried by the wind.

274
00:30:48,912 --> 00:30:50,174
The note she left
was an inspiration...

275
00:30:50,614 --> 00:30:54,516
...to all young people...

276
00:30:55,352 --> 00:30:58,788
...during the Meiji Era.

277
00:30:59,122 --> 00:31:02,091
A time of idealism
and heroic spirit.

278
00:31:20,892 --> 00:31:23,492
The flowers fly hither
and thither.

279
00:31:23,493 --> 00:31:26,493
And I'll soon follow them.

280
00:31:26,494 --> 00:31:28,894
The same will come to pass for us all.

281
00:31:40,163 --> 00:31:41,926
In which ward is Wen-leung?

282
00:31:42,032 --> 00:31:44,364
I see him now.

283
00:31:50,607 --> 00:31:55,374
Wen-leung, business is what men
are for, isn't it?

284
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:58,739
Men can do any kind
of work.

285
00:31:59,516 --> 00:32:02,974
Now that you have recovered,
you can do anything.

286
00:32:03,553 --> 00:32:06,920
You have six boats in your family,

287
00:32:07,557 --> 00:32:09,991
...laden with rice and sugar...

288
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:13,461
...and ready to set sail to make a lot
of money in China.

289
00:32:14,031 --> 00:32:15,828
Those boats are ideal
for smuggling.

290
00:32:16,533 --> 00:32:20,333
We'd make a lot of money
with a single round trip.

291
00:32:22,205 --> 00:32:23,331
What do you say?

292
00:32:26,843 --> 00:32:31,473
I'll have to ask
my brother.

293
00:32:33,717 --> 00:32:35,344
Ask what?

294
00:32:35,452 --> 00:32:38,285
Do you consult him on everything?

295
00:32:38,422 --> 00:32:41,186
Let's keep this between ourselves.

296
00:32:41,291 --> 00:32:45,057
We Shanghai people are well
organized. Don't worry.

297
00:32:45,162 --> 00:32:46,390
We'll take care of everything.

298
00:32:47,164 --> 00:32:49,428
The rice and the sugar
are not a problem.

299
00:32:49,933 --> 00:32:52,060
Come on, be shrewed.

300
00:32:52,169 --> 00:32:56,071
When opportunity knocks,
it's foolish not to open the door.

301
00:33:00,410 --> 00:33:01,434
Cheers!

302
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:04,512
To you, Wen-leung.

303
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:14,120
Ah-ga, enjoying the company
of the ladies, I see.

304
00:33:17,294 --> 00:33:19,888
Ah-tao, look to table eight.

305
00:33:20,530 --> 00:33:22,020
Excuse me.

306
00:33:22,833 --> 00:33:26,234
May I present Tsun-chu
and Yen-hung.

307
00:33:26,470 --> 00:33:29,962
Be nice to these mainlanders,
and see they have a good time.

308
00:33:34,277 --> 00:33:35,403
What's this?

309
00:33:36,713 --> 00:33:38,374
We are talking business!

310
00:33:38,882 --> 00:33:41,350
What are all these women
doing here?

311
00:33:42,119 --> 00:33:44,349
Come sit here.

312
00:33:44,454 --> 00:33:45,978
Come.

313
00:33:46,123 --> 00:33:47,283
Forget those mainlanders.

314
00:34:10,347 --> 00:34:12,008
I was waiting for you.

315
00:34:12,315 --> 00:34:14,579
I have a business proposal for you.

316
00:34:22,726 --> 00:34:25,854
Take a good look.
Can you tell the difference?

317
00:34:35,272 --> 00:34:37,672
Red Monkey, introduce me.

318
00:34:38,241 --> 00:34:39,139
It's Ah-ga.

319
00:34:39,242 --> 00:34:40,834
This is my girl, Ah-tsun.

320
00:34:40,944 --> 00:34:41,968
Hello.

321
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:43,068
You're very beautiful.

322
00:34:43,180 --> 00:34:44,704
And you're very nice.

323
00:34:44,981 --> 00:34:46,915
Have a cigarette.

324
00:34:47,617 --> 00:34:48,777
Let me light it for you.

325
00:34:50,253 --> 00:34:53,745
Mr. Ah-ga, we were hoping
to see you more often.

326
00:34:53,857 --> 00:34:54,881
You will.

327
00:34:54,991 --> 00:34:56,117
Thanks.

328
00:34:56,226 --> 00:34:58,194
I'm going in, Red Monkey.

329
00:35:03,834 --> 00:35:07,634
These are real Japanese
banknotes.

330
00:35:07,838 --> 00:35:10,363
We'll put a stamp on them
and then they can be cashed.

331
00:35:14,277 --> 00:35:15,938
Is it Kimguichiu's share?

332
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:17,704
How many do you have?

333
00:35:19,616 --> 00:35:21,311
A full valise.

334
00:35:21,818 --> 00:35:23,547
Have you had an idea?

335
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:28,620
No problem.

336
00:35:38,168 --> 00:35:40,398
Not now, Red Monkey.

337
00:35:41,705 --> 00:35:43,366
I want to sleep.

338
00:35:43,473 --> 00:35:45,304
Let me rest.

339
00:35:46,409 --> 00:35:47,774
I don't want to do it now.

340
00:35:53,216 --> 00:35:56,049
Later.
Let me sleep a while.

341
00:36:00,891 --> 00:36:01,789
Who is it?

342
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:18,799
Hinomi, are you busy?

343
00:37:18,902 --> 00:37:19,869
A bit.

344
00:37:19,950 --> 00:37:21,014
Here.

345
00:37:21,271 --> 00:37:24,570
When I was here, everyone
was so nice to me.

346
00:37:24,774 --> 00:37:26,036
Take these fruits as
thanks.

347
00:37:26,443 --> 00:37:28,411
My thanks to you all.

348
00:37:28,511 --> 00:37:29,409
Thank you.

349
00:38:27,537 --> 00:38:31,200
The mainland police killed a
cigarette vendor, did you know that?

350
00:38:31,308 --> 00:38:32,434
Yes, I heard.

351
00:38:32,542 --> 00:38:34,567
- You too?
- Yes.

352
00:38:34,678 --> 00:38:38,580
The local people were furious.
The whole street was very tense.

353
00:38:38,715 --> 00:38:40,080
Really furious.

354
00:38:40,183 --> 00:38:41,810
Things were quite explosive.

355
00:38:42,052 --> 00:38:43,280
The cigarettes were brought in as
contraband...

356
00:38:44,354 --> 00:38:46,584
...by a senior official.

357
00:38:46,723 --> 00:38:48,782
Bribery is rife.

358
00:38:48,892 --> 00:38:53,795
They pursue the little fish but
leave the big fish alone.

359
00:38:59,302 --> 00:39:01,429
- We don't have to smoke.
- I do.

360
00:39:01,538 --> 00:39:05,474
I can't go without cigarettes.

361
00:39:09,846 --> 00:39:14,340
Cigarettes are not as
important as rice.

362
00:39:15,285 --> 00:39:18,550
Prices are controlled by
Shanghai...

363
00:39:18,655 --> 00:39:19,952
...to keep up their profits.

364
00:39:20,123 --> 00:39:23,058
The civil servants don't only deal
in contraband cigarettes.

365
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:26,429
They don't care if we have
rice and sugar,

366
00:39:26,529 --> 00:39:29,623
...only money.

367
00:39:31,167 --> 00:39:34,933
Under the Japanese, times were hard
but we always had rice.

368
00:39:35,171 --> 00:39:39,130
In less than a year,
rice has gone up 52%.

369
00:39:39,309 --> 00:39:41,869
But have salaries gone up?

370
00:39:42,278 --> 00:39:43,677
You are right.

371
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:47,677
Let's face it, this is not a government;
it's a private company.

372
00:39:48,385 --> 00:39:50,444
Governor Chen Yi is filling...

373
00:39:50,687 --> 00:39:53,656
...his own pockets,

374
00:39:53,757 --> 00:39:55,520
...not yours.

375
00:39:56,326 --> 00:39:57,350
Please, eat a little of the
rice dumpling.

376
00:39:58,862 --> 00:40:00,220
Hinomi made it.

377
00:40:00,225 --> 00:40:00,880
Thank you.

378
00:40:02,031 --> 00:40:04,397
To tell the truth, that's not
the real problem.

379
00:40:08,938 --> 00:40:13,272
The real problem
is unemployment.

380
00:40:13,376 --> 00:40:14,343
You're right.

381
00:40:15,211 --> 00:40:17,111
Since our return to China,

382
00:40:17,213 --> 00:40:20,080
...many Taiwanese have lost
their jobs.

383
00:40:20,984 --> 00:40:23,646
Many of them were
intellectuals...

384
00:40:24,487 --> 00:40:27,945
...who weren't easily
pacified.

385
00:40:28,057 --> 00:40:29,581
With no work,

386
00:40:30,593 --> 00:40:33,756
...sooner or later
there's bound to be chaos.

387
00:40:33,863 --> 00:40:35,728
And not only the intellectuals.

388
00:40:35,832 --> 00:40:36,696
Soldiers too.

389
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:40,827
Yes, the soldiers conscripted by
Japan can't find work now.

390
00:40:42,839 --> 00:40:45,637
Someone from the mainland took over
the court...

391
00:40:45,875 --> 00:40:49,470
...throwing out the locals
and replacing them with...

392
00:40:49,879 --> 00:40:53,337
...his own wife, uncle and nephew.

393
00:40:53,450 --> 00:40:55,884
The court has been taken over
completely...

394
00:40:55,985 --> 00:40:57,509
...by his family.

395
00:40:58,054 --> 00:40:59,885
They follow his orders.

396
00:41:00,150 --> 00:41:01,550
The Japanese gave you...

397
00:41:01,790 --> 00:41:06,130
...a slave mentality.
You have to change.

398
00:41:06,730 --> 00:41:07,400
We don't even know
how to speak Mandarin.

399
00:41:07,433 --> 00:41:11,093
Slaves? Dammit.

400
00:41:11,201 --> 00:41:13,999
Have we sunk so low as
to want to become slaves again?

401
00:41:14,270 --> 00:41:16,602
The Ching Dynasty sold us out.

402
00:41:16,739 --> 00:41:21,176
Who asked us if we wanted
to be ceded to Japan?

403
00:41:22,612 --> 00:41:24,136
Drink up.

404
00:41:27,150 --> 00:41:28,447
If the Nationalist Government...

405
00:41:29,252 --> 00:41:31,812
...doesn't change its ways,

406
00:41:32,489 --> 00:41:34,218
...even though we have won the war,

407
00:41:34,591 --> 00:41:37,321
...our suffering will continue.

408
00:41:38,428 --> 00:41:41,226
How long before we can lift up our
heads with pride?

409
00:41:41,364 --> 00:41:42,092
Who knows?

410
00:41:42,198 --> 00:41:43,062
We mustn't give up hope.

411
00:41:43,199 --> 00:41:45,292
That would be a waste.

412
00:41:45,502 --> 00:41:48,630
If we want a future,

413
00:41:49,072 --> 00:41:53,202
...the suffering masses
have to resist.

414
00:41:53,877 --> 00:41:57,278
If the Nationalists carry on letting
Chen Yi do what he wants,

415
00:41:57,814 --> 00:42:00,146
...there'll be problems in Taiwan.

416
00:42:00,550 --> 00:42:01,517
Lao He.

417
00:42:02,318 --> 00:42:03,717
There certainly will, as soon as...

418
00:42:03,820 --> 00:42:08,348
...Mr Ho makes ready his pen
to tell the tale.

419
00:42:10,350 --> 00:42:12,600
You are our witness
from the mainland.

420
00:43:04,801 --> 00:43:09,801
It's a folksong called Lorelei,
based on a German legend.

421
00:43:27,802 --> 00:43:32,802
It's about a beautiful siren
seated on a rock in the Rhine.

422
00:43:32,803 --> 00:43:36,803
Sailors are so enchnated by
her singing,

423
00:43:36,804 --> 00:43:40,804
...that they crash their boats into
the rock and die.

424
00:44:05,105 --> 00:44:07,805
I first heard it when I was eight.

425
00:44:07,806 --> 00:44:13,806
I remember the goats bleating and
the voice of an actress in the Opera.

426
00:44:13,806 --> 00:44:17,806
I used to mimic her.
My teacher said I'd become an actor.

427
00:44:50,806 --> 00:44:54,806
I fell from a tree, hurt my head
and caught a fever.

428
00:44:54,807 --> 00:44:58,807
I couldn't walk and didn't
know I was deaf...

429
00:44:58,808 --> 00:45:02,808
...until my father wrote me.

430
00:45:02,808 --> 00:45:06,808
I was too young to
be upset by it.

431
00:48:05,615 --> 00:48:07,048
What's the matter?

432
00:48:07,717 --> 00:48:08,843
He has a fever.

433
00:48:09,552 --> 00:48:11,213
Daddy loves you.

434
00:48:11,888 --> 00:48:13,185
Wait for me downstairs.

435
00:48:16,492 --> 00:48:17,925
Give him something for it.

436
00:48:52,261 --> 00:48:53,125
And?

437
00:48:53,362 --> 00:48:54,522
Here it is.

438
00:48:56,260 --> 00:48:57,000
Hello, Wen-heung.

439
00:48:58,960 --> 00:48:59,940
Give.

440
00:49:00,870 --> 00:49:01,802
Give it me!

441
00:49:12,648 --> 00:49:13,706
What's this?

442
00:49:14,250 --> 00:49:15,308
What is it?

443
00:49:15,952 --> 00:49:17,351
How they fuck you!

444
00:49:20,423 --> 00:49:22,050
Tell your boss to come!

445
00:49:24,894 --> 00:49:26,555
How they fuck you! Put it out.
Why are you smoking?

446
00:49:26,829 --> 00:49:28,023
Put it out.

447
00:49:29,298 --> 00:49:32,358
Are you blind? Can't you read!

448
00:49:33,202 --> 00:49:34,362
Shit!

449
00:49:37,006 --> 00:49:38,803
You want to die young.

450
00:49:39,175 --> 00:49:40,938
How could you do that?

451
00:49:42,445 --> 00:49:43,377
What do you think you're doing?

452
00:49:45,114 --> 00:49:47,912
Bring your boss here!

453
00:49:48,017 --> 00:49:49,314
Go and find your boss.

454
00:49:54,256 --> 00:49:57,817
Don't I give you enough money
for your expenses?

455
00:49:57,927 --> 00:49:59,690
If this gets out,

456
00:49:59,795 --> 00:50:01,763
...a lot of people could be hurt.

457
00:50:02,064 --> 00:50:04,396
And I could die!

458
00:50:05,067 --> 00:50:06,932
I'll take responsibility.

459
00:50:07,103 --> 00:50:08,968
You'll take responsibility?

460
00:50:09,672 --> 00:50:11,003
How can you do that?

461
00:50:11,707 --> 00:50:15,165
It says here that Lin Wen-heung
is in charge of the goods.

462
00:50:17,546 --> 00:50:20,879
You can't take responsibility.
Don't make me sick.

463
00:50:21,917 --> 00:50:24,442
And you dress like those types
from Shanghai.

464
00:50:25,254 --> 00:50:26,881
The latest fashion!

465
00:50:27,356 --> 00:50:28,789
Layabout!

466
00:50:34,196 --> 00:50:35,356
Where's Wen-leung?

467
00:50:36,799 --> 00:50:37,891
I don't know.

468
00:50:38,467 --> 00:50:39,900
You're together all day...

469
00:50:40,069 --> 00:50:43,004
...and you say you don't know?

470
00:50:45,708 --> 00:50:47,073
Speak up.

471
00:50:49,412 --> 00:50:51,243
I really don't know.

472
00:51:00,222 --> 00:51:03,589
Go and call Mr Ko.

473
00:51:12,168 --> 00:51:15,365
Give me Taipei 24.

474
00:52:42,227 --> 00:52:43,194
Wen-leung.

475
00:52:44,763 --> 00:52:47,630
Your brother found out about
the last shipment.

476
00:52:47,933 --> 00:52:50,902
How could he know?

477
00:52:51,103 --> 00:52:52,400
You ask him.

478
00:52:53,072 --> 00:52:56,269
The shipment has been seized.

479
00:53:01,046 --> 00:53:02,138
Where is Ah-ga?

480
00:53:02,781 --> 00:53:04,408
Still at the warehouse.

481
00:53:33,879 --> 00:53:35,813
Does my brother know
I'm involved?

482
00:53:36,415 --> 00:53:39,384
I don't know. Ask Ah-ga.

483
00:53:46,050 --> 00:53:47,200
Wen-leung,

484
00:53:47,826 --> 00:53:50,886
...now that your brother knows about it,

485
00:53:51,663 --> 00:53:54,154
...we have to go and speak to him.

486
00:54:03,776 --> 00:54:05,334
I must speak to Ag-ha first.

487
00:54:13,118 --> 00:54:14,915
What do we do now, boss?

488
00:54:15,387 --> 00:54:18,185
Let's wait for Wen-leung
to get things organized.

489
00:54:29,768 --> 00:54:31,167
Do you want to wash your hands?

490
00:54:32,004 --> 00:54:32,971
Please.

491
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:55,550
Excuse me.

492
00:54:56,094 --> 00:54:57,686
Thanks.

493
00:55:30,529 --> 00:55:31,723
What are you doing here?

494
00:55:33,632 --> 00:55:34,724
Aren't you Ah-tsun?

495
00:55:36,935 --> 00:55:38,732
No, you're mistaken.

496
00:55:39,304 --> 00:55:41,499
Wen-leung, what's going on?

497
00:55:51,850 --> 00:55:54,580
We've met before, in Chiu-fen.

498
00:55:57,589 --> 00:56:01,491
Leave me alone. I told you
I'm not Ah-tsun.

499
00:56:02,828 --> 00:56:03,954
Her name is Ah-man.

500
00:56:04,696 --> 00:56:05,628
Leave us.

501
00:56:13,672 --> 00:56:17,472
Do you have Red Monkey's money?

502
00:56:17,943 --> 00:56:20,969
What are you saying?
Fool!

503
00:56:21,079 --> 00:56:22,307
What's this?

504
00:56:24,149 --> 00:56:27,448
Kim-tsua, it's none of your business.

505
00:56:27,553 --> 00:56:30,852
Not my business, eh?

506
00:56:31,123 --> 00:56:32,556
Leave us.

507
00:56:59,217 --> 00:57:01,981
Ah-ga, tell Wen-leung
to come here.

508
00:57:53,739 --> 00:57:56,230
Ungrateful boy!

509
00:57:58,810 --> 00:58:00,937
You came back from overseas.

510
00:58:02,347 --> 00:58:04,042
We gave you the chance
to reform.

511
00:58:04,950 --> 00:58:06,645
But did you change? No.

512
00:58:07,452 --> 00:58:10,100
You are a lowlife,

513
00:58:11,080 --> 00:58:12,460
...and your friends are lowlifes.

514
00:58:12,491 --> 00:58:15,790
Ah-shue, bring water.

515
00:58:16,161 --> 00:58:19,995
There's blood on you and in the room.
How do you think that'll be taken?

516
00:58:23,969 --> 00:58:25,459
I know.

517
00:58:27,205 --> 00:58:29,070
Look at your father!

518
00:58:31,143 --> 00:58:33,077
Did I ever annoy people...

519
00:58:33,879 --> 00:58:35,710
...in this district? No.

520
00:58:35,814 --> 00:58:37,907
Only the Japanese government.

521
00:58:39,351 --> 00:58:41,182
They called me a gangster.

522
00:58:43,789 --> 00:58:45,654
Me a gangster?

523
00:58:46,625 --> 00:58:49,788
The Japanese government
certainly hated me.

524
00:58:50,495 --> 00:58:53,555
But it was only to help
the district.

525
00:58:54,533 --> 00:58:57,696
I turned big problems
into small ones,

526
00:58:58,103 --> 00:59:01,436
...and got rid of small ones.

527
00:59:01,640 --> 00:59:03,631
I never stole anything from anyone,

528
00:59:04,676 --> 00:59:07,907
...and that's why the local gangs
supported me.

529
00:59:09,650 --> 00:59:14,308
But you do nothing honestly.

530
00:59:16,620 --> 00:59:17,900
It's always something dishonest.

531
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:21,170
Look at your daughter-in-law.

532
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:25,500
And at your brother.

533
00:59:26,300 --> 00:59:27,650
And you, Wen-leung.

534
00:59:28,900 --> 00:59:29,700
Have you fulfilled
your obligations?

535
00:59:32,237 --> 00:59:35,866
Everything was clear at the beginning.

536
00:59:36,141 --> 00:59:38,109
Who'd have known they'd done this.

537
00:59:38,510 --> 00:59:40,239
Didn't you speak to them about it?

538
00:59:40,345 --> 00:59:41,607
Of course.

539
00:59:43,281 --> 00:59:45,909
Let's gather everyone together
and clarify the issues.

540
00:59:47,100 --> 00:59:48,200
Ah-chuan,

541
00:59:49,755 --> 00:59:52,315
...go tell your boss
I want to see him.

542
00:59:53,125 --> 00:59:56,583
This is disagreeable!

543
00:59:58,797 --> 01:00:02,563
Ah-ga, where are those fellows
from Shanghai?

544
01:00:02,968 --> 01:00:03,992
I haven't seen them.

545
01:00:05,070 --> 01:00:06,196
Damn it!

546
01:00:11,610 --> 01:00:13,339
It's Wen-leung again.

547
01:00:14,212 --> 01:00:16,180
As if we didn't have
enough problems.

548
01:00:17,082 --> 01:00:19,277
I don't know what to say.

549
01:00:39,504 --> 01:00:40,471
Leave me here.

550
01:00:46,211 --> 01:00:48,202
How are you?

551
01:00:49,681 --> 01:00:50,648
Where is your boss?

552
01:00:51,883 --> 01:00:53,043
He went out.

553
01:02:06,391 --> 01:02:07,517
Mrs Ah-Kio.

554
01:02:08,140 --> 01:02:09,900
Take a seat please.

555
01:02:15,867 --> 01:02:19,359
You honour me by coming
to see me.

556
01:02:19,471 --> 01:02:21,905
It gives me hope.

557
01:02:22,841 --> 01:02:25,036
There's nothing that
can't be repaired.

558
01:02:25,744 --> 01:02:29,236
Everyone knows what
times we live in.

559
01:02:30,181 --> 01:02:33,480
You all grew up together.

560
01:02:34,219 --> 01:02:38,121
You shouldn't be
at odds over this.

561
01:02:43,728 --> 01:02:47,027
Our Kim-tsua began this,
so he's at fault.

562
01:02:48,133 --> 01:02:49,828
But the whole incident...

563
01:02:50,468 --> 01:02:54,427
...began with the return of Red Monkey's
Japanese money in Chiu-fen.

564
01:02:57,676 --> 01:02:59,337
Kim-tsua says...

565
01:02:59,811 --> 01:03:03,372
...that Red Monkey was planning to cheat him,

566
01:03:04,382 --> 01:03:06,646
...and so he went to see him.

567
01:03:06,818 --> 01:03:08,752
Red Monkey didn't want
to return the money.

568
01:03:09,387 --> 01:03:10,877
That's how it all began.

569
01:03:11,890 --> 01:03:14,222
Kim-tsua had a woman he liked there.

570
01:03:15,160 --> 01:03:17,253
Maybe Kim-tsua was
in the wrong, but...

571
01:03:17,329 --> 01:03:19,991
...he would never lie to me.

572
01:03:22,834 --> 01:03:26,133
Red Monkey is dead,

573
01:03:26,504 --> 01:03:29,337
...and so can't give his
version of the story.

574
01:03:30,241 --> 01:03:33,870
This fighting and squabbling
must end!

575
01:03:34,012 --> 01:03:36,344
Have some tea.

576
01:03:44,689 --> 01:03:46,919
This entire conversation
makes no sense.

577
01:03:47,425 --> 01:03:51,828
The most important thing is to
take care of the money.

578
01:03:52,263 --> 01:03:55,596
I think it must be
split three ways.

579
01:03:55,867 --> 01:03:57,334
One part for your brother,

580
01:03:57,435 --> 01:03:58,925
...one for Kim-tsua...

581
01:03:59,637 --> 01:04:03,368
...and one for Red Monkey's
old mother.

582
01:05:22,887 --> 01:05:24,752
Yesterday I went to Wen-ching's house,

583
01:05:25,290 --> 01:05:28,487
...and so I didn't write in my diary.

584
01:05:29,461 --> 01:05:32,658
Wen-sun's wife
told me things...

585
01:05:33,164 --> 01:05:35,689
...about Wen-ching's childhood.

586
01:05:36,501 --> 01:05:38,264
Of the brothers, Wen-sun
studied the most,

587
01:05:38,903 --> 01:05:42,805
...but Wen-ching was
the most intelligent.

588
01:05:43,541 --> 01:05:47,739
He said his physical problems were due
to the gods being jealous.

589
01:05:48,913 --> 01:05:50,938
Wen-sun disappeared...

590
01:05:51,049 --> 01:05:52,676
...in the Philippines.

591
01:05:53,451 --> 01:05:56,579
His family don't think he'll return,

592
01:05:56,855 --> 01:05:58,083
...but his wife cleans...

593
01:05:58,423 --> 01:06:01,790
...his clinic every day.

594
01:06:02,193 --> 01:06:04,354
Every day she disinfects...

595
01:06:04,762 --> 01:06:07,128
...the needles and syringes.

596
01:06:08,066 --> 01:06:12,127
She thinks he's still alive...

597
01:06:12,570 --> 01:06:14,265
...and that he'll come home one day.

598
01:06:15,440 --> 01:06:18,932
Then everything will
be as it was.

599
01:06:19,477 --> 01:06:21,377
He'll look after his patients,

600
01:06:21,546 --> 01:06:24,140
...write prescriptions, do injections,

601
01:06:24,549 --> 01:06:27,416
...listen to music...
to Beethoven.

602
01:07:50,068 --> 01:07:50,727
Brother.

603
01:07:51,202 --> 01:07:51,964
Who's down below?

604
01:07:52,070 --> 01:07:54,971
Soldiers from the mainland.
Get away.

605
01:07:55,073 --> 01:07:57,200
What do they want with me?

606
01:07:57,308 --> 01:07:59,572
Hurry up and get out.

607
01:07:59,978 --> 01:08:00,740
What's going on?

608
01:08:00,845 --> 01:08:03,609
They have come for Wen-heung.

609
01:08:03,948 --> 01:08:05,006
They have come for us.

610
01:08:05,216 --> 01:08:06,342
Go back to bed!

611
01:08:23,268 --> 01:08:25,259
This is breaking and entering.

612
01:08:25,370 --> 01:08:25,995
Search for him.

613
01:08:26,104 --> 01:08:31,269
They told us your son
was a collaborator.

614
01:08:31,409 --> 01:08:32,899
My son, a collaborator?

615
01:08:33,544 --> 01:08:34,909
Somebody denounced him.

616
01:08:35,013 --> 01:08:37,481
And that makes him a traitor?

617
01:08:37,582 --> 01:08:39,982
We have to take him in for interrogation
to find out the truth.

618
01:08:45,989 --> 01:08:47,224
Do you eat fish all day?

619
01:08:47,325 --> 01:08:49,259
What kind of mayor are you?

620
01:08:49,560 --> 01:08:51,528
It's not easy for us.

621
01:08:51,729 --> 01:08:53,594
Then you'll never find out
the truth.

622
01:08:53,698 --> 01:08:55,529
Someone denounced him.

623
01:08:55,700 --> 01:08:57,668
If that makes you a collaborator,

624
01:08:57,769 --> 01:08:59,566
...then I'm a gangster.

625
01:09:00,371 --> 01:09:04,671
I went in and out of prison
during the Japanese occupation.

626
01:09:05,076 --> 01:09:06,338
You have to find out the truth.

627
01:09:06,444 --> 01:09:07,877
How does that make him
a traitor?

628
01:09:07,979 --> 01:09:09,503
We'll investigate.

629
01:09:09,614 --> 01:09:11,343
Investigate? What does that mean?

630
01:09:18,356 --> 01:09:22,952
If he's a traitor,
then we all are!

631
01:09:23,194 --> 01:09:25,094
We'll make a full
investigation.

632
01:09:25,763 --> 01:09:28,755
My son and I are gangsters,

633
01:09:28,866 --> 01:09:30,527
...I admit it.

634
01:09:30,635 --> 01:09:33,433
But only for the good of
the entire district.

635
01:09:34,072 --> 01:09:37,132
So as not to be intimidated
by the Japanese.

636
01:09:37,241 --> 01:09:38,538
If that's being a collaborator,

637
01:09:38,643 --> 01:09:41,168
...then you are one too.

638
01:09:41,412 --> 01:09:43,607
Officer, the man who denounced him
is the collaborator.

639
01:09:46,050 --> 01:09:48,951
You can't arrest everyone
who is denounced.

640
01:09:49,120 --> 01:09:50,781
Who are you kidding?

641
01:09:52,924 --> 01:09:54,255
Wen-leung!

642
01:10:43,241 --> 01:10:44,469
"Dear uncle:

643
01:10:44,909 --> 01:10:48,401
...yesterday soldiers arrested
Wen-leung.

644
01:10:49,680 --> 01:10:52,513
They also went to the office
to arrest father...

645
01:10:53,284 --> 01:10:57,618
...but he escaped,
and only injured a leg.

646
01:10:58,990 --> 01:11:00,480
They say someone denounced
Wen-leung...

647
01:11:00,591 --> 01:11:04,755
...and said he was
a collaborator.

648
01:11:05,730 --> 01:11:07,664
They say he helped the Japanese...

649
01:11:07,765 --> 01:11:11,360
...capture many people in Shanghai.

650
01:11:12,837 --> 01:11:16,933
Even if were true, they must
have forced him to do it.

651
01:11:22,146 --> 01:11:24,671
Mother says you have friends
in Taipei.

652
01:11:25,082 --> 01:11:29,746
Do you know anyone who might be able
to secure his freedom?

653
01:11:30,421 --> 01:11:32,184
We have money.

654
01:11:33,024 --> 01:11:35,618
Please help us and get in touch
with us as soon as possible.

655
01:11:37,295 --> 01:11:38,227
Ah-shue".

656
01:11:44,168 --> 01:11:45,100
I know.

657
01:11:47,071 --> 01:11:49,062
Are you looking for Mr Chen,
the town councillor?

658
01:11:50,741 --> 01:11:53,938
It doesn't matter. We need your help.

659
01:11:54,445 --> 01:11:55,776
Why does it have to be like this?

660
01:11:59,250 --> 01:12:01,878
It's OK. If that's how you think,
forget it.

661
01:12:05,957 --> 01:12:07,049
I'll prepare it.

662
01:12:12,129 --> 01:12:13,494
I know. Someone will deliver it.

663
01:12:14,165 --> 01:12:15,097
Mum.

664
01:12:15,233 --> 01:12:16,530
We have guests.

665
01:12:16,634 --> 01:12:17,692
I'm coming.

666
01:12:24,141 --> 01:12:25,438
They'll free him?

667
01:12:26,177 --> 01:12:27,166
They'll free Wen-leung?

668
01:12:27,278 --> 01:12:30,543
Not yet, but I think it will turn out well.

669
01:12:31,082 --> 01:12:33,516
Why haven't they released him?

670
01:12:35,353 --> 01:12:39,949
Friends in Taipei have made
enquiries. Nanking says...

671
01:12:40,191 --> 01:12:43,683
...that charges against Taiwanese
of collaboration will be withdrawn.

672
01:12:43,794 --> 01:12:45,455
So I don't think there'll
be any problems.

673
01:12:45,897 --> 01:12:48,730
But first they have to
announce...

674
01:12:48,833 --> 01:12:51,529
...the new regulations.

675
01:12:51,636 --> 01:12:52,864
You must help us!

676
01:12:52,970 --> 01:12:55,632
Calm down.

677
01:12:58,409 --> 01:13:02,072
Maybe friends in Taipei will be able...

678
01:13:02,179 --> 01:13:05,148
...to obtain his release earlier.

679
01:13:05,283 --> 01:13:09,049
Please, call your brother.

680
01:13:09,287 --> 01:13:10,780
ÉHe'll know what to do.

681
01:13:10,820 --> 01:13:11,900
Right.

682
01:13:24,735 --> 01:13:28,102
Get me Taipei 24.

683
01:13:38,749 --> 01:13:40,307
Please, do all you can.

684
01:13:45,156 --> 01:13:46,589
Thanks, thanks.

685
01:13:58,135 --> 01:13:59,261
And?

686
01:14:01,772 --> 01:14:04,798
They say the law on collaboration
is going to be changed.

687
01:14:05,409 --> 01:14:06,774
Damn.

688
01:14:07,645 --> 01:14:10,808
They make laws, and they change laws.

689
01:14:11,282 --> 01:14:12,977
This island is in a bad way.

690
01:14:13,150 --> 01:14:15,516
First the Japanese,
then the Chinese.

691
01:14:15,953 --> 01:14:18,922
They all exploit us and
no one gives a damn.

692
01:14:58,423 --> 01:15:00,423
- What's going on?
- It's urgent.

693
01:15:00,924 --> 01:15:02,424
OK, we'll talk later.

694
01:15:27,610 --> 01:15:28,500
Brother.

695
01:15:33,798 --> 01:15:34,924
Sit down.

696
01:15:40,404 --> 01:15:41,496
Sit down, please.

697
01:15:57,888 --> 01:15:59,048
I am sorry to trouble you...

698
01:16:00,391 --> 01:16:02,484
...while you are enjoying yourselves.

699
01:16:03,994 --> 01:16:07,395
My brother has been arrested
and imprisoned.

700
01:16:08,566 --> 01:16:11,660
You know people
in power.

701
01:16:12,269 --> 01:16:13,634
I need your help.

702
01:16:15,573 --> 01:16:17,939
Can you arrange for him to be
set free for New Year?

703
01:16:19,243 --> 01:16:22,178
Wen-heung is sorry to bother you,

704
01:16:22,413 --> 01:16:24,677
...but his brother has been arrested.

705
01:16:24,782 --> 01:16:28,616
He'd like your help so he
can be released for New Year.

706
01:16:30,721 --> 01:16:33,246
They want Wen-leung...

707
01:16:33,357 --> 01:16:36,121
...to be released before New Year.

708
01:16:38,429 --> 01:16:40,989
When did they arrest him?
I knew nothing of this.

709
01:16:43,801 --> 01:16:45,063
I didn't know either.

710
01:16:46,237 --> 01:16:49,297
They didn't know Wen-leung
had been arrested.

711
01:16:49,406 --> 01:16:51,397
How can we help?

712
01:16:53,310 --> 01:16:56,006
Hippocrites! It's all your fault!

713
01:16:56,113 --> 01:16:57,705
Shut up!

714
01:16:59,216 --> 01:17:00,706
Idiot!

715
01:17:00,885 --> 01:17:02,477
Can't you keep
your mouth shut?

716
01:17:15,099 --> 01:17:16,191
Tell them...

717
01:17:17,802 --> 01:17:19,360
...that I know what to do.

718
01:17:21,906 --> 01:17:23,396
It's all fixed.

719
01:17:23,974 --> 01:17:26,568
He says he knows
the rules.

720
01:17:26,844 --> 01:17:28,072
It's all there.

721
01:18:13,140 --> 01:18:14,100
He's back!

722
01:18:15,560 --> 01:18:16,600
He's back!

723
01:18:19,430 --> 01:18:20,362
Put him down here.

724
01:18:25,870 --> 01:18:26,859
Wen-leung!

725
01:18:27,104 --> 01:18:28,332
Bring medicines,

726
01:18:29,039 --> 01:18:30,165
...a container and a spoon!

727
01:18:30,374 --> 01:18:31,466
Wen-leung,

728
01:18:31,809 --> 01:18:33,902
...how could they have beat you like that?

729
01:18:38,315 --> 01:18:40,283
Hurry, fetch a doctor!

730
01:18:43,554 --> 01:18:45,249
Calm down.

731
01:18:45,422 --> 01:18:47,549
Crying won't help.

732
01:18:49,593 --> 01:18:50,685
Calm down.

733
01:18:52,630 --> 01:18:54,063
Bring water.

734
01:18:55,900 --> 01:18:57,197
Am I talking to the clinic?

735
01:18:57,935 --> 01:19:03,066
Is the doctor there?
Please, hurry up.

736
01:19:03,173 --> 01:19:04,606
Open your mouth.

737
01:19:18,923 --> 01:19:20,618
Why is there so much blood?

738
01:19:21,525 --> 01:19:22,924
He was OK in the car.

739
01:19:23,027 --> 01:19:25,928
The vibrations must have made
him lose blood.

740
01:19:26,163 --> 01:19:27,460
Damn.

741
01:19:29,300 --> 01:19:30,665
Did you call?

742
01:19:30,768 --> 01:19:31,496
Yes.

743
01:19:31,702 --> 01:19:33,135
I'll call again.

744
01:19:33,904 --> 01:19:34,928
Open your mouth.

745
01:19:37,942 --> 01:19:40,035
Get me the Hui-an Clinic.

746
01:19:41,845 --> 01:19:43,373
Tell him it's urgent!

747
01:19:43,373 --> 01:19:43,472
Tell him it's urgent!
OK!

748
01:19:43,472 --> 01:19:44,673
OK!

749
01:19:44,774 --> 01:19:46,674
Is that the clinic?

750
01:19:47,175 --> 01:19:48,275
I'm calling from "Little Shanghai".

751
01:19:48,476 --> 01:19:49,476
Is the doctor on his way?

752
01:22:59,209 --> 01:23:01,177
I don't know why,

753
01:23:02,546 --> 01:23:04,480
...but I have had a lot of
bad dreams lately.

754
01:23:05,749 --> 01:23:06,807
They were about dad...

755
01:23:06,917 --> 01:23:10,978
...tying me to a telegraph
pole when I was a boy.

756
01:23:18,695 --> 01:23:19,719
Did you boil the water?

757
01:23:21,832 --> 01:23:22,799
Yes.

758
01:23:31,542 --> 01:23:33,373
I remember.

759
01:23:34,578 --> 01:23:36,205
It was just before New Year.

760
01:23:37,481 --> 01:23:41,076
When my father was young,
he loved gambling.

761
01:23:42,986 --> 01:23:45,216
We had no money and mum...

762
01:23:45,322 --> 01:23:48,120
...took out a gold necklace...

763
01:23:48,592 --> 01:23:50,321
...and asked dad
to pawn it.

764
01:23:52,129 --> 01:23:54,222
My mother was afraid that dad...

765
01:23:55,866 --> 01:23:59,825
...would gamble away the money
and sent me with him.

766
01:24:00,571 --> 01:24:05,508
As soon as my father had the
money in his hand,

767
01:24:05,609 --> 01:24:08,942
...he persuaded me to stand
next to a telegraph pole.

768
01:24:10,981 --> 01:24:14,712
He then tied me to it with his belt
and went off to bet.

769
01:24:16,053 --> 01:24:18,419
It was December and
very cold.

770
01:24:21,091 --> 01:24:23,025
No one went by.

771
01:24:25,062 --> 01:24:27,053
It was almost 9 before someone...

772
01:24:27,164 --> 01:24:29,792
...saw me and untied me.

773
01:24:30,300 --> 01:24:32,063
I almost died of the cold.

774
01:24:34,071 --> 01:24:37,700
After that, whenever
mum asked me...

775
01:24:37,808 --> 01:24:40,333
...to go with dad, I refused.

776
01:25:11,243 --> 01:25:12,676
Citizens of Taiwan:

777
01:25:13,645 --> 01:25:17,911
On the night of the 27th, during
an investigation in Taipei,

778
01:25:18,650 --> 01:25:22,017
...unfortunately
someone was killed.

779
01:25:22,654 --> 01:25:23,882
I have already take the matter...

780
01:25:24,222 --> 01:25:26,053
...in my own hands.

781
01:25:26,892 --> 01:25:30,157
The people who killed others
during this incident...

782
01:25:30,595 --> 01:25:34,053
...have already been brough to court
to be judged...

783
01:25:34,299 --> 01:25:36,358
....and punished.

784
01:25:37,202 --> 01:25:39,170
We have ordered medical attention...

785
01:25:39,738 --> 01:25:41,296
...for a woman with light wounds.

786
01:25:42,140 --> 01:25:44,267
I have asked for her to be treated

787
01:25:44,776 --> 01:25:46,700
And I have given her money
for the sake of her tranquility.

788
01:25:52,050 --> 01:25:55,417
We have to leave for Taipei.

789
01:26:00,125 --> 01:26:04,061
Today, the radio spoke of
riots in Taipei...

790
01:26:04,796 --> 01:26:07,128
...between Taiwanese
and mainlanders.

791
01:26:07,432 --> 01:26:09,366
Taiwan is under martial law.

792
01:26:11,703 --> 01:26:14,103
In the hospital we are
all scared.

793
01:26:14,806 --> 01:26:17,934
One war has just ended.

794
01:26:18,110 --> 01:26:20,601
Is another about to begin?

795
01:26:22,180 --> 01:26:23,909
My brother came to see me.

796
01:26:24,249 --> 01:26:26,581
He is going to Taipei with Wen-ching.

797
01:26:27,252 --> 01:26:28,219
But this time...

798
01:26:28,620 --> 01:26:30,520
...it's very dangerous to go there.

799
01:26:30,989 --> 01:26:33,514
They have urgent
business there.

800
01:26:34,326 --> 01:26:38,160
I'm very worried but
dare not say anything.

801
01:26:39,131 --> 01:26:41,292
Wen-ching with his disability...

802
01:26:41,633 --> 01:26:44,761
...you have to look after him, brother.

803
01:27:11,062 --> 01:27:11,858
Where?

804
01:27:45,931 --> 01:27:48,399
Death to the mainlanders!

805
01:27:54,639 --> 01:27:57,039
Halt, this is a hospital.

806
01:28:01,880 --> 01:28:03,780
Hurry, take him in.

807
01:28:16,194 --> 01:28:19,095
This is a hospital, you can't make
a disturbance.

808
01:28:19,197 --> 01:28:21,392
Get out of here.

809
01:28:26,004 --> 01:28:27,494
Citizens of Taiwan:

810
01:28:28,173 --> 01:28:30,767
Yesterday measures were announced...

811
01:28:31,209 --> 01:28:33,370
...to control disorder,

812
01:28:33,979 --> 01:28:37,847
...and I hope they were
heard and understood.

813
01:28:38,550 --> 01:28:41,348
Now, to restore...

814
01:28:41,520 --> 01:28:43,511
...calm and order quickly,

815
01:28:43,722 --> 01:28:45,917
...I am issuing more merciful measures.

816
01:28:46,758 --> 01:28:50,285
They are as follows:

817
01:28:50,929 --> 01:28:55,730
First, regarding those involved...

818
01:28:55,867 --> 01:29:00,429
...the government will not go ahead...

819
01:29:00,539 --> 01:29:02,700
...and punish them.

820
01:29:03,241 --> 01:29:06,438
Second, those arrested...

821
01:29:06,578 --> 01:29:09,411
...for taking part in the disorder,

822
01:29:09,581 --> 01:29:10,980
...will be set free.

823
01:29:11,383 --> 01:29:14,580
They'll be taken to police
headquarters...

824
01:29:14,686 --> 01:29:18,053
...where their families will be able to come by
and look for them.

825
01:29:18,156 --> 01:29:21,091
To make things simpler,

826
01:29:21,226 --> 01:29:23,456
...mayors will issue no guarantees.

827
01:29:24,229 --> 01:29:27,289
Third, the wounded
and the dead...

828
01:29:27,599 --> 01:29:30,295
...whatever their jobs,

829
01:29:30,402 --> 01:29:33,337
...whether Taiwanese or mainlanders,

830
01:29:33,572 --> 01:29:38,441
...will receive medical attention or
appropriate compensation.

831
01:29:38,777 --> 01:29:42,941
Fourth, a special committee...

832
01:29:43,081 --> 01:29:45,845
...will be set up.

833
01:29:46,184 --> 01:29:49,517
It will consist of
representatives of the government,

834
01:29:49,654 --> 01:29:52,680
...the judicial and
municipal authorities.

835
01:29:53,024 --> 01:29:56,357
It will also include
members of the public...

836
01:29:56,928 --> 01:30:01,831
...with the aim of reflecting
true public opinion.

837
01:30:12,310 --> 01:30:13,538
What are you doing here?

838
01:30:14,100 --> 01:30:15,250
And my brother?

839
01:30:46,400 --> 01:30:49,100
Doctor! Come quickly!

840
01:30:59,658 --> 01:31:01,125
Citizens of Taiwan:

841
01:31:02,093 --> 01:31:05,358
Yesterday saw the temporary
reintroduction of martial law.

842
01:31:06,264 --> 01:31:12,601
I want to assure all those of you
who love peace,

843
01:31:13,638 --> 01:31:15,538
...that this decree is...

844
01:31:16,307 --> 01:31:18,707
...for your protection.

845
01:31:19,844 --> 01:31:23,439
Take no notice of rumours
about spies,

846
01:31:23,882 --> 01:31:27,215
...because suspicion
leads to fear.

847
01:31:27,986 --> 01:31:29,749
I assure all
citizens...

848
01:31:30,155 --> 01:31:34,182
... who obey the law,
that nothing will happen to them.

849
01:31:36,061 --> 01:31:38,461
Meanwhile, I am announcing
the reintroduction of martial law.

850
01:31:39,030 --> 01:31:43,933
Our objective is merely to punish
rebels and traitors.

851
01:31:44,869 --> 01:31:46,632
For every day they are
at large,

852
01:31:47,205 --> 01:31:51,301
...peaceloving people will have
to put up with another day of disorder.

853
01:33:01,202 --> 01:33:04,402
Hinoe is safe.
She asked me to come first.

854
01:33:04,403 --> 01:33:07,403
Mr Lin, the teacher, is
in the special committeel.

855
01:33:07,404 --> 01:33:10,904
Many in Taipei died.
People are frightened.

856
01:33:27,572 --> 01:33:28,732
Dead?

857
01:34:04,509 --> 01:34:05,942
Where are you from?

858
01:34:08,546 --> 01:34:09,877
Where are you from?

859
01:34:11,783 --> 01:34:12,772
Where are you going?

860
01:34:19,123 --> 01:34:20,522
I am... Taiwanese.

861
01:34:22,640 --> 01:34:24,600
Are you from Japan?

862
01:34:28,135 --> 01:34:29,785
Are you from Japan?

863
01:34:32,837 --> 01:34:33,997
Must be a mainlander.

864
01:34:34,239 --> 01:34:35,171
What are you doing?

865
01:34:39,644 --> 01:34:40,804
He is deaf.

866
01:34:42,013 --> 01:34:44,641
He can't hear
what you are saying.

867
01:35:07,700 --> 01:35:09,250
Wen-ching.

868
01:35:12,480 --> 01:35:14,100
Wen-ching.

869
01:36:00,124 --> 01:36:01,614
What's the matter, brother?

870
01:36:10,668 --> 01:36:12,568
Is it fractured?

871
01:36:16,708 --> 01:36:18,335
I don't know.

872
01:36:50,742 --> 01:36:52,403
Lin has disappeared.

873
01:36:53,044 --> 01:36:55,604
They've arrested everyone
in the special committee.

874
01:36:58,149 --> 01:36:59,912
The troops of Chen Yi...

875
01:37:00,018 --> 01:37:01,986
...are killing and arresting people.

876
01:38:24,402 --> 01:38:26,962
Your son has come back, ma'am.

877
01:38:34,812 --> 01:38:37,076
You are back!
I was so worried.

878
01:38:37,448 --> 01:38:40,281
Soldiers and police
came here every day.

879
01:38:40,885 --> 01:38:43,285
They were right on the doorstep.

880
01:38:48,392 --> 01:38:50,087
What's wrong with your foot?

881
01:38:53,498 --> 01:38:55,022
Is it serious?

882
01:39:09,780 --> 01:39:13,443
What are you doing? It's good
that he's back!

883
01:39:14,785 --> 01:39:18,016
You can't stay here.
I'll hide you in Lai-Liao.

884
01:39:18,789 --> 01:39:19,687
Hinomi,

885
01:39:20,324 --> 01:39:22,315
...I forbid you to leave the house.

886
01:39:22,426 --> 01:39:24,621
I'll write to the hospital.

887
01:39:44,182 --> 01:39:49,085
On 19th March,
the director of the hospital,

888
01:39:49,220 --> 01:39:51,415
...took all my things.

889
01:39:52,523 --> 01:39:55,651
It was my father's idea.

890
01:39:59,597 --> 01:40:03,192
There was a letter from Ah-shue.

891
01:40:04,735 --> 01:40:06,794
Wen-ching has been arrested.

892
01:40:07,371 --> 01:40:09,396
They say it was for Mr Lin.

893
01:40:12,910 --> 01:40:14,775
Wen-ching's father went around
shouting:

894
01:40:15,413 --> 01:40:19,679
"They are even arresting the deaf. Where
is justice in this world?"

895
01:40:20,885 --> 01:40:22,819
Justice is not important to me.

896
01:40:23,254 --> 01:40:26,155
I only want to know...

897
01:40:27,158 --> 01:40:28,853
...where Wen-ching is.

898
01:40:29,460 --> 01:40:31,826
I only want to know...

899
01:40:32,363 --> 01:40:34,024
...if he's alive and well.

900
01:41:54,211 --> 01:41:57,044
Wu Chin-wen, Tai Tung-ho,
to court.

901
01:44:57,061 --> 01:44:58,995
Lin Wen-ching, to court!

902
01:47:34,485 --> 01:47:37,977
Uncle, it's supper time.

903
01:49:17,378 --> 01:49:26,178
Face the world
without shame.

904
01:49:26,179 --> 01:49:35,179
Your father is innocent.

905
01:49:46,480 --> 01:49:59,180
At this time
of difficulty...

906
01:50:00,381 --> 01:50:07,881
I am apart from my loved one...

907
01:51:05,262 --> 01:51:08,561
Uncle,you can't eat that.

908
01:51:08,665 --> 01:51:09,996
You mustn't!

909
01:51:22,946 --> 01:51:23,878
Wen-leung.

910
01:51:29,152 --> 01:51:30,141
Where is Wen-ching?

911
01:51:30,387 --> 01:51:33,584
He went out yesterday and hasn't come back.

912
01:51:34,024 --> 01:51:35,082
And your father?

913
01:51:35,259 --> 01:51:37,625
No idea. He went out this morning.

914
01:52:37,095 --> 01:52:39,893
Ah-shue, where are your parents?

915
01:52:40,899 --> 01:52:43,094
They left this morning.

916
01:52:44,536 --> 01:52:49,530
Dad usually comes home late, drunk.

917
01:52:49,741 --> 01:52:52,642
He staggers and vomits all over the house.

918
01:52:57,449 --> 01:52:59,076
When did your father's club close?

919
01:52:59,251 --> 01:53:00,479
In March.

920
01:53:00,585 --> 01:53:02,883
It was chaotic for a while.

921
01:53:03,250 --> 01:53:04,780
Many people died,

922
01:53:05,190 --> 01:53:07,090
...and the neighborhood was wrecked.

923
01:53:09,795 --> 01:53:13,492
Dad's friend, Mr Ko, was arrested.

924
01:53:13,598 --> 01:53:14,530
Ah-shue!

925
01:53:54,506 --> 01:53:56,736
Aunt Hinomi, uncle has returned.

926
01:54:00,212 --> 01:54:02,476
We waited a long time, but he knew...

927
01:54:02,814 --> 01:54:04,907
...which station exit to take.

928
01:54:28,306 --> 01:54:29,102
Ah-shue,

929
01:54:29,341 --> 01:54:30,774
...look for your brothers.

930
01:54:36,648 --> 01:54:38,081
Take your time and write.

931
01:54:43,555 --> 01:54:46,319
Uncle, you cannot eat that.

932
01:54:47,793 --> 01:54:49,454
It's food for the altar.

933
01:54:54,099 --> 01:54:55,293
You can't eat it.

934
01:55:17,394 --> 01:55:21,394
You are thinner.
Are you OK?

935
01:55:21,395 --> 01:55:25,395
My brother disappeared.
He was hiding in Lai-liao.

936
01:55:25,396 --> 01:55:30,396
One day soldiers came.
Since then, we have had no news.

937
01:57:57,675 --> 01:57:59,088
Wen-ching!

938
01:58:00,500 --> 01:58:01,488
Wen-ching!

939
01:58:29,748 --> 01:58:31,113
Here comes Mr Huang.

940
01:58:34,185 --> 01:58:38,121
Mr Huang, this is
my good friend Wen-ching.

941
01:58:42,961 --> 01:58:45,020
He was in prison with your brother...

942
01:58:45,130 --> 01:58:48,463
... before he was executed.

943
01:58:48,867 --> 01:58:51,028
He has come especially to see you.

944
01:58:53,175 --> 01:58:53,950
Sit down.

945
01:59:27,651 --> 01:59:30,651
"In life, far from the motherland.

946
01:59:30,652 --> 01:59:33,652
"In death, returning to the motherland.

947
01:59:33,653 --> 01:59:37,653
"Both life and death
are governed by destiny."

948
02:00:33,854 --> 02:00:36,654
Hinoe got married and
lives in the mountains.

949
02:00:36,655 --> 02:00:40,655
I can't tell you where.
She doesn't want her family to know.

950
02:00:40,656 --> 02:00:44,656
She said, "Consider me dead.
My life belongs to the motherland.

951
02:00:44,657 --> 02:00:48,657
"In prison, I swore to live, for the sake of
friends who had died."

952
02:01:55,658 --> 02:02:00,658
I cannot live like before.
I want to stay here.

953
02:02:00,659 --> 02:02:05,659
I know I can do whatever you ask me.

954
02:02:05,660 --> 02:02:08,860
This is no place for you.

955
02:02:26,061 --> 02:02:33,061
What's important are your beliefs,
not where you live or what you do.

956
02:02:33,062 --> 02:02:40,662
They suggested marriage to Hinomi,
but it's you she loves.

957
02:03:31,449 --> 02:03:34,145
Let me introduce my best friend,
Wen-ching.

958
02:05:36,774 --> 02:05:38,298
Are you going to reopen for business or not?

959
02:05:40,445 --> 02:05:41,434
Enough!

960
02:05:41,646 --> 02:05:43,307
Go and play outside

961
02:05:43,414 --> 02:05:45,575
Wen-leung, this is for the altar.

962
02:05:45,683 --> 02:05:48,379
Eat after the prayers.

963
02:05:50,021 --> 02:05:53,650
You decided to close.

964
02:05:53,758 --> 02:05:56,124
Now you won't say
when you'll reopen.

965
02:05:56,227 --> 02:05:57,489
Can't you make up your mind?

966
02:05:59,263 --> 02:06:00,195
Shut up!

967
02:06:00,531 --> 02:06:01,828
Don't argue with me!

968
02:06:07,271 --> 02:06:08,898
Don't drink from the teapot!

969
02:06:09,140 --> 02:06:10,630
You're setting a bad example to the children!

970
02:06:11,042 --> 02:06:13,237
You're too big for such things.

971
02:06:19,484 --> 02:06:20,815
Are you thirsty?

972
02:06:24,789 --> 02:06:27,952
Drink properly or not at all.
Don't be ridiculous.

973
02:06:34,832 --> 02:06:35,992
Look!

974
02:06:36,300 --> 02:06:39,269
You were gone for days,
God knows where!

975
02:06:39,637 --> 02:06:42,936
You either lock yourself in your room
or hide out where...

976
02:06:43,040 --> 02:06:44,530
...nobody can find you.

977
02:06:45,009 --> 02:06:49,173
I wanted you to visit mother's grave
with me. Where were you?

978
02:06:50,314 --> 02:06:52,179
That's why I have such bad luck!

979
02:06:53,017 --> 02:06:55,850
I am the only one of the four children...

980
02:06:55,953 --> 02:06:59,047
...who visits mum's grave.
She asks me why,

981
02:06:59,791 --> 02:07:02,919
...and I don't lack for words.
As for you,

982
02:07:03,327 --> 02:07:05,557
...how long do you think you can go
without working?

983
02:07:07,665 --> 02:07:12,762
I planned to open a photographic studio
on the side so you could run it.

984
02:07:13,504 --> 02:07:14,971
We discussed it enough.

985
02:07:15,640 --> 02:07:18,541
When will you give me an answer?

986
02:07:18,676 --> 02:07:21,201
How can he reply? He can't hear.

987
02:07:21,345 --> 02:07:22,903
Shut up!

988
02:07:23,381 --> 02:07:26,646
The only thing you know
is to tell people off.

989
02:07:28,753 --> 02:07:31,153
Ah-shue,you tell him.

990
02:07:36,894 --> 02:07:39,385
When a young woman visits us,

991
02:07:39,463 --> 02:07:41,863
...without thinking of her dignity,

992
02:07:41,966 --> 02:07:45,527
...it's obvious what's going on.
Don't you understand?

993
02:07:46,571 --> 02:07:48,835
What are you waiting for?

994
02:08:08,659 --> 02:08:11,355
What's all the row?
Stop singing!

995
02:08:19,800 --> 02:08:20,600
Damn it!

996
02:08:21,272 --> 02:08:22,500
Shut up!

997
02:08:23,741 --> 02:08:27,040
What's all this howling?

998
02:08:30,114 --> 02:08:33,641
You are like bad spirits.
What's all the noise?

999
02:08:34,285 --> 02:08:36,480
Why are you shouting?

1000
02:08:38,122 --> 02:08:42,058
Can't you talk normally?

1001
02:08:45,496 --> 02:08:46,656
What's going on?

1002
02:08:51,669 --> 02:08:55,867
It's useless. He seems incapable
of acting normally.

1003
02:08:58,075 --> 02:08:59,440
I'm sorry.

1004
02:09:00,411 --> 02:09:01,810
Please, carry on singing.

1005
02:09:04,081 --> 02:09:05,207
No, thank you.

1006
02:09:07,084 --> 02:09:08,847
Take no notice of him.

1007
02:09:08,953 --> 02:09:12,480
You sing very well.

1008
02:09:13,200 --> 02:09:14,800
Please, carry on.

1009
02:09:14,825 --> 02:09:16,292
He's as stubborn as a mule!

1010
02:09:16,394 --> 02:09:19,227
People like him
can't be taught anything.

1011
02:11:16,060 --> 02:11:16,860
Damn you!

1012
02:11:18,349 --> 02:11:21,216
How come you're not dead?

1013
02:11:21,986 --> 02:11:24,113
You really made Wen-leung
suffer.

1014
02:11:24,221 --> 02:11:25,688
Shame on you!

1015
02:11:30,928 --> 02:11:32,452
So?

1016
02:11:35,499 --> 02:11:36,329
What's up?

1017
02:11:36,434 --> 02:11:38,197
What's up?

1018
02:11:38,702 --> 02:11:41,728
You know what you did.

1019
02:11:42,273 --> 02:11:46,403
Shut up or you'll be sorry.

1020
02:11:46,510 --> 02:11:47,875
What will you do about it?

1021
02:11:49,413 --> 02:11:50,277
What?

1022
02:11:50,448 --> 02:11:51,642
Calm down.

1023
02:11:51,749 --> 02:11:52,977
You don't scare me.

1024
02:11:55,152 --> 02:11:56,346
Pig!

1025
02:11:56,454 --> 02:11:58,285
You'll come to a bad end
one of these days.

1026
02:13:08,359 --> 02:13:09,417
Older brother!
Older brother!

1027
02:13:12,963 --> 02:13:16,296
Ah-ga.

1028
02:13:17,434 --> 02:13:18,264
Call a doctor!

1029
02:13:18,369 --> 02:13:19,529
What happened?

1030
02:13:31,382 --> 02:13:33,577
Kim-tsua, take that knife.

1031
02:13:34,351 --> 02:13:35,579
Call a doctor.

1032
02:14:00,177 --> 02:14:01,109
Wen-heung!

1033
02:16:37,935 --> 02:16:39,197
Here comes the bride.

1034
02:16:41,972 --> 02:16:46,170
Let's ask our ancestors...

1035
02:16:55,219 --> 02:16:56,550
...for children and wealth.

1036
02:17:13,370 --> 02:17:14,701
Bow to the ancestors.

1037
02:17:28,786 --> 02:17:29,810
Kneel down.

1038
02:17:34,658 --> 02:17:35,750
Pray.

1039
02:17:37,761 --> 02:17:39,058
First reverence.

1040
02:17:42,433 --> 02:17:43,923
Two.

1041
02:17:46,103 --> 02:17:47,400
Three.

1042
02:17:50,007 --> 02:17:51,099
Pray.

1043
02:17:53,076 --> 02:17:54,407
Four.

1044
02:17:57,381 --> 02:17:58,541
Five.

1045
02:18:01,385 --> 02:18:02,613
Six.

1046
02:18:05,022 --> 02:18:06,216
Pray.

1047
02:18:07,958 --> 02:18:09,289
Seven.

1048
02:18:12,229 --> 02:18:13,526
Eight.

1049
02:18:16,066 --> 02:18:17,556
Nine.

1050
02:18:19,703 --> 02:18:21,170
Stand up.

1051
02:18:24,975 --> 02:18:26,704
Bow to each other.

1052
02:18:31,114 --> 02:18:32,376
Kneel.

1053
02:18:38,830 --> 02:18:41,190
Bride and groom, bow
to each other three times.

1054
02:18:41,250 --> 02:18:42,800
One.

1055
02:18:45,530 --> 02:18:46,930
Two.

1056
02:18:48,550 --> 02:18:49,950
Three.

1057
02:18:51,100 --> 02:18:52,500
Stand up.

1058
02:22:44,701 --> 02:22:46,066
It's late.

1059
02:22:46,470 --> 02:22:48,768
I heard the first thunder
of spring.

1060
02:22:49,172 --> 02:22:52,903
One clap after another,

1061
02:22:53,610 --> 02:22:57,046
...as if waking the hillsides
and the sea.

1062
02:23:00,584 --> 02:23:03,212
Someone came from the mountains.

1063
02:23:03,653 --> 02:23:06,053
He said my brother
needed money.

1064
02:23:06,289 --> 02:23:08,348
He needed it...

1065
02:23:08,458 --> 02:23:11,427
...to print pamphlets
to educate people.

1066
02:23:11,895 --> 02:23:15,797
The man said they didn't want
to be always asking...

1067
02:23:16,199 --> 02:23:19,726
...for help from Weng-ching.

1068
02:23:20,203 --> 02:23:22,171
But only when they come
to ask for money,

1069
02:23:22,506 --> 02:23:25,441
...do we know that they're safe
and that the struggle continues.

1070
02:23:25,842 --> 02:23:29,573
Only then are we satisfied.

1071
02:23:33,016 --> 02:23:34,847
Ah-chien can already make sounds.

1072
02:23:34,951 --> 02:23:37,385
Last night I thought
he was saying "mummy."

1073
02:23:38,188 --> 02:23:41,885
I was so happy.

1074
02:23:41,992 --> 02:23:44,256
I hurried to find Wen-ching...

1075
02:23:44,661 --> 02:23:46,390
...so he could hear too.

1076
02:23:46,596 --> 02:23:50,396
It was only when I saw him I realized
my stupidity. How could he hear?

1077
02:24:09,519 --> 02:24:11,214
Prices are rising.

1078
02:24:11,655 --> 02:24:14,749
The neighbours say
times will be hard.

1079
02:24:15,125 --> 02:24:16,990
Maybe I'm a fool.

1080
02:24:17,260 --> 02:24:21,424
But while I have Wen-ching
and Ah-chien...

1081
02:24:21,598 --> 02:24:24,362
...I think I'll be happy.

1082
02:28:03,486 --> 02:28:05,283
Don't run!

1083
02:28:09,726 --> 02:28:11,715
Still running! Shit!

1084
02:28:15,532 --> 02:28:16,658
Why are you shouting?

1085
02:28:31,748 --> 02:28:32,840
On your knees.

1086
02:28:36,186 --> 02:28:37,517
Heads down.

1087
02:28:44,627 --> 02:28:45,821
What are you looking at?

1088
02:31:48,044 --> 02:31:51,673
Ah-shue, your uncle Wen-ching
has been arrested.

1089
02:31:52,048 --> 02:31:55,609
We still don't know where he is.

1090
02:31:56,653 --> 02:31:58,644
At first we considered running away,

1091
02:31:58,988 --> 02:32:01,718
...but there was nowhere to go

1092
02:32:04,961 --> 02:32:07,054
I am writing this long after,

1093
02:32:07,263 --> 02:32:10,699
...because only now do I feel
calmer.

1094
02:32:12,035 --> 02:32:16,199
This photo was taken three days
before Wen-ching's arrest.

1095
02:32:17,373 --> 02:32:18,806
When they came for him,

1096
02:32:19,008 --> 02:32:21,340
...he was taking someone's portrait.

1097
02:32:21,844 --> 02:32:24,039
He insisted on finishing the job...

1098
02:32:24,447 --> 02:32:26,608
...before they took him away.

1099
02:32:29,919 --> 02:32:34,618
I searched and asked all over
Taipei but have no news.

1100
02:32:36,159 --> 02:32:38,127
Ah-chien has his first teeth.

1101
02:32:38,594 --> 02:32:40,255
He has a lovely smile...

1102
02:32:40,363 --> 02:32:42,263
and your uncle's eyes.

1103
02:32:43,366 --> 02:32:45,357
Please, come and see us soon.

1104
02:32:46,369 --> 02:32:48,132
It's fresh in Chiu-fen.

1105
02:32:48,604 --> 02:32:50,231
The autumn flowers
are in bloom.

1106
02:32:50,606 --> 02:32:53,473
The mountains are all white,
like snow.

1107
02:32:59,982 --> 02:33:01,006
It's time to eat.

1108
02:33:01,117 --> 02:33:02,846
OK. Just a moment.

1109
02:33:03,300 --> 02:33:04,350
Ah-chi,

1110
02:33:04,854 --> 02:33:06,287
...you shouldn't be watching
adults gambling.

1111
02:33:06,489 --> 02:33:07,683
Bring your uncle.

1112
02:33:08,324 --> 02:33:09,916
Uncle, it's time to eat.

1113
02:33:21,237 --> 02:33:22,261
Where is Uncle Wan?

1114
02:33:22,372 --> 02:33:24,272
He said he'd be back soon.

1115
02:33:24,374 --> 02:33:25,466
Wash your hands.

1116
02:33:59,567 --> 02:34:00,567
Help yourselves.

1117
02:35:43,468 --> 02:35:49,168
December 1949.
Mainland China is lost.

1118
02:35:49,169 --> 02:35:54,169
The Nationalist government
moves to Taiwan.

1119
02:35:54,170 --> 02:36:00,170
Taipei becomes
provisional capital.
