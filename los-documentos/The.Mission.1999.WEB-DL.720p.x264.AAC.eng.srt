1
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:41,917
My jacket

2
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,355
Boss, the car's here

3
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,957
Mind your head

4
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,070
Is the room ready?

5
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,036
Yes, it's ready

6
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:44,956
OK

7
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,070
The room is all paid for

8
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,955
You girl take good care of our VIP

9
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,676
Over here, sir

10
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:40,276
Roy, this is Captain Fung

11
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,793
Sit, and drinks?

12
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:44,830
Yesterday someone got his fingers

13
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,552
chopped off at the nearby public toilet

14
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,113
It's just one finger

15
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,312
One should always pay for his food

16
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,676
You're in charge, tell us who did it

17
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,114
Did I say I'm involved?

18
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,349
You want us to drop by everyday?

19
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,511
Good! I can take a vacation then

20
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,359
And you'll be doing my job for me

21
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,955
I'm sure this street will be completely
safe

22
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:17,352
Roy

23
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:20,989
Sit

24
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:23,830
He told you to sit

25
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,233
Tell them what happened

26
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,390
Hey, see what they want to drink

27
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,190
It's on me

28
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,035
This time it's free

29
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:45,272
Take your time

30
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:55,631
You have nothing to do with this

31
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,231
Don ' t move

32
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,191
Boss, I'll cover you, go

33
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,431
Frank, I'm at the Super Bowl restaurant

34
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,550
Someone wants to kill me

35
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,152
The word is out, someone's coming

36
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:57,157
Leave now

37
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:58,550
Got it

38
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,953
Dinner? Where's he at?

39
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,317
Tell him this is Frank

40
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:12,550
have him call me right away

41
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,233
Shit, why do things come up every time
I have a cold?

42
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:23,995
Boss... Are you all right?

43
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,629
I'm OK

44
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,632
Brother, everything all right?

45
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:35,077
You go back first

46
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:35,991
I already called Raymond

47
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:37,390
He'll take care of the cops

48
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,068
Tell Fay to take the boss back

49
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:45,271
What a lousy day, I was scared shitless

50
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,873
Go home and rest
OK

51
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:50,591
This way

52
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:53,076
Bring me a camera

53
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:55,637
Go get a camera

54
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,118
Shit

55
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:01,870
Did I really ask for a camera?

56
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:03,790
What are you standing here for?

57
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,308
Waiting to have your pictures taken?

58
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,550
Find me those killers

59
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,476
Yes, Frank

60
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:11,632
Talk

61
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:12,796
No

62
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:15,874
I don't know who did it

63
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,113
I'm no a traitor

64
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,398
Ko has been shot to death

65
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:25,750
You're saying you're not involved?

66
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,874
Why are you alive?

67
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:30,675
And not even a single wound?

68
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,269
I'm scared, Frank

69
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,836
I really didn't betray the boss, Frank

70
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:41,310
1O minutes

71
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,030
Believe me... Frank

72
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:48,713
Frank, don't kill me

73
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,793
If he's still alive after 1O minutes

74
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,353
it means he's innocent

75
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:10,957
Yes

76
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,275
If he can't make it, then too bad for him

77
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:13,991
Understood

78
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:14,836
Joe, get in

79
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,037
Spending millions on re-furnishing
is it worth it?

80
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,070
Where's your tie?

81
00:12:59,120 --> 00:12:59,950
My wife took it to the laundry

82
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,194
A servant never knows his manner

83
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:03,231
Frank

84
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:10,357
Sister in law

85
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:11,636
Frank

86
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:12,757
Going out?

87
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:14,315
Yes, I'm meeting a friend for lunch

88
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,554
I'm late, I have to go

89
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,429
Joe, have someone go with her

90
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:24,392
Brother

91
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:33,148
You're going to scare the neighbors

92
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,189
with all those men outside blocking the
road

93
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:35,916
They have a problem with that?

94
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:36,632
Frank

95
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:39,995
I'll have them replaced by other people

96
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:42,430
Go get Curtis

97
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:02,869
Damn

98
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,751
a haircut costs less than a hundred

99
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,470
But this creative director dyed a streak

100
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:09,795
of my hair blonde

101
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,195
and charged me a thousand dollars

102
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,316
Am I disturbing you?

103
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:13,917
No

104
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,110
What's the latest trend?

105
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,509
Maybe you can do my hair sometime

106
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:21,078
I saw this actress on TV who dyed her
hair blonde

107
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:24,154
It's yellow and glittery

108
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,679
looks just like shit

109
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,791
Have you heard what happened?

110
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:34,512
Yes

111
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:35,672
Huh?

112
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:36,550
I heard about it

113
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,478
I remember now

114
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,030
the paper says

115
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:44,318
she's a 36C

116
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,679
She's really hot

117
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:51,516
Tomorrow at 3

118
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:53,552
Come to the office

119
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,353
Please have a seat

120
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,395
Thanks
You're welcome

121
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:18,955
I'm Shin

122
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,635
I'm with Roy

123
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:39,073
Please wait inside

124
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:39,950
OK

125
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:40,830
Curtis

126
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:43,158
Sit

127
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,673
I'm Shin, I'm with Roy

128
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,231
How have you been?

129
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:52,756
Same old, same old

130
00:15:58,960 --> 00:15:59,870
Please wait inside

131
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:02,477
Roy

132
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,315
It's OK

133
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:29,393
Please have a seat

134
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,111
Thanks

135
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:44,917
Damn

136
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:46,993
why can't the foreigners learn Cantonese?

137
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,030
Anyone want to order out?

138
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:56,310
4O cents

139
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,395
Somehow it turned into a two million
dollar profit

140
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,029
Let's go, my brother's waiting

141
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,116
Mr. Lung

142
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,752
Thank you, Helen

143
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:19,270
Brother, they're all here

144
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:28,954
Mr. Lung

145
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:33,389
Curtis, long time no see, how are you?

146
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,908
Pretty good. Thank you

147
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:38,791
Mike

148
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:39,671
Mr. Lung, how are you?

149
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:40,392
Thanks

150
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:42,911
James
Mr. Lung

151
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:43,870
Thank you

152
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:51,354
Roy, Shin

153
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,271
they're very well respected

154
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,998
Thank you

155
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:56,829
Thank

156
00:17:59,040 --> 00:17:59,870
Everyone please be careful

157
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:16,350
Mr. Lung, please take a deep breath
Thanks

158
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,076
Mr. Lung, is it too tight?

159
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:28,877
It's OK

160
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:36,789
You guys are unbelievable

161
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:38,560
I only let for a few days

162
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:40,152
and someone already messed up my
place?

163
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:57,950
Rat?

164
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,549
I'm not scared of him

165
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:12,595
Back?

166
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:14,749
You want me to come back?

167
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,793
Just kill him

168
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,719
Add 2 pounds to the recoil spring

169
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,755
So they had more people

170
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,357
5 arrested and 2 wounded

171
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,037
No?

172
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,678
5 wounded and 2 arrested

173
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:28,592
What?

174
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:31,870
Damn it, you go eat shit

175
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:47,837
Mrs. Lung

176
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:49,512
Mrs. Lung

177
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:50,717
Going out?

178
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,513
No, I want some water

179
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:53,311
Let me help you

180
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:54,430
Thank you

181
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:55,430
Hot or cold water?

182
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,469
Hot water please

183
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,070
Thank you

184
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,036
I know you don't have one

185
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:14,636
You said you can find anything

186
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:17,789
and you can't find me a bullet-proof vest?

187
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:20,436
Call me

188
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,556
Hello... Mr. Chan

189
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:28,472
What?

190
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:29,789
You need a room

191
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:31,630
and 4 women?

192
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,196
I'm not in the business anymore

193
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:34,511
Bye

194
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:39,430
I hate addressing these losers as "mister"

195
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:42,034
Got cigarettes?

196
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,797
James, Shin get the cars ready
Mr. Lung is going out

197
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:46,437
Got it

198
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:11,076
What's up?

199
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,672
What? What's up?

200
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:16,515
Anything wrong?

201
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,591
We're born to see action, not to stand
here all day

202
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:25,996
If we have to stand, we might as well
become hookers

203
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:27,593
It's better than doing night-watch here

204
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:33,430
Go tell that to Frank

205
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,956
Anyway, I hope it'll be over soon

206
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:52,197
What's up?

207
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:55,669
What are you talking about?

208
00:23:58,280 --> 00:23:59,508
He wants me to have a talk with him?

209
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,790
Who does he think he is?

210
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,708
I'm one of the 5 bodyguards

211
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:12,554
It's a job that other kids can only
dream about

212
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,912
If I can make a name for myself this time

213
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,992
I can brag about it in the years to come

214
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,515
So how did you make a name
for yourself

215
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:37,757
Were you involved in all the big events?

216
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,399
Tell me, there's a lot I need to learn

217
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:19,992
Mr. Lung, are you all right?

218
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:22,592
Are you all right?

219
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:56,510
It's a rifle

220
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:58,989
Mike, see where the sniper is

221
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:26,077
He didn't fall for it

222
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:34,591
I'll go

223
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:52,592
Roy

224
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:53,878
Start the car

225
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:42,637
Mike

226
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:44,915
His gun's got a scope

227
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,679
You don't have the advantage from
this distance

228
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:47,791
I'll move up

229
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:11,312
Go Shin

230
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:32,396
Let him go

231
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:35,230
Roy

232
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:10,591
Get in your cars

233
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:18,076
Where ' s Roy?

234
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:19,396
Everyone get in

235
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:24,673
I don't know how to drive

236
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:41,157
Roy

237
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:41,872
Where ' s Curtis?

238
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:42,797
In the backyard

239
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:10,876
I don't care. Just find him for me

240
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:21,757
Roy

241
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:29,477
Stop it

242
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:37,115
Hey, are you crazy?
Put the guns away

243
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:39,076
Break it up

244
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:07,716
James, Mike

245
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:08,989
you guys will do the night-watch

246
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:49,236
Good morning, Mr. Lung

247
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:50,510
Good morning, Mr. Lung

248
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:51,997
Mr. Lung

249
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:53,390
Curtis went out

250
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:54,437
Are you going out?

251
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:55,470
I'm not going to the office today

252
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:56,951
Are you all right?

253
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,228
It still hurts a little

254
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:01,909
I'm getting old

255
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:11,076
Who want coffee?

256
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:18,790
Milk tea?

257
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:23,876
Ovaltine?

258
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:33,070
What?

259
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:34,671
Make yourself at home

260
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:46,558
If I was killed last night

261
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:48,749
It's just my bad luck

262
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,076
you guys are not responsible

263
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:56,149
For someone in my position

264
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,158
you have to be ready for a lot of things

265
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:05,795
Who doesn't take sugar?

266
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:45,311
Curtis

267
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:46,236
This way

268
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:55,877
Rat

269
00:34:58,680 --> 00:34:59,430
Who is this?

270
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:02,710
Curtis

271
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:05,796
What do you want?

272
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:15,272
Stay away from Roy's bar

273
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:16,352
Why?

274
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,031
Just leave it alone

275
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:18,956
Shit

276
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:37,350
That's my boss

277
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:35,789
Roy, what a coincidence

278
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:37,439
So you left your street to become
a driver?

279
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:39,594
About Rat's death, good for you

280
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:40,829
Someone did you a favor

281
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:43,191
Lately your street has been a lot more
quiet

282
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:45,436
I know you're busy
so I go to your bar everyday

283
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:46,834
It's like a daily routine

284
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:49,392
Rat is out of the picture now

285
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:50,914
And I'm not scared of cats or dogs

286
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:53,310
Visit your place sometime
I'll buy you a drink

287
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:55,790
Bye Roy

288
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:08,192
Shin, listen... listen to me

289
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:15,478
From now on you go pick up Mrs. Lung
lt'll be your job

290
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,435
Who did Curtis work for?

291
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:26,232
Mr. Lung

292
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:28,114
Why is his name Curtis? He looks funny

293
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:30,034
Don't judge him by his looks

294
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:32,311
He had a formidable reputation around
Tsim Sha Tsui

295
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:33,715
You mess with him and you're dead

296
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,718
You serious? Go ask around

297
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:37,750
People call him The Ice

298
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:42,831
Curtis Hey

299
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:49,828
Thanks

300
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:50,512
Roy

301
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:54,551
Thank you

302
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:56,077
Thank you

303
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:57,512
You're welcome

304
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:00,550
How did you kill him?

305
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:03,156
You did it alone?

306
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:06,916
It's none of your business

307
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:12,877
Thank you

308
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:21,829
What matter is that Mr. Lung is safe

309
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:24,516
Feeling better now?

310
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,233
Who wants to kill Mr. Lung?

311
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:31,749
Just focus on our job

312
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:39,073
How long do you think we have to do
this job?

313
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:43,236
How do I know?

314
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:46,996
You busy? If you are, then leave

315
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:50,194
I'm OK, I can do this for another 8 or
1O years

316
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:57,950
Is there another cigarette?

317
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:06,635
Mr. Lung, you've been in trouble lately

318
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:07,954
You're not around to call the shots

319
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:09,873
All the business came to a halt

320
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:11,148
how can we go on?

321
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:13,312
We can't let this continue

322
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:15,278
We need business

323
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:18,188
But we don't have anyone in charge now

324
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:20,078
And we don't know who's trying to kill
Mr. Lung

325
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,391
Mr. Lung, you're the boss

326
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:24,800
Mr. Lung, you should give us some
assurance

327
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,358
Something like this happens periodically

328
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,958
How will outsiders look at us?

329
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:29,269
How will our men look at us?

330
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:33,474
Frank is looking into it

331
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:36,749
Everyone knows I'm the boss

332
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:39,356
If you have any good ideas

333
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:40,395
then tell me

334
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:42,951
You're the boss, it's your call.

335
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:47,874
Mr. Lung, we'll go first

336
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:56,155
Super Bowl...

337
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:59,709
is not doing well

338
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:03,478
I want to take back my shares for
another use

339
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:04,391
Uncle

340
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:06,479
You don't have many shares left

341
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:08,988
Then forget it

342
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:10,436
How much do you need?

343
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:11,476
2O million

344
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:13,875
I'll give it to you tomorrow morning

345
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:15,275
Thank you

346
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:20,271
Uncle

347
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:21,955
don't go to Macau so often

348
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:23,994
OK

349
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:01,470
James

350
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:06,638
What happened?

351
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:08,230
the care broke down

352
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:11,195
I could reach you on your cell phone

353
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:13,677
The phone battery is dead

354
00:47:21,320 --> 00:47:23,072
I spent an hour and still couldn't fix
the car

355
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:24,390
The spark plug is wet

356
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:30,232
Go take a shower

357
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:08,800
Helen, this is the file you need

358
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:10,153
Thanks

359
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:00,353
Helen, I'm leaving for the day

360
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:01,469
Yes, Mr. Lung

361
00:49:13,160 --> 00:49:14,559
The old men didn't say much

362
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:16,518
It was only that bowtie bastard who
can't shut up

363
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:17,590
I'm looking into him

364
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:19,114
he's suspicious

365
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:20,471
Let's not talk here

366
00:49:22,120 --> 00:49:23,348
Manchester United has had a bad season

367
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:24,317
Should bet on them?

368
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:26,998
I bet 5 million dollars, half of it is your
money

369
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:54,634
Frank, got any money?

370
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:56,755
Do you have any money with you?

371
00:49:58,280 --> 00:49:59,110
I always carry enough with me

372
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:00,431
Give me some

373
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:05,477
James

374
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:07,671
Understood

375
00:50:09,120 --> 00:50:10,553
It's hared to believe he didn't die

376
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:16,796
This is from Mr. Lung

377
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:37,717
Curtis

378
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:39,237
Remember me?

379
00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:41,917
I'm Hoi, long time no see

380
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:44,352
Am I disturbing you?

381
00:50:45,160 --> 00:50:46,559
Looks like you're doing well

382
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:48,876
Call me if there are any good jobs
I just got out of prison

383
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,309
OK, this is my number

384
00:50:56,360 --> 00:50:57,315
Remember to call me

385
00:50:58,640 --> 00:50:59,834
Look out, boss

386
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:12,989
Where are you shot

387
00:57:13,480 --> 00:57:14,595
Can't you see the bullet yourself?

388
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:16,394
Thank God I got my bullet-proof vest
in time

389
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:17,916
But it still hurts

390
00:58:11,560 --> 00:58:13,790
Frank, I got it

391
00:58:14,760 --> 00:58:15,397
Got it

392
00:58:16,840 --> 00:58:18,512
OK, I understand

393
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:23,355
So it's Fat Cheung

394
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:26,394
How many men are left?

395
00:58:27,640 --> 00:58:28,311
Wait for my call

396
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:34,596
He'll call me

397
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:43,993
We have to act now

398
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:46,792
If that bastard gets the word and escapes

399
00:58:46,920 --> 00:58:47,750
How will we find him?

400
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:51,273
Bring him over here

401
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:54,910
What if he refuses to come?

402
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:07,793
You eat too much

403
00:59:08,360 --> 00:59:09,315
You should be careful

404
00:59:10,440 --> 00:59:11,668
Go see a doctor

405
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:14,517
Have your blood pressure and
cholesterol level checked

406
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:16,750
Loose some weight

407
00:59:26,200 --> 00:59:27,269
My brother wants to see you

408
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:32,715
Finish your food first

409
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:42,551
There was a time when I had to rise my
life just for a good meal

410
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:45,315
I admit I plotted the hits

411
00:59:45,560 --> 00:59:46,879
I lost

412
00:59:46,920 --> 00:59:48,399
I accept my fate

413
00:59:48,680 --> 00:59:49,669
Go talk to my brother

414
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:54,071
I'm an old man

415
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:56,436
I'm tried to always having to serve some
else

416
00:59:56,840 --> 00:59:58,353
Take my life if you want it

417
01:00:00,040 --> 01:00:02,315
Your father came from Shan ton
to Hong Kong

418
01:00:03,120 --> 01:00:06,795
We roamed about to take a living

419
01:00:07,400 --> 01:00:11,996
We started with nothing, but we became
an organization

420
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:15,393
We all put our heats into it

421
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:17,237
But there's one thing I don't understand

422
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:19,357
Can you tell me...

423
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:21,675
How come it's your family in charge of
the organization now?

424
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:54,550
Finish the job before you leave

425
01:01:54,600 --> 01:01:56,397
So people know we mean business

426
01:01:56,520 --> 01:01:57,157
Understood

427
01:01:58,880 --> 01:01:59,551
Let's move

428
01:02:28,040 --> 01:02:30,349
Enjoy the food, Curtis, I'll go get the
shark fins

429
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:30,912
Sorry for the trouble

430
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:31,756
Don't mention it

431
01:02:33,400 --> 01:02:34,913
I thought I was going to do this job for
8 or 1O years

432
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:36,353
But the moment we struck back

433
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:37,469
They just fell apart quickly

434
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:39,158
Now, I'm already missing the actions

435
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:40,432
Farewell

436
01:02:40,800 --> 01:02:43,030
If the 5 of us are such a great team

437
01:02:43,320 --> 01:02:44,992
We should get together and make some
money

438
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:45,712
Sure

439
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:47,433
I'm going to work for Roy

440
01:02:47,960 --> 01:02:49,791
Don't count me in, I still prefer cutting
hair

441
01:02:50,080 --> 01:02:50,512
James?

442
01:02:51,040 --> 01:02:52,314
Friendship forever

443
01:02:52,640 --> 01:02:53,117
Sure

444
01:02:57,680 --> 01:02:58,271
Curtis

445
01:03:11,080 --> 01:03:11,830
My brother wants you guys to take this

446
01:03:13,360 --> 01:03:13,792
Thank you

447
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:16,074
I want to say good-bye to Mr. Lung

448
01:03:16,280 --> 01:03:17,110
Don't disturb him

449
01:03:21,720 --> 01:03:23,438
In the old days when we finished a job

450
01:03:24,080 --> 01:03:27,595
all we did was go out dancing and
got massages

451
01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:31,078
There was this crazy old man

452
01:03:31,320 --> 01:03:32,070
But he's already dead

453
01:03:32,800 --> 01:03:34,279
He gave everyone a bag of cocaine
after each job

454
01:03:34,760 --> 01:03:35,829
What do I need that for? Shit

455
01:03:39,800 --> 01:03:40,949
These days...

456
01:03:42,320 --> 01:03:43,389
The organization treats everyone
impartially

457
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:49,035
My brother doesn't know about this

458
01:03:51,120 --> 01:03:52,109
It's only between the two of us

459
01:04:08,040 --> 01:04:08,756
What?

460
01:04:12,120 --> 01:04:12,996
My sister-in-law

461
01:04:17,040 --> 01:04:18,439
She had an affair with Shin

462
01:04:20,280 --> 01:04:21,030
Who told you that?

463
01:04:23,040 --> 01:04:23,790
Go ask him

464
01:04:31,120 --> 01:04:31,916
What if he says it's true?

465
01:04:35,040 --> 01:04:36,155
I'll take care of it

466
01:04:36,560 --> 01:04:38,039
That means I won't see him again

467
01:04:39,480 --> 01:04:40,230
Sure

468
01:05:05,880 --> 01:05:06,312
Curtis

469
01:05:07,720 --> 01:05:08,391
These are for you guys

470
01:05:10,600 --> 01:05:11,510
Can you get me a gun before 1O

471
01:05:12,320 --> 01:05:12,957
Anything in particular?

472
01:05:13,640 --> 01:05:14,277
Just the usual

473
01:05:15,360 --> 01:05:16,429
Don't forget, before 1O

474
01:05:17,720 --> 01:05:18,436
Let me borrow your phone

475
01:05:19,360 --> 01:05:19,837
Wait for me outside

476
01:05:32,520 --> 01:05:34,988
Shin, this is Curtis

477
01:05:35,680 --> 01:05:37,033
Got time? Let's meet up

478
01:05:40,720 --> 01:05:41,550
I'll pick you up after work...

479
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:43,596
OK

480
01:06:22,840 --> 01:06:24,478
Hello, who are you?

481
01:06:24,720 --> 01:06:26,392
Who are you?

482
01:06:27,200 --> 01:06:27,712
Shin?

483
01:06:28,680 --> 01:06:29,271
Who is this?

484
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:30,431
This is James

485
01:06:31,280 --> 01:06:31,837
Wrong number

486
01:07:02,520 --> 01:07:04,158
Hello

487
01:07:06,360 --> 01:07:06,951
James...

488
01:07:08,640 --> 01:07:09,277
Yeah?

489
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:12,188
Slow down

490
01:07:13,520 --> 01:07:13,997
What?

491
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:17,916
What happened?

492
01:07:20,160 --> 01:07:21,718
Do you know what happened?

493
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:25,955
Yes

494
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:30,312
Mike

495
01:07:31,320 --> 01:07:32,469
Let's find Curtis

496
01:07:51,720 --> 01:07:52,550
Did you drive Mrs. Lung to places? Did
you?

497
01:07:52,600 --> 01:07:54,318
I did

498
01:07:55,960 --> 01:07:57,632
Did she seduce you? Did she?

499
01:07:59,120 --> 01:08:00,155
She tried to seduce me

500
01:08:04,400 --> 01:08:04,957
Curtis

501
01:08:07,080 --> 01:08:08,513
Shin is with me

502
01:08:09,040 --> 01:08:10,598
He's young and inexperienced

503
01:08:10,800 --> 01:08:11,789
We're all good friends

504
01:08:11,840 --> 01:08:13,512
I'm just doing my job

505
01:08:14,280 --> 01:08:15,156
I have to protect him

506
01:08:19,080 --> 01:08:21,230
You have to finish the job, right?

507
01:08:24,840 --> 01:08:26,114
I know people call you The Ice

508
01:08:26,600 --> 01:08:27,919
but do you have to be that cold-hearted?

509
01:08:29,880 --> 01:08:31,199
If you use your gun, I'll use mine too

510
01:08:33,240 --> 01:08:34,355
I'll protect him

511
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:36,876
Don't touch him

512
01:09:18,200 --> 01:09:18,791
Roy

513
01:09:21,160 --> 01:09:22,479
Did you have an affair with Mrs. Lung?

514
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:24,199
Did you?

515
01:09:27,680 --> 01:09:29,557
Now Frank wants Curtis to kill you

516
01:09:41,880 --> 01:09:43,233
Make sure he gets on the boat tonight

517
01:09:45,760 --> 01:09:47,193
What's the matter with you?

518
01:09:48,800 --> 01:09:49,630
Take it

519
01:10:32,320 --> 01:10:33,594
What's your plan when you get to Taiwan

520
01:10:38,320 --> 01:10:39,116
I've never been there

521
01:10:42,360 --> 01:10:43,315
I'm afraid to fly

522
01:10:44,840 --> 01:10:45,556
I've never be there either

523
01:10:49,360 --> 01:10:51,669
I didn't expect the first thing to do for

524
01:10:51,720 --> 01:10:52,869
Roy would be getting you out of HK

525
01:10:56,480 --> 01:10:57,117
Thanks

526
01:10:58,480 --> 01:10:59,310
Roy is a good boss

527
01:10:59,720 --> 01:11:00,675
You're with the right man

528
01:11:03,680 --> 01:11:04,430
The boat's here

529
01:11:18,640 --> 01:11:19,470
Maybe we'll meet again

530
01:11:52,320 --> 01:11:52,957
Shin

531
01:11:55,760 --> 01:11:57,671
If you leave, Curtis will have to take the
wrap

532
01:11:58,040 --> 01:11:59,393
Because Roy protected you, Frank will
deal with him

533
01:12:00,480 --> 01:12:01,879
James and I will also be in a lot of trouble

534
01:12:03,080 --> 01:12:04,672
It's you, or the 4 of us

535
01:12:53,480 --> 01:12:53,912
James

536
01:12:55,760 --> 01:12:56,670
is the gun ready?

537
01:12:57,560 --> 01:12:58,197
I gave it to him

538
01:12:58,960 --> 01:12:59,517
It's black

539
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:03,277
It's all set

540
01:13:53,920 --> 01:13:54,477
Curtis

541
01:13:54,520 --> 01:13:55,509
They're here

542
01:14:05,680 --> 01:14:06,430
Sit, Curtis

543
01:14:24,600 --> 01:14:25,350
Can you let him go?

544
01:14:28,440 --> 01:14:29,270
Joe is outside

545
01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:36,194
Then let's enjoy this meal

546
01:14:37,760 --> 01:14:39,398
You can say it's a farewell dinner

547
01:14:44,960 --> 01:14:45,312
Sure

548
01:15:04,480 --> 01:15:05,037
Eat

549
01:15:30,360 --> 01:15:30,917
Curtis

550
01:15:34,240 --> 01:15:35,559
Let me talk to Mr. Lung

551
01:15:37,680 --> 01:15:38,556
I'll be back before 3

552
01:15:42,920 --> 01:15:44,035
OK, before 3

553
01:16:12,840 --> 01:16:13,352
Mr. Lung

554
01:16:14,440 --> 01:16:15,395
Shin didn't mean it

555
01:16:18,960 --> 01:16:20,678
Mr. Lung

556
01:16:21,840 --> 01:16:22,909
you can't blame it all on Shin

557
01:16:23,880 --> 01:16:24,676
Your wife

558
01:16:27,800 --> 01:16:28,357
Mr. Lung

559
01:16:28,960 --> 01:16:31,554
give me face, I guarantee you he won't
do it again

560
01:16:49,080 --> 01:16:49,512
Mr. Lung

561
01:16:50,760 --> 01:16:51,795
please let Shin go

562
01:16:53,680 --> 01:16:55,398
He's just a kid, he knows he's wrong

563
01:16:56,360 --> 01:16:58,351
Just cut his hand off and spare his life

564
01:16:59,360 --> 01:17:00,156
You're a generous man

565
01:17:21,840 --> 01:17:22,352
I'm here to see Mr. Lung

566
01:17:26,200 --> 01:17:26,632
Mrs. Lung

567
01:19:02,400 --> 01:19:02,877
Time's up

568
01:19:11,680 --> 01:19:12,317
How did it go?

569
01:19:15,040 --> 01:19:16,598
James, don't make it difficult for me

570
01:19:17,080 --> 01:19:18,115
Roy, don't shoot

571
01:19:29,840 --> 01:19:30,431
Mrs. Lung

572
01:19:31,320 --> 01:19:31,877
is dead

573
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:05,591
Thank you

574
01:20:27,360 --> 01:20:28,236
Take care of it for me

575
01:20:28,400 --> 01:20:28,991
Sure thing

576
01:20:54,320 --> 01:20:54,832
James
