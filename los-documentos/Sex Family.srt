Father, are you going to
take a rest now?

3
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:19,040
Yes, as usual.

4
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:21,040
I see.

5
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:40,860
How is everyone doing today?

6
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:44,620
Yes, as usual.

7
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,340
I see.

8
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:53,400
Were there any problems?

9
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:56,400
No, nothing at all.

10
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,660
- That's good, then.
- Indeed.

11
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:08,060
There is no problem
whatsoever.

12
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:43,840
There is no problem
whatsoever...

13
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:04,960
There will never be any
problem with this, right?

14
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:08,240
Yeah...

15
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:15,880
<i>There is no problem
whatsoever.</i>

16
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:18,320
Everything seems to be going
according to the plan.

17
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,680
There will be no problem.

18
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:34,160
<i>There is no problem
whatsoever.</i>

19

<i>There is no problem
whatsoever.</i>

20
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:48,780
Mother, you have lived
long enough.

21
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:55,200
Hurry up... kill me!

22
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:00,340
Mother!

23
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,120
You can die now,

24
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:07,940
and my brothers will continue
to live in agony.

25

26

<i>Quick, kill... kill me!</i>

27
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,240
Thank you.

28
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:50,580
I won’t die.
I cannot die!

29
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:07,880
Mother, were you happy?

30
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:44,020
I won't die...

Me.

And my younger brother.

52
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:45,120
Then, there was his mistress.

53
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:49,760
Her daughters, Akiko,

00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,660

The three of them!

57
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:07,300
All of them are my
father’s women!

58
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:11,960
He made his mistress’ three
daughters his mistresses also.

59
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:16,700
His way of dominating the world
is simple and forceful.

60
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:20,920
On the surface, he has fame
and status...

61
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,906
as the Commander-in-Chief, but,

62
00:12:22,956 --> 00:12:25,370
in reality, he is
the boss of a monkey family.

63
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:29,060
All males and females have
to obey him.

64
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:35,860
My older brother and I...

65
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,390
shared our father's women

66
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:44,000
and enjoyed sex in the house.

67
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:48,980
My mother lost her mind
and died.

68
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:54,360
I did nothing.

69
00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:00,100
My mother died because
I did absolutely anything.

70
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:07,520
I killed my mother!

71
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:23,480
The one who made mother
kill herself... was me!

72
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:45,020
Go away!

73
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:47,720
How dare you?

74
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:51,540
Why did you tell me that you would
die if I didn’t come?

75
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:54,860
Why did you tell me you
killed your mother?

76
00:13:57,100 --> 00:14:02,220
If you were that sad, why didn't
you attend her funeral?

77
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,260
At the funeral,

78
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:11,640
you should have told everyone
about our father,

79
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:16,740
that your mother committed suicide,

80
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,640
and that our father was the reason!

81
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,640
Shut up, you mistress’ child!

82
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:33,380
That's right.

83
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:37,260
I am indeed a mistress’ child,

84
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:43,140
but I attended the funeral on
behalf of the real wife's oldest son,

85
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:49,020
and even came here for you because
you told me that you would die.

86
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:53,900
I see, sister...
no, Akiko.

87
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:56,560
Let's run away!

88
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,560
Run away?

89
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:01,280
Why did my mother die?

90
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:04,320
My older brother and I...

91
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:09,260
No, you are also a member of
the prestigious Sakae family,

92
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:15,040
but, in reality, you are nothing
but father's puppet.

93
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:24,220
If we don't do anything,
we will continue to rot like this.

94
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:28,680
We will all continue to
be his puppets.

95
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:34,220
You will become our father's
and my older brother's toy!

96
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:36,220
Idiot!

97
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:39,040
Yes, I am an idiot.

98
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:41,440
But that's because I love
you so much!

99
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:44,740
Stop it!

100
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:46,020
I won't stop anymore.

101
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:49,490
I don't care you are my father's
mistress or my older brother's wife.

102
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:51,430
I fell in love with you
at first sight.

103
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:53,720
I have been waiting for
this very moment.

104
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:55,760
Stop it!

105
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:58,700
This is not what you told me!

106
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:04,020
Let's leave the house.

107
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:06,530
It's not just running away
from our father.

108
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:08,380
Let's become independent,

109
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:12,660
and prove that we can have
our own self-reliant lives.

110
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:19,500
Let's start over.
Let's change everything!

111
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:24,080
That kind of...
That kind of dream...

112
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,660
- I don't have it anymore.
- This is not a dream!

113
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:29,590
It is our own life.

114
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:32,540
Stop!
I can't do that anymore.

115
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:35,020
Why?
Why can't you do it?

116
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,520
Stop it.

117
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,380
We shouldn't...

118
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,280
<i>We shouldn't!</i>

119
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:06,760
<i>We shouldn't!</i>

120
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:09,540
<i>We shouldn't!</i>

121
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:15,020
<i>We can't! We can't!</i>

122
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:19,300
<i>I didn't have any dream.</i>

123
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:24,780
<i>I didn't know why I did
all those things.</i>

124
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:29,480
<i>At any rate, I was hopeless
at that time.</i>

125
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:32,460
<i>That was my youth.</i>

126
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:35,900
<i>I didn't really love anyone.</i>

127
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:41,260
<i>I lived an agonizing life
without any dreams.</i>

128
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:44,200
<i>At any rate,</i>

129
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:48,520
<i>I visited him because I thought he
could find a solution for me.</i>

130
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:03,720
Have your mother and
sisters been fine?

131
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,740
Give this to your mother.

132
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,320
You are now a university student.

133
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:19,000
Focus on your studies.

134
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,280
You see...

135
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:26,740
I am not really a university
student.

136
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:33,480
I am a mistress’ daughter!

137
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:49,560
And today...

138
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:53,640
I am going to quit being one!

139
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,160
Akiko!

140
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:58,900
What are you...?

141
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:02,940
<i>When I saw his face,</i>

142
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:05,240
<i>I...</i>

143
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:10,180
<i>I couldn't lie to myself that I
was not a mistress’ daughter.</i>

144
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:11,870
What do you think you can do?

145
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:15,600
<i>Either I became a mistress’
daughter fully,</i>

146
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:19,360
<i>or I'd quit being one as an
independent woman.</i>

147
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:23,480
If you hate being a
mistress’ daughter...

148
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,720
the only solution would be
to become a mistress yourself.

149
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:48,460
You will become my
mistress today.

150
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,520
I... will not!

151
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:46,320
<i>Somehow, I didn't show
any resistance.</i>

152
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,320
<i>No...</i>

153
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:51,540
<i>Even if I had resisted,</i>

154
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:55,300
<i>I would have been just too
weak to do that...</i>

155
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:58,120
<i>since I was only a girl.</i>

156
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:03,340
<i>When I realized that,</i>

157
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:07,380
<i>I decided to become a
mistress,</i>

158
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:10,340
<i>rather than a mistress’
daughter.</i>

159
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:58,480
Don't cry.

160
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:01,900
I am not crying.

161
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:08,740
Stop! Do you plan to make
me a mistress too?

162
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:12,820
What are you staring at?

163
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,920
That's right.

164
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:19,740
Our father sold me to your
older brother already.

165
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:25,450
Okay, let's end this.

166
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:26,660
No!

167
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:29,320
You know that's not possible!

168
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:44,860
Why are you here?

169
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:58,400
I am asking why you are here.

170
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:02,600
Mother committed suicide.

171
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:07,500
Mother... was killed by you!

172
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:09,960
Is that so?

173
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:11,660
Of course!

174
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:16,460
Well, perhaps you're right.

175
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:22,180
I might have killed her.

176
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:25,420
She might have killed herself.

177
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:30,800
I don’t think about people
once they’re dead.

178
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:34,740
She ran away from me, anyway.

179
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:38,540
So, I decided to forget about her.

180
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:44,180
That's false!

181
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:48,160
This is your usual,
fake way of doing things.

182
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:51,760
You are avoiding the truth.

183
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,780
Stop being deceitful!

184
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,300
Is there something wrong?

185
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:41,660
During the funeral,
I slept with a man today.

186
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:45,980
It was Koji, wasn’t he?

187
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:49,860
That’s right.
You are good at guessing.

188
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:52,640
I would happily sleep with him.

189
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:59,240
I felt I was almost being,
raped, though.

190
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:02,220
He tackled me suddenly.

191
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:04,920
It was such a crazy situation.

192
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:06,920
You see,

193
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:10,360
I have never seen him that angry.

194
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:14,940
I am serious!
His eyes were completely red.

195
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:17,940
He almost sucked my nose.

196
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:21,560
I'm not laughing of that.

197
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:26,520
What's wrong?
Did something happen?

198
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:31,240
No, it's not that.

199
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:36,000
I just have been thinking
about everyone recently.

200
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:44,900
Everyone living in this house.

201
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:51,960
I think you are attracted to Koji.

202
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:57,440
Why don’t you go have fun
with Koji tonight?

203
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:16,180
In other words, considering the
male and female combinations,

204
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:33,720
<i>father and Haruko will
become a couple as usual,</i>

205
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:37,420
<i>even more openly than before.</i>

206
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:45,180
<i>According to the current custom,</i>

207
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:49,000
<i>the order is from the top
going down.</i>

208
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:52,920
<i>Therefore, Natsuko and Shozo
will soon become a couple.</i>

209
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:08,920
In summary, I can be alone...

210
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:16,360
and finally leave this house.

211
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:25,840
It's been a while since you
visited my room.

212
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:03,060
Didn't you come here to do me?

213
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,060
I guess...

214
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:09,820
I'm fine with that.

215
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:31,040
I guess your medicine dose
has increased.

216
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:33,520
A little.

217
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:38,060
Do you want to leave this
house with me?

218
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:40,060
Let's see...

219
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:44,960
I am being serious.

220
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:49,860
I am fed up of everything here.

221
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:55,120
I know, me too.

222
00:30:57,500 --> 00:31:01,320
But it's been five years since
I got stuck in this room.

223
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:09,640
I think it's time for you to get
some fresh air outside.

224
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:13,840
Fresh air...

225
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:19,160
The blue sky...

226
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,500
The blue ocean...

227
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:26,020
A white sand beach...

228
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:29,480
That's good!

229
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:00,480
It's fine, isn't it?

230
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:07,960
What do you think?
Let’s leave now.

231
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:13,880
No matter how hot the sun is,

232
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:17,080
staying here is not much different.

233
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:21,100
And I bet the wind outside
will be cold.

234
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:24,040
I am going back to
my workplace.

235
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:27,680
Come, let's go together.

236
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:05,380
Come, let's go back!

237
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:06,910
Everyone is waiting for us.

238
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:09,140
I have to do something
before that.

239
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:12,560
My father made them release me
on the same day.

240
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,920
Our comrades might think
I am a spy!

241
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:18,700
I will tell you about it later!

242
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:54,400
It must have been hard, Natsuko.

243
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:59,740
Father, you pulled a dirty trick.

244
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:01,960
I am different from my sisters!

245
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:21,160
Father, let’s make it clear.

246
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:24,200
I don't want to become a
mistress like my sisters.

247
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:26,420
You cannot control me
with your power!

248
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:43,040
This is exactly the mistress’
life I imagined.

249
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:46,540
How dare you live like this,
sister?

250
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:48,740
This is not different from
being a pig!

251
00:34:56,240 --> 00:35:00,060
You might think you can dominate
everything in this world.

252
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:02,960
It's nothing but a bourgeois’
vanity!

253
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:07,360
I will pay you back everything later.
I don't want to see your face again.

254
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,580
Farewell!

255
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:21,100
When are you going to
pay me back, then?

256
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,460
Why don't you pay me
back now?

257
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:28,520
In other words, you will never be
able to pay me back.

258
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:31,420
So, do you want me to become
your mistress too?

259
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:36,660
Well, I wonder about that?

260
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:38,660
Say it clearly!

261
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:47,100
I don't know what you mean
by the word “mistress".

262
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:49,240
Considering that you are
my daughter,

263
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:52,140
being taken care of by me,
you should become one.

264
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:54,680
I understand.

265
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:58,900
Then, take as much as you
have provided until now!

266
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:01,820
It's not a big deal for me!

267
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:23,760
I am only throwing away this
19-year-old body and life.

268
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:28,240
I will use my life for more
precious goals later.

269
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:33,940
Father.

270
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:37,100
I am afraid to say I'm
not a virgin anymore.

271
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:44,880
You stay here.

272
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:05,340
The one who dominates and
the one who is dominated.

273
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,780
This world consists of
the two of them.

274
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:10,720
I...

275
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:14,800
I don't just own the
things I dominate.

276
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:18,000
I don't just love the things
I dominate.

277
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:24,860
You all exist because I am here.

278
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:30,420
You, the ones who are dominated,
exist before me, the one who dominates.

279
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:41,400
<i>Take up, the starved people!
Now, the day will be soon!</i>

280
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:49,540
<i>Wake up, my comrades!
The sun has already risen!</i>

281
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:54,440
<i>In the day we can off the
tyrannical chains,</i>

282
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:58,340
<i>The Red Flag burns with our bloods!</i>

283
00:37:58,580 --> 00:38:06,500
<i>We're distantly separated by the seas,
But let's go together joining hands!</i>

284
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,760
<i>Let's battle with...</i>

285
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:01,000
I wonder if I despise myself?

286
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:05,820
That's what I live for.

287
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:15,940
I am a dying woman.

288
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:21,000
A dying woman cannot be revived.

289
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:26,460
Nobody wants a impotent woman
digging her own grave.

290
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:31,320
But...

291
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:35,900
I wonder how death...

292
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:40,780
feels like?

293
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:00,000
Damn it!

294
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:05,380
I won't be a block of a sex
pyramid forever!

295
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:08,400
Those people...

296
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:11,300
I absolutely won't do it with them!

297
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:15,160
Shit...

298
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:46,700
<i>I'm in pain!</i>

299
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:50,000
<i>Pain...</i>

300
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:21,240
Good morning!

301
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:44,960
Have a good day.

302
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:23,860
At the prosecutor’s office,

303
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:28,440
they were joking that you
were planning a coup, father.

304
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:30,200
Indeed.

305
00:44:32,300 --> 00:44:35,980
Well, that kind of rumor circulates...

306
00:44:37,020 --> 00:44:39,502
because of that incident

307
00:44:39,552 --> 00:44:44,040
and the low volume
of criminal cases at hand.

308
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,380
Indeed.

309
00:44:48,620 --> 00:44:51,520
There is no smoke without fire.

310
00:44:53,140 --> 00:44:55,420
I am actually considering it.

311
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:57,540
Huh?

312
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:29,000
<i>You can't possibly be a
virgin, right?</i>

313
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:39,900
Do you have sex with our
father every night?

314
00:46:45,060 --> 00:46:48,280
It's natural because the two of you
share the same blood.

315
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:51,740
<i>You are going to become
a pig soon too.</i>

316
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:56,220
Do you like our father?

317
00:47:04,740 --> 00:47:07,920
Since I was born, I was raised
to become a mistress.

318
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:10,640
I am destined to be our
father's mistress.

319
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:12,220
Nice to meet you.

320
00:47:19,540 --> 00:47:21,160
My father is persistent!

321
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:29,820
Okay.

322
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:32,440
Let's go.

323
00:47:36,840 --> 00:47:38,100
That's good.

324
00:47:39,020 --> 00:47:40,500
Alright.

325
00:47:43,460 --> 00:47:44,940
That's nice.

326
00:47:46,140 --> 00:47:47,580
Good.

327
00:47:57,260 --> 00:47:59,720
That's it.
Alright.

328
00:48:04,580 --> 00:48:06,200
Sit like that.

329
00:48:20,420 --> 00:48:21,560
Good.

330
00:48:23,060 --> 00:48:25,360
Relax now. Good.

331
00:48:34,900 --> 00:48:36,580
Okay.

332
00:48:45,980 --> 00:48:47,460
Well...

333
00:48:51,100 --> 00:48:52,960
Look to the left.

334
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:57,820
This way.
Good.

335
00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:02,260
<i>Brother!</i>

336
00:49:07,980 --> 00:49:09,300
Now, smile.

337
00:49:11,620 --> 00:49:14,240
- Do you take this kind of photos?
- I do.

338
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:17,140
I need them for gynecological
reasons.

339
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:18,980
Spread your legs please.

340
00:49:22,220 --> 00:49:23,960
<i>That's it.</i>

341
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:31,260
Keep smiling.

342
00:49:37,620 --> 00:49:38,820
<i>Good.</i>

343
00:49:41,340 --> 00:49:44,680
Brother, our mother didn't
commit suicide.

344
00:49:44,820 --> 00:49:45,860
I killed her.

345
00:49:46,580 --> 00:49:49,280
Huh?
What did you just say?

346
00:49:50,340 --> 00:49:51,940
I killed our mother.

347
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:54,360
What?!

348
00:49:56,420 --> 00:49:59,720
I saw her suffering in the middle
of an attempted suicide.

349
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:04,100
So, I thought she had
chosen to kill herself,

350
00:50:04,340 --> 00:50:05,800
that she was happier dying,

351
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:10,160
<i>rather than living like she did.
So, I helped her.</i>

352
00:50:10,520 --> 00:50:11,520
That's enough!

353
00:50:12,500 --> 00:50:15,020
If you are here to talk nonsense,
leave already.

354
00:50:15,260 --> 00:50:18,580
And be sure to get some sleep.
Your eyes are red.

355
00:50:44,940 --> 00:50:46,880
That idiot makes me sick.

356
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:52,040
I am serious.
I strangled her with my own hands.

357
00:50:53,380 --> 00:50:54,980
And then?

358
00:50:55,640 --> 00:50:59,200
Our mother was having a nightmare.

359
00:51:00,580 --> 00:51:04,540
And she got naked while she
was suffering.

360
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:06,540
Then, I...

361
00:51:07,420 --> 00:51:10,700
You raped and killed her, right?

362
00:51:10,980 --> 00:51:12,300
Yes...

363
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:16,760
That's matricide and I am going
to get capital punishment, right?

364
00:51:24,260 --> 00:51:27,520
<i>Brother, can you prosecute me?</i>

365
00:51:36,700 --> 00:51:40,040
Get me arrested and
prosecuted right now!

366
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:48,080
Since our mother died,

367
00:51:48,680 --> 00:51:51,400
you've been behaving
a bit strangely.

368
00:51:53,020 --> 00:51:55,580
I will think about it.
Wait at home for now.

369
00:51:59,180 --> 00:52:00,180
Yes!

370
00:52:03,740 --> 00:52:05,320
I can't believe this.

371
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:08,880
Was he really serious just now?

372
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:16,700
First, this kind of thing couldn't
have happened in our house.

373
00:52:18,820 --> 00:52:23,420
Second, there is no motive
for a murder at all.

374
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:08,460
Impossible!

375
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:12,260
Such a thing would
be ridiculous!

376
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,680
Nobody believes that I did it.

377
00:55:48,040 --> 00:55:50,020
I wonder if I was wrong?

378
00:55:51,180 --> 00:55:53,580
I shouldn't have killed mother,

379
00:55:54,140 --> 00:55:55,800
but those pigs instead!

380
00:57:00,760 --> 00:57:02,660
Are you pregnant?

381
00:57:07,140 --> 00:57:08,560
I see.

382
00:57:09,240 --> 00:57:12,760
Our father's or my brother's?
Whose child is it?

383
00:57:15,580 --> 00:57:16,960
Your brother's...

384
00:57:20,840 --> 00:57:23,420
You are nothing but a
useless baby pig.

385
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:07,060
Is she dead?

386
00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:34,080
You pig!

387
00:59:22,620 --> 00:59:24,200
Who is it?

388
00:59:36,060 --> 00:59:37,580
What do you want?

389
00:59:42,060 --> 00:59:44,180
I didn't know you were
a good man.

390
00:59:45,600 --> 00:59:48,300
If you are here to sleep with me,
then you are wrong.

391
00:59:48,520 --> 00:59:51,060
I am different from my
father and brothers.

392
00:59:51,160 --> 00:59:54,000
Is that so?
That's unfortunate.

393
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,620
I thought you wanted a
woman too.

394
01:00:00,620 --> 01:00:02,920
- Why are you here?
- For nothing.

395
01:00:08,100 --> 01:00:10,420
Actually, I want to talk.

396
01:00:14,980 --> 01:00:18,600
You see, your mother did
not commit suicide.

397
01:00:18,940 --> 01:00:21,280
In fact, the one who killed
your mother was...

398
01:00:25,980 --> 01:00:27,040
It was me.

399
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:28,200
It was me!

400
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:33,680
It's the truth.

401
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:37,180
I gave Natsuko sleeping
pills to your mother...

402
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:39,780
because she said she
couldn’t sleep well.

403
01:00:43,040 --> 01:00:45,900
So, I made her die that way.

404
01:00:46,740 --> 01:00:49,880
She took 40 pills, and it was
an attempted suicide.

405
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:52,260
She took 50 pills in total.

406
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:56,320
And it was me who made her
take the remaining 10 pills.

407
01:00:56,680 --> 01:00:59,540
- That was what killed her.
- No way!

408
01:00:59,660 --> 01:01:03,420
I'm pretty convinced that mother
was happier dying...

409
01:01:03,560 --> 01:01:06,240
rather than being treated
as a dirty mistress.

410
01:01:07,060 --> 01:01:09,100
Your mother was dirty too.

411
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:11,360
She wasn't!
She was different from you!

412
01:01:11,780 --> 01:01:13,160
What are you talking about?

413
01:01:13,220 --> 01:01:15,620
All of the women have been
raped by our father.

414
01:01:16,500 --> 01:01:18,360
Our behaviors and thoughts...

415
01:01:18,700 --> 01:01:21,140
Your father controlled everyone!

416
01:01:21,240 --> 01:01:22,280
Shut up, you whore!

417
01:01:22,700 --> 01:01:24,800
Yes, I am a whore!

418
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:26,000
Shit!

419
01:01:26,320 --> 01:01:28,000
You have lost your mind.

420
01:01:28,160 --> 01:01:31,150
You didn't have any reason
to kill my sisters.

421
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:34,180
I did, I sure did!
Women cannot understand it.

422
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:36,820
<i>Hey, Haruko!</i>

423
01:01:44,460 --> 01:01:47,460
Yes, there is no problem
whatsoever.

424
01:01:49,780 --> 01:01:54,880
I don't want to tell anyone,
including the police, about this.

425
01:01:55,900 --> 01:01:59,220
My sisters’ deaths don't
even make me feel sad.

426
01:01:59,720 --> 01:02:01,520
I am totally fine,

427
01:02:01,880 --> 01:02:04,800
because I am able to
live my own life.

428
01:02:05,100 --> 01:02:06,800
I am different from you.

429
01:02:10,740 --> 01:02:13,800
I will continue to stick to father.

430
01:02:21,100 --> 01:02:22,580
Father...

431
01:02:38,580 --> 01:02:41,080
<i>What happened?
Was there any problem?</i>

432
01:02:41,720 --> 01:02:44,200
<i>There is no problem
whatsoever.</i>

433
01:02:48,100 --> 01:02:50,700
<i>Nothing at all.</i>

434
01:03:16,640 --> 01:03:18,920
Katana.
The katana isn't here!

435
01:03:19,900 --> 01:03:22,530
No, there is no problem,
as usual.

436
01:03:22,580 --> 01:03:24,520
Silence! There is!

437
01:03:24,580 --> 01:03:26,020
Damn you!

438
01:03:30,600 --> 01:03:32,980
- You took it.
- Father.

439
01:03:34,060 --> 01:03:36,300
Do you really need this?

440
01:03:41,620 --> 01:03:43,820
No, it's fine...

441
01:03:44,620 --> 01:03:47,840
You see,
I borrowed this...

442
01:03:48,760 --> 01:03:50,440
to kill my sisters.

443
01:03:56,480 --> 01:03:59,140
Father, I...

444
01:03:59,660 --> 01:04:02,020
I was wrong, after all.

445
01:04:02,840 --> 01:04:06,860
I have killed my mother
and sisters now.

446
01:04:08,380 --> 01:04:10,080
I was wrong, after all!

447
01:04:11,960 --> 01:04:13,860
Anyone can be wrong.

448
01:04:14,140 --> 01:04:16,620
There are various ways
to correct yourself.

449
01:04:18,780 --> 01:04:20,820
But what you need right now...

450
01:04:21,840 --> 01:04:25,060
is to know how I'll absolve
your mistake.

451
01:04:26,160 --> 01:04:27,800
You're wrong, father!

452
01:04:28,900 --> 01:04:31,150
I am not talking about that.
I am here to...

453
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:34,680
And I believe I have been
right all along.

454
01:04:34,840 --> 01:04:36,500
I am not talking about that!

455
01:04:36,920 --> 01:04:38,400
I came here.

456
01:04:38,500 --> 01:04:40,200
Here, here!

457
01:04:40,620 --> 01:04:42,380
I came to sit here!

458
01:04:53,180 --> 01:04:54,740
You...

459
01:04:55,800 --> 01:04:57,440
Shit!

460
01:05:08,080 --> 01:05:09,420
I...

461
01:05:10,100 --> 01:05:11,420
I...

462
01:05:12,480 --> 01:05:14,940
I didn't come to just sit here!

463
01:05:22,200 --> 01:05:24,620
How dare you judge me?

464
01:05:25,120 --> 01:05:27,140
Are you that scared of
a murderer?

465
01:05:33,320 --> 01:05:36,980
You, my brothers...

466
01:05:37,640 --> 01:05:40,040
all of you want to sit here,
don’t you?

467
01:05:40,800 --> 01:05:43,240
But you just couldn't
defeat our father.

468
01:06:03,480 --> 01:06:04,800
However...

469
01:06:07,940 --> 01:06:11,340
the one who is sitting here
right now is me!

470
01:06:14,420 --> 01:06:16,380
I am sitting here!

471
01:08:19,440 --> 01:08:27,120
THE END
