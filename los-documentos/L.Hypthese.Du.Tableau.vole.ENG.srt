THE HYPOTHESIS
OF THE STOLEN PAINTING

2
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,900
<i>Human consciousness has expired.

3
00:01:26,069 --> 00:01:29,438
<i>On the cadaver he squats,</i>
<i>gloating, mired.

4
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:32,272
<i>Seated in triumph, he turns to crow.

5
00:01:32,443 --> 00:01:35,139
<i>Each time</i>
<i>he deals the corpse a blow.

6
00:01:35,312 --> 00:01:36,746
<i>Victor Hugo

7
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:41,210
<i>What do you see? What do you feel?

8
00:01:41,352 --> 00:01:44,287
<i>Is it pain or is it ecstasy

9
00:01:44,456 --> 00:01:47,050
<i>that keeps you afloat in space?

10
00:01:47,225 --> 00:01:49,921
<i>P.K. BAPH. VI. 141.

11
00:01:56,235 --> 00:02:00,365
<i>No sinister adjuncts</i>
<i>lend their banal significance.

12
00:02:01,273 --> 00:02:05,471
<i>No hint of melodrama</i>
<i>injects its facile role.

13
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:11,712
<i>Simply by interpreting</i>
<i>in his sober, magisterial style,

14
00:02:12,119 --> 00:02:16,453
<i>the dynamism of these figures and</i>
<i>by capturing gesture and attitude,

15
00:02:17,157 --> 00:02:19,887
<i>the painter reveals</i>
<i>the ardent fanaticism of these men,

16
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:22,051
<i>their implacable purpose.

17
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:27,266
J. Alboise in <i>L'Artiste</i>, 1889.

18
00:02:28,735 --> 00:02:31,500
<i>Ingenious,</i>
<i>somewhat studied compositions

19
00:02:31,739 --> 00:02:34,503
<i>recalling the witty groupings

20
00:02:34,542 --> 00:02:36,942
<i>employed with felicity by Gérôme.

21
00:02:39,113 --> 00:02:42,514
<i>Adding a novelist's skills</i>
<i>to those of the painter,

22
00:02:42,683 --> 00:02:45,516
<i>he plays cleverly</i>
<i>on our curiosity as spectators

23
00:02:45,953 --> 00:02:47,511
<i>who arrived too late.

24
00:02:48,422 --> 00:02:52,553
M.F. Lajenevais,
<i>Revue des Deux Mondes,</i> 1889.

25
00:02:54,997 --> 00:02:58,524
<i>Rare is the artist so assured</i>
<i>of the present and the future.

26
00:02:59,501 --> 00:03:03,369
<i>He is not merely an instinctive</i>
<i>master of composition.

27
00:03:05,507 --> 00:03:07,976
<i>His sense of history preserves him

28
00:03:08,144 --> 00:03:11,978
<i>from the pitfalls</i>
<i>of dusty scholarship.

29
00:03:12,515 --> 00:03:14,210
It was also said,

30
00:03:14,384 --> 00:03:16,978
"Always a painter,
Monsieur Tonnerre

31
00:03:17,153 --> 00:03:21,556
"is now an artist,
in the highest sense of the word."

32
00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:24,551
<i>And yet...

33
00:03:24,627 --> 00:03:26,960
Alas! And yet...

34
00:03:31,569 --> 00:03:34,561
<i>How could such paintings</i>
<i>provoke a scandal?

35
00:03:34,738 --> 00:03:36,262
And yet...

36
00:03:44,216 --> 00:03:46,582
<i>How is it</i>
<i>that only six paintings...

37
00:03:46,685 --> 00:03:47,845
Seven.

38
00:03:48,553 --> 00:03:51,647
<i>How is it that a simple scandal,

39
00:03:51,823 --> 00:03:54,417
<i>a mere stir in fashionable Paris

40
00:03:54,593 --> 00:03:57,585
<i>became transformed</i>
<i>into an affair of state?

41
00:03:57,963 --> 00:03:59,430
Alas.

42
00:04:00,699 --> 00:04:04,636
<i>Today we look and look again</i>
<i>at these paintings.

43
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:08,605
<i>There is nothing shocking</i>
<i>about them,

44
00:04:08,674 --> 00:04:13,111
<i>no common link between them,</i>
<i>not even a unity in style.

45
00:04:14,614 --> 00:04:16,206
<i>In some,

46
00:04:17,049 --> 00:04:20,281
<i>the striking thing</i>
<i>is the attention to detail

47
00:04:21,255 --> 00:04:25,316
<i>but also a lack of care</i>
<i>in the overall composition.

48
00:04:26,126 --> 00:04:27,616
<i>In others,

49
00:04:28,061 --> 00:04:31,030
<i>the flowing strokes</i>
<i>and vivid colours

50
00:04:31,198 --> 00:04:34,031
<i>but also the static quality</i>
<i>of the compositions.

51
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:38,639
<i>Y et others indulge

52
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:42,007
<i>the excessive illusionism</i>
<i>of a theatrical décor

53
00:04:43,445 --> 00:04:45,310
<i>but also

54
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:48,005
<i>seem contradictory</i>
<i>in their composition.

55
00:04:49,551 --> 00:04:54,352
<i>That these six paintings should pose</i>
<i>such questions is understandable.

56
00:04:54,656 --> 00:04:55,884
Seven paintings.

57
00:04:56,659 --> 00:04:58,422
<i>But a scandal,

58
00:04:58,894 --> 00:05:00,657
<i>intervention by the authorities...

59
00:05:00,696 --> 00:05:02,960
Alas! Thrice alas!

60
00:05:03,666 --> 00:05:04,928
<i>And yet...

61
00:05:05,334 --> 00:05:07,894
And yet only seven paintings

62
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:10,664
preserve their mute testimony.

63
00:05:11,473 --> 00:05:13,941
<i>A scandal so great</i>
<i>that the authorities,

64
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:17,774
<i>for once in agreement,</i>
<i>felt impelled to bury it.

65
00:05:18,782 --> 00:05:20,682
<i>The press was silent,

66
00:05:21,184 --> 00:05:23,675
<i>spies infiltrated the salons

67
00:05:23,854 --> 00:05:28,188
<i>and others, diversionary scandals,</i>
<i>seemingly by chance,

68
00:05:28,658 --> 00:05:31,957
<i>overtook the people</i>
<i>most concerned with these paintings

69
00:05:32,262 --> 00:05:36,927
<i>executed more or less skilfully</i>
<i>by an obscure disciple of Gérôme:

70
00:05:37,602 --> 00:05:39,194
<i>the painter Tonnerre.

71
00:05:41,672 --> 00:05:43,469
Two comments...

72
00:05:44,308 --> 00:05:46,708
Two comments
concerning the paintings.

73
00:05:48,713 --> 00:05:50,943
And two further comments.

74
00:05:52,017 --> 00:05:56,386
Two further comments,
but these of a more general nature.

75
00:06:03,395 --> 00:06:04,726
Firstly,

76
00:06:05,297 --> 00:06:08,892
the seven paintings
do have a common factor.

77
00:06:11,571 --> 00:06:16,702
Although one of them was the object
of particularly virulent attacks

78
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:20,739
- we shall see why our parents
were driven

79
00:06:20,914 --> 00:06:22,748
to react in this way -

80
00:06:22,749 --> 00:06:26,742
and although two or three others
among the paintings

81
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:31,348
were held to be
purely and simply shocking,

82
00:06:31,992 --> 00:06:33,960
the fact is

83
00:06:34,361 --> 00:06:38,798
that the scandal centred
on the exhibition as a whole.

84
00:06:39,767 --> 00:06:41,860
On all the paintings,

85
00:06:42,036 --> 00:06:43,765
each and every one of them.

86
00:06:47,142 --> 00:06:48,666
Secondly,

87
00:06:49,778 --> 00:06:54,442
if we closely examine
each painting in turn,

88
00:06:55,083 --> 00:06:59,782
we cannot but be struck
by a number of curious details.

89
00:07:08,898 --> 00:07:11,025
This one, for example.

90
00:07:12,869 --> 00:07:17,067
We see two Crusaders
in the act of playing chess.

91
00:07:18,808 --> 00:07:21,436
The composition is theatrical,
you say.

92
00:07:22,011 --> 00:07:25,778
Yes, but what does that mean,
"theatrical?"

93
00:07:27,384 --> 00:07:28,715
The gestures?

94
00:07:29,653 --> 00:07:31,712
The positioning of the figures?

95
00:07:33,824 --> 00:07:35,815
No, not at all.

96
00:07:35,993 --> 00:07:38,655
The effect you describe
as theatrical

97
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:42,122
derives from one simple detail:

98
00:07:42,667 --> 00:07:43,827
the lighting.

99
00:07:46,604 --> 00:07:52,065
From the two rays of light, one
entering by the window on the right,

100
00:07:52,243 --> 00:07:55,076
the other
by the window on the left.

101
00:08:10,863 --> 00:08:14,731
Which implies
a world with two suns.

102
00:08:18,939 --> 00:08:21,874
This, I might add,
is only one example.

103
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:52,405
To turn now to the two comments

104
00:08:52,573 --> 00:08:54,872
of a more general nature.

105
00:08:56,111 --> 00:08:59,740
Let us consider
the historical context and say,

106
00:09:00,215 --> 00:09:01,580
firstly,

107
00:09:02,618 --> 00:09:06,884
the paintings did not show,
they alluded.

108
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:10,624
And what our fathers saw,

109
00:09:12,729 --> 00:09:15,391
at the point
when the eight powers intervened,

110
00:09:15,632 --> 00:09:17,998
was <i>The Ceremony.

111
00:09:20,136 --> 00:09:23,936
And, at that time in ceremony,
whose ritual is now lost,

112
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:27,999
which today we can scarcely
begin to imagine,

113
00:09:28,945 --> 00:09:31,574
the ceremony

114
00:09:31,749 --> 00:09:34,343
was on the verge of becoming
a matter of common knowledge.

115
00:09:34,518 --> 00:09:35,985
This could not go on.

116
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,312
Which is why,
some months after the exhibition,

117
00:09:39,456 --> 00:09:42,425
police raided the painter's house

118
00:09:42,593 --> 00:09:45,426
and burst in on the ceremony.

119
00:09:45,963 --> 00:09:48,796
And why the authorities
had no alternative.

120
00:09:48,966 --> 00:09:51,834
They had to act quickly.

121
00:09:55,807 --> 00:09:57,035
Secondly,

122
00:09:57,776 --> 00:10:00,973
the painter Tonnerre
defended himself.

123
00:10:01,746 --> 00:10:04,476
From Italy, he made his appeal.

124
00:10:05,617 --> 00:10:09,019
Affectingly, by letter,
he declared his innocence.

125
00:10:10,556 --> 00:10:13,582
Cleverly, he turned
the rules of the game upside down.

126
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:17,893
He declared
that the ceremony did not exist.

127
00:10:19,098 --> 00:10:22,795
That what was known by that name,

128
00:10:23,002 --> 00:10:25,801
what the police saw
with their own eyes

129
00:10:26,173 --> 00:10:29,631
was merely
a re-enactment of his paintings

130
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:32,643
through medium of tableaux vivants,

131
00:10:33,247 --> 00:10:34,680
no more no less.

132
00:10:38,018 --> 00:10:40,316
We can imagine today

133
00:10:40,887 --> 00:10:46,292
what the reaction to this defence
must have been

134
00:10:46,461 --> 00:10:48,986
within the ranks
of the eight powers.

135
00:10:50,798 --> 00:10:55,997
We can guess how some people
must have smiled ironically

136
00:10:56,304 --> 00:10:59,034
and others laughed quite openly.

137
00:10:59,741 --> 00:11:03,678
It was inevitable that our parents
should have reacted in this way.

138
00:11:05,414 --> 00:11:09,145
But we have
other means of analysis today.

139
00:11:12,121 --> 00:11:14,248
And I think I know

140
00:11:14,456 --> 00:11:18,620
what the painter Tonnerre
really meant to say

141
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:21,356
when he protested his innocence.

142
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:24,623
Guilty as sin, he was.

143
00:11:26,269 --> 00:11:28,362
What a terrible revelation.

144
00:11:33,643 --> 00:11:36,339
They <i>were</i> the ceremony.

145
00:11:37,981 --> 00:11:39,506
<i>And yet...

146
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:42,282
The paintings do not show,
they allude.

147
00:11:43,688 --> 00:11:44,950
The paintings...

148
00:11:46,791 --> 00:11:50,090
re-enacted through the medium
of tableaux vivants

149
00:11:50,962 --> 00:11:53,294
do not allude.

150
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:57,528
They show.

151
00:12:32,906 --> 00:12:34,841
<i>After opening the door

152
00:12:35,209 --> 00:12:37,575
<i>the collector shows us</i>
<i>into a drawing-room

153
00:12:37,745 --> 00:12:39,736
<i>overlooking a large garden.

154
00:13:23,759 --> 00:13:25,693
<i>He approaches the window.

155
00:13:26,963 --> 00:13:31,230
<i>With the aid of binoculars,</i>
<i>we can see at the foot of the garden

156
00:13:32,002 --> 00:13:36,564
<i>the reproduction of a mythological</i>
<i>scene in a tableau vivant.

157
00:13:42,212 --> 00:13:43,839
<i>Near a lake,

158
00:13:44,214 --> 00:13:47,207
<i>the Huntress muses with her bow.

159
00:13:47,618 --> 00:13:49,586
<i>Sheltered by the foliage,

160
00:13:50,221 --> 00:13:54,715
<i>Actaeon's eyes</i>
<i>waver between this vision of Diana

161
00:13:56,227 --> 00:13:58,422
<i>and a glimpse of his prey.

162
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:56,289
<i>Is the third figure</i>
<i>really necessary?

163
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,922
<i>Why this third person?

164
00:15:03,665 --> 00:15:05,860
<i>And why does he hold a mirror?

165
00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:18,371
Well, the mirror you mention

166
00:15:18,548 --> 00:15:20,880
would have been to dazzle the prey.

167
00:15:21,584 --> 00:15:25,543
In this sense the role of the third
figure in the <i>Diana and Actaeon

168
00:15:25,755 --> 00:15:29,191
would assume
an unexpected importance.

169
00:15:30,226 --> 00:15:33,389
It will indeed have escaped no one
that, extraneous to the scene,

170
00:15:33,563 --> 00:15:37,330
this third figure invades it
purely to watch the watcher.

171
00:15:43,107 --> 00:15:46,342
In another sense,
it is not impossible

172
00:15:46,343 --> 00:15:50,177
that the prey
is none other than Actaeon himself,

173
00:15:50,347 --> 00:15:52,008
metamorphosed as a punishment

174
00:15:52,183 --> 00:15:55,381
for having dared
cast his eye on the goddess.

175
00:16:05,363 --> 00:16:07,558
<i>Y et what is there in this painting

176
00:16:07,732 --> 00:16:11,463
<i>to make us think</i>
<i>it is the first of a series?

177
00:16:13,539 --> 00:16:17,441
<i>What leads us from it</i>
<i>to the one we may consider

178
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:19,271
<i>the next in sequence?

179
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:37,892
At the risk of upsetting
a somewhat facile train of thought,

180
00:16:38,665 --> 00:16:41,964
I would like
to inject a certain doubt.

181
00:16:43,403 --> 00:16:47,396
Suppose the Diana the Huntress
theme were merely a red herring.

182
00:16:47,974 --> 00:16:51,570
Suppose the anomalous
elements were merely snares.

183
00:16:52,413 --> 00:16:56,008
And that the trail
must be sought elsewhere.

184
00:16:56,184 --> 00:16:57,879
A trail indicated

185
00:16:58,052 --> 00:17:01,920
by a detail, minor but nevertheless
exposed to full view.

186
00:17:03,124 --> 00:17:04,921
Let us allow that,

187
00:17:05,093 --> 00:17:08,860
as an absurd piece
of hunting equipment,

188
00:17:09,131 --> 00:17:11,432
the mirror offers a thematic clue

189
00:17:11,433 --> 00:17:13,924
which might further our pursuit.

190
00:17:26,350 --> 00:17:28,341
<i>The collector is asking us

191
00:17:28,451 --> 00:17:30,681
<i>to ignore the narrative element,

192
00:17:30,854 --> 00:17:34,457
<i>the arrangement of objects

193
00:17:34,458 --> 00:17:38,326
<i>and even the object</i>
<i>of the character's scrutiny.

194
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:47,062
Look at the mirror.

195
00:17:47,538 --> 00:17:51,668
The mirror reflects the sun's rays.

196
00:17:52,176 --> 00:17:53,973
Let us trace their direction.

197
00:18:06,258 --> 00:18:09,591
<i>Here we see the sun's rays</i>
<i>reflected by the mirror

198
00:18:09,762 --> 00:18:12,993
<i>and falling onto a basement window.

199
00:18:53,307 --> 00:18:57,505
<i>A game of chess is interrupted</i>
<i>by the arrival of a Crusader.

200
00:18:59,048 --> 00:19:03,314
<i>One then realizes that the sun is</i>
<i>entering by the window on the left

201
00:19:03,452 --> 00:19:07,548
<i>while the same rays, reflected by the</i>
<i>mirror from the preceding painting

202
00:19:07,723 --> 00:19:11,022
<i>are cast on the scene</i>
<i>through the window opposite.

203
00:19:12,627 --> 00:19:17,565
<i>Thus the riddle of the two</i>
<i>contradictory rays is solved.

204
00:19:21,771 --> 00:19:23,568
<i>The Arrival of the Crusader.

205
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:35,350
I think that

206
00:19:35,486 --> 00:19:40,423
the untenable aspect of the theme
will not have escaped anyone.

207
00:19:42,993 --> 00:19:44,585
Whence comes this Crusader?

208
00:19:45,195 --> 00:19:46,594
What does he interrupt?

209
00:19:48,232 --> 00:19:50,894
How, coming directly
from the Crusades,

210
00:19:51,068 --> 00:19:53,867
could he burst in on the scene

211
00:19:54,038 --> 00:19:55,596
and surprise the players?

212
00:19:58,877 --> 00:20:00,572
And these players,

213
00:20:00,612 --> 00:20:03,046
what are they hiding

214
00:20:03,615 --> 00:20:06,641
that they should be surprised
by the arrival

215
00:20:06,818 --> 00:20:08,615
of a new character?

216
00:20:10,221 --> 00:20:11,712
A new character...

217
00:20:32,512 --> 00:20:38,644
The disturbing presence of the page
will, I think, have escaped no one.

218
00:20:39,286 --> 00:20:42,619
The page who makes a great show
of his consternation

219
00:20:42,656 --> 00:20:44,920
before the other characters
in the painting

220
00:20:45,659 --> 00:20:46,717
whereas we,

221
00:20:47,495 --> 00:20:48,723
and we alone,

222
00:20:49,463 --> 00:20:52,261
can glimpse his secret smile.

223
00:20:52,433 --> 00:20:53,900
<i>If we accept

224
00:20:54,068 --> 00:20:57,663
<i>that this painting follows</i>
<i>the preceding one in the series,

225
00:20:58,306 --> 00:21:01,742
<i>which can we take to be the next,

226
00:21:01,909 --> 00:21:03,137
<i>and why?

227
00:21:03,678 --> 00:21:08,241
I think you will have noticed
that the characters are Templars.

228
00:21:08,784 --> 00:21:13,312
As you see, the painter has respected
the hierarchy within the Order.

229
00:21:14,890 --> 00:21:16,915
Let us now consider this hierarchy.

230
00:21:21,330 --> 00:21:23,298
On the lowest level,

231
00:21:23,465 --> 00:21:26,264
almost marginal to the composition,

232
00:21:26,703 --> 00:21:27,795
is the page.

233
00:21:29,272 --> 00:21:32,730
Then the two Templars,
equal before the Grand Master.

234
00:21:37,513 --> 00:21:39,913
Respecting the painter's intentions,

235
00:21:40,083 --> 00:21:42,609
let us carefully observe
the Grand Master.

236
00:21:47,091 --> 00:21:48,752
What is his attitude?

237
00:21:49,326 --> 00:21:52,386
Let us examine
with renewed attention

238
00:21:52,764 --> 00:21:54,789
each detail of his clothes,

239
00:21:55,532 --> 00:21:57,227
the severity of his eye,

240
00:21:57,401 --> 00:21:59,562
the clenched left hand.

241
00:21:59,970 --> 00:22:04,135
Let us accept the astonishing
gesture of his right,

242
00:22:04,310 --> 00:22:07,006
indicating the mirror.

243
00:22:07,412 --> 00:22:10,108
<i>A mirror reflecting what?

244
00:22:10,248 --> 00:22:13,751
<i>The window behind which,</i>
<i>in the first painting,

245
00:22:13,752 --> 00:22:16,243
<i>another mirror reflects the sun

246
00:22:16,421 --> 00:22:18,651
<i>shining through</i>
<i>this painting's window.

247
00:22:18,758 --> 00:22:20,453
Crude conjecture.

248
00:22:20,794 --> 00:22:25,754
<i>Perhaps one might now venture the</i>
<i>hypothesis of a group of paintings

249
00:22:25,865 --> 00:22:30,199
<i>whose interconnection</i>
<i>is ensured by a play of mirrors.

250
00:22:30,370 --> 00:22:31,770
Conjecture.

251
00:22:31,771 --> 00:22:36,140
<i>One might see the painter's oeuvre</i>
<i>as a reflection

252
00:22:36,275 --> 00:22:38,403
<i>on the art of reproduction.

253
00:22:38,579 --> 00:22:42,777
Certainly not. That is not the way
to look at this painting.

254
00:22:44,618 --> 00:22:47,781
The effect must be considered

255
00:22:49,022 --> 00:22:50,887
in a totally different way.

256
00:22:51,058 --> 00:22:52,252
Otherwise

257
00:22:52,793 --> 00:22:55,023
we shall become entangled
in the snare set for us.

258
00:22:56,264 --> 00:22:59,995
In this particular case,
the thing to be considered

259
00:23:00,502 --> 00:23:03,232
is the form of the mirror.

260
00:23:03,405 --> 00:23:07,671
With due care, however,
for therein lies another snare.

261
00:23:08,376 --> 00:23:12,210
We must not linger over
the significance of this form

262
00:23:12,381 --> 00:23:14,282
to the theme.

263
00:23:14,817 --> 00:23:17,479
It is common knowledge,
more common within each day,

264
00:23:17,653 --> 00:23:20,121
that the crescent moon

265
00:23:20,289 --> 00:23:22,883
is a Saracen symbol.

266
00:23:23,292 --> 00:23:27,820
No one can fail to be aware that
the presence of so impious a token

267
00:23:27,864 --> 00:23:30,128
within the Order

268
00:23:30,299 --> 00:23:33,201
is surprising, to say the least.

269
00:23:35,438 --> 00:23:38,134
Today,

270
00:23:39,142 --> 00:23:41,838
though they find it
difficult to accept, everyone knows

271
00:23:41,879 --> 00:23:46,111
that the presence of this token
in the Order was, alas, probable.

272
00:23:46,850 --> 00:23:50,047
But this is of no consequence.
None of this matters.

273
00:23:50,889 --> 00:23:52,856
What matters

274
00:23:52,857 --> 00:23:55,052
is the form itself,

275
00:23:55,226 --> 00:23:57,319
the fact that this crescent

276
00:23:57,495 --> 00:24:00,055
should be reproduced
in another painting

277
00:24:00,832 --> 00:24:03,357
which I now invite you to consider.

278
00:24:15,481 --> 00:24:19,178
<i>A series of paintings</i>
<i>linked by minor details

279
00:24:19,385 --> 00:24:23,446
<i>sometimes skilfully inserted</i>
<i>extraneously to the theme:

280
00:24:25,124 --> 00:24:27,753
<i>the ray of light in the mirror,

281
00:24:28,661 --> 00:24:32,119
<i>the second mirror</i>
<i>in the shape of a crescent.

282
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:35,567
<i>And now...

283
00:24:35,735 --> 00:24:38,704
I would like to draw your attention

284
00:24:38,872 --> 00:24:43,468
to the extreme care with which
the painter has placed the mirror.

285
00:24:50,317 --> 00:24:53,920
So that
it is really impossible to err

286
00:24:53,921 --> 00:24:56,389
in arranging the tableau vivant.

287
00:24:56,824 --> 00:24:59,520
<i>Is such care likely?

288
00:24:59,693 --> 00:25:02,321
What else is the painter's purpose

289
00:25:02,496 --> 00:25:04,624
but to draw our attention

290
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:09,237
to what is reflected in the mirror
when the tableau is arranged?

291
00:25:10,172 --> 00:25:13,164
Look, it is he one sees
reflected in the mirror.

292
00:25:14,943 --> 00:25:18,003
But now let us consider
the lighting effects.

293
00:25:19,581 --> 00:25:22,415
The chiaroscuro, obviously,
is arbitrary.

294
00:25:23,019 --> 00:25:26,511
Why should certain figures,
perhaps not the most important,

295
00:25:26,656 --> 00:25:28,647
be privileged

296
00:25:29,192 --> 00:25:31,854
and others remain a shadow?

297
00:25:32,261 --> 00:25:36,459
But setting aside the lighting,
let us concentrate on the figures.

298
00:25:41,138 --> 00:25:42,537
All becomes clear.

299
00:25:47,745 --> 00:25:50,441
Let us reverse the lighting.

300
00:25:51,615 --> 00:25:55,142
Let what was plunged in shadow
emerge into the light

301
00:25:55,285 --> 00:25:58,744
and what was clearly visible
return to the darkness.

302
00:26:05,663 --> 00:26:06,891
The mask.

303
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:12,001
There is the link
with the next painting.

304
00:26:13,104 --> 00:26:15,004
<i>We must then ask:

305
00:26:15,673 --> 00:26:19,576
<i>which is that painting</i>
<i>and why does the mask lead us to it?

306
00:26:26,185 --> 00:26:30,212
<i>Now the collector explains</i>
<i>that this painting does not exist.

307
00:26:30,389 --> 00:26:32,789
<i>That it is the stolen painting

308
00:26:32,925 --> 00:26:37,022
<i>and that all we know of it</i>
<i>is that there was a mask.

309
00:26:52,045 --> 00:26:56,039
<i>A certain number of problems</i>
<i>now present themselves.

310
00:26:58,219 --> 00:27:02,087
<i>If the previous painting</i>
<i>does indeed lead us to this one,

311
00:27:03,658 --> 00:27:07,059
<i>then obviously there will be</i>
<i>a hiatus in the series.

312
00:27:08,062 --> 00:27:10,030
<i>And with the trail lost,

313
00:27:10,765 --> 00:27:13,530
<i>how can we establish</i>
<i>the order of the paintings?

314
00:27:19,075 --> 00:27:22,340
No one will ever know
what in this painting

315
00:27:22,511 --> 00:27:26,072
was to have led us to the one I
postulate as the next in the series.

316
00:28:12,364 --> 00:28:17,131
<i>Here is the scandalous painting</i>
<i>rejected by the Salon in 1887.

317
00:28:19,337 --> 00:28:22,139
<i>Apparently exhibited in private,

318
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:26,100
<i>it was, inexplicably,</i>
<i>acquired by the state.

319
00:28:33,419 --> 00:28:37,014
What, in this painting,
could have provoked a scandal?

320
00:28:37,657 --> 00:28:41,388
Was it enough simply to show
people of some social prominence

321
00:28:41,561 --> 00:28:44,156
in attitudes which are in fact
quite commonplace

322
00:28:44,531 --> 00:28:49,161
while claiming that they had agreed
to act as models

323
00:28:49,270 --> 00:28:50,601
for the painting?

324
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:54,002
Might this painting

325
00:28:54,675 --> 00:28:58,167
not be interpreted as a means

326
00:28:58,846 --> 00:29:01,179
of stifling the rumours

327
00:29:01,349 --> 00:29:03,943
which lay behind the scandal

328
00:29:04,085 --> 00:29:07,748
and which tarnished the reputation
of a respectable family?

329
00:29:11,025 --> 00:29:13,357
But in that case,
where would the scandal lie?

330
00:29:17,199 --> 00:29:18,666
Maybe...

331
00:29:20,202 --> 00:29:24,195
the fact of having posed
for this scene from family life,

332
00:29:24,974 --> 00:29:27,272
no matter how commonplace
or innocent it be,

333
00:29:27,910 --> 00:29:30,640
maybe this fact in itself

334
00:29:30,813 --> 00:29:34,613
was felt to be totally unacceptable.

335
00:29:36,418 --> 00:29:40,788
In fact, although the scenes
are indeed commonplace,

336
00:29:40,924 --> 00:29:42,289
it is nevertheless true

337
00:29:42,459 --> 00:29:45,223
that the fact
of having exhibited themselves,

338
00:29:45,729 --> 00:29:50,257
the fact of having assembled
the protagonists of a scandal

339
00:29:51,068 --> 00:29:53,229
might be interpreted

340
00:29:53,304 --> 00:29:55,238
as ostentation,

341
00:29:56,241 --> 00:29:58,436
as acknowledging and condoning

342
00:29:58,609 --> 00:30:03,012
what public opinion would have
described as an "unspeakable vice".

343
00:30:03,814 --> 00:30:07,910
But are these scenes
indeed so innocent?

344
00:30:08,552 --> 00:30:10,349
Can we assert

345
00:30:10,521 --> 00:30:14,618
that they are entirely
free from certain obscurities?

346
00:30:16,829 --> 00:30:19,161
Who knows

347
00:30:19,265 --> 00:30:22,666
but that these scenes
reveal aspects of the scandal

348
00:30:22,835 --> 00:30:26,362
instantly recognizable
to the initiated?

349
00:30:30,742 --> 00:30:33,769
There is certainly
something disturbing

350
00:30:33,946 --> 00:30:36,278
about these scenes from daily life.

351
00:30:38,752 --> 00:30:42,916
We may note that in each of them

352
00:30:43,489 --> 00:30:46,458
someone has just committed,

353
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:49,153
or is preparing to commit,

354
00:30:55,536 --> 00:30:58,266
That in both cases,

355
00:30:58,706 --> 00:31:02,972
a third character
is in the act of watching

356
00:31:06,013 --> 00:31:09,745
and that through his air
of frank disapproval, this character

357
00:31:10,685 --> 00:31:12,710
provokes the desire

358
00:31:14,322 --> 00:31:16,813
to commit the forbidden act.

359
00:31:18,526 --> 00:31:23,190
A disapproval
that he displays to the spectator

360
00:31:23,565 --> 00:31:26,500
but conceals from the characters.

361
00:31:26,635 --> 00:31:28,126
Perhaps

362
00:31:28,571 --> 00:31:30,766
in order to guard himself

363
00:31:31,341 --> 00:31:36,335
against any eventual accusation
of complicity.

364
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:42,344
<i>The grouping tells us, however,

365
00:31:43,419 --> 00:31:46,583
<i>that those who have been</i>
<i>discovered, as it were,

366
00:31:47,057 --> 00:31:50,993
<i>are pointedly turning their backs</i>
<i>on the spy.

367
00:31:52,663 --> 00:31:56,622
<i>Knowing this,</i>
<i>and accepting this situation,

368
00:31:56,800 --> 00:32:00,793
<i>the spy therefore</i>
<i>does indeed participate

369
00:32:00,971 --> 00:32:03,462
<i>as an accomplice

370
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:07,008
<i>in the public exposition

371
00:32:07,178 --> 00:32:10,477
<i>of the moments</i>
<i>preceding and following

372
00:32:10,648 --> 00:32:13,173
<i>the reprehensible act.

373
00:32:19,591 --> 00:32:24,393
And since the reprehensible aspect
of this act

374
00:32:25,398 --> 00:32:27,628
resides in the intention,

375
00:32:30,403 --> 00:32:35,102
is not the exposition
of these moments much more so?

376
00:32:38,311 --> 00:32:40,413
Does this not open up

377
00:32:40,414 --> 00:32:44,817
limitless possibilities
for interpretation?

378
00:32:47,053 --> 00:32:49,283
Possibilities

379
00:32:49,890 --> 00:32:52,654
reaching beyond the act itself,

380
00:32:54,428 --> 00:32:59,423
which, as we need not now deny,
did indeed take place.

381
00:33:02,003 --> 00:33:06,440
But was this not enough
to provoke a scandal?

382
00:33:10,445 --> 00:33:11,639
Furthermore,

383
00:33:13,448 --> 00:33:16,474
I should add that these events

384
00:33:17,453 --> 00:33:19,080
and public rumours

385
00:33:19,254 --> 00:33:24,556
have come down to us
by way of a little <i>roman-à-clef.

386
00:33:28,463 --> 00:33:31,330
A brief résumé of this little novel

387
00:33:31,467 --> 00:33:36,462
will give us some idea
of the enormity of the events

388
00:33:36,673 --> 00:33:39,471
which rumour
endeavoured to conceal.

389
00:33:42,779 --> 00:33:45,475
The beginning of the novel

390
00:33:46,516 --> 00:33:49,451
describes a betrothal scene.

391
00:33:57,461 --> 00:34:01,659
Tha Marquise de I. has invited
her friends to a reception

392
00:34:01,799 --> 00:34:04,063
to announce
the engagement of her niece O.

393
00:34:04,268 --> 00:34:05,496
who is also her ward,

394
00:34:05,536 --> 00:34:08,972
to the Marquis de E.,
a friend of the family.

395
00:34:09,573 --> 00:34:15,103
The Marquise is presented from
the outset as a domineering woman

396
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:17,771
swayed by vaulting ambition.

397
00:34:17,949 --> 00:34:21,578
The anonymous author makes no secret
of his sympathy for the Marquis,

398
00:34:22,621 --> 00:34:26,216
portrayed as a man of thirty-five,

399
00:34:26,391 --> 00:34:28,359
kindly by nature

400
00:34:28,527 --> 00:34:31,019
and forced by the ruin of his family

401
00:34:31,197 --> 00:34:34,189
into a marriage of convenience.

402
00:34:35,167 --> 00:34:37,135
The Marquis is shown

403
00:34:37,303 --> 00:34:39,567
as the victim of a cunning plot

404
00:34:39,739 --> 00:34:43,175
devised entirely
by the Marquise de I.

405
00:34:43,942 --> 00:34:45,933
At the end of the first chapter

406
00:34:46,112 --> 00:34:50,174
the Marquise
suspects her niece's betrothed

407
00:34:50,350 --> 00:34:52,318
of a questionable interest

408
00:34:52,519 --> 00:34:56,546
in young L.,
her nephew and ward.

409
00:34:56,657 --> 00:35:00,559
The latter is described
as a boy of very winning ways

410
00:35:00,727 --> 00:35:05,755
not entirely unaware of the interest
he has awakened in the Marquis de E.

411
00:35:06,233 --> 00:35:11,001
The author has earlier informed us
that the Marquise had planned

412
00:35:11,172 --> 00:35:15,131
to marry the two cousins,
the young L. and the young O.,

413
00:35:15,276 --> 00:35:19,736
thus uniting the fortunes of the
collateral branches of the family.

414
00:35:20,581 --> 00:35:22,811
In securing her niece's hand,

415
00:35:22,984 --> 00:35:27,581
the Marquis de E. spoiled her plan.

416
00:35:28,357 --> 00:35:33,294
But her discovery of the interest
shown in the boy by the Marquis

417
00:35:33,462 --> 00:35:36,590
leads her
to devise the sinister plot

418
00:35:36,699 --> 00:35:39,600
which is revealed in Chapter Two.

419
00:35:40,002 --> 00:35:41,401
This is

420
00:35:41,570 --> 00:35:46,372
to encourage the relationship
between the Marquis and young L.

421
00:35:46,509 --> 00:35:48,841
in order to provoke a scandal

422
00:35:49,012 --> 00:35:52,641
which, by ruining
the reputation of the Marquis,

423
00:35:52,816 --> 00:35:55,614
would make impossible the marriage

424
00:35:55,685 --> 00:35:57,516
to the girl O.

425
00:35:58,454 --> 00:36:01,082
At this point,
matters are complicated

426
00:36:01,257 --> 00:36:03,886
by the entry of a new character,

427
00:36:04,194 --> 00:36:06,492
El Señor de H.,

428
00:36:06,630 --> 00:36:09,599
Knight of the Order of Malta

429
00:36:09,633 --> 00:36:13,399
and Spanish envoy to the Holy See.

430
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:17,805
Since this person
is also attracted by young L.,

431
00:36:17,942 --> 00:36:22,646
he provokes
the jealousy and rivalry

432
00:36:22,647 --> 00:36:24,308
of the Marquis de E.

433
00:36:25,049 --> 00:36:29,418
E. and H.,
being friends of long standing

434
00:36:29,554 --> 00:36:33,320
in view of their affiliation
to the same secret society,

435
00:36:35,361 --> 00:36:39,423
agree to settle their
quarrel through a game of chess

436
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:43,765
with the loser undertaking

437
00:36:43,937 --> 00:36:49,068
to renounce all claim to the
hypothetical favours of the boy L.

438
00:36:51,844 --> 00:36:55,905
The betrothed girl
happens to witness this scene.

439
00:36:56,283 --> 00:37:00,686
Perceiving the disquieting
implications of the scene

440
00:37:00,687 --> 00:37:03,520
without really understanding,

441
00:37:03,690 --> 00:37:07,456
she tells to her aunt.

442
00:37:07,694 --> 00:37:11,926
The latter, we learn in Chapter
Four, is now resolved to act.

443
00:37:13,367 --> 00:37:17,600
In pursuance of her plan,
she therefore summons the Marquis.

444
00:37:18,206 --> 00:37:20,868
Arriving at the appointed place,

445
00:37:21,376 --> 00:37:24,903
the Marquis finds the Marquise
partially unclothed

446
00:37:25,079 --> 00:37:28,207
challengingly exhibiting herself
before his eyes.

447
00:37:28,383 --> 00:37:32,149
Understanding the allusion

448
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:35,017
to his lack of interest
in the fair sex,

449
00:37:35,190 --> 00:37:39,149
he loses his temper
and offers to strike her.

450
00:37:39,828 --> 00:37:43,389
The girl, witnessing the scene,

451
00:37:43,565 --> 00:37:45,999
assumes it to be
a lovers' quarrel.

452
00:37:46,168 --> 00:37:49,535
Convinced that she is betrayed,
she determines

453
00:37:49,737 --> 00:37:51,296
to confront her aunt.

454
00:37:51,807 --> 00:37:53,741
In Chapter Five,

455
00:37:54,010 --> 00:37:56,535
realizing that she has aroused

456
00:37:56,713 --> 00:38:00,308
new feelings between the betrothed,

457
00:38:00,450 --> 00:38:05,114
the Marquise summons the girl O.
to a clandestine meeting.

458
00:38:06,023 --> 00:38:09,425
At this meeting,
the Marquise apprises the girl

459
00:38:09,594 --> 00:38:12,119
of her fiancé's unnatural tastes.

460
00:38:13,331 --> 00:38:17,767
Seeing this revelation
as a mere stratagem

461
00:38:17,768 --> 00:38:20,965
to part her from him,

462
00:38:21,772 --> 00:38:23,467
the girl reacts violently.

463
00:38:24,008 --> 00:38:27,535
Their quarrel is witnessed by H.

464
00:38:27,679 --> 00:38:32,946
who decides to propose
an alliance with the Marquise

465
00:38:33,085 --> 00:38:36,782
with a view to alienating the boy L.
from the Marquis.

466
00:38:37,356 --> 00:38:40,757
Thus it is that,
for the fist time in the story,

467
00:38:40,792 --> 00:38:43,693
young L. takes the initiative

468
00:38:43,795 --> 00:38:46,697
and confesses his love
to the Marquise.

469
00:38:47,266 --> 00:38:52,101
This scene is witnessed by the girl,
now doubly jealous of her aunt

470
00:38:52,672 --> 00:38:54,902
but unable to choose in her heart

471
00:38:55,074 --> 00:38:58,840
between young L. and the Marquis.

472
00:38:59,012 --> 00:39:01,606
She confides in her fiancé.

473
00:39:02,482 --> 00:39:07,182
These revelations cause the Marquis
to fall into a deep depression

474
00:39:07,321 --> 00:39:11,257
intensified
when he witnesses a strange scene

475
00:39:11,425 --> 00:39:14,189
between young L. and H.

476
00:39:14,795 --> 00:39:15,989
In this scene,

477
00:39:16,130 --> 00:39:19,429
H., a stag's head in his hand,

478
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:24,436
is attempting to persuade the boy
to pose as Diana the Huntress.

479
00:39:26,674 --> 00:39:29,108
The Marquis, bursting in the scene,

480
00:39:29,478 --> 00:39:32,606
provokes his friend H. to anger.

481
00:39:32,747 --> 00:39:36,843
He reproaches him
with his lack of integrity

482
00:39:37,118 --> 00:39:40,485
in failing to keep his promise
to renounce the boy.

483
00:39:41,257 --> 00:39:42,884
Intervening

484
00:39:43,059 --> 00:39:47,052
to reproach E. for having
abandoned him to a foreigner,

485
00:39:47,229 --> 00:39:48,856
the boy aggravates the quarrel.

486
00:39:49,265 --> 00:39:50,857
In Chapter Ten,

487
00:39:50,933 --> 00:39:54,869
we come to the scene
of the duel between E. and H.

488
00:39:54,936 --> 00:39:57,769
during the course of which young L.

489
00:39:57,873 --> 00:40:01,366
is simultaneously arbiter, second,

490
00:40:01,545 --> 00:40:04,036
sponsor and occasion of the duel.

491
00:40:06,149 --> 00:40:12,145
In despair, believing herself the
cause of the duel, O. intervenes.

492
00:40:12,322 --> 00:40:15,655
While the Marquise
watches from a distance,

493
00:40:15,792 --> 00:40:20,093
at last savouring the scandal
she has anticipated for months.

494
00:40:21,299 --> 00:40:25,292
Unfortunately,
both adversaries miss their mark

495
00:40:25,703 --> 00:40:30,197
and H.'s bullet
accidentally wounds the girl O.

496
00:40:33,078 --> 00:40:36,207
Police arrest the protagonists

497
00:40:36,381 --> 00:40:39,475
but intervention of E.'s family

498
00:40:39,618 --> 00:40:42,416
secures their prompt release.

499
00:40:48,827 --> 00:40:51,387
Accused of attempted homicide

500
00:40:51,562 --> 00:40:54,794
and obliged to plead insanity

501
00:40:55,335 --> 00:40:57,098
to escape the law,

502
00:40:57,237 --> 00:41:00,832
H. is confined to an asylum
not far from Paris.

503
00:41:02,942 --> 00:41:04,569
In the penultimate chapter,

504
00:41:04,744 --> 00:41:08,942
we find the girl O.
affected by her wound.

505
00:41:09,516 --> 00:41:12,645
In the delirium of her fever

506
00:41:12,820 --> 00:41:15,448
she sees herself as St. Theresa

507
00:41:15,623 --> 00:41:19,753
and her cousin as the angel
conducting her to heaven.

508
00:41:20,194 --> 00:41:21,957
The Marquis visits her,

509
00:41:22,329 --> 00:41:25,264
but seeing him
as the devil himself,

510
00:41:25,432 --> 00:41:27,229
she repulses him violently.

511
00:41:27,935 --> 00:41:29,869
In renewed delirium,

512
00:41:29,970 --> 00:41:33,873
now imagining herself
to be a Babylonian harlot,

513
00:41:33,975 --> 00:41:37,274
young O. repulses
her angel of redemption

514
00:41:37,446 --> 00:41:41,348
and still seeing the Marquis
as the devil, implores him

515
00:41:41,483 --> 00:41:43,747
to conduct her to hell

516
00:41:43,885 --> 00:41:48,652
thus obeying a command
given by St Theresa.

517
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:54,059
Following
a long and grievous convalescence,

518
00:41:54,230 --> 00:41:57,631
O. forgives the Marquis de E.

519
00:42:11,014 --> 00:42:15,781
We find all the characters
assembled at a family gathering.

520
00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:19,512
Suddenly Señor H. reappears,

521
00:42:20,691 --> 00:42:25,028
having fled the asylum with the aid
of members of the secret society,

522
00:42:25,029 --> 00:42:26,861
alerted by the Marquise.

523
00:42:27,899 --> 00:42:30,663
H. publicly accuses E.

524
00:42:30,836 --> 00:42:33,037
of failing to keep his promise

525
00:42:33,038 --> 00:42:35,199
by continuing to importune young L.

526
00:42:36,041 --> 00:42:37,941
The latter intervenes

527
00:42:38,042 --> 00:42:41,273
to accuse H.
of alienating him from his aunt.

528
00:42:42,481 --> 00:42:47,442
The girl O., finally grasping
the situation, breaks with E.

529
00:42:48,521 --> 00:42:52,457
But the story does not end
as the Marquise would have wished.

530
00:42:53,058 --> 00:42:57,324
That very night, the boy L.
is carried off by H.

531
00:42:57,664 --> 00:43:00,258
aided by members of the sect

532
00:43:00,433 --> 00:43:06,339
and taken to their mansion
in the rue de la Pompe.

533
00:43:07,741 --> 00:43:09,902
Promptly alerted by the Marquise,

534
00:43:10,077 --> 00:43:12,841
the police intervene

535
00:43:12,979 --> 00:43:17,083
and interrupt a strange ceremony
involving young L.

536
00:43:17,084 --> 00:43:20,076
as both priest and sacrifice.

537
00:43:21,088 --> 00:43:24,080
The protagonists
all find themselves in prison

538
00:43:24,192 --> 00:43:28,094
and are released
on payment of a substantial bail.

539
00:43:28,863 --> 00:43:32,492
Young L.
is found hanged in his cell

540
00:43:32,667 --> 00:43:37,195
and the talk is either of suicide
or a crime.

541
00:43:42,110 --> 00:43:47,309
<i>Can we accept that what lies behind</i>
<i>these paintings is merely a novel?

542
00:43:48,116 --> 00:43:50,880
<i>We can then say</i>
<i>that the protagonists

543
00:43:51,019 --> 00:43:53,613
<i>simply portrayed the novel's theme

544
00:43:53,789 --> 00:43:56,519
<i>as if it were a ceremony.

545
00:43:59,128 --> 00:44:02,131
We have not yet seen or said
everything.

546
00:44:02,132 --> 00:44:03,929
Two paintings remain.

547
00:44:05,001 --> 00:44:08,334
<i>We have travelled a difficult road</i>
<i>to come this far.

548
00:44:10,307 --> 00:44:13,799
<i>Will we manage</i>
<i>to travel it to the end?

549
00:44:15,413 --> 00:44:20,316
<i>Will we remember all the arguments</i>
<i>and counter-arguments developed?

550
00:44:23,153 --> 00:44:26,179
<i>Will we have time</i>
<i>to expound other doubts,

551
00:44:26,791 --> 00:44:30,591
<i>to point out the innumerable</i>
<i>thematic clues to the intrigue?

552
00:44:40,138 --> 00:44:42,333
In this painting we may perceive

553
00:44:42,474 --> 00:44:46,001
certain elements
of previous paintings.

554
00:44:58,191 --> 00:45:00,182
This group, for instance,

555
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:03,386
recalls the painting
<i>Tortures of the Inquisition.

556
00:45:05,031 --> 00:45:07,192
This one, <i>The Game of Chess.

557
00:45:07,833 --> 00:45:10,564
This character
evokes <i>Diana the Huntress.

558
00:45:13,007 --> 00:45:15,237
<i>But the other characters?

559
00:45:15,409 --> 00:45:18,708
<i>The naked women?</i>
<i>The clowns and demons?

560
00:45:21,014 --> 00:45:23,414
We shall explain them

561
00:45:23,584 --> 00:45:26,052
through the hypothesis
of the stolen painting.

562
00:45:27,321 --> 00:45:30,314
<i>The collector</i>
<i>once again requires us

563
00:45:30,492 --> 00:45:32,517
<i>to forget the thematic clue

564
00:45:32,694 --> 00:45:35,595
<i>and to concentrate</i>
<i>on the composition.

565
00:45:35,730 --> 00:45:38,324
In this painting,
as in the preceding ones,

566
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:41,196
characters are grouped in threes.

567
00:45:42,237 --> 00:45:47,266
Each group of three recalls a scene
from an earlier painting,

568
00:45:48,077 --> 00:45:51,740
although there is, so to speak,
no linking story.

569
00:46:01,457 --> 00:46:04,017
<i>Let us turn our minds</i>
<i>back to the previous painting.

570
00:46:05,262 --> 00:46:08,425
<i>From there,</i>
<i>let us follow the thematic clue.

571
00:46:09,265 --> 00:46:13,929
<i>We see that the story</i>
<i>moves from painting to painting

572
00:46:14,304 --> 00:46:15,703
<i>like the hands of a watch.

573
00:46:18,241 --> 00:46:23,270
<i>Let us ask where this series of</i>
<i>scenes from family life is taking us.

574
00:46:32,123 --> 00:46:37,459
<i>We will now examine the characters</i>
<i>of the scandalous painting.

575
00:46:38,263 --> 00:46:39,730
<i>Let us trace

576
00:46:39,897 --> 00:46:43,299
<i>each character's gestures,</i>
<i>painting by painting.

577
00:46:46,873 --> 00:46:51,310
<i>We now see that, in moving</i>
<i>from one painting to the next,

578
00:46:52,311 --> 00:46:55,542
<i>the characters</i>
<i>are slowly completing the circle,

579
00:46:56,315 --> 00:46:57,612
<i>each in his own way.

580
00:47:17,436 --> 00:47:20,338
The circle is not perfect,
you will say.

581
00:47:21,042 --> 00:47:24,341
But what we have here
are really curves

582
00:47:24,378 --> 00:47:29,509
which form circles of unequal
diameter if completed by imagination.

583
00:47:30,751 --> 00:47:35,586
And these circles may be classified
roughly in three groups,

584
00:47:36,358 --> 00:47:38,622
of decreasing importance.

585
00:47:38,794 --> 00:47:42,753
And the circles of each group
are combined,

586
00:47:43,398 --> 00:47:46,993
their respective product is,
of course, a sphere.

587
00:47:47,169 --> 00:47:51,572
Spheres which we can in turn imagine
as combined or not

588
00:47:51,739 --> 00:47:53,570
but which still evoke spheres.

589
00:47:53,742 --> 00:47:57,042
<i>But any movement</i>
<i>effected by a human being

590
00:47:57,213 --> 00:48:01,616
<i>leaves an imaginary trace</i>
<i>comparable to a curve.

591
00:48:01,784 --> 00:48:03,775
We shall return to this.

592
00:48:29,413 --> 00:48:33,407
<i>Curved lines which suggest circles.

593
00:48:34,652 --> 00:48:36,779
<i>Circles leading to the sphere.

594
00:48:38,690 --> 00:48:43,389
<i>The blazing sphere which dominates</i>
<i>the last painting in the series.

595
00:48:48,999 --> 00:48:50,592
Baphomet,

596
00:48:51,437 --> 00:48:53,803
an androgynous demon.

597
00:48:54,439 --> 00:48:56,873
The principle of non-definition.

598
00:48:58,244 --> 00:48:59,836
In defiance of time.

599
00:49:01,881 --> 00:49:04,907
An immaculate body without soul

600
00:49:05,451 --> 00:49:10,913
caressed by the breezes which are
wandering, bodiless souls.

601
00:49:12,893 --> 00:49:15,453
Assailed through the seven orifices

602
00:49:16,330 --> 00:49:20,630
by wandering souls
seeking their reincarnation.

603
00:49:21,468 --> 00:49:22,833
Souls

604
00:49:23,637 --> 00:49:27,472
already despairing
of the day of resurrection.

605
00:49:32,113 --> 00:49:36,447
Is this not what we have seen
repeated in all the paintings?

606
00:49:37,051 --> 00:49:40,487
Is it not
the very heart of the paintings,

607
00:49:41,156 --> 00:49:42,589
their occult theme?

608
00:49:43,491 --> 00:49:45,551
The real cause of the scandal?

609
00:49:47,496 --> 00:49:49,726
Worshipped by the Templars,

610
00:49:49,899 --> 00:49:52,959
religion within a religion
of a state within a state?

611
00:49:54,503 --> 00:49:56,562
Still worshipped today

612
00:49:56,739 --> 00:49:58,866
in secret ceremonies

613
00:49:59,007 --> 00:50:01,771
masquerading as mere debauches.

614
00:50:04,079 --> 00:50:07,515
<i>So that is the real reason</i>
<i>for the scandal?

615
00:50:07,550 --> 00:50:08,983
It is.

616
00:50:09,185 --> 00:50:13,121
<i>But if all the paintings portray</i>
<i>the cult of the androgyne,

617
00:50:13,290 --> 00:50:16,316
<i>what is the role of the painting</i>
Diana the Huntress<i>?

618
00:50:16,493 --> 00:50:19,519
I shall explain through the
hypothesis of the stolen painting.

619
00:51:16,590 --> 00:51:19,889
<i>The collector, visibly exhausted,

620
00:51:20,060 --> 00:51:22,620
<i>now invites us to consider

621
00:51:22,795 --> 00:51:25,423
<i>the Tonnerres</i>
<i>from a fresh standpoint.

622
00:52:21,292 --> 00:52:23,556
What you have seen

623
00:52:24,294 --> 00:52:28,629
are merely some of the ideas
these paintings have inspired in me

624
00:52:28,666 --> 00:52:30,361
over the years.

625
00:52:32,470 --> 00:52:35,496
Hence, perhaps,
their fragmentary nature.

626
00:52:38,276 --> 00:52:41,040
But today...

627
00:52:42,647 --> 00:52:45,673
now that I have once again

628
00:52:45,851 --> 00:52:49,117
recreated <i>The Ceremony</i> for you,

629
00:52:50,323 --> 00:52:52,257
a doubt assails me.

630
00:52:54,660 --> 00:52:56,127
And I ask myself

631
00:52:56,294 --> 00:53:00,458
if the effort was worthwhile.

632
00:53:01,767 --> 00:53:03,701
I have, I confess, many doubts.

633
00:53:06,473 --> 00:53:09,738
The enigma has been solved,
certainly,

634
00:53:10,309 --> 00:53:12,334
and that should satisfy us.

635
00:53:14,147 --> 00:53:16,513
But we are not satisfied.

636
00:53:21,087 --> 00:53:24,353
What matters to us,

637
00:53:25,026 --> 00:53:26,721
we humble mortals,

638
00:53:27,495 --> 00:53:31,898
that the authorities should fear
the celebration of a cult

639
00:53:32,433 --> 00:53:35,630
because this cult is the expression

640
00:53:35,970 --> 00:53:38,404
of something more vast?

641
00:53:41,376 --> 00:53:43,709
What matters to us,

642
00:53:44,246 --> 00:53:47,340
we humble creatures of this world,

643
00:53:49,551 --> 00:53:52,111
if this "something more vast"

644
00:53:52,254 --> 00:53:56,213
be a revival
of the cult of Mithras?

645
00:54:01,130 --> 00:54:05,430
Can we summon interest in the fact

646
00:54:06,336 --> 00:54:08,270
that a cult like this

647
00:54:09,005 --> 00:54:13,635
is, in effect, the equivalent
of military discipline?

648
00:54:16,546 --> 00:54:19,380
And that military manoeuvres,

649
00:54:19,550 --> 00:54:22,610
pomp and parades

650
00:54:23,054 --> 00:54:26,546
are merely
one aspect of the ceremony

651
00:54:26,690 --> 00:54:29,022
these paintings complete.

652
00:54:32,063 --> 00:54:35,362
Can we feel fear

653
00:54:35,866 --> 00:54:39,769
at the revelation that military life

654
00:54:39,870 --> 00:54:42,668
and all that these paintings
represent

655
00:54:42,807 --> 00:54:45,605
<i>are</i> the ceremony

656
00:54:46,811 --> 00:54:49,678
whose solemn expression

657
00:54:50,015 --> 00:54:55,044
signifies the mutual annihilation
of the celebrants...

658
00:54:56,889 --> 00:54:58,413
total war?

659
00:55:02,295 --> 00:55:04,320
No, I do not think so.

660
00:55:05,197 --> 00:55:06,824
I do not think so.

661
00:55:08,267 --> 00:55:13,000
Any such elucidation
would take too long for us to grasp.

662
00:55:14,408 --> 00:55:15,636
Furthermore,

663
00:55:16,710 --> 00:55:19,270
the cunning stratagem whereby

664
00:55:19,445 --> 00:55:22,744
it is divided
in three superimposed riddles

665
00:55:23,250 --> 00:55:25,844
would hardly speed us

666
00:55:26,453 --> 00:55:28,717
towards our goal.

667
00:55:30,724 --> 00:55:32,352
And yet,

668
00:55:33,528 --> 00:55:36,861
I know that something
will be retained.

669
00:55:38,833 --> 00:55:40,061
I know

670
00:55:40,868 --> 00:55:42,335
that at this very moment

671
00:55:42,870 --> 00:55:46,863
the paintings are beginning
to fade from memory.

672
00:55:49,377 --> 00:55:54,645
I know that the snare
set by the painter Tonnerre

673
00:55:55,450 --> 00:55:57,884
is beginning to show results.

674
00:56:11,167 --> 00:56:13,135
The gestures,

675
00:56:13,903 --> 00:56:18,499
the same gestures repeated
from painting to painting

676
00:56:19,610 --> 00:56:21,009
loom up,

677
00:56:21,977 --> 00:56:23,410
in isolation,

678
00:56:24,581 --> 00:56:27,346
to better efface
the paintings themselves

679
00:56:28,119 --> 00:56:29,916
and what they represent.

680
00:56:31,922 --> 00:56:33,150
So,

681
00:56:33,924 --> 00:56:35,391
let us forget.

682
00:56:37,128 --> 00:56:38,527
Let us allow

683
00:56:39,430 --> 00:56:41,398
the paintings to fade...

684
00:56:42,834 --> 00:56:44,096
to vanish...

685
00:56:45,437 --> 00:56:46,836
to vanish...

686
00:56:47,939 --> 00:56:50,806
so that all that remains

687
00:56:50,942 --> 00:56:54,571
is the isolated gestures,

688
00:56:56,514 --> 00:56:59,244
the gestures of <i>The Ceremony.

689
00:57:01,386 --> 00:57:02,911
<i>So saying,

690
00:57:03,190 --> 00:57:06,956
<i>the collector</i>
<i>courteously shows us to the door.

691
01:03:21,187 --> 01:03:24,213
