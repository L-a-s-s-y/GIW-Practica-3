- I can't even do this.
- So what can we do?

16
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:13,880
We can't do anything.

17
00:02:18,013 --> 00:02:20,505
What are you doing?

18
00:02:20,641 --> 00:02:24,179
Being a virgin. I look
like a virgin, don't I?

19
00:02:26,938 --> 00:02:30,181
- I am a virgin!
- I see.

20
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:34,026
Can you understand that?

21
00:02:34,321 --> 00:02:36,858
Nobody understands anything.

22
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,282
Nobody understands us!

23
00:02:41,745 --> 00:02:45,113
Everything's going
bad in this world.

24
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:50,751
- What do you mean, everything?
- Well, everything...

25
00:02:52,964 --> 00:02:54,955
In this world...

26
00:02:56,885 --> 00:02:58,876
You know what?

27
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:02,429
- If everything's going bad...
- so...

28
00:03:03,642 --> 00:03:05,508
we're going...

29
00:03:05,644 --> 00:03:08,136
bad... as...

30
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:10,854
- well...
- Right!

31
00:03:10,982 --> 00:03:13,314
Does it matter?

32
00:03:13,402 --> 00:03:15,814
It doesn't matter.

33
00:04:02,993 --> 00:04:05,325
What's that you've got?

34
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:08,867
What are you chewing? Show me!

35
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:33,596
What are you doing?

36
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:36,727
Is anything out there?

37
00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:05,544
Come on.

38
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:11,592
Where to?

39
00:05:11,686 --> 00:05:14,929
Someplace where
something's going on.

40
00:05:17,818 --> 00:05:19,684
What next?

41
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:50,799
You should've been here yesterday.
It was such fun.

42
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:55,678
We can't manage everything.

43
00:05:59,734 --> 00:06:03,193
We're always so busy.

44
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:16,873
What do you think of that?

45
00:06:17,669 --> 00:06:21,378
Not bad. But not like that now.

46
00:06:22,841 --> 00:06:24,707
Let's have a look.

47
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:31,471
Yeah...

48
00:06:33,602 --> 00:06:35,764
Yeah...

49
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:40,514
OK, I'm going.

50
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:52,363
- At least have some wine.
- I don't know.

51
00:06:52,454 --> 00:06:58,291
- Go on. What's on the wine list?
- Something special for you?

52
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:04,672
- A bottle of wine?
- No, just a glass.

53
00:07:12,807 --> 00:07:14,673
That's our Jarmila!

54
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:18,101
Don't look!

55
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:20,262
So you're here?

56
00:07:20,732 --> 00:07:22,814
It's nice here, isn't it?

57
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:26,435
So it's you?

58
00:07:30,075 --> 00:07:35,411
My sister told me lots about you.
Won't you introduce me?

59
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:40,408
- I am the sister.
- Jarmila!

60
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:51,882
- Will the young lady be dining?
- And wining as well.

61
00:07:54,391 --> 00:07:56,382
Another glass, please.

62
00:07:57,102 --> 00:07:59,810
- Have you got snails?
- We don't.

63
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:05,357
- Nor rabbit?
- They've got venison.

64
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:09,941
No, that's too much. I
only want something small.

65
00:08:12,117 --> 00:08:17,032
I'll have the chicken, then.
Is it big enough? One moment.

66
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:23,534
I'll have something
small to start with.

67
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:28,543
- Would you like some cakes?
- No, thank you. You have some.

68
00:08:28,842 --> 00:08:30,708
Don't know...

69
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:34,420
Yes, we'll have that and that.

70
00:08:35,306 --> 00:08:37,513
Don't be silly, have some.

71
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:51,190
She's scared she'll get fat.

72
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:00,282
Why aren't you eating?

73
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:19,674
- Are you on a diet?
- Well, you see...

74
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:27,182
- I couldn't bear that.
- I don't like sweet things.

75
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:31,856
I love food.

76
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:50,412
I love eating.

77
00:09:53,885 --> 00:09:55,751
It's delicious.

78
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:13,110
- Have you got any little ones?
- I beg your pardon!

79
00:10:15,532 --> 00:10:17,773
Isn't it hot here?

80
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:22,368
I'd say so. Here it is!

81
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:28,701
- How old are you?
- Why do you want to know?

82
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:30,786
Don't take it like that.

83
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:37,085
Do you smoke? Would you
offer me a cigarette?

84
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:44,133
I haven't finished yet!
You're spoiling her.

85
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:49,222
Do you have any filter-tips?
There you are, such filth...

86
00:10:55,822 --> 00:10:58,439
The spoons are so heavy.

87
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:03,318
What time is your train?

88
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:10,788
In about 40 minutes!

89
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:15,497
40 minutes? Let's
hurry up, then.

90
00:11:16,301 --> 00:11:18,167
The bill, please.

91
00:11:21,181 --> 00:11:23,673
We'll be fine if we take a taxi.

92
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:38,779
- At least it hasn't gone yet.
- Would you get a paper for me?

93
00:11:46,915 --> 00:11:48,997
I just don't understand.

94
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:55,041
- I told her you were an uncle...
- What do you mean, uncle?

95
00:11:55,757 --> 00:12:00,547
- My boyfriend's uncle...
- What do you mean, boyfriend?

96
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:02,920
He lives in Jičín...

97
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:11,307
- She'll tell on me!
- What do you mean?

98
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:17,981
That I go around with old men!

99
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:28,612
- Here you are.
- Thank you and goodbye.

100
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:30,656
- Bye!
- Bye!

101
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:07,029
Sorry. He didn't want
to leave on his own.

102
00:13:07,954 --> 00:13:09,820
Oh, my God.

103
00:13:10,665 --> 00:13:14,283
Where does the train stop first?

104
00:13:17,171 --> 00:13:19,037
This one?

105
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:21,964
Probably at the next stop.

106
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:26,136
I thought it was the
Orient Express!

107
00:13:27,265 --> 00:13:31,350
Never mind. Bohemia's
beautiful too.

108
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:33,639
My Bohemia...

109
00:20:35,693 --> 00:20:38,276
And who's going to pay for this?

110
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:40,565
Dead men tell no tales!

111
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:48,111
Only you forgot to
close the window!

112
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:01,294
You've got bandy legs.

113
00:21:01,594 --> 00:21:06,179
Don't you know, this is the
essence of my personality?

114
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:09,011
Tie your legs up at the knees.

115
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:20,230
You've got to get some exercise.
Get me some water.

116
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:47,636
Rehabilitation centre.

117
00:21:48,182 --> 00:21:50,423
Die! Die! Die!

118
00:22:00,361 --> 00:22:03,353
Die! Die! Die!

119
00:22:13,415 --> 00:22:15,281
Can't you smell it?

120
00:22:16,043 --> 00:22:19,161
- What?
- How volatile life is!

121
00:22:20,089 --> 00:22:22,706
Isn't it nice to be home?

122
00:22:24,844 --> 00:22:29,634
- Why keep talking about it?
- Tell me it's nice to be home.

123
00:22:34,812 --> 00:22:37,725
- So you mind!
- No, I don't mind.

124
00:22:40,734 --> 00:22:42,600
80, say it's great.

125
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:48,481
I'll say what I like.

126
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:01,623
Maybe I'll even have a piano.

127
00:23:11,807 --> 00:23:14,014
When I run around like you.

128
00:23:16,687 --> 00:23:18,519
What?

129
00:23:21,609 --> 00:23:23,520
Who's running around?

130
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:30,694
We've gone bad, haven't we?

131
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:37,572
And I've got a job, you nitwit!

132
00:23:46,342 --> 00:23:48,925
You've spilt milk on yourself!

133
00:23:56,977 --> 00:23:58,843
But you look smart!

134
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:29,566
Why do you want us to go bad?

135
00:25:32,781 --> 00:25:36,991
- You know we're still maturing.
- How do you mean?

136
00:25:41,707 --> 00:25:44,745
- When is it going?
- When is what going?

137
00:25:44,835 --> 00:25:48,328
Let me fix that hanky of yours.

138
00:25:49,715 --> 00:25:52,924
Marcelka told me you
were an explorer.

139
00:25:55,429 --> 00:25:59,764
Hanky, hanky, big white hanky!

140
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:03,593
Our daddy would think
you're a baddy!

141
00:26:04,438 --> 00:26:06,645
That's too much!

142
00:26:13,614 --> 00:26:18,609
Don't take it like that. She's
had meningitis since birth.

143
00:26:21,121 --> 00:26:23,032
And what about Blanka?

144
00:26:26,668 --> 00:26:32,038
- How old's your old woman?
- I've had just about enough!

145
00:26:48,774 --> 00:26:52,688
This is the fifth one to leave!
I'm fed up.

146
00:26:54,822 --> 00:26:57,905
We have to think of
something better.

147
00:27:02,121 --> 00:27:04,328
It's so extraordinary...

148
00:27:05,916 --> 00:27:09,125
I wouldn't have
believed it possible.

149
00:27:10,129 --> 00:27:13,212
Like a message from
another world...

150
00:27:17,761 --> 00:27:22,506
But you're so earthly,
yet so heavenly!

151
00:27:23,725 --> 00:27:28,140
You don't belong to this century.
Do you hear me?

152
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:35,852
Julie, please.

153
00:27:38,282 --> 00:27:40,148
Don't be like this.

154
00:27:41,785 --> 00:27:45,403
You should never have
come into my life!

155
00:28:00,888 --> 00:28:02,754
Julie?

156
00:28:04,266 --> 00:28:08,635
- Yes?
- Just a misunderstanding...

157
00:28:08,896 --> 00:28:13,356
I don't know what's
happening to me today.

158
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:17,985
Don't treat me like
this when I love you.

159
00:28:18,947 --> 00:28:21,234
I have no idea what you want.

160
00:28:22,284 --> 00:28:24,150
Julie!

161
00:28:25,078 --> 00:28:26,989
Now I know what love is!

162
00:28:29,249 --> 00:28:32,162
I want this moment
to last forever!

163
00:28:34,504 --> 00:28:36,586
Don't treat me like this!

164
00:28:41,136 --> 00:28:43,844
Without you, my life is torture.

165
00:28:47,809 --> 00:28:52,554
You've no idea what this means.
I must be in love with you.

166
00:28:54,274 --> 00:28:56,140
Damn it!

167
00:28:57,194 --> 00:29:01,609
- Julie!
- Have you got any food?

168
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:06,158
A bit of jam, at least...

169
00:29:17,172 --> 00:29:21,131
- What have you been doing?
- How's life?

170
00:29:21,718 --> 00:29:26,212
- Would you like some coffee?
- We're in a hurry today.

171
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:28,422
If only I was as young...

172
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:32,594
<i>Oh, youth of mine, Why
run away with time</i>

173
00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:37,727
<i>Why when I think of you, My
eyes fill with tears true</i>

174
00:29:38,318 --> 00:29:44,109
- Where are you off to?
- Out. It's no fun here today.

175
00:29:46,535 --> 00:29:49,698
<i>Don't leave me, my little girl</i>

176
00:29:49,997 --> 00:29:52,238
<i>Be my friend...</i>

177
00:29:53,959 --> 00:29:55,825
Bye-bye.

178
00:29:56,169 --> 00:29:59,287
Wait! Don't go.

179
00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:03,833
Sit down. I'll make
you some coffee.

180
00:30:23,613 --> 00:30:26,696
Look, an angel - and
she's not flying!

181
00:30:44,426 --> 00:30:47,134
Look, she's got some money here!

182
00:31:16,458 --> 00:31:21,043
She went to get us some sugar
and we've stolen from her!

183
00:31:22,756 --> 00:31:26,169
What do you mean, we. I did!

184
00:31:29,388 --> 00:31:31,254
So you're a thief!

185
00:31:31,932 --> 00:31:35,641
Yes, I'm worse than you!

186
00:31:42,818 --> 00:31:45,526
And it also means
that I'm a liar!

187
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:50,439
That's nothing.

188
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:54,610
Everyone does that.

189
00:31:56,498 --> 00:31:58,364
No one can tell.

190
00:32:10,095 --> 00:32:11,961
Come on.

191
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:16,177
Let's do something big, OK?

192
00:32:17,436 --> 00:32:19,302
We're on fire!

193
00:32:48,425 --> 00:32:51,417
- Julie, is that you?
- Yes, it's me.

194
00:32:51,845 --> 00:32:54,633
Julie, I keep
thinking about you.

195
00:32:56,725 --> 00:32:59,638
I must have fallen
in love with you.

196
00:33:01,855 --> 00:33:07,066
You don't know what that sleepless
night with you means to me.

197
00:33:34,513 --> 00:33:38,347
Julie, I keep waiting for you.

198
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:45,183
I'm afraid I might
never see you again.

199
00:33:48,235 --> 00:33:52,320
Don't treat me like this
when you know I love you.

200
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:55,898
Are you there?

201
00:33:57,202 --> 00:33:59,068
Are you upset with me?

202
00:33:59,829 --> 00:34:04,414
Forgive me, but life
without you is torture.

203
00:34:11,091 --> 00:34:13,879
You don't belong
to this century.

204
00:34:16,388 --> 00:34:18,846
I love you Julie.

205
00:34:21,851 --> 00:34:25,014
I wouldn't have
believed it possible!

206
00:34:29,401 --> 00:34:32,393
Now I know what love is.

207
00:34:35,574 --> 00:34:37,781
Another piece of meat?

208
00:34:39,828 --> 00:34:44,573
- What are you doing?
- There's no meat around here.

209
00:34:44,874 --> 00:34:46,740
What about this?

210
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:50,419
No, I only want fruit now.

211
00:34:50,714 --> 00:34:54,799
What do you mean, fruit?
I don't understand you.

212
00:34:55,552 --> 00:34:57,463
Say you'll come again.

213
00:35:00,515 --> 00:35:02,051
Do you hear, Julie?

214
00:35:02,142 --> 00:35:06,181
- I still fancy something.
- I can't hear you very well.

215
00:35:06,521 --> 00:35:08,979
- Domestic fowl.
- I've fallen in love with you.

216
00:35:09,065 --> 00:35:12,057
- A nice chicken.
- My little chicken!

217
00:35:12,152 --> 00:35:15,486
- That's too big.
- A nice steak!

218
00:35:15,864 --> 00:35:20,358
- Yes, a nice little steak!
- Oh, a nice piece of bread!

219
00:35:22,078 --> 00:35:25,446
Yes, I've got some
nice bread at home.

220
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:29,534
Julie, I love you.

221
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:35,631
Say you won't treat me
like you did last time.

222
00:35:37,636 --> 00:35:40,845
I wouldn't have
believed it possible.

223
00:35:41,181 --> 00:35:43,969
It's never happened
to me before.

224
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:54,271
I think I know now what...

225
00:35:57,447 --> 00:35:59,313
What are you doing?

226
00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:02,612
What a shame!

227
00:36:04,621 --> 00:36:06,487
What's his name?

228
00:36:08,041 --> 00:36:10,032
You know, I have no idea.

229
00:36:20,595 --> 00:36:25,385
I completely forgot to ask him.

230
00:36:27,977 --> 00:36:30,435
But I've got his phone number.

231
00:36:43,535 --> 00:36:46,118
- You going there?
- Of course!

232
00:36:57,590 --> 00:37:00,799
Do this bit here.

233
00:37:01,094 --> 00:37:04,428
Girls, you're all tatty.

234
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:14,057
All these frills!

235
00:37:15,358 --> 00:37:19,898
What on Earth have
you been doing?

236
00:37:20,488 --> 00:37:22,946
What's been keeping you?

237
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:27,656
How am I supposed to be able
to get rid of him on my own?

238
00:37:43,386 --> 00:37:45,252
Watch out for bones.

239
00:37:46,139 --> 00:37:48,801
Watch out for the bony bits!

240
00:37:50,018 --> 00:37:52,760
Look out for phony bonies!

241
00:37:59,569 --> 00:38:01,856
Fishy, fishier, fishiest!

242
00:38:05,575 --> 00:38:08,567
Girlies! Girlies!

243
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:11,828
Girlies! Girlies!

244
00:38:12,207 --> 00:38:14,744
Hasn't the world gone bad?

245
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:17,993
Kiss me.

246
00:38:26,846 --> 00:38:28,712
When's your train?

247
00:39:23,152 --> 00:39:26,235
Look, rails!

248
00:39:34,122 --> 00:39:35,988
I'm fed up.

249
00:39:37,584 --> 00:39:43,170
I can't think of anything new.

250
00:39:44,382 --> 00:39:47,966
We'll have to think of
a worse kind of life.

251
00:39:58,146 --> 00:39:59,978
Aplt...

252
00:40:02,859 --> 00:40:04,725
Augusta...

253
00:40:06,487 --> 00:40:09,946
- Arsen.
- He's in jail, isn't he?

254
00:40:11,701 --> 00:40:13,567
Right, now 'B':

255
00:40:15,663 --> 00:40:17,529
Baggage...

256
00:40:19,167 --> 00:40:21,033
That's too lyrical.

257
00:40:22,921 --> 00:40:24,787
Beranek...

258
00:40:28,718 --> 00:40:32,837
- What happened to Beranek?
- He got a job.

259
00:40:34,349 --> 00:40:36,215
Coural...

260
00:40:39,979 --> 00:40:41,845
Horrid!

261
00:40:44,484 --> 00:40:46,350
I don't know that one.

262
00:40:46,569 --> 00:40:51,359
I say horrid because we
haven't got anyone for 'H'.

263
00:40:56,037 --> 00:40:59,246
- What are you doing?
- I can't read it.

264
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:08,622
It's Doda!

265
00:41:10,927 --> 00:41:12,793
I see.

266
00:41:14,514 --> 00:41:21,261
Who was it who kept saying,
"What will become of us?"

267
00:41:21,896 --> 00:41:24,729
- The one who died?
- Yeah.

268
00:41:28,528 --> 00:41:31,737
His signature must
be here somewhere.

269
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:39,160
Hansel's arrived.

270
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:43,077
Our Gretel's all het up...

271
00:41:45,795 --> 00:41:50,505
<i>Can you hear me? It's me, Hansel.
Open the door.</i>

272
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:56,837
<i>Please open the door.
I know you're there.</i>

273
00:41:57,056 --> 00:42:00,970
<i>I must talk to you.
1 have to explain.</i>

274
00:42:04,772 --> 00:42:08,060
<i>It was just a little
misunderstanding.</i>

275
00:42:09,944 --> 00:42:12,606
<i>I keep thinking about you.</i>

276
00:42:16,242 --> 00:42:21,828
Open the door, Marie. He
keeps thinking about you.

277
00:42:23,875 --> 00:42:29,837
Go on, open it, if he
keeps thinking about you.

278
00:42:30,006 --> 00:42:31,872
<i>Please.</i>

279
00:42:33,051 --> 00:42:35,258
He must be in love with you.

280
00:42:36,512 --> 00:42:41,006
Don't start, if he keeps
thinking about you.

281
00:42:43,478 --> 00:42:44,889
<i>Marie.</i>

282
00:42:44,979 --> 00:42:47,846
He's got a nice
voice, this Johnny.

283
00:42:47,982 --> 00:42:54,570
<i>- Please open the door!
Johnny, Jack, John...</i>

284
00:42:56,199 --> 00:42:58,065
Do you love me, John?

285
00:43:00,995 --> 00:43:04,704
Look, Hans, is there
anything to eat there?

286
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:11,286
Or perhaps you mind?

287
00:43:12,632 --> 00:43:15,795
Who says I'm saying anything?

288
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:19,927
Give me his address, then.

289
00:43:32,151 --> 00:43:34,017
Here's a little pen.

290
00:43:39,951 --> 00:43:41,817
Legibly, OK?

291
00:43:56,134 --> 00:43:58,216
I don't like you any more.

292
00:44:04,308 --> 00:44:06,174
Nor I you.

293
00:44:08,437 --> 00:44:10,269
But I mean it.

294
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:19,529
Really, not any more.

295
00:44:23,244 --> 00:44:25,736
I don't like you at all.

296
00:44:31,544 --> 00:44:33,410
Where are you off to?

297
00:44:47,894 --> 00:44:51,603
- Where have you been?
- At the end.

298
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:56,266
At the end of what?

299
00:44:57,612 --> 00:44:59,478
At the end of the pier.

300
00:45:18,257 --> 00:45:20,589
- Come on.
- Where to?

301
00:45:25,806 --> 00:45:27,672
Come on.

302
00:45:30,269 --> 00:45:32,101
Ouch!

303
00:45:32,813 --> 00:45:35,020
I told you to come!

304
00:45:52,250 --> 00:45:54,617
- No!
- You have to smoke!

305
00:45:56,963 --> 00:46:00,547
- How depraved!
- Indeed.

306
00:46:06,889 --> 00:46:10,553
- Come on.
- Please.

307
00:46:12,937 --> 00:46:14,769
Look, a butterfly!

308
00:46:21,028 --> 00:46:23,565
That's what I don't understand.

309
00:46:23,864 --> 00:46:27,607
Why do they say, "I love you"?

310
00:46:29,578 --> 00:46:31,444
Do you understand?

311
00:46:36,711 --> 00:46:40,875
Why don't they say,
for example, "egg"?

312
00:46:42,466 --> 00:46:44,798
What a good idea!

313
00:46:47,930 --> 00:46:49,796
Give me one.

314
00:46:51,767 --> 00:46:55,226
I just meant it as an example.

315
00:46:55,688 --> 00:46:57,554
Come on!

316
00:46:58,149 --> 00:47:00,857
If it's something that matters.

317
00:47:12,121 --> 00:47:14,613
So what's supposed to matter?

318
00:47:18,669 --> 00:47:21,627
Do you really think it matters?

319
00:47:23,007 --> 00:47:24,873
Matte rs?

320
00:47:37,021 --> 00:47:40,559
Even when someone
doesn't exist any more?

321
00:47:42,401 --> 00:47:44,813
You mean, when someone dies?

322
00:47:47,198 --> 00:47:51,943
- Let's say you.
- Why me? What about you?

323
00:47:53,371 --> 00:47:55,362
We're sitting here now.

324
00:47:56,248 --> 00:48:00,037
Just imagine if it weren't us!

325
00:48:01,128 --> 00:48:03,495
That would be stupid!

326
00:48:08,594 --> 00:48:11,336
How do you know it's us?

327
00:48:13,057 --> 00:48:16,766
- How do you know you exist?
- Because of you!

328
00:48:17,395 --> 00:48:19,227
Of course!

329
00:48:24,318 --> 00:48:28,733
Otherwise, it would be
difficult to prove with you.

330
00:48:28,906 --> 00:48:35,118
You're not registered
here, you don't work...

331
00:48:35,454 --> 00:48:38,196
There is no proof you exist.

332
00:48:40,709 --> 00:48:42,575
There's nothing.

333
00:48:45,548 --> 00:48:47,414
Is something there?

334
00:48:49,176 --> 00:48:51,042
Let me see.

335
00:48:51,971 --> 00:48:54,679
Something should be happening.

336
00:49:03,357 --> 00:49:05,223
But what?

337
00:49:10,865 --> 00:49:14,074
You're always rushing
off somewhere.

338
00:49:15,369 --> 00:49:19,488
<i>Roses red, roses red</i>

339
00:49:19,582 --> 00:49:22,370
<i>How I love roses red</i>

340
00:49:23,169 --> 00:49:26,628
<i>I want them for you, my beloved</i>

341
00:49:27,256 --> 00:49:29,918
<i>I pick them to please you</i>

342
00:49:30,384 --> 00:49:34,628
<i>For your blonde hair
a ring I shall weave</i>

343
00:49:35,264 --> 00:49:38,552
<i>Roses, red, how I love thee</i>

344
00:49:50,196 --> 00:49:52,062
LADIES

345
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:54,856
Anything there?

346
00:49:55,618 --> 00:49:58,610
We can try somewhere
else, can't we?

347
00:50:01,582 --> 00:50:03,448
Does it matter?

348
00:50:06,045 --> 00:50:07,501
It doesn't matter.

349
00:50:07,588 --> 00:50:09,875
One should try everything!

350
00:51:00,432 --> 00:51:03,424
"What... are... you...
staring... at?"

351
00:51:11,694 --> 00:51:13,560
What is he doing?

352
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:17,363
He's going to water the garden.

353
00:51:18,867 --> 00:51:20,733
Lucky guy!

354
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:23,987
What, getting up so early?

355
00:52:11,128 --> 00:52:14,211
Nobody's paying any
attention to us!

356
00:52:16,508 --> 00:52:19,296
What if we're lacking something?

357
00:52:21,513 --> 00:52:26,223
People don't realise how
freezing it is in the morning.

358
00:52:36,070 --> 00:52:38,482
What are you thinking about?

359
00:52:44,328 --> 00:52:46,194
See how you look?

360
00:52:56,048 --> 00:53:01,919
I wonder why that gardener
didn't notice us.

361
00:53:06,809 --> 00:53:08,720
What are we doing here?

362
00:53:10,979 --> 00:53:13,767
Why didn't he at
least tell us off?

363
00:53:17,152 --> 00:53:19,439
He wasn't even sorry for us!

364
00:53:22,574 --> 00:53:26,408
What an old fogey!
We're still young.

365
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:33,533
We're young and we've got our
whole lives ahead of us!

366
00:53:45,389 --> 00:53:50,099
Know what worried me? That
we were invisible to him!

367
00:53:52,062 --> 00:53:53,894
That's stupid!

368
00:53:55,733 --> 00:53:58,521
I thought we'd evaporated!

369
00:54:00,362 --> 00:54:05,357
So why didn't he notice us? Why
didn't the cyclists notice?

370
00:54:06,744 --> 00:54:08,610
Why, I wonder?

371
00:54:15,419 --> 00:54:18,252
Why is there water here? Why?

372
00:54:18,881 --> 00:54:21,623
Why's there a river? Why?

373
00:54:22,342 --> 00:54:25,050
Why, uncle?

374
00:54:25,971 --> 00:54:29,009
Why am I cold? Why?

375
00:54:29,516 --> 00:54:31,382
Why, uncle?

376
00:54:32,936 --> 00:54:35,553
There you are. We do exist!

377
00:54:37,357 --> 00:54:39,223
We exist, we exist...

378
00:55:16,021 --> 00:55:18,388
It's nice to be home.

379
00:55:19,399 --> 00:55:21,606
Die! Die! Die!

380
00:55:23,028 --> 00:55:26,987
I'm on fire, you're on
fire, we're on fire.

381
00:55:28,617 --> 00:55:31,405
Can you feel how
volatile life is?

382
00:55:32,996 --> 00:55:37,706
Don't treat me like this if you
know I'm in love with you.

383
00:55:38,001 --> 00:55:42,120
What will become of us?

384
00:55:46,051 --> 00:55:48,668
There's no proof at all.

385
00:55:50,722 --> 00:55:52,588
I'm lying here.

386
00:55:52,683 --> 00:55:55,766
Just imagine if it weren't me...

387
00:56:04,069 --> 00:56:07,107
We're not going on
any more walks, OK?

388
00:56:07,197 --> 00:56:11,236
Right, no more walks!

389
00:56:14,746 --> 00:56:16,612
IS this OK?

390
00:56:27,718 --> 00:56:29,584
Too much!

391
00:56:32,848 --> 00:56:34,714
Does it matter?

392
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:12,009
- Does it matter?
- It doesn't matter.

393
00:58:03,730 --> 00:58:06,768
Let's go, there's nothing here.

394
00:58:09,820 --> 00:58:12,403
Look, it says, "Nourishment"!

395
00:58:12,948 --> 00:58:15,656
I'm hungry.

396
00:58:17,411 --> 00:58:20,324
There might be
something up there.

397
00:58:21,581 --> 00:58:24,039
- Yeah, cold!
- Let's go!

398
00:58:28,380 --> 00:58:30,587
Quick, someone's coming!

399
00:58:39,391 --> 00:58:41,257
Send us up!

400
00:58:59,995 --> 00:59:03,408
TRANSPORTATION OF
PERSONS PROHIBITED

401
00:59:03,999 --> 00:59:06,206
I've got pins and needles.

402
00:59:07,461 --> 00:59:09,327
Are we here?

403
00:59:11,381 --> 00:59:13,247
I'll go first.

404
00:59:18,180 --> 00:59:20,046
This must be it.

405
00:59:29,775 --> 00:59:32,392
- Where is it?
- What?

406
00:59:32,986 --> 00:59:35,853
- That nourishment!
- Come on.

407
00:59:46,124 --> 00:59:47,990
Come on.

408
01:00:22,369 --> 01:00:24,451
One, two, three, four...

409
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:40,671
What are you drinking?

410
01:00:42,347 --> 01:00:44,213
Wine.

411
01:00:47,435 --> 01:00:50,473
What are you licking
off your finger?

412
01:00:53,275 --> 01:00:58,145
Go carefully, so no one notices!
Look.

413
01:01:06,788 --> 01:01:08,654
See, carefully.

414
01:01:28,852 --> 01:01:32,390
This is interesting and piquant!

415
01:01:33,648 --> 01:01:35,514
That is lovely!

416
01:01:35,984 --> 01:01:39,727
Look at this animal,
it's got eyes!

417
01:02:02,510 --> 01:02:04,672
This is a nice relish!

418
01:02:11,603 --> 01:02:14,721
Why don't we use plates?

419
01:02:15,774 --> 01:02:18,141
Let's lay out a banquet!

420
01:02:54,104 --> 01:02:55,936
What now?

421
01:03:02,988 --> 01:03:05,195
Canned button mushrooms!

422
01:03:23,550 --> 01:03:26,633
Don't worry. Does it matter?

423
01:03:28,972 --> 01:03:30,883
No, it doesn't matter.

424
01:03:37,689 --> 01:03:41,102
- Did you try this green one?
- Which one?

425
01:03:44,362 --> 01:03:47,150
We haven't got
anything to drink.

426
01:04:05,925 --> 01:04:08,758
Quick, it's too heavy!

427
01:04:33,828 --> 01:04:35,694
Johnnie!

428
01:06:08,173 --> 01:06:10,631
Look! Little cakes!

429
01:06:20,977 --> 01:06:22,888
These ones are better.

430
01:06:39,913 --> 01:06:45,033
This is what I call a cake,
not that rubbish of yours.

431
01:06:48,505 --> 01:06:50,371
Does it matter?

432
01:06:55,553 --> 01:06:57,419
No, I don't!

433
01:07:59,242 --> 01:08:01,108
A fashion show!

434
01:09:58,152 --> 01:10:01,361
THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY
THEY COULD END UP.

435
01:10:07,578 --> 01:10:08,659
Help!

436
01:10:08,746 --> 01:10:16,746
IS THERE ANY WAY TO MEND
WHAT'S BEEN DESTROYED?

437
01:10:17,672 --> 01:10:19,879
We're drowning!

438
01:10:19,966 --> 01:10:22,628
We're shouting for help.

439
01:10:22,885 --> 01:10:25,502
It's because we've gone bad!

440
01:10:31,936 --> 01:10:33,768
Help!

441
01:10:34,605 --> 01:10:37,267
- Help!
- Help us!

442
01:10:37,775 --> 01:10:39,641
Help!

443
01:10:41,904 --> 01:10:45,272
We don't want to be bad!

444
01:10:45,366 --> 01:10:48,154
EVEN IF THEY HAD A CHANCE,

445
01:10:48,244 --> 01:10:55,867
IT WOULD PROBABLY
LOOK LIKE THIS.

446
01:10:58,921 --> 01:11:01,709
Let's clear all this up.
Quickly.

447
01:11:03,301 --> 01:11:08,387
If we're good and hard-working,
we'll be happy...

448
01:11:08,514 --> 01:11:11,006
We've got to tidy it up.

449
01:11:11,100 --> 01:11:13,216
Let's make it all nice.

450
01:11:13,394 --> 01:11:18,605
We'll be happy because
we're hard-working...

451
01:11:18,983 --> 01:11:21,691
It still needs a
bit more here...

452
01:11:22,487 --> 01:11:26,526
We'll be hard-working and
everything will be clean.

453
01:11:26,616 --> 01:11:32,783
When we get everything done,
we'll be good and happy...

454
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:39,413
We'll be hard-working
and good...

455
01:11:57,230 --> 01:11:59,096
Are you crazy?

456
01:11:59,690 --> 01:12:06,153
It will be beautiful again,
all clean and tidy...

457
01:12:08,115 --> 01:12:12,279
If we work hard, we'll
be happy and good!

458
01:13:33,075 --> 01:13:35,282
We worked hard, didn't we?

459
01:13:35,703 --> 01:13:39,287
Yes, we've put
everything to rights!

460
01:13:40,166 --> 01:13:42,032
All nice again!

461
01:13:46,213 --> 01:13:48,079
I'm happy!

462
01:13:50,426 --> 01:13:52,633
I'm happy too!

463
01:14:09,946 --> 01:14:12,483
We're both so happy!

464
01:14:20,373 --> 01:14:22,865
Say that we're happy.

465
01:14:33,636 --> 01:14:35,502
Is it just a game?

466
01:14:37,848 --> 01:14:39,714
It isn't.

467
01:14:44,438 --> 01:14:47,430
We're really happy!

468
01:14:52,238 --> 01:14:54,149
But it doesn't matter!

469
01:15:08,462 --> 01:15:14,879
THIS FILM IS DEDICATED
TO ALL THOSE

470
01:15:14,969 --> 01:15:19,088
WHOSE SOLE SOURCE OF INDIGNATION

471
01:15:19,181 --> 01:15:23,266
IS A TRAMPLED-ON TRIFLE.

472
01:15:31,652 --> 01:15:36,567
THE END
