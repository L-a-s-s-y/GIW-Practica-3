And Esther?
Shango, she reared me.

Well now, that's the price
you have to pay

for freedom sometime, you know.

326
00:24:14,995 --> 00:24:16,663
'Cause the nearer I get
to the white man,

eating what left.

no eat it.

331

the white man the same way.

332

[scoffs] But don't that mean
you too, Shango?

What you think I've been
bringing you all this time?

And that morning? [scoffs]

350
00:25:24,564 --> 00:25:26,858
Nunu, she wasn't taking nothing.

351
00:25:26,942 --> 00:25:29,569
She got to mumbling
her country talk.

352
00:25:29,653 --> 00:25:33,240
And nobody, nobody in that yard

353
00:25:33,323 --> 00:25:36,117
had any idea
what she was talking about.

354
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:38,662
She was a mumbling ninny.

355
00:25:38,745 --> 00:25:41,081
Hmm, now, once somebody

356
00:25:41,164 --> 00:25:43,667
got to mumbling,
and somebody else

357
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:45,835
got to mumbling,
and 'fore you know it,

358
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:47,796
everybody in the yard
was mumbling.

359
00:25:47,879 --> 00:25:49,547
They was mumbling
the same thing, honey.

360
00:25:49,631 --> 00:25:51,132
I mean, it was just like a song.

361
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:52,884
Everybody was just
a mumbling child.

362
00:25:52,968 --> 00:25:54,636
We was a chanting. Ha!

363
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:56,680
And we didn't have no idea
what we was talking about.

364
00:25:56,763 --> 00:25:59,307
You hear me?
But we was going.

365
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:03,144
Hmm. I spit with every words
we were saying.

366
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:05,897
It started to do the job,
'cause, all of a sudden,

367
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:07,857
that old cracker
got to gasping for air.

368
00:26:07,941 --> 00:26:09,985
[laughs] He got to gasping.

369
00:26:10,068 --> 00:26:12,028
Lord, he couldn't catch
his breath.

370
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:15,240
Then his eyes
got to rolling back in his head.

371
00:26:15,323 --> 00:26:16,825
His tongue got the--

372
00:26:16,908 --> 00:26:19,119
Just going back
in his mouth, you know.

373
00:26:19,202 --> 00:26:22,539
I mean, foam was just coming
all out of his mouth.

374
00:26:22,622 --> 00:26:25,959
You hear me? Foam was coming out
of the man's mouth.

375
00:26:26,042 --> 00:26:28,378
And right about that time,
Nunu, she gets strong.

376
00:26:28,461 --> 00:26:31,339
She take a notion
to jump back her arm,

377
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:33,633
and she put her eyes
on that old cracker, honey,

378
00:26:33,717 --> 00:26:35,385
and he got to going 'round.

379
00:26:35,468 --> 00:26:38,471
-Right about that time…

gasping for air!

382
00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:45,812
[laughing] He was just gasping,
like he had a chicken bone…

383
00:26:45,895 --> 00:26:47,772
Come on, she don't sound right.
We better be going.

384
00:26:47,856 --> 00:26:49,190
-Come on, let's go.
-I don't want to go.

385
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:50,984
I don't want to go.
I want to hear this.

386
00:26:51,067 --> 00:26:54,029
[woman] All of us,
we get to stare at Nunu.

387
00:26:54,112 --> 00:26:57,449
But she wasn't paying
no attention to us at all,

388
00:26:57,532 --> 00:27:00,952
'cause her eyes were stuck
on that old cracker,

389
00:27:01,036 --> 00:27:02,912
and he was just going 'round.

390
00:27:02,996 --> 00:27:04,622
Lord, child, I mean,

391
00:27:04,706 --> 00:27:07,125
you ain't never seen
nothing like it.

392
00:27:07,208 --> 00:27:09,878
And I tell you, you never want
to see nothing like that

393
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:11,296
long as you live.

394
00:27:12,422 --> 00:27:14,257
I don't know what got into him,

395
00:27:14,341 --> 00:27:16,843
whether it was God or the devil.

396
00:27:16,926 --> 00:27:19,220
But something sure enough
got into him.

397
00:27:20,096 --> 00:27:22,349
And Nunu? Humph.

398
00:27:22,432 --> 00:27:25,226
She was just staring at him.

399
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:27,812
And as he sat there
in front of all of us,

400
00:27:27,896 --> 00:27:29,731
his skin,

401
00:27:29,814 --> 00:27:32,859
everything on him
turned to ashy gray.

402
00:27:33,735 --> 00:27:34,986
And that Nunu…

403
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:38,615
<i>You know, she just stood there</i>

404
00:27:38,698 --> 00:27:41,242
<i>like she was God Himself.</i>

405
00:27:42,577 --> 00:27:44,412
The girl just stood there.

406
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:47,082
And the man died.

407
00:27:48,792 --> 00:27:51,503
Leaning right there
against that cabin.

408
00:27:51,586 --> 00:27:54,005
He died.

409
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:55,757
I tell you, for me?

410
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:58,676
Humph, that was
real Judgment Day.

411
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:01,262
All of us just stand there,
witnessing as that old cracker

412
00:28:01,346 --> 00:28:03,556
went and died
in front of everybody.

413
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,183
And it took Nunu
and her home tongue

414
00:28:05,266 --> 00:28:06,935
to finally do the job

415
00:28:07,018 --> 00:28:09,312
we all had been praying for.

416

"It was her mother tongue."

Nunu is an Akan.

She always talks
about her peoples.

So, just hold on tight to him.

All right, smart boy. Noble!

538
00:34:37,158 --> 00:34:38,951
Yes, Sir.

539
00:34:39,035 --> 00:34:40,703
I guess you better go ahead
and do it then.

540
00:34:40,787 --> 00:34:43,289

you can't expect me

541

to do the whipping
all by myself all the time.

542

I'm not going to do

I'm feeling bad today, I mean…

Yes, sir. [sighs]

you'd rather count.

you know I can't count.

You know what, boy?

552

You used to race
to tear them Black hides.

something about it.

a headman for the white man

I almost went mad,
I couldn't control my head.

816

The fact I couldn't say no
is what's killing me.

817

You can do something about that.

827
00:53:38,006 --> 00:53:40,634
You can pull yourself up
and say no.

828
00:53:42,761 --> 00:53:45,388
The choice is either to be
a true man

829
00:53:45,472 --> 00:53:47,265

Now, they're going to know
you are a tender man.

Don't be afraid

Everybody knows why he's here,

Noble Ali, you know
I can't sleep with you.

You are a headman.

my tormentor.

883
00:57:26,568 --> 00:57:29,195
I was snatched away
and sold from my birthplace

884
00:57:29,279 --> 00:57:32,782
by my own people
acting like a headman.

885
00:57:32,866 --> 00:57:36,911
And till today,
the headman is my tormentor.

886
00:57:36,995 --> 00:57:40,290
But you might as well
give up on me,

887
00:57:40,373 --> 00:57:43,585
because I'm never going to lie
next to your body

888
00:57:43,668 --> 00:57:47,297
so long as you remain
the headman for the white man.
