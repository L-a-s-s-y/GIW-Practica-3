00:00:19,144 --> 00:00:21,271
Er, will it take much longer?

3
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:24,066
With traffic like this...

4
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:28,612
I could walk from here.

5
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:33,242
Akebono Trading?
No no, no way.

6
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:37,788
Ma'am, don't be like that,
sit back and relax.

7
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:43,794
Akebono Trading's taken off lately.
Out of nowhere.

8
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:47,881
No one who goes there
asks for change.

9
00:00:53,095 --> 00:00:56,598
I'm not so lucky.
I'm always fearing the worst.

10
00:00:58,183 --> 00:01:03,105
The other day, I drove
sumo wrestlers. Three at once.

11
00:01:04,147 --> 00:01:06,483
That was a big mistake.

12
00:01:07,442 --> 00:01:09,319
They busted my suspension,

13
00:01:10,529 --> 00:01:12,864
but wouldn't fork out for repairs.

14
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:15,242
They really screwed me.

15
00:01:22,457 --> 00:01:24,918
So... how much longer will it take?

16
00:01:31,008 --> 00:01:32,843
Traffic's hell at this hour.

17
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:42,185
Ma'am, don't ever cross
a sumo wrestler.

18
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:45,230
Remember that wrestler Fujinomaru?

19
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:48,608
Well, sumo's not my thing.

20
00:01:49,151 --> 00:01:55,032
Three years ago, he killed
his senior stablemate and his lover,

21
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:58,493
but he got off on an insanity plea.

22
00:01:59,286 --> 00:02:05,167
It was on the news. Turns out
it was actually premeditated murder.

23
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:07,836
You read gossip rags?

24
00:02:10,005 --> 00:02:12,382
Damn, their bodies were a mess.

25
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:17,429
Every bone was broken,
snapped like pencils.

26
00:02:19,181 --> 00:02:21,391

To see Mr. Kurume
in Section 12.

41
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:14,546
Section 12?

42
00:04:15,213 --> 00:04:20,177
There's no such section here.
What's their specialty?

43
00:04:20,886 --> 00:04:23,513
Art sales and acquisitions,
I heard.

44
00:04:23,889 --> 00:04:25,015
Art?

00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:29,978
Ah, the new Section 12.
Please forgive me.

- So, your name is?
- Narushima.

Ms. Narushima?

48
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:38,778
Narushima...
Ms. Akiko Narushima?

49
00:04:39,488 --> 00:04:41,615
- Your first day.
- That's right.

50
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:45,994
So, did you bring a photo?

51
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:49,331
- Yes. Should I give it to you?
- Please.

52
00:04:50,582 --> 00:04:52,959
It's necessary,
for security reasons.

53
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:57,798
Huh? Another newcomer?
Why don't they get out?

54
00:04:59,049 --> 00:05:00,592
This is all I have.

55
00:05:01,092 --> 00:05:04,304
It's rather big.
Business card size is best.

56
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:07,516
Well, it'll do.
I'll take care of it.

57
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:10,602
- May I go in?
- Sure, go ahead.

58
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:14,272
Well, I'll be seeing you.
Pleased to meet you.

59
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:52,102
A Lautrec?
Yes, I've heard of it, but...

60
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:59,150
Ah, I know. Mr. Sakakibara, that one
in the weeklies... Yes, I know it.

61
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:01,236
Huh?

62
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:03,572
1.8 billion yen?

63
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:08,285
Mr. Sakakibara,
that's a little too...

64
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:12,497
Picasso? 2 billion...

65
00:06:16,251 --> 00:06:22,340
Mr. Sakakibara, we don't want to be
stingy, but that's new territory for us.

66
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:27,721
How about something more accessible
in the 20 to 30 million range...

67
00:06:28,597 --> 00:06:33,143
No no, we're quick learners.
We've hired an expert for that.

68
00:06:34,686 --> 00:06:36,855
Sure. Sure, sure.

69
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:42,694
Redon? One moment please,
I'll jot it down.

70
00:06:46,281 --> 00:06:49,200
R-e-d-o-n.

71
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:52,537
Sure. Sure, understood.

72
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:56,666
Alright Mr. Sakakibara,
we'll call you back.

73
00:06:57,375 --> 00:07:00,211
Sure. Thank you.
Much appreciated.

74
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:07,594
Kurume, a Redon sold at Sotheby's
last year for 800 million.

75
00:07:08,345 --> 00:07:10,096
Sonovabitch...

76
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:13,558
That damn Sakakibara.
He was mocking me!

77
00:07:15,226 --> 00:07:18,104
Oh, how about this?
A Laurencin for 60 mil.

78
00:07:18,772 --> 00:07:20,190
Surprisingly cheap, isn't it?

79
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:23,485
No, steep! Yoshioka,
that under 30 mil list?

80
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:25,570
Er, it'll be ready soon.

81
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:31,326
Well, in the 20 mil range...
Oh, Chagall maybe?

82
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:33,495
Huh? A Chagall for 20 mil?

83
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:34,621
Only a fake.

84
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:38,166
Yoshioka, what auction?!
Will the buyer sell?!

85
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:39,584
A lithograph.

86
00:07:39,584 --> 00:07:41,169
What?! A lithograph won't do!

87
00:07:41,962 --> 00:07:44,381
Famous means expensive, huh?

88
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:49,970
But how can a Laurencin go for 60 mil
and a Lautrec for 1.8 bil?

89
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:55,517
Narushima, what's your take
as an art expert?

90
00:07:56,184 --> 00:08:01,940
I was only a museum curator,
so I don't know about market prices,

91
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:09,072
but Lautrec and Laurencin differ in
historical status, so it makes sense.

92
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:15,078
Also, Chagall's lithographs
have exquisite beauty,

93
00:08:15,245 --> 00:08:17,580
and deserved value as fine art.

94
00:08:17,956 --> 00:08:22,502
Hey, art is like women.
No buyer, no value.

95
00:08:23,128 --> 00:08:24,129
Yes sir.

96
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:30,427
By the way, you mentioned Redon on the phone
earlier, so how about this?

97
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:33,471
What do you think?

98
00:08:34,055 --> 00:08:38,727
It's a favorite of mine.
It's been re-evaluated at last.

99
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:44,899
Van Goghs sell for over 10 billion,
so a Redon could for 1.

100
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:49,362
Narushima, do you know
what's worth 1 billion?

101
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:53,533
No, I just thought you might like it.

102
00:08:53,992 --> 00:08:57,162
But a 1 billion painting's
worth 1 billion.

103
00:08:57,412 --> 00:09:00,457
How would you know?
It's kids' stuff!

104
00:09:07,589 --> 00:09:09,841
Hey, Yoshioka, I want that under 30 mil list soon.

105
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:14,804
Kurume's like that.
Irritable. Don't let it rile you.

106
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:19,184
No, I'm not bothered at all.
I'm still learning sales.

107
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:21,019
You'll pick it up.

108
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:27,192
Narushima, But maybe you shouldn't get used to
a cutthroat business like ours.

109
00:09:30,028 --> 00:09:33,281
By the way, Narushima, have you met Hyodo in HR?

110
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:34,574
No.

111
00:09:34,908 --> 00:09:38,828
Oh. But weren't you hired
on Hyodo's recommendation?

112
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:41,664
I was.
I only heard that though.

113
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:45,251
You'll meet him eventually.
He's scary.

114
00:09:45,794 --> 00:09:47,045
Is he really?

115
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:49,339
A weirdo in a way.

116
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:54,177
Always acts alone,
and has no staff of his own.

117
00:09:54,636 --> 00:09:58,431
He suddenly takes charge of
big jobs unrelated to HR.

118
00:09:59,974 --> 00:10:03,603
Taking on art sales
was actually Hyodo's idea.

119
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:05,730
I see.

120
00:10:05,897 --> 00:10:08,191
Compared to him,
Kurume's easy.

121
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:13,321
Promise you won't let
Kurume's tantrums get to you.

122
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:24,707
Hey, Nonomura, a client's waiting!
Come!

123
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:27,418
But I have to show Narushima...

124
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:29,504
That can wait!
Right, Narushima?

125
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:32,799
But she hasn't met Hyodo...

126
00:10:33,007 --> 00:10:36,636
Hyodo?! He's HR!
Nothing to do with Section 12!

127
00:10:37,387 --> 00:10:41,599
Nonomura, don't tell me
you're Hyodo's boy now?

128
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:43,059
Of course not, sir.

129
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:46,062
It's fine, please go.
I'll return the key.

130
00:10:46,354 --> 00:10:47,897
But do you know where the security office...

131
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:48,940
- Just come.
- I'll be OK.

132
00:10:49,232 --> 00:10:51,276
- Okay, sorry...
- Shut up and come!

133
00:10:56,698 --> 00:10:59,409
<i>Mr. Hyodo, our CEO's on the line.</i>

134
00:11:01,119 --> 00:11:02,579
Tell him I'm still asleep.

135
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:24,017
<i>Security Office</i>

137

Excuse me? I came to return this key.

138
00:11:49,918 --> 00:11:50,919
Can I help?

139
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:52,837
I'm returning this key.

140
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:55,423
Is that so?
No one's in there?

141
00:11:56,841 --> 00:12:00,303
That's odd.
Anyway, I'll take it.

142
00:12:00,595 --> 00:12:01,679
Thank you.

143
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:12,357
Ah, Fujimaru, you were in here?

144
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:21,783
How's it going?
Got the hang of it?

145
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:33,461
Oh, her. She joined Section 12
today. Akiko Narushima.

146
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:37,757
Her photo's too big,
so I stuck it in there.

147
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:41,970
Quite a classy lady.

148
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:44,931
Who's there?

149
00:12:48,059 --> 00:12:50,103
Oh, Shirai probably.

150
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:56,067
Hey.

151
00:12:58,027 --> 00:13:01,447
Mamiya, how about
the Japanese St. Leger?

152
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:07,203
I don't bet on horses anymore.

153
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:09,455
Ah, what a waste.

154
00:13:09,831 --> 00:13:13,376
I got a tip from the top
of Central Betting.

155
00:13:13,584 --> 00:13:15,128
I'm out.

156
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:16,546
Oh yeah?

157
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:20,508
I'm going to stake all my money on it.

158
00:13:21,843 --> 00:13:24,220
So pay back that 9 mil already.

159
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:26,806
9 mil?

160
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:30,476
It was 8 mil a little while ago.

161
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:45,199
Like I told you, 15% interest
gets added monthly, yeah?

162
00:13:46,284 --> 00:13:49,160
Win it back on the horses, okay?

163
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,081
Shirai.

164
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:54,959
Can you wait some more?

165
00:13:55,126 --> 00:13:59,505
I can wait. I can,
or pay me back another way.

166
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:03,551
The deed to your house,
or something.

167
00:14:05,011 --> 00:14:07,180
Like that.
Yeah, like that.

168
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:13,102
Shirai, let me introduce you.

169
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:15,938
He's new here. Fujimaru.

170
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:20,860
Fujimaru? Is that his real name?
Or a horse's...

171
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:27,617
You... trying to threaten me?

172
00:14:28,034 --> 00:14:30,620
Are you crazy?
Of course not.

173
00:14:31,454 --> 00:14:32,997
Then why this freak?!

174
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:06,489
Narushima, I think 1 billion
for a Redon is fair too.

175
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:09,575
You do?
Then again...

176
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:12,120
I can somehow talk Kurume into it.

177
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:18,918
But I'll need a list of 10 paintings
for 30 mil, and 5 for 100 mil.

178
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:23,422
As a start, quantity over price first.
That'll lower the risk.

179
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:25,380
OK.

180
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:34,267
By the way, tell me.
What's worth more?

181
00:15:34,725 --> 00:15:39,856
A first-rate artist's mediocre piece,
or a second-rate artist's masterpiece?

182
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:42,608
I'd say the latter.

183
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:43,860
You would?

184
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:48,990
Yes. The status of an artist
can change easily with the times,

185
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:53,744
but the status of a masterpiece
doesn't change at all.

186
00:15:53,995 --> 00:15:54,745
Got it.

187
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:59,584
Hey, everyone, try these Canadian sausages.
Food Section samples.

188
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:00,460
OK.

189
00:16:00,918 --> 00:16:02,128
Try some.

190
00:16:04,547 --> 00:16:06,090
- Takada?
- No thanks.

191
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:07,341
Thought so.

192
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:13,139
Wow, great!
How is it, Narushima?

193
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:15,360
Well...

194
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:16,934
Oh, thank you.

195
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:21,606
Okey doke,
I'll go make some coffee.

196
00:16:21,606 --> 00:16:23,566
Ah, Yoshioka, for all of us.

197
00:16:23,733 --> 00:16:25,193
Yeah sure, sure.

198
00:17:55,283 --> 00:17:57,034
Shirai's late today.

199
00:17:59,996 --> 00:18:01,080
Fujimaru.

200
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:08,421
Fujimaru?

201
00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:12,758
I know you're there.

202
00:18:19,849 --> 00:18:21,517
Yes, you're here.

203
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:25,021
Ah, Fujimaru, listen.

204
00:18:25,271 --> 00:18:30,901
Be careful with this lever.
The switchboard's old and dangerous.

205
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,363
Don't ever switch it on, okay?

206
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:42,288
Anyway, Shirai sure is late...

207
00:18:54,884 --> 00:18:56,344
Open it.

208
00:19:12,443 --> 00:19:13,569
Open it.

209
00:19:18,658 --> 00:19:20,034
What the hell?!

210
00:19:21,786 --> 00:19:23,204
What have you done?!

211
00:19:31,128 --> 00:19:33,923
I know why Shirai
had to end up like that.

212
00:19:40,346 --> 00:19:41,722
What's your game?!

213
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:47,937
What's my game?
That's for you to figure out.

214
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:19,927
Narushima, right?

215
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:21,262
Yes...

216
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:23,597
I'm Hyodo.

217
00:20:23,806 --> 00:20:26,851
Oh, Mr. Hyodo!
Sorry for not visiting you.

218
00:20:27,143 --> 00:20:30,730
That doesn't matter.
How's everything going?

219
00:20:31,647 --> 00:20:33,190
Well, it's going.

220
00:20:33,858 --> 00:20:35,067
I see.

221
00:20:36,444 --> 00:20:37,987
Tell me something.

222
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:39,160
Yes.

223
00:20:39,196 --> 00:20:41,782
A Christie's auction
is in NY this weekend.

224
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:47,955
Cezanne's Cracked Walls.
Is 8 billion a ripoff or a bargain?

225
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:50,583
What? Well...

226
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:55,254
The House With Cracked Walls?

227
00:20:57,173 --> 00:20:58,424
It's a fair price.

228
00:20:58,966 --> 00:21:01,760
Got it. Thanks.
See you tomorrow.

229
00:21:02,553 --> 00:21:07,224
Mr. Hyodo, But Section 12 policy forbids
buying expensive artworks.

230
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:10,186
Section 12 isn't involved, okay?

231
00:21:11,630 --> 00:21:12,620
OK.

232
00:21:15,649 --> 00:21:20,196
It's not some top secret project.
Just a personal one.

233
00:21:21,322 --> 00:21:25,910
So tell Kurume if you want,
or whatever. Fine with me.

234
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:28,829
No need to worry.

235
00:21:29,205 --> 00:21:30,581
Are you sure?

236
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:35,836
But if you have 8 billion to spend,
Kurume might change his mind.

237
00:21:39,173 --> 00:21:40,216
You believe that?

238
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:48,432
Unfortunately, Kurume's a no-hoper.

239
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:52,978
Whatever he does,
he's bound to fail.

240
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:55,523
Then, what about Section 12?

241
00:21:56,273 --> 00:21:58,859
That's... up to you.

242
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:01,529
But I don't understand...

243
00:22:01,904 --> 00:22:03,906
Section 12's all losers.

244
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:05,074
How!

245
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:11,455
Like Hanae Takada. She's ambitious,
but just too bigheaded to succeed.

246
00:22:12,081 --> 00:22:13,123
How rude...

247
00:22:13,457 --> 00:22:17,795
And Ken Nonomura.
A nice guy but just an errand boy.

248
00:22:18,212 --> 00:22:19,672
The worst kind.

249
00:22:20,381 --> 00:22:23,384
And Minoru Yoshioka.
His problem's obvious.

250
00:22:24,218 --> 00:22:25,594
He's just a loser.

251
00:22:26,512 --> 00:22:28,180
I'm sure you sensed it.

252
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:32,768
So Mr. Hyodo, you created Section 12
just to destroy it?

253
00:22:34,144 --> 00:22:37,565
Why do such a thing?
For the company's sake?

254
00:22:38,232 --> 00:22:41,860
What gives you the right?
I can't believe you.

255
00:22:47,741 --> 00:22:50,369
I'm sorry.
I said too much.

256
00:22:50,953 --> 00:22:52,162
No, it's fine.

257
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:56,041
Thanks for your Cezanne advice.

258
00:23:15,477 --> 00:23:16,687
Narushima.

259
00:23:18,147 --> 00:23:20,316
Narushima. A moment.

260
00:23:34,288 --> 00:23:35,247
Narushima.

261
00:23:41,128 --> 00:23:42,379
Sit here.

262
00:24:09,615 --> 00:24:13,035
Insulin.
I'm somewhat diabetic.

263
00:24:19,541 --> 00:24:22,711
Post Office savings accounts
give good interest.

264
00:24:24,254 --> 00:24:25,631
Really...

265
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:28,092
Be good to your parents.

266
00:24:29,218 --> 00:24:31,136
I will, thank you.

267
00:24:31,428 --> 00:24:32,638
Relax.

268
00:24:46,527 --> 00:24:47,903
Narushima.

269
00:24:49,071 --> 00:24:50,698
There's nothing to fear.

270
00:24:52,116 --> 00:24:54,326
Just sit there and watch me.

271
00:26:44,478 --> 00:26:46,104
Hello, Security Office?

272
00:26:47,356 --> 00:26:52,027
I'm in the File Room, but
the door's locked and I can't get out.

273
00:26:54,947 --> 00:26:57,699
I'm sorry, but could you
open it for me?

274
00:26:59,952 --> 00:27:01,161
I'd appreciate it.

275
00:27:28,689 --> 00:27:30,566
Oh, Narushima's not with you?

276
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:34,611
She's not back yet?

277
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:36,196
Gone all afternoon.

278
00:27:36,363 --> 00:27:39,324
Hmm. She takes her time.

279
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:44,806
Er, are you a guard?

280
00:29:44,741 --> 00:29:45,909
Something wrong?

281
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:48,120
That door at the back...

282
00:29:51,832 --> 00:29:53,583
Did something strange happen?

283
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:57,254
Someone was there,
on the other side.

284
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:02,426
That'll be the new guy.

285
00:30:02,884 --> 00:30:05,887
He doesn't know the ropes,
but give him time.

286
00:30:06,763 --> 00:30:08,056
- So that was it...?
- Yes.

287
00:30:21,194 --> 00:30:22,863
Hey, Narushima, what's wrong?

288
00:30:22,863 --> 00:30:25,490
She got stuck in the File Room.

289
00:30:25,699 --> 00:30:27,492
Ah, we all did at first.

290
00:30:28,577 --> 00:30:32,330
Thanks for your help.
I'll be okay now.

291
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:33,832
Okay, here you go.

292
00:30:38,378 --> 00:30:40,047
Narushima, sit here.

293
00:30:46,762 --> 00:30:47,888
What did I do?

294
00:30:48,346 --> 00:30:51,850
Don't tell me you
tried something with her.

295
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:53,393
O-Of course not!

296
00:30:54,394 --> 00:30:58,815
If she was just stuck, she was
gone for a strangely long time.

297
00:30:59,274 --> 00:31:02,569
I've done nothing.
That's the truth.

298
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:07,824
You use the security cameras to peep.

299
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:10,160
- I do not!
- I know you do.

300
00:31:13,121 --> 00:31:14,414
I know.

301
00:31:15,791 --> 00:31:19,961
If you want to feel somebody up,
stick to old biddies.

302
00:31:25,675 --> 00:31:27,427
My young ladies are off limits.

303
00:31:29,054 --> 00:31:30,263
Got that?

304
00:31:36,603 --> 00:31:39,648
Narushima, go home early
if you like.

305
00:31:40,357 --> 00:31:41,900
No, I'll be fine.

306
00:31:42,234 --> 00:31:45,362
When you get stuck,
call security's extension.

307
00:31:46,238 --> 00:31:48,156
Yes, I did that, but...

308
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:50,117
Something else happened?

309
00:31:51,368 --> 00:31:55,789
A security guard came,
but something seemed off.

310
00:32:05,841 --> 00:32:09,177
A new guard?
Did you see him?

311
00:32:09,636 --> 00:32:10,804
No.

312
00:32:11,054 --> 00:32:12,722
Takada, have you?

313
00:32:12,722 --> 00:32:13,765
No.

314
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:17,310
I saw him.
He was huge.

315
00:32:18,019 --> 00:32:20,522
He could probably break down a door.

316
00:32:22,274 --> 00:32:23,733
He's that huge.

317
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:25,652
Two meters?

318
00:32:28,071 --> 00:32:32,284
Not much of an IQ though.
He couldn't open the door.

319
00:32:33,869 --> 00:32:35,912
Narushima, that can't have been nice.

320
00:32:36,163 --> 00:32:39,310
- Nonomura, get that file for me.
- Sure.

321
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:42,910
- Narushima, could you do a gallery check up?
- Sure.

322
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:52,512
<i>An update regarding the sumo wrestler
acquitted of murder three years ago.</i>

323
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:58,852
<i>Pressure from the victims' families
has urged police to re-arrest him.</i>

324
00:32:59,019 --> 00:33:01,396
<i>He is currently being traced.</i>

325
00:33:03,523 --> 00:33:04,900
This is him!

326
00:33:05,567 --> 00:33:06,985
Kurume in Section 12!

327
00:33:08,737 --> 00:33:09,863
This jerk!

328
00:33:14,201 --> 00:33:17,120
He's with other staff during the day,

329
00:33:18,872 --> 00:33:21,249
but he always does overtime alone.

330
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:28,048
You know, I could keep an eye
on him using our monitors.

331
00:33:29,925 --> 00:33:31,468
No need to kill him.

332
00:33:33,094 --> 00:33:34,971
Death's too good for him.

333
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:38,725
Just beat him severely.

334
00:33:40,185 --> 00:33:41,561
Severely.

335
00:33:44,397 --> 00:33:45,815
Enjoying yourself?

336
00:33:49,986 --> 00:33:53,198
Since I met you,
I've been enjoying myself.

337
00:33:55,784 --> 00:33:57,327
Especially today.

338
00:33:59,287 --> 00:34:00,830
What's that?

339
00:34:06,002 --> 00:34:07,420
You stole it?

340
00:34:08,004 --> 00:34:10,590
No. I didn't.

341
00:34:12,133 --> 00:34:14,427
Someone left it for me.

342
00:34:15,845 --> 00:34:17,931
Do you know why they did?

343
00:34:21,184 --> 00:34:23,353
They're trying to test me.

344
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:29,192
However,
I don't have time for that.

345
00:35:18,533 --> 00:35:20,577
Oh, this is the File Room key.

346
00:35:21,494 --> 00:35:22,495
Right.

347
00:35:27,417 --> 00:35:30,920
Excuse me,
I'd like to ask you something.

348
00:35:32,047 --> 00:35:34,674
Has anyone found a lost earring?

349
00:35:37,218 --> 00:35:38,303
An earring?

350
00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:42,182
Yes. One just like this.

351
00:35:47,354 --> 00:35:50,482
I see. If it's found,
I'll call you right away.

352
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:53,234
Please do...

353
00:35:56,446 --> 00:35:59,783
Narushima, I saw the new guard
this morning.

354
00:36:00,492 --> 00:36:01,326
Wow.

355
00:36:01,326 --> 00:36:03,536
Man, he's big.
You'll be amazed.

356
00:36:04,245 --> 00:36:04,996
Oh.

357
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:10,335
And, I just heard, he was a
sumo wrestler. No wonder he's big.

358
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:15,298
No kidding.
He was a sumo wrestler?

359
00:36:16,383 --> 00:36:18,676
But I've never seen him on TV.

360
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:22,097
If he had been,
why would he work here as a security guard?

361
00:36:22,472 --> 00:36:23,556
Good point.

362
00:36:24,349 --> 00:36:26,726
He's a washout, huh?
Poor guy.

363
00:36:27,602 --> 00:36:32,607
Actually, he's kinda weird.
Wears an earring on one side only.

364
00:36:33,608 --> 00:36:35,527
Not stylish, just funny.

365
00:36:35,735 --> 00:36:37,028
Oh yeah?

366
00:36:37,404 --> 00:36:40,657
Hey, you two.
Cut the idle chit-chat.

367
00:36:41,449 --> 00:36:42,409
Yes sir.

368
00:37:05,473 --> 00:37:06,683
Excuse me.

369
00:38:50,411 --> 00:38:53,665
Oh, the guard just went
to the basement.

370
00:38:54,249 --> 00:38:55,458
He did?

371
00:38:59,462 --> 00:39:02,924
<i>Basement machine room entrance</i>

372
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:06,636
No, no, that's off limits!

373
00:39:06,970 --> 00:39:08,680
- Sorry.
- What's up?

374
00:39:09,097 --> 00:39:10,848
- Nothing.
- You work here?

375
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:13,393
I'm from Section 12.

376
00:39:14,102 --> 00:39:15,186
Section 12...

377
00:39:16,062 --> 00:39:17,397
Never heard of it.

378
00:39:23,069 --> 00:39:24,487
You can't fool me, lady!

379
00:41:11,844 --> 00:41:12,887
What?

380
00:41:14,263 --> 00:41:16,432
Um, have you seen a guard here?

381
00:41:16,974 --> 00:41:19,102
Nope. They wouldn't come here.

382
00:41:20,144 --> 00:41:21,187
I see...

383
00:41:21,396 --> 00:41:26,651
If you see one, tell them.
Clean the breakers and switchboard.

384
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:28,653
My job's hard enough.

385
00:41:29,404 --> 00:41:32,782
I came to do electrical work,
now I'm cleaning.

386
00:41:34,117 --> 00:41:35,368
I'm very sorry.

387
00:41:36,369 --> 00:41:38,162
Don't you apologize.

388
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:39,956
Hey, hold this for me.

389
00:41:40,490 --> 00:41:41,620
Sure.

390
00:41:41,749 --> 00:41:43,876
Well, I don't come cheap.

391
00:41:44,419 --> 00:41:49,340
A few days' switchboard repair fees
would sink a small company.

392
00:41:49,799 --> 00:41:51,092
Done. Thanks.

393
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:57,306
Actually, somebody was in here
somewhere. Guard or not.

394
00:46:00,299 --> 00:46:01,968
That sounds bad.

395
00:46:02,301 --> 00:46:08,349
The company outsources security,
so I don't know who to talk to.

396
00:46:09,517 --> 00:46:14,230
Maybe call the security company.
Or better, the police?

397
00:46:15,022 --> 00:46:19,068
It's not having my earring taken
that bothers me.

398
00:46:19,235 --> 00:46:20,611
Your photo?

399
00:46:20,950 --> 00:46:21,920
Yes...

400
00:46:22,154 --> 00:46:24,282
I'm sure I'd be upset too.

401
00:46:24,573 --> 00:46:29,453
But you gave up your photo,
and you dropped your earring.

402
00:46:30,170 --> 00:46:30,950
Yes...

403
00:46:33,624 --> 00:46:36,544
I guess I'm just being too uptight.

404
00:46:40,047 --> 00:46:43,259
I know. Why not talk to
Hyodo in HR?

405
00:46:43,676 --> 00:46:44,885
You mean that Hyodo?

406
00:46:45,261 --> 00:46:51,183
Yeah. He'll help. He's eccentric,
but he's got connections and clout.

407
00:46:55,604 --> 00:46:57,523
If you can't, I will.

408
00:46:58,566 --> 00:47:04,155
No, it's okay. I've met him once,
so I'll tell him directly.

409
00:47:05,281 --> 00:47:06,532
Hang in there.

410
00:47:07,030 --> 00:47:07,960
Yes.

411
00:47:10,161 --> 00:47:13,622
<i> Mr. Hyodo, Narushima
from Section 12 for you.</i>

412
00:47:21,714 --> 00:47:23,883
<i> Wake me at 6 p.m.</i>

413
00:47:32,683 --> 00:47:35,853
Seriously?
Nah, it's no problem.

414
00:47:37,354 --> 00:47:39,523
Yeah yeah.
Okay, see ya.

415
00:47:41,067 --> 00:47:43,069
Yoshioka's not coming back.

416
00:47:43,903 --> 00:47:44,904
Really?

417
00:47:45,071 --> 00:47:49,450
Everybody's so cold.
Today's your welcome party.

418
00:47:50,576 --> 00:47:51,869
It's just you and me.

419
00:47:53,370 --> 00:47:57,291
Sure, but I still have work to do.

420
00:47:57,792 --> 00:48:00,711
Overtime?
It's dangerous to work alone.

421
00:48:02,046 --> 00:48:03,089
That guard...

422
00:48:06,217 --> 00:48:07,802
Hey Nonomura.
We're going.

423
00:48:08,344 --> 00:48:09,678
Oh, but...

424
00:48:09,845 --> 00:48:11,555
Narushima, you've got work to do?

425
00:48:11,889 --> 00:48:13,182
Yes, a little.

426
00:48:13,349 --> 00:48:14,141
See?

427
00:48:14,308 --> 00:48:17,269
I'll keep her company.
Kurume, after you.

428
00:48:17,937 --> 00:48:19,313
- Nonomura.
- Yes sir?

429
00:48:26,612 --> 00:48:27,613
Let's go.

430
00:48:28,072 --> 00:48:29,115
Yes sir.

431
00:48:29,865 --> 00:48:31,534
Okay Narushima, sorry.

432
00:48:57,101 --> 00:48:58,144
I forgot something.

433
00:48:59,854 --> 00:49:01,772
Nonomura, you go ahead.

434
00:49:03,858 --> 00:49:06,110
What? Go on ahead.

435
00:49:11,323 --> 00:49:12,324
Yes sir.

436
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:55,290
<i>Why...don't you do anything,
I'll do it for you...</i>

437
00:49:57,828 --> 00:49:58,787
Shut him up.

438
00:50:46,544 --> 00:50:49,255
No need to kill him!
You know, right?!

439
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:51,215
No need to kill him!

440
00:50:51,548 --> 00:50:54,009
Please, noooo!

441
00:53:37,131 --> 00:53:40,467
Excuse me, I'm with Section 12.
Seen Kurume?

442
00:53:40,634 --> 00:53:42,511
Kurume? I haven't.

443
00:53:42,886 --> 00:53:43,929
I see...

444
00:53:46,098 --> 00:53:48,308
<i>Human Resources</i>

445
00:54:06,744 --> 00:54:08,662
Narushima? What's up?

446
00:54:09,246 --> 00:54:11,373
Have you seen Kurume?

447
00:54:12,166 --> 00:54:15,711
No. You should've called my extension.

448
00:54:16,378 --> 00:54:18,589
But I can never get through.

449
00:54:18,730 --> 00:54:19,590
What?

450
00:54:21,130 --> 00:54:22,330
Oh.

451
00:54:23,927 --> 00:54:25,345
My secretary's day off?

452
00:54:30,559 --> 00:54:31,643
What's the time?

453
00:54:32,603 --> 00:54:33,729
11 a.m.

454
00:54:34,021 --> 00:54:39,276
11? 9 p.m. in New York.
Too late to call.

455
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:44,364
Sore throat.

456
00:54:45,532 --> 00:54:47,117
No more cigs for me!

457
00:54:47,534 --> 00:54:52,748
If you hear from Kurume,
please tell him to come to Section 12.

458
00:54:53,081 --> 00:54:54,291
Yeah sure.

459
00:54:55,083 --> 00:54:56,251
I'll be going now.

460
00:54:57,127 --> 00:54:58,587
Oh, wait, Narushima.

461
00:54:59,296 --> 00:55:02,674
Sorry, got something
I can drink? Anything?

462
00:55:10,432 --> 00:55:11,808
Ah, that's good.

463
00:55:12,810 --> 00:55:13,852

00:55:15,604 --> 00:55:17,523
Do you know about the new guard?

466
00:55:18,273 --> 00:55:19,233
No.

467
00:55:20,025 --> 00:55:21,026
Oh.

468
00:55:21,777 --> 00:55:22,861
Something wrong?

469
00:55:24,696 --> 00:55:28,742
He's extremely large.
You'll know if you see him.

470
00:55:29,743 --> 00:55:34,289
That man, he wears
an earring of mine that I lost.

471
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,669
It's really creepy.

472
00:55:39,336 --> 00:55:40,420
I'll look into it.

473
00:55:40,963 --> 00:55:42,548
The security office is empty now.

474
00:55:43,507 --> 00:55:44,466
Alright.

475
00:55:46,844 --> 00:55:48,595
I'll sort it out later.

476
00:55:49,054 --> 00:55:50,222
I'd appreciate it.

477
00:55:50,848 --> 00:55:55,894
By the way, Narushima.
Tell Takada in Section 12 for me.

478
00:55:56,854 --> 00:55:59,856
In Kurume's absence,
she's in charge. Okay?

479
00:56:00,399 --> 00:56:01,441
Sure.

480
00:56:05,946 --> 00:56:07,573
Great news, Narushima.

481
00:56:08,073 --> 00:56:11,743
The dealer will sell the Chagall
for 25 million.

482
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:13,328
They will?!

483
00:56:14,162 --> 00:56:18,333
Lots to do. Nonomura,
hurry up with that buyer list.

484
00:56:24,882 --> 00:56:26,258
Hello, Akebono Trading.

485
00:56:26,508 --> 00:56:30,345
Oh, Mr. Sakakibara!
Yes it's me, Takada.

486
00:56:31,179 --> 00:56:34,725
Yes. No, Kurume
is taking the day off.

487
00:56:35,350 --> 00:56:38,520
Yes, so let me help you on his behalf.

488
00:56:42,441 --> 00:56:44,026
More overtime, huh?

489
00:56:44,192 --> 00:56:45,319
So it seems.

490
00:56:48,670 --> 00:56:50,530
<i>Hello, Akebono Corporation.</i>

491
00:56:50,700 --> 00:56:52,670
<i>Thank you for giving us a call.</i>

492
00:56:52,900 --> 00:56:54,130
<i>Yes, we can do that right away.</i>

493
00:56:54,320 --> 00:56:55,870
<i>Yes, it seems like it.</i>

494
00:56:56,420 --> 00:56:58,080
<i>I'm really sorry to bother you.</i>

495
00:56:58,390 --> 00:56:59,980
<i>Not at all.</i>

496
00:57:00,590 --> 00:57:01,010
<i>Yes, of course...</i>

497
00:57:01,168 --> 00:57:02,628
Narushima, can we talk?

498
00:57:03,260 --> 00:57:04,190
Sorry?

499
00:57:04,296 --> 00:57:05,464
Can we talk?

500
00:57:13,805 --> 00:57:14,973
What is it?

501
00:57:15,682 --> 00:57:17,476
Trouble last night?

502
00:57:17,726 --> 00:57:19,853
What? What do you mean?

503
00:57:20,479 --> 00:57:24,524
Kurume isn't here today
because of last night.

504
00:57:25,984 --> 00:57:27,653
He's human too, you know.

505
00:57:28,487 --> 00:57:32,366
I bet he can't bear to
look you in the eyes again.

506
00:57:32,991 --> 00:57:34,785
What happened last night?

507
00:57:35,494 --> 00:57:39,456
He came to you,
while you worked overtime.

508
00:57:40,040 --> 00:57:41,249
He didn't.

509
00:57:41,583 --> 00:57:46,338
I know he did.
I knew, but I couldn't do a thing.

510
00:57:47,297 --> 00:57:49,049
Really, he didn't come.

511
00:57:50,133 --> 00:57:52,427
But he headed back to the office.

512
00:57:53,220 --> 00:57:54,304
He did?

513
00:57:55,722 --> 00:57:58,308
I should've tried to protect you, Narushima.

514
00:57:59,518 --> 00:58:02,646
Nonomura, you've got the wrong idea.

515
00:58:03,522 --> 00:58:06,566
Kurume never returned
last night at all.

516
00:58:07,901 --> 00:58:08,902
Then...

517
00:58:10,570 --> 00:58:11,988
...where has he gone?

518
00:59:25,645 --> 00:59:28,106
Fujimaru! Why do that?!

519
00:59:28,899 --> 00:59:31,276
That girl did nothing wrong!

520
00:59:40,494 --> 00:59:44,164
Why... would you...

521
00:59:50,670 --> 00:59:54,841
It seems you still
don't understand me at all.

522
00:59:55,801 --> 00:59:58,220
No, I understand you.

523
00:59:59,679 --> 01:00:00,889
All too well.

524
01:00:02,390 --> 01:00:04,309
Sorry I interrupted you.

525
01:00:16,196 --> 01:00:17,447
Fujimaru...

526
01:00:18,657 --> 01:00:20,075
Let me go...

527
01:00:21,576 --> 01:00:23,370
I-I won't do anything...

528
01:00:25,664 --> 01:00:26,915
Forgive me!

529
01:00:27,082 --> 01:00:28,917
For what?

530
01:00:28,917 --> 01:00:34,214
J-Just...
let me go... please!

531
01:00:35,340 --> 01:00:36,550
I-I'm begging you!

532
01:00:37,050 --> 01:00:39,386
You said you understand me.

533
01:00:40,387 --> 01:00:41,680
How is that?

534
01:00:41,847 --> 01:00:46,768
M-My spine... My spine...
You're crushing it!

535
01:00:47,018 --> 01:00:50,772
Trying to understand me
is beyond your tolerance.

536
01:00:57,821 --> 01:00:59,072
I'm alive...

537
01:01:01,241 --> 01:01:02,242
Thank you...

538
01:01:03,201 --> 01:01:04,619
I'm alive...

539
01:01:06,746 --> 01:01:08,290
Want to call the police?

540
01:01:12,210 --> 01:01:14,963
Even if you don't,
they'll come soon enough.

541
01:01:16,172 --> 01:01:17,841
Why be so impatient?

542
01:01:19,384 --> 01:01:22,262
I'm not...
I don't mean to be...

543
01:01:24,973 --> 01:01:26,433
Honestly.

544
01:01:28,602 --> 01:01:30,812
Burn me into your memory.

545
01:01:35,358 --> 01:01:36,568
Of course...

546
01:01:37,319 --> 01:01:40,989
Are we clear?
Don't ever forget me.

547
01:02:10,393 --> 01:02:13,230
Okey doke,
I'll go make some coffee.

548
01:02:13,772 --> 01:02:16,358
- Yoshioka, it's okay. I'll make it.
- No, don't worry.

549
01:02:16,650 --> 01:02:18,234
- I will.
- Really.

550
01:02:18,777 --> 01:02:20,654
Sorry. Go for it then.

551
01:04:43,838 --> 01:04:45,298
Are you alright?!

552
01:04:48,468 --> 01:04:52,097
I'll call an ambulance,
so please stay still.

553
01:05:11,866 --> 01:05:15,203
Yoshioka! Oh my god!
Run! Oh my god...

554
01:05:15,370 --> 01:05:19,040
W-Wait a minute!
What are you talking about?

555
01:05:19,999 --> 01:05:22,836
Hey, Nonomura!
She's here after all.

556
01:05:28,591 --> 01:05:32,262
You okay? I was wondering
why you didn't come back.

557
01:05:33,972 --> 01:05:35,849
There's been a murder!

558
01:05:36,010 --> 01:05:36,910
What?

559
01:05:53,283 --> 01:05:55,910
That guard.
You know, the big one.

560
01:06:01,249 --> 01:06:03,251
Watch out!
He might be there.

561
01:06:08,173 --> 01:06:10,884
Narushima,
go back to the 4th floor.

562
01:06:16,097 --> 01:06:17,140
Yoshioka!

563
01:06:47,712 --> 01:06:48,963
This is brutal...

564
01:06:53,760 --> 01:06:54,969
Call the cops quick.

565
01:07:23,456 --> 01:07:24,499
What the...

566
01:07:29,629 --> 01:07:31,381
No good. Line's cut.

567
01:07:35,134 --> 01:07:36,427
Find an exit!

568
01:07:46,271 --> 01:07:47,855
No good.

569
01:07:47,855 --> 01:07:50,942
Let's go back to the 4th floor.
I'm worried about Takada...

570
01:10:05,993 --> 01:10:07,662
It won't work...

571
01:10:09,997 --> 01:10:11,082
Takada!

572
01:10:11,082 --> 01:10:12,125
You came here?

573
01:10:12,458 --> 01:10:16,421
It won't work! What's going on?
The power won't come back.

574
01:10:16,712 --> 01:10:18,423
Forget that, let's run!

575
01:10:18,798 --> 01:10:21,426
There's been a murder.
We'll be next.

576
01:10:22,427 --> 01:10:23,845
What are you talking about?

577
01:10:25,847 --> 01:10:26,973
That guard.

578
01:10:27,265 --> 01:10:28,933
Don't be ridiculous.

579
01:10:30,810 --> 01:10:33,104
Nonomura? Where is he?

580
01:10:33,354 --> 01:10:38,818
Beats me. He came back, said he'd
go make coffee, then left again.

581
01:10:39,861 --> 01:10:41,028
The kitchen!

582
01:10:41,040 --> 01:10:43,114
What? Wait!

583
01:10:49,900 --> 01:10:50,920
Wait!

584
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:13,060
What is this?
What is it?!

585
01:11:14,145 --> 01:11:15,521
We're screwed.

586
01:11:16,147 --> 01:11:17,648
What now, Yoshioka?!

587
01:11:20,026 --> 01:11:23,196
Okay. Let's break a
2nd floor window and jump.

588
01:11:44,383 --> 01:11:47,428
You're that guy.
Your reputation precedes you.

589
01:11:49,347 --> 01:11:51,140
This is even worse though.

590
01:11:54,602 --> 01:11:57,355
Do you know
what you're doing? Huh?

591
01:11:59,982 --> 01:12:01,150
You don't.

592
01:12:02,652 --> 01:12:06,322
Fine. So basically,
you're sick in the head.

593
01:12:10,493 --> 01:12:11,911
I'll go call the cops.

594
01:12:13,496 --> 01:12:14,497
Give me your key.

595
01:12:23,589 --> 01:12:24,674
Okay, let's try this.

596
01:12:28,803 --> 01:12:30,513
Put your key on this wagon.

597
01:12:31,806 --> 01:12:35,560
Then you can go.
You can do that, right?

598
01:12:49,240 --> 01:12:50,283
Come and get it.

599
01:12:52,285 --> 01:12:53,494
I'd rather not.

600
01:12:55,162 --> 01:12:56,330
Change of plans.

601
01:12:57,832 --> 01:13:01,419
I'll look for a way out.
So long.

602
01:13:07,884 --> 01:13:09,302
It's no good.

603
01:13:09,302 --> 01:13:10,386
They're all locked!

604
01:13:10,386 --> 01:13:11,345
That one?!

605
01:13:12,305 --> 01:13:13,347
No good either.

606
01:13:15,391 --> 01:13:18,561
Why no lights?!
Somebody do something!

607
01:13:18,769 --> 01:13:21,272
No use!
The power's turned off!

608
01:13:22,064 --> 01:13:24,859
- We're done for! We can't escape!
- Don't give up.

609
01:13:26,902 --> 01:13:28,154
Hyodo!

610
01:13:28,821 --> 01:13:30,114
Working late too?

611
01:13:31,365 --> 01:13:32,950
All doors are locked.

612
01:13:33,534 --> 01:13:36,829
I see.
He's a clever one.

613
01:13:37,163 --> 01:13:39,957
He's killed twice.
We must do something.

614
01:13:40,541 --> 01:13:41,626
Nobody else left?

615
01:13:41,918 --> 01:13:42,668
No.

616
01:13:42,835 --> 01:13:44,295
Okay. Come to my office.

617
01:14:00,019 --> 01:14:02,188
It's the only door he can't open.

618
01:14:19,538 --> 01:14:23,960
Hyodo, how long do we stay here?
Any good ideas?

619
01:14:24,710 --> 01:14:26,337
I'm trying to think.

620
01:14:28,464 --> 01:14:30,966
How do we reach out for help?

621
01:14:32,718 --> 01:14:34,512
Wave out the window?

622
01:14:35,471 --> 01:14:38,057
Only if somebody's looking
at this hour.

623
01:14:39,558 --> 01:14:42,228
The phone line's cut,
so no fax either.

624
01:14:44,188 --> 01:14:48,943
Hey. What about telex?
That doesn't use the phone line.

625
01:14:50,569 --> 01:14:53,239
Unfortunately, this is HR.
No telex.

626
01:14:53,614 --> 01:14:55,908
- Section 12 has it.
- Who'll go?

627
01:14:57,284 --> 01:14:58,244
I'll go.

628
01:14:58,452 --> 01:15:00,162
Yoshioka, don't go alone.

629
01:15:01,247 --> 01:15:02,289
We'll all go.

630
01:15:02,456 --> 01:15:03,666
Bad idea.

631
01:15:04,667 --> 01:15:07,795
Narushima, I'm a fast runner.
I'll be fine.

632
01:15:08,921 --> 01:15:10,506
He won't catch me.

633
01:15:12,591 --> 01:15:16,971
But who should I send a telex to?
It's midnight.

634
01:15:21,809 --> 01:15:22,935
New York.

635
01:15:29,108 --> 01:15:30,484
Narushima.

636
01:15:32,111 --> 01:15:36,741
I told you Yoshioka's a loser,
but let me take that back.

637
01:15:44,415 --> 01:15:45,916
Great, it'll work!

638
01:19:01,737 --> 01:19:02,696
Hyodo.

639
01:19:03,572 --> 01:19:05,908
I know.
He's been gone too long.

640
01:19:06,533 --> 01:19:07,952
We need to go help.

641
01:19:12,039 --> 01:19:13,582
Might be too late.

642
01:19:13,749 --> 01:19:17,836
I can't go alone. If he's hurt,
I can't carry him.

643
01:19:19,129 --> 01:19:20,214
That's true.

644
01:19:31,308 --> 01:19:33,185
Takada, listen.

645
01:19:33,936 --> 01:19:36,438
Is it over?
Are we saved?

646
01:19:37,481 --> 01:19:38,774
Not yet.

647
01:19:39,149 --> 01:19:40,276
Oh...

648
01:19:41,068 --> 01:19:45,280
Hyodo and I are heading out,
but you stay here.

649
01:19:46,031 --> 01:19:47,658
This room is safe.

650
01:19:49,118 --> 01:19:52,871
Keep the door locked.
We'll knock three times.

651
01:19:53,622 --> 01:19:56,375
Then open it. Okay?

652
01:20:26,030 --> 01:20:28,574
Damn. No telex now.

653
01:20:31,201 --> 01:20:33,287
Oh! Yoshioka!

654
01:20:38,625 --> 01:20:40,627
Yoshioka. Yoshioka!

655
01:20:44,214 --> 01:20:45,382
Did you send a telex?

656
01:20:49,636 --> 01:20:53,140
Good, good!
Way to go.

657
01:21:06,695 --> 01:21:07,780
Who's there?

658
01:21:10,491 --> 01:21:11,658
Narushima?

659
01:21:17,539 --> 01:21:18,707
Hyodo?

660
01:21:21,960 --> 01:21:25,172
Who's there?!
It should be three knocks!

661
01:21:55,244 --> 01:21:57,621
No. I won't open it!

662
01:22:05,796 --> 01:22:07,881
Wait! Don't go!

663
01:22:58,474 --> 01:22:59,683
Stop!

664
01:23:02,436 --> 01:23:04,146
Don't! No!

665
01:23:18,702 --> 01:23:19,745
Don't!

666
01:24:26,728 --> 01:24:27,938
You bastard!

667
01:24:29,731 --> 01:24:30,983
Narushima! Quickly!

668
01:25:25,746 --> 01:25:27,414
Stop. Please stop!

669
01:25:30,042 --> 01:25:33,712
Why? Why do this?!
For what?

670
01:25:39,760 --> 01:25:42,429
To understand requires courage.

671
01:25:44,181 --> 01:25:47,476
I have courage.
Please tell me.

672
01:25:51,063 --> 01:25:53,106
You were unlucky.

673
01:25:54,441 --> 01:25:57,069
Meaning what?
That's no explanation.

674
01:25:58,070 --> 01:25:59,863
I want to understand you.

675
01:26:07,204 --> 01:26:11,291
You can't explain.
So stop this! Please!

676
01:26:11,458 --> 01:26:14,378
You suddenly appeared before me.

677
01:26:16,004 --> 01:26:17,923
This began from that moment.

678
01:26:21,134 --> 01:26:23,303
I knew this would happen.

679
01:26:37,401 --> 01:26:41,446
The time flowing within me
is unlike that of your kind.

680
01:26:42,781 --> 01:26:44,116
What kind of time?

681
01:26:44,366 --> 01:26:46,076
Desolate time.

682
01:26:47,953 --> 01:26:49,454
That can't be.

683
01:26:50,580 --> 01:26:52,874
You're human just like me.

684
01:26:54,126 --> 01:26:56,420
Time flows the same for us all.

685
01:27:03,385 --> 01:27:05,429
You're utterly wrong.

686
01:27:09,182 --> 01:27:11,393
Try using your brain.

687
01:27:13,895 --> 01:27:17,816
Fine. I don't want to
understand you anymore.

688
01:27:18,817 --> 01:27:20,861
So leave me out of this.

689
01:27:22,529 --> 01:27:26,032
Hurry back to your lair.
And never come out!

690
01:27:40,589 --> 01:27:42,215
You're just like them.

691
01:27:43,800 --> 01:27:47,471
You can't believe humans like me
exist in this world.

692
01:27:49,264 --> 01:27:50,599
I won't believe it.

693
01:27:52,184 --> 01:27:54,394
But here I am.

694
01:28:01,943 --> 01:28:03,737
Here ends my explanation.

695
01:28:52,118 --> 01:28:53,662
Don't ever...

696
01:28:56,790 --> 01:28:58,250
...forget me.

697
01:30:34,012 --> 01:30:35,555
Are you alright?

698
01:30:37,098 --> 01:30:38,516
Yoshioka's alive.

699
01:30:49,319 --> 01:30:52,030
Plus, we got a Cezanne
for 8.5 billion.

700
01:31:19,849 --> 01:31:24,145
You see, we got a
strange phone call from New York.

701
01:31:25,980 --> 01:31:27,565
