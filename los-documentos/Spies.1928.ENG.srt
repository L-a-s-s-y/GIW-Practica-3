Fritz Lang's SPIONE was restored between 2003 and 2004

2
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:16,719
by the Friedrich-Wilhelm-Murnau-Stiftung.

3
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:18,797
As no original negative exists, various nitrate copies were used.

4
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:20,558
Due to its length and excellent condition, a copy from the Národni Filmovy Archiv, Prague, formed the restoration's basis,

5
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:22,353
as well as copies from the National Film and Sound Archive in Canberra

6
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,153
and the Cinematheque Francaise in Paris.

7
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:25,998
Some of the intertitles were copied from a copy in Vienna

8
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:28,031
and an internegative in the Moscow Institute Gosfilmofond

9
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:29,184
Lost opening credits were recreated

10
00:00:29,197 --> 00:00:30,331
based on censorship cards.

11
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:32,033
Copying was carried out by L'Immagine Ritrovata in Bologna.

12
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:33,992

Important documents have disappeared!

00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,201
No trace of the perpetrator!

40
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:14,320
Are the officials in charge of state security so asleep on the job

41
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,199
... that our most important documents and secret files...

42
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,993
... can disappear without a trace?

43
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,474

56
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,876
Dear Mr. Jason!

57
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,594
Enclosed please find several new caricatures

58
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:38,758
and opinions expressed by the public concerning your department...

59
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,666
Isn't it time to bring this ridicule of the helplessness

60
00:06:40,679 --> 00:06:42,475
of the Secret Service to an end?

61
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:45,353
The Minister of the Interior.

62
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,992
What's the use of all your precautions in bringing me here

63
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:17,158
when I am secretly photographed by one of your staff in your own office...?

64
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:31,114
Who's paying you... you scoundrel - to inform on me...?!

65
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:40,279
I'd sooner die like a dog than become a traitor!

66
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:31,832
Your fate is in your hands, Vincent... Who are you working for?

67
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,391
Find out for yourself!

68
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:41,400
And may God have mercy on you if you find him!

69
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,473
Who is he talking about - ?!

70
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:07,590
If I knew, No. 326, I wouldn't need you!

71
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:14,239
And the public wouldn't be making a laughing stock of us!

72
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:03,158
It's easy for you to laugh because, fortunately for you, you prevented

73
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:09,071
your picture falling into the hands of this... damned spy...!

74
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:51,999
... and no one knows what this man looks like - ?!

75
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:03,793
A few... people have known... but...

76
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:07,111
I would be sorry, No. 326,

77
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:10,915
if I had to put a cross after your name as well... >

78
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,359
The Enemy...

79
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,996
Copy photos 4 and 6...!

80
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:57,830
Distribute to all members of the surveillance squad!

81
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:06,077
His headquarters...

82
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:48,949
Morrier kidnapped from the gallows.

83
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:53,119
Sensational act prior to execution.

84
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:56,232
Masked perpetrators escape.

85
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:09,792
This time, Morrier, I have saved you from the noose,

86
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:14,596
because I can make good use of a scoundrel like you...

87
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:18,475
But if ever I sign your death sentence...

88
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:31,629
I am a scoundrel, sir, but a grateful scoundrel...

89
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,316
is on her way...

90
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:35,273
... to the Haghi Bank.

91
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:10,035
Miss Barranikowa shall report to me immediately

92
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:13,198
when she returns from Colonel Jellusic.

93
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:23,752
Colonel Jellusic, a man of interest to many people...

94
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:02,519
Are there letters under this box number waiting for me?

95
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:52,229
What box number did this man just pick up letters from?

96
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:25,915
Sorry, Lady Leslane,

97
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:28,839
Director General Haghi would like to see...

98
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:33,238
it will be only two minutes... a formality...

99
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:37,911
because of what happened ihere...

100
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:34,394
I would like to make a proposal, Lady Leslane!

101
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:51,754
I would like to find out from you, as the wife of Roger Leslane

102
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:56,795
when and where the Japanese Secret Treaty will be signed.

103
00:22:56,920 --> 00:23:00,993
.. and who will be present!

104
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,516
If I hear nothing within 48 hours,

105
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:22,669
in the 49th hour your husband

106
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:28,478
will find out just where his wife spends her Tuesday and Friday evenings...

107
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:14,071
Your efforts are futile, Lady Leslane, I have the negatives...

108
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:36,476
I'm richer than Ford, Lady Leslane, even if I pay significantly less in taxes.

109
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:03,679
The day after tomorrow,

110
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:09,591
you will deliver the data in writing to the owner of the opium den you know so well

111
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:13,793
and in exchange you will get the negative...

112
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,799
How far have you gotten with Jellusic?!

113
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:12,991
I've got him eating out of my hand!

114
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:15,924
And for a kiss he'd sell me all his

115
00:27:15,937 --> 00:27:18,752
fortresses and the entire army of his country!

116
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:35,111
You know what to do.
I expect a report tonight!

117
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:04,835
Save me - I shot him - !

118
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:42,713
... he invited me to come see him... about a tour... he...

119
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:49,109
he tried to force me... I didn't know what to do - so I shot him!

120
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:25,837
If you really want to help me... just let me leave!

121
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:07,199
It will be better for you and for me... if we never see each other again!

122
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:07,151
Choose whomever you wish for this project, but keep me out of it!

123
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:09,520
- I don't want to work against this man...

124
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:41,753
He reminds me... of my brother Sascha...

125
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:58,270
All the more reason for you to fight our enemies in the form of this man,

126
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:05,318
enemies who also were the enemies of your father, of your brother, or...

127
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:13,079
Have you forgotten?

128
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:41,430
SENTENCED TO DEATH.

129
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:57,234
They died innocent, two victims of the Ochrana of your Russian Czar -

130
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:13,795
... because they weren't smart enough to keep their thoughts to themselves!

131
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:03,471
My friend!

132
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:10,309
My friend!

133
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:23,430
I owe you an explanation.

134
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:29,833
... I must see you again.

135
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:07,158
Don't tell me you've fallen in love with this fellow - ?

136
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:07,071
My friend! I owe you an explanation and must see you again!

137
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:12,479
Come tomorrow at 4:00 to have...

138
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:21,150
a glass of real Russian tea - with the woman you saved - S.B.

142
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:56,477
I am so happy - so happy - !

143
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:03,716
I, too...

144
00:48:13,160 --> 00:48:15,276
From Russia?

145
00:48:56,880 --> 00:49:00,236
In memory of my father and my brother...

146
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:04,115
they died as victims of the Czarist Ochrana...

147
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:03,633
But, is there nothing at all that you want - ?!

I'll pick you up at 9:00- we'll go to Danielli. Okay?

152
00:53:25,560 --> 00:53:29,758
Wear it forever - it shall bring you luck!

156
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:24,552
Go immediately to J. H.

157
00:59:26,080 --> 00:59:28,674
Pay Jellusic the price demanded in exchange

158
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:31,235
for all the mobilization plans in his possession. Under the condition...

159
00:59:31,360 --> 00:59:33,271
Under the condition...

160
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:37,234
...that he cross the border tonight.

161
00:59:37,360 --> 00:59:41,194
You will not return home, but will report to me immediately. H.

162
01:01:45,720 --> 01:01:47,711
The condition is...

163
01:01:47,840 --> 01:01:52,038
... that you have to cross the border tonight...

164
01:01:57,400 --> 01:02:00,040
But the night is still young, my lovely Sonja...

165
01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:03,391
and you had promised...

166
01:02:16,560 --> 01:02:19,439
The documents...

167
01:03:36,120 --> 01:03:39,317
A farewell kiss, beautiful Sonja...!

168
01:04:18,800 --> 01:04:21,599
A cavalier does not betray his lady!

169
01:06:46,840 --> 01:06:48,592
Drive home!

170
01:07:29,120 --> 01:07:30,633
Are you satisfied now - ?

171
01:08:10,280 --> 01:08:13,671
<So you love that young man?

172
01:09:00,200 --> 01:09:02,635
Your house has been cleared out - you will live

173
01:09:02,760 --> 01:09:05,434
at headquarters and

174
01:09:05,560 --> 01:09:08,313
not leave your room without my permission-

175
01:11:47,280 --> 01:11:52,434
If the Barranikowa woman had not once again been warned in time,

176
01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:57,589
I would have raided her house tonight!

177
01:12:06,480 --> 01:12:12,271
You are hardly the first to have fallen into the trap of this master spy.

178
01:12:47,120 --> 01:12:48,952
Nothing is to deter a man

179
01:12:49,080 --> 01:12:50,673
from the path of duty...

180
01:12:50,840 --> 01:12:52,399
not even a woman...

181
01:14:55,040 --> 01:14:58,999
Why don't you go home, my child?

182
01:16:51,560 --> 01:16:53,836
Please, let me stay here!

183
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:57,391
Don't send me away again!

184
01:16:57,520 --> 01:17:01,593
I won't take up any more space than a little dog...!

185
01:17:32,560 --> 01:17:36,349
Have I offended you? Must I leave again?

186
01:18:47,183 --> 01:18:52,098
When I went looking for the fellow early this morning,

187
01:18:52,223 --> 01:18:56,421
he had already decamped... without a trace!

188
01:19:17,063 --> 01:19:22,012
I'll show you pictures of all the people suspected

189
01:19:22,143 --> 01:19:25,579
of being spies that were taken over the last month...

190
01:20:39,663 --> 01:20:47,663
Colonel Jellusic left this morning at 2:40 on the Orient Express!

191
01:20:54,623 --> 01:20:58,935
Opera Ball 13
General Delivery, Main Post Office

192
01:21:47,663 --> 01:21:55,377
I'll have this man watched by one of our agents as soon as he arrives.

193
01:22:09,583 --> 01:22:14,862
A plane leaves in 45 minutes that will arrive down there.

194
01:22:14,983 --> 01:22:18,135
... two hours after the Orient Express.

195
01:22:28,703 --> 01:22:30,535
The Secret Service

196
01:22:30,663 --> 01:22:32,700
reserves two seats

197
01:22:32,823 --> 01:22:35,736
on the Aero Orient Express.

198
01:22:54,503 --> 01:22:57,495
People like Jellusic can be had for money...!

199
01:22:57,663 --> 01:23:00,655
If I offer him enough...

200
01:23:00,783 --> 01:23:05,857
he'll betray those who are paying him!

201
01:23:39,023 --> 01:23:41,981
Jellusic has to be put out of commission.

202
01:23:42,103 --> 01:23:45,095
Denounce him as a spy to his Commander in Chief

203
01:23:45,223 --> 01:23:47,419
... at General Headquarters!

204
01:25:25,743 --> 01:25:28,257
Good afternoon, Mr. Jellusic...

205
01:26:29,503 --> 01:26:31,062
So you don't deny...?

206
01:26:52,703 --> 01:26:56,094
You are granted one last request, Mr. Jellusic...

207
01:27:17,463 --> 01:27:20,581
I beg - in all - humility...

208
01:28:22,343 --> 01:28:25,973
Surveillance Report Re:Signing of the Japanese Secret Agreement.

209
01:28:26,103 --> 01:28:30,256
Location:Small conference room of the Japanese Embassy.

210
01:28:30,383 --> 01:28:33,421
Time:5:30 a. m.

211
01:28:33,583 --> 01:28:37,294
Present:The two treaty parties,

212
01:28:37,295 --> 01:28:40,660
... and Chief of Secret Service Dr. Matsumoto.

213
01:28:40,783 --> 01:28:44,697
The Embassy will be subject to the most stringent security measures.

214
01:29:16,023 --> 01:29:18,936
I'll have this treaty in my hands tonight!

215
01:29:41,783 --> 01:29:43,296
Gentlemen!

216
01:29:43,423 --> 01:29:46,779
Gentlemen! One of these envelopes contains the most important treaty

217
01:29:46,903 --> 01:29:49,941
Japan has concluded in a century...

218
01:29:53,383 --> 01:29:56,421
You'll take three different routes to Tokyo... Whoever does not deliver

219
01:29:56,583 --> 01:30:01,532
his letter with its seal unbroken

220
01:30:01,663 --> 01:30:05,577
is not worthy of being called a Japanese!

221
01:31:27,583 --> 01:31:31,577
Whose blood am I to wear around my neck, Haghi?

222
01:31:41,143 --> 01:31:43,293
I called you, Sonja,

223
01:31:43,423 --> 01:31:45,255
to clear things...

224
01:31:45,383 --> 01:31:47,294
... between you and me.

225
01:32:07,703 --> 01:32:09,614
Where is - he - ?!

226
01:32:16,183 --> 01:32:21,861
He's trying to trace you through Jellusic.

227
01:32:43,543 --> 01:32:45,898
SUDDEN DEATH OF COLONEL M.O. JELLUSIC.

228
01:32:46,023 --> 01:32:49,254
As we learned after press time,

229
01:32:49,423 --> 01:32:52,575
Jellusic, colonel extraordinaire at General Headquarters,

230
01:32:52,703 --> 01:32:55,741
has died of a heart attack shortly after returning from a holiday trip.

231
01:33:46,743 --> 01:33:49,417
20,000 pounds... in new bank notes -

232
01:33:49,543 --> 01:33:52,740
with consecutive serial numbers...!

233
01:34:07,623 --> 01:34:10,456
A blank telegram, please!

234
01:34:56,263 --> 01:34:59,142
Find out immediately to whom the State Bank.

235
01:34:59,303 --> 01:35:01,692
has issued notes in denominations of one thousand with...

236
01:35:01,823 --> 01:35:04,861
... with consecutive numbers from 0319726 to 0319745 Stop

237
01:35:04,983 --> 01:35:06,860
Return with next flight.

238
01:36:01,783 --> 01:36:03,137
A special call...!

239
01:36:23,943 --> 01:36:26,059
What - ?! The bank note numbers?!

240
01:36:43,343 --> 01:36:48,463
You have to make up your mind, Sonja. Are you on my side - against him?

241
01:36:58,303 --> 01:37:03,537
You still don't seem to know what I am capable of!

242
01:38:59,543 --> 01:39:02,740
I have other irons in the fire...

243
01:40:22,183 --> 01:40:27,132
- the house shall be yours... you will live

244
01:40:27,263 --> 01:40:30,574
there as a little princess...

245
01:40:38,623 --> 01:40:40,500
I have to go, Kitty...!

246
01:40:49,263 --> 01:40:51,857
But not so fast - ! Not so fast - !

247
01:40:51,983 --> 01:40:54,372
Just a few more hours - !

248
01:40:54,503 --> 01:40:57,461
A few meagre hours...

249
01:41:29,823 --> 01:41:35,421
Don't you see that I will die - if you leave me - ?

250
01:41:43,463 --> 01:41:48,333
As surely as I shall win this battle, Sonja, I will defeat him...

251
01:41:48,503 --> 01:41:53,976
Do you nevertheless stick to your decision?!?

252
01:42:08,503 --> 01:42:14,374
And how long are you planning to keep me prisoner?

253
01:42:17,783 --> 01:42:22,619
Until one of us is the victor, Sonja - he or I!

254
01:47:13,263 --> 01:47:16,255
No. 326, who is coming back tonight, has sent us a radiogram that falls into your field of expertise...

255
01:47:43,143 --> 01:47:45,134
Read it for yourself!

256
01:47:45,263 --> 01:47:48,619
This matter has to be taken care of before No. 326 returns!

257
01:47:50,963 --> 01:47:53,120
Find out immediately to whom the State Bank

258
01:47:53,143 --> 01:47:54,861
has issued notes in denominations of one thousand...

259
01:47:54,983 --> 01:47:57,423
... with consecutive numbers 0319726 to 0319745. STOP Return by next plane.

260
01:48:24,543 --> 01:48:30,539
So I'll come tonight with No. 326 to your dressing room!

261
01:48:48,983 --> 01:48:52,453
I'll take care of the postal censorship

262
01:48:52,583 --> 01:48:57,498
- You see to it that all borders are closed!

263
01:48:57,623 --> 01:49:02,538
If the treaty falls into the wrong hands, the war in the East is all but declared!

264
01:49:29,063 --> 01:49:31,339
It's the last car -

265
01:49:31,463 --> 01:49:33,977
... and it will happen in the tunnel...

266
01:49:34,103 --> 01:49:36,379
if No. 326 falls into the trap

267
01:50:04,023 --> 01:50:12,023
I have told you, Sonja, you will be free when one of us two men triumphs...

268
01:50:18,023 --> 01:50:21,778
It is I who have been conquered... because I need you!

269
01:50:27,703 --> 01:50:32,015
No one but you is skilful enough to bring

270
01:50:32,143 --> 01:50:35,454
the photos of the treaty across the closed border...

271
01:50:35,583 --> 01:50:39,213
Do me this one last service...

272
01:50:39,343 --> 01:50:43,541
... and the road to the man you love will be open!

273
01:51:15,543 --> 01:51:22,256
And you swear that he will be safe from you in the future if I say yes - ?

274
01:52:25,543 --> 01:52:28,192
I believe they'll use a foreigner

275
01:52:28,193 --> 01:52:30,777
to take the stolen treaty across the border

276
01:52:30,903 --> 01:52:36,774
- and the sudden departure of the Russian courier is,

277
01:52:36,943 --> 01:52:40,299
at the very least, suspicious...

278
01:52:44,543 --> 01:52:48,298
... the more so now that 719 has determinedd

279
01:52:48,423 --> 01:52:52,417
that the bank notes for Jellusic also came from Russian hands...

280
01:53:08,143 --> 01:53:11,374
Unfortunately, I cannot leave here without destroying my cover

281
01:53:11,503 --> 01:53:14,700
and jeopardizing my work as No. 719

282
01:53:14,823 --> 01:53:17,941
But anyway I booked the neighboring compartment...

283
01:53:18,063 --> 01:53:21,260
... to that of the Russian messenger...

284
01:53:40,543 --> 01:53:42,819
Around 6 a.m. you will cross the border

285
01:53:42,943 --> 01:53:44,661
that is the decisive moment!

286
01:55:08,303 --> 01:55:12,934
I almost forgot what I found the other day...

287
02:01:36,343 --> 02:01:40,576
The last car of the express train...

288
02:01:40,703 --> 02:01:42,979
- crashed in the tunnel... -

289
02:04:51,103 --> 02:04:54,016
You wretch!

290
02:04:54,143 --> 02:04:59,343
Did Haghi send you to make sure that his damned plan was successful

291
02:05:02,503 --> 02:05:06,212
You don't intend to betray us, do you... you scoundrel...?

292
02:09:30,063 --> 02:09:32,976
Attention. Central. Central. Central..!

293
02:09:38,343 --> 02:09:40,459
Attention. Central. Central. Central..!

294
02:09:46,663 --> 02:09:48,813
Attention. Central. Central. Central..!

295
02:09:48,943 --> 02:09:51,981
No. 326 is alive - ! Sonja has betrayed us - !

296
02:11:44,863 --> 02:11:48,140
We wish to talk to Director Haghi.

297
02:11:53,383 --> 02:11:57,377
Gentlemen, what could the police be looking for here - ?

298
02:12:01,623 --> 02:12:04,934
A criminal - and the proof of his crime!

299
02:12:17,383 --> 02:12:23,095
I order you to hand over to me the keys to all of the bank safes!

300
02:14:00,463 --> 02:14:03,421
If the bank is not vacated within 15 minutes of receiving

301
02:14:03,543 --> 02:14:06,535
this note, and the police have not withdrawn completely...

302
02:14:06,663 --> 02:14:09,132
...the woman you love, whom I hold in my power, will die.

303
02:14:37,903 --> 02:14:41,862
You have 14 minutes to live, Sonja,

304
02:14:41,983 --> 02:14:45,578
... if he chooses not to obey me!

305
02:15:07,623 --> 02:15:10,581
People's lives - in danger - !

306
02:15:10,703 --> 02:15:14,139
The bank must be searched within 13 minutes,

307
02:15:14,263 --> 02:15:17,096
and Haghi's secret room found - do you understand? -

308
02:16:45,983 --> 02:16:49,294
Burn all papers...dynamite the safes...

309
02:16:49,423 --> 02:16:53,542
In ten minutes the bank will be filled with gas!

310
02:17:03,183 --> 02:17:08,462
Soon, Sonja, you will know all about the secrets of death.

311
02:17:08,623 --> 02:17:12,776
- take with you a secret from my life!

312
02:18:17,303 --> 02:18:22,855
The bank has been searched down to the foundations

313
02:18:22,983 --> 02:18:26,294
- there is no trace of a secret exit.

314
02:24:19,423 --> 02:24:20,254
Where is Haghi?

315
02:24:20,383 --> 02:24:21,976
10,000 MARKS REWARD!

316
02:24:22,103 --> 02:24:23,463
Who has seen the man pictured,

317
02:24:23,464 --> 02:24:25,264
above, Bank Director Haghi, since midday?

318
02:24:25,343 --> 02:24:28,495
Any type of information leading to his arrest..

319
02:24:28,623 --> 02:24:30,341
... will receive the reward offered

320
02:24:46,983 --> 02:24:48,781
WANTED

321
02:25:06,383 --> 02:25:08,057
Not even a mouse would be able to leave the city

322
02:25:08,058 --> 02:25:09,341
he has to be here somewhere...

323
02:25:20,063 --> 02:25:22,862
There's a small error... I want to report...

324
02:25:29,023 --> 02:25:33,301
It's just that... the numbers on the thousand pound notes...

325
02:25:33,423 --> 02:25:37,496
which I have to deliver a receipt for...

326
02:25:37,623 --> 02:25:40,456
The telegram contains different numbers!

327
02:26:04,343 --> 02:26:06,984
No. 719... has switched the telegrams...! The Clown Nemo is Haghi!

328
02:27:54,743 --> 02:27:58,702
A little music please - Mr. Conductor - !

329
02:29:32,023 --> 02:29:33,377
Curtain - !

330
02:29:44,278 --> 02:29:46,378
The End
