1
00:03:27,133 --> 00:03:28,174
I have a few more ques--

2
00:03:31,216 --> 00:03:33,841
I can't make it stop!

3
00:03:56,716 --> 00:03:59,924
I used to make things without
it all being so complicated

4
00:04:01,966 --> 00:04:03,424
I was 22.

5
00:04:04,966 --> 00:04:06,424
Hold!

6
00:04:07,383 --> 00:04:09,383
I'm gonna come in and get wide.

7
00:04:11,549 --> 00:04:12,924
You ready for wide, Ma?

8
00:04:14,258 --> 00:04:16,341
<i>Gazing upon my mom.</i>

9
00:04:16,341 --> 00:04:18,924
Go down to Barbara's feet.

10
00:04:20,341 --> 00:04:21,424
<i>One of them.</i>

11
00:04:23,091 --> 00:04:24,133
Go!

12
00:04:26,299 --> 00:04:29,008
<i>A parallax fantasy.</i>

13
00:04:29,758 --> 00:04:33,549
<i>My mom performs
her period piece.</i>

14
00:04:34,299 --> 00:04:38,299
<i>The mime-ic
embodiment of the ovaries.</i>

15
00:04:39,091 --> 00:04:40,716
<i>Fallopian tubes.</i>

16
00:04:40,841 --> 00:04:42,133
<i>Uterus.</i>

17
00:04:42,341 --> 00:04:43,716
<i>Cervix.</i>

18
00:04:44,966 --> 00:04:46,424
<i>Ovulation.</i>

19
00:04:48,549 --> 00:04:51,549
<i>The creation of the egg.</i>

20
00:04:52,133 --> 00:04:53,758
<i>Its release.</i>

21
00:04:54,633 --> 00:04:56,049
<i>Its journey.</i>

22
00:04:56,549 --> 00:04:57,924
<i>Its weight.</i>

23
00:05:02,424 --> 00:05:03,924
<i>Menstruation.</i>

24
00:05:09,341 --> 00:05:10,633
Stay right where you are.

25
00:05:10,633 --> 00:05:13,883
<i>And I never showed
this film to anyone.</i>

26
00:05:14,049 --> 00:05:15,841
<i>- I'm sorry, are you cold?
- No, I'm just--</i>

27
00:05:16,966 --> 00:05:18,633
I'll warm up in a second.

28
00:05:18,633 --> 00:05:20,674
It's, it's, it's...
I promise it looks good.

29
00:05:20,674 --> 00:05:22,133
You can't even
really see your feet.

30
00:05:22,133 --> 00:05:24,091
Okay, are you ready?

31
00:05:25,008 --> 00:05:28,133
<i>Many years after this,
I received an email.</i>

32
00:05:29,174 --> 00:05:30,758
<i>It was from a new website.</i>

33
00:05:30,758 --> 00:05:33,258
<i>They wanted content
based on a theme.</i>

34
00:05:34,174 --> 00:05:35,424
<i>Female Trouble.</i>

35
00:05:35,424 --> 00:05:38,924
<i>They wanted to know
if I wanted to pitch an idea.</i>

36
00:05:38,924 --> 00:05:41,799
<i>I wrote back, "Is this
a John Waters thing?"</i>

37
00:05:42,799 --> 00:05:44,591
<i>They wrote back, "No."</i>

38
00:05:44,883 --> 00:05:47,549
She created this mime-ic...

39
00:05:47,549 --> 00:05:50,633
<i>Still I had heard that
the website had a lot of money.</i>

40
00:05:51,133 --> 00:05:52,299
<i>And...</i>

41
00:05:53,174 --> 00:05:55,383
<i>I thought of
my mom's period piece.</i>

42
00:05:56,841 --> 00:05:58,508
<i>At the meeting, I was nervous.</i>

43
00:05:58,716 --> 00:06:01,091
<i>Sweating, undulating.</i>

44
00:06:01,799 --> 00:06:03,174
<i>Just like my mom.</i>

45
00:06:04,174 --> 00:06:05,633
<i>The one who's a mime.</i>

46
00:06:05,633 --> 00:06:07,341
My mom is a mime.

47
00:06:07,633 --> 00:06:10,174
<i>I pitched the full performance,</i>

48
00:06:10,299 --> 00:06:13,216
<i>this time complete
with comedic sound effects.</i>

49
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:25,799
<i>Everybody was laughing
and I was sweating,</i>

50
00:06:25,799 --> 00:06:27,549
<i>and they even floated the idea</i>

51
00:06:27,549 --> 00:06:30,299
<i>of someday making
a feature film together.</i>

52
00:06:30,299 --> 00:06:32,049
Are you married to this idea?

53
00:06:32,591 --> 00:06:34,966
Or are you open to,
I don't know,

54
00:06:34,966 --> 00:06:38,008
maybe something
more narrative?

55
00:06:40,258 --> 00:06:42,008
<i>At the end of it all
we shook hands</i>

56
00:06:42,008 --> 00:06:44,466
<i>and they promised to be in touch.</i>

57
00:06:48,841 --> 00:06:51,049
<i>I went home, I waited.</i>

58
00:06:52,174 --> 00:06:55,383
<i>I felt dirty for dragging
my moms into that building.</i>

59
00:06:58,758 --> 00:07:01,341
<i>A week later
I received an email.</i>

60
00:07:01,341 --> 00:07:03,091
<i>The website liked me,</i>

61
00:07:03,091 --> 00:07:05,883
<i>but they thought that
my idea was too...</i>

62
00:07:05,883 --> 00:07:07,299
<i>...ass-oteric.</i>

63
00:07:08,133 --> 00:07:10,633
<i>I didn't know
what ass-oteric meant,</i>

64
00:07:10,633 --> 00:07:12,299
<i>so I asked my new boyfriend.</i>

65
00:07:12,799 --> 00:07:15,008
<i>He said it was
pronounced with an "ES",</i>

66
00:07:15,174 --> 00:07:18,174
<i>not an "ASS", and told me
to look it up.</i>

67
00:07:23,966 --> 00:07:25,716
<i>Esoteric.</i>

68
00:07:25,716 --> 00:07:28,091
<i>Adjective from</i> esōterō,

69
00:07:28,091 --> 00:07:29,216
<i>meaning inner.</i>

70
00:07:29,591 --> 00:07:32,674
<i>Intended for or likely to be
understood by</i>

71
00:07:32,674 --> 00:07:35,133
<i>only a small number of people.</i>

72
00:07:35,924 --> 00:07:37,008
Esoteric.

73
00:07:37,758 --> 00:07:38,841
Esoteric.

74
00:07:39,883 --> 00:07:41,549
E-so-te-ric.

75
00:07:41,549 --> 00:07:43,591
<i>I didn't know what was so...</i>

76
00:07:43,883 --> 00:07:47,174
<i>esoteric about
my mom's period piece.</i>

77
00:07:48,383 --> 00:07:49,924
<i>The website wanted
to know if I wanted</i>

78
00:07:49,924 --> 00:07:51,549
<i>to direct a different video.</i>

79
00:07:51,883 --> 00:07:53,299
<i>One in which
little girls talked about</i>

80
00:07:53,299 --> 00:07:55,341
<i>what they dreamed
of being when they grew up.</i>

81
00:07:55,466 --> 00:07:57,591
<i>But instead of
little girl dreams,</i>

82
00:07:58,091 --> 00:08:00,008
<i>it was little boy dreams.</i>

83
00:08:00,174 --> 00:08:02,216
<i>You know, lawyer,</i>

84
00:08:02,799 --> 00:08:03,966
<i>fireman,</i>

85
00:08:04,133 --> 00:08:05,549
<i>football player,</i>

86
00:08:06,466 --> 00:08:07,841
<i>filmmaker.</i>

87
00:08:09,216 --> 00:08:11,674
<i>I wished I was
the kind of person</i>

88
00:08:11,674 --> 00:08:13,883
<i>who wanted to
direct that video.</i>

89
00:08:15,383 --> 00:08:16,924
<i>I wished because...</i>

90
00:08:18,174 --> 00:08:21,549
<i>movies about
the pain of being female</i>

91
00:08:21,549 --> 00:08:23,383
<i>were awash with money.</i>

92
00:08:25,758 --> 00:08:26,966
But instead I wrote...

93
00:08:27,591 --> 00:08:29,008
Dear So and So,

94
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:31,008
I think that probably

95
00:08:31,008 --> 00:08:33,633
the most "female" thing
for me to do

96
00:08:33,633 --> 00:08:36,799
would be to "realize"
your "vision"

97
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:39,383
and "direct" this "video."

98
00:08:40,133 --> 00:08:43,299
That being said, as a person,

99
00:08:43,424 --> 00:08:46,299
I don't think
the Idea is a good one,

100
00:08:46,299 --> 00:08:48,883
and I hate not having
a choice.

101
00:08:49,924 --> 00:08:52,049
<i>A better video would be</i>

102
00:08:52,049 --> 00:08:54,924
<i>of a female filmmaker
pitching an idea to a website,</i>

103
00:08:54,924 --> 00:08:56,799
<i>and the website calling the idea</i>

104
00:08:56,799 --> 00:08:58,133
<i>assoteric.</i>

105
00:08:58,299 --> 00:09:01,133
And then telling the
female filmmaker what to do.

106
00:09:03,091 --> 00:09:04,549
<i>And then I signed it.</i>

107
00:09:07,091 --> 00:09:09,674
<i>And maybe the most female trouble
part of it all was</i>

108
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:11,049
<i>that I walked
into that meeting</i>

109
00:09:11,049 --> 00:09:13,216
<i>having already made
a feature film.</i>

110
00:09:14,549 --> 00:09:16,966
<i>But I didn't have
the words to say it.</i>

111
00:09:23,424 --> 00:09:25,258
I don't feel female.

112
00:09:26,633 --> 00:09:28,716
Until somebody tells me I am.

113
00:09:37,091 --> 00:09:39,466
<i>Dude, you got this.
Just like, say action with authority.</i>

114
00:09:43,216 --> 00:09:45,091
Right, left...

115
00:09:45,716 --> 00:09:47,216
- And you say...
- Action.

116
00:09:47,883 --> 00:09:48,924
Action.

117
00:09:48,924 --> 00:09:50,383
- Action. Action.
- Action.

118
00:09:51,049 --> 00:09:52,299
- Action. Action!
- You just yell it.

119
00:09:52,591 --> 00:09:54,591
- Action. Action.
- Action.

120
00:09:55,383 --> 00:09:56,883
Action!

121
00:09:57,008 --> 00:09:58,299
- Action!
- Action!

122
00:09:59,982 --> 00:10:01,024
Action!

123
00:10:01,024 --> 00:10:03,549
<i>Okay, it starts here.</i>

124
00:10:04,383 --> 00:10:05,633
<i>12 years ago.</i>

125
00:10:06,174 --> 00:10:09,008
<i>The day I drove past the lake.</i>

126
00:10:10,341 --> 00:10:11,799
<i>The lake whose
shore was home</i>

127
00:10:11,799 --> 00:10:15,133
<i>to one of the US of A's
first moving picture studios,</i>

128
00:10:15,133 --> 00:10:18,174
<i>specializing in
'damsel in distress' films</i>

129
00:10:19,299 --> 00:10:20,466
<i>The lake so deep</i>

130
00:10:20,466 --> 00:10:23,008
<i>that after the studio's
flammable nitrate films</i>

131
00:10:23,008 --> 00:10:24,133
<i>were thrown into it</i>

132
00:10:24,716 --> 00:10:26,216
<i>they were never recovered.</i>

133
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:31,758
<i>I drove past the lake
and into my hometown.</i>

134
00:10:32,091 --> 00:10:36,466
<i>A hometown with that hill
filled with failed communes.</i>

135
00:10:38,383 --> 00:10:41,008
<i>The same communes
that my moms</i>

136
00:10:41,841 --> 00:10:43,716
<i>and dad fled to.</i>

137
00:10:48,633 --> 00:10:50,816
<i>In my hometown
as a young woman,</i>

138
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:53,883
<i>I felt the
vicious cycle of birth.</i>

139
00:10:54,883 --> 00:10:58,049
<i>Giving birth and death.</i>

140
00:11:07,466 --> 00:11:11,174
<i>Nevertheless I returned
home to make this film.</i>

141
00:11:12,341 --> 00:11:17,258
<i>My first feature film
with my family and my friends.</i>

142
00:11:21,008 --> 00:11:22,549
<i>I was 25.</i>

143
00:11:32,716 --> 00:11:34,299
So good.

144
00:11:35,549 --> 00:11:38,008
Hey Vita!
How do I look?

145
00:11:38,633 --> 00:11:40,133
Is that them?

146
00:11:40,383 --> 00:11:41,924
Yeah. What, you haven't met them?

147
00:11:41,924 --> 00:11:42,966
No.

148
00:11:42,966 --> 00:11:44,716
Holy shit, you're so shy.

149
00:11:44,924 --> 00:11:46,341
Hey guys, come on.

150
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:47,799
- Circle up!
- Circle up!

151
00:11:47,799 --> 00:11:49,341
I have a couple
of announcements

152
00:11:49,341 --> 00:11:51,424
before we,
before we get started.

153
00:11:52,424 --> 00:11:54,966
So the first announcement is

154
00:11:55,174 --> 00:11:59,133
I trust you all so
inherently and implicitly,

155
00:11:59,133 --> 00:12:01,758
and chemically
and emotionally

156
00:12:01,758 --> 00:12:05,299
and spiritually,
conceptually,

157
00:12:05,299 --> 00:12:06,383
no matter what,

158
00:12:06,383 --> 00:12:08,299
and I really hope
you can trust me too.

159
00:12:08,508 --> 00:12:11,216
We are all the
authors of this film.

160
00:12:11,341 --> 00:12:13,174
And the second
announcement, thank you,

161
00:12:13,924 --> 00:12:16,054
is that there's this old guy

162
00:12:16,054 --> 00:12:17,549
who lives down the road
from my moms'.

163
00:12:17,549 --> 00:12:18,883
He will offer you weed.

164
00:12:18,883 --> 00:12:20,133
It is goblin weed.

165
00:12:20,133 --> 00:12:22,091
Do not smoke it.
Do not smoke it.

166
00:12:22,091 --> 00:12:23,008
I'm telling you--

167
00:12:23,008 --> 00:12:24,591
- I have to smoke goblin weed!
- Do not smoke, do not...

168
00:12:24,591 --> 00:12:27,133
- If a goblin offers me weed...
- It is nasty, powerful little shit!

169
00:12:27,133 --> 00:12:31,008
<i>The crew consisted of Sam,
the assistant director.</i>

170
00:12:31,008 --> 00:12:32,799
- Not the producer?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

171
00:12:33,091 --> 00:12:35,299
<i>Alexis, the cinematographer.</i>

172
00:12:35,299 --> 00:12:36,591
But we're more like sisters.

173
00:12:36,758 --> 00:12:38,216
- <i>Bobby.</i>
- Hi! Pleasure.

174
00:12:38,216 --> 00:12:40,133
<i>Alexis's assistant.</i>

175
00:12:40,924 --> 00:12:42,883
<i>She had given him head once.</i>

176
00:12:43,133 --> 00:12:44,591
<i>JJ, the designer.</i>

177
00:12:45,441 --> 00:12:47,483
<i>I had given him head twice.</i>

178
00:12:47,483 --> 00:12:49,508
<i>And... Dustin.</i>

179
00:12:49,508 --> 00:12:51,966
- Hey baby, you're back!
- It's good to be back!

180
00:12:52,174 --> 00:12:53,883
- Hi baby.
- Hey. Hey.

181
00:12:53,883 --> 00:12:55,799
- How you doing?
- I'm good.

182
00:12:55,799 --> 00:12:57,549
I had this like
really intense dream

183
00:12:57,549 --> 00:12:59,924
that you were like with someone
else, and I like woke up

184
00:12:59,924 --> 00:13:01,258
with this like weird taste
in my mouth.

185
00:13:01,258 --> 00:13:03,966
- Sorry.
- No, it's fine.

186
00:13:04,591 --> 00:13:06,424
- It's all just a dream.
- Yeah.

187
00:13:07,341 --> 00:13:08,645
Hey, I got a...

188
00:13:10,758 --> 00:13:11,716
it's like a little...

189
00:13:12,841 --> 00:13:14,216
heart-shaped rock.

190
00:13:15,633 --> 00:13:17,216
For luck or something.

191
00:13:17,216 --> 00:13:19,341
- So nice. Thank you.
- Yeah.

192
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:21,883
Okay, I gotta get back to work.
Okay guys, let's go!

193
00:13:21,883 --> 00:13:24,091
Let's go! Let's do it.
Let's make a movie. Yeah!

194
00:13:25,383 --> 00:13:26,258
What about him?

195
00:13:26,424 --> 00:13:28,549
Oh great, sound guy.
Wait, tell me your name again.

196
00:13:29,008 --> 00:13:31,174
I'm so fucking bad
at remembering names.

197
00:13:31,799 --> 00:13:33,174
Oh shit, Sam, Sam, Sam.

198
00:13:33,174 --> 00:13:34,508
It's the guy.
Can you talk to him?

199
00:13:34,508 --> 00:13:35,924
So I am the producer?

200
00:13:35,924 --> 00:13:37,466
- Yeah?
- You gonna introduce me?

201
00:13:37,466 --> 00:13:39,424
Oh, right!
Okay guys, guys, wait.

202
00:13:40,049 --> 00:13:41,174
This is Dina.

203
00:13:42,091 --> 00:13:43,341
This is Dina.

204
00:13:45,008 --> 00:13:46,841
- Go ahead, introduce yourself.
- Okay...

205
00:13:46,966 --> 00:13:49,174
Hi, I'm Dina.

206
00:13:49,299 --> 00:13:50,883
I've never been
in a film before.

207
00:13:51,174 --> 00:13:53,008
I play the main character.

208
00:13:53,174 --> 00:13:55,008
I don't think she has
a name yet.

209
00:13:55,508 --> 00:13:56,883
But I've watched
tons of movies.

210
00:13:56,883 --> 00:13:58,508
All right, let's get into it.

211
00:13:58,508 --> 00:14:00,841
- Yeah!
- Okay!

212
00:14:02,841 --> 00:14:04,633
Oh, phones! Okay...

213
00:14:04,633 --> 00:14:07,091
<i>It was the middle
of what could be described</i>

214
00:14:07,091 --> 00:14:11,466
<i>as a revolutionary decade
in moving images.</i>

215
00:14:12,216 --> 00:14:15,216
<i>The aftermath of
a world financial collapse</i>

216
00:14:15,216 --> 00:14:18,049
<i>coupled with the rise of
the first affordable</i>

217
00:14:18,174 --> 00:14:21,258
<i>and professional
digital moving image cameras</i>

218
00:14:21,258 --> 00:14:24,549
<i>created an era of
micro-budget filmmaking.</i>

219
00:14:28,591 --> 00:14:32,716
<i>I had $4525.</i>

220
00:14:33,466 --> 00:14:34,383
Action.

221
00:14:35,383 --> 00:14:36,466
Action.

222
00:14:38,174 --> 00:14:39,133
Action.

223
00:14:40,633 --> 00:14:43,299
<i>So we did what we had to do.</i>

224
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:44,299
Squeeze in!

225
00:14:45,133 --> 00:14:46,174
<i>We begged,</i>

226
00:14:46,424 --> 00:14:47,633
<i>we borrowed,</i>

227
00:14:48,174 --> 00:14:49,258
<i>we stole.</i>

228
00:14:51,424 --> 00:14:54,439
<i>And before we get too far,
I should tell you</i>

229
00:14:56,049 --> 00:14:57,091
<i>it was bad.</i>

230
00:14:58,008 --> 00:15:01,799
<i>And I was on
a lot of Adderall.</i>

231
00:15:03,799 --> 00:15:05,758
<i>which is probably why</i>

232
00:15:05,758 --> 00:15:08,466
<i>I can't remember
the sound guy's name.</i>

233
00:15:22,633 --> 00:15:24,049
Vita, he's almost here!

234
00:15:24,258 --> 00:15:25,466
Oh, oh, okay!

235
00:15:25,674 --> 00:15:26,674
- Yeah, okay.
- Okay.

236
00:15:28,591 --> 00:15:29,966
How we doing? We good?

237
00:15:29,966 --> 00:15:31,549
Okay, great!
Great, great, great.

238
00:15:31,549 --> 00:15:33,674
- Forty five seconds!
- Oh shit! Oh, all right. Here we go.

239
00:15:33,674 --> 00:15:36,174
Here we go! We're ready!
We're ready. Okay. Okay.

240
00:15:37,008 --> 00:15:38,133
All right, guys!

241
00:15:38,133 --> 00:15:39,799
Alright, JJ, get the fuck out!
Come on!

242
00:15:39,799 --> 00:15:41,758
Guys! We gotta go,
we gotta go!

243
00:15:41,758 --> 00:15:42,799
Buddy, get out--

244
00:15:42,799 --> 00:15:44,216
We gotta go! Let's go!
Let's--

245
00:15:44,216 --> 00:15:45,674
JJ! Come on, come on!

246
00:15:45,674 --> 00:15:46,716
We gotta go! Okay...

247
00:15:46,716 --> 00:15:48,341
- And...
- Hold on, hold on!

248
00:15:48,841 --> 00:15:50,216
And action!

249
00:15:58,091 --> 00:16:00,091
Ten! Nine!

250
00:16:00,091 --> 00:16:03,133
Eight! Seven! Six!

251
00:16:03,133 --> 00:16:06,174
Five! Four! Three!

252
00:16:06,174 --> 00:16:07,216
Two!

253
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:08,341
One!

254
00:16:10,466 --> 00:16:13,966
<i>I remember I paid
Airplane Andy 50 bucks.</i>

255
00:16:15,091 --> 00:16:16,966
<i>He built the plane in his garage</i>

256
00:16:18,174 --> 00:16:19,799
<i>and taught himself to fly.</i>

257
00:16:24,424 --> 00:16:27,133
<i>He was willing to do
as many takes as I wanted</i>

258
00:16:28,924 --> 00:16:31,633
<i>to make it feel real.</i>

259
00:16:32,758 --> 00:16:34,258
Cut! Whoa!

260
00:16:35,383 --> 00:16:37,508
I got it, I got it, I got it.

261
00:16:37,508 --> 00:16:40,841
Yeah, I mean that--
you can--

262
00:16:41,258 --> 00:16:42,299
You okay?

263
00:16:42,299 --> 00:16:43,508
Are you okay?

264
00:16:43,674 --> 00:16:44,799
- Amazing!
- Vita!

265
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:46,383
- Okay...
- Vita, um...

266
00:16:46,549 --> 00:16:47,591
We were rolling, right?

267
00:16:47,591 --> 00:16:48,633
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Okay.

268
00:16:48,633 --> 00:16:50,091
He wants to do it again
even closer,

269
00:16:50,091 --> 00:16:51,591
and then pull out
at the very last second.

270
00:16:51,591 --> 00:16:54,174
<i>But I'm sure I cut
him off after three.</i>

271
00:16:55,236 --> 00:16:57,966
<i>'cause he kept flying closer...</i>

272
00:16:57,966 --> 00:16:59,174
You want to do another?

273
00:16:59,174 --> 00:17:00,549
<i>and closer</i>

274
00:17:01,716 --> 00:17:02,924
<i>and closer.</i>

275
00:17:03,424 --> 00:17:04,549
Hey...

276
00:17:06,424 --> 00:17:09,049
Fuck me, man,
come as close as you want.

277
00:17:09,716 --> 00:17:11,591
Okay. Yeah, let's go.

278
00:17:11,591 --> 00:17:15,174
<i>It was a primal experience.</i>

279
00:18:18,133 --> 00:18:19,799
Did you cum?

280
00:18:20,633 --> 00:18:22,716
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

281
00:18:24,591 --> 00:18:25,799
Where?

282
00:18:31,549 --> 00:18:32,716
What do you mean?

283
00:18:37,924 --> 00:18:39,883
- Shit, sorry.
- Oh fuck.

284
00:18:39,883 --> 00:18:41,008
Sorry. Sorry.

285
00:18:41,674 --> 00:18:42,674
Sorry.

286
00:18:42,924 --> 00:18:43,966
Fuck.

287
00:18:45,008 --> 00:18:46,383
Alright, don't be upset.

288
00:18:48,133 --> 00:18:50,841
- Oh no.
- Hey. Hey...

289
00:18:51,216 --> 00:18:52,841
Hey, hey...

290
00:18:58,258 --> 00:18:59,341
I love you.

291
00:19:03,966 --> 00:19:05,258
I love you too.

292
00:19:07,466 --> 00:19:08,841
God damn it.

293
00:19:12,131 --> 00:19:13,174
Kill you...

294
00:19:16,174 --> 00:19:18,008
<i>I'd read this list online.</i>

295
00:19:18,633 --> 00:19:21,008
<i>The most important things
for a director to be.</i>

296
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:25,174
<i>And the number one thing
was healthy.</i>

297
00:19:27,549 --> 00:19:29,508
And dad, maybe
it's the sound of the zoom

298
00:19:29,508 --> 00:19:31,466
that makes
you turn your head.

299
00:19:34,341 --> 00:19:35,924
Alright, y'all ready...

300
00:19:38,091 --> 00:19:40,049
No, it's just the light.

301
00:19:41,049 --> 00:19:43,008
Okay, so some questions.

302
00:19:43,299 --> 00:19:46,466
One, are the eventual worms
alive or plastic?

303
00:19:46,466 --> 00:19:48,133
Two, Alexis says
neither are red enough,

304
00:19:48,133 --> 00:19:49,549
but we need more light, so.

305
00:19:49,549 --> 00:19:52,049
And three, we need to talk
about the prosthetic belly.

306
00:19:53,841 --> 00:19:55,466
Vita, what do you think?

307
00:19:56,758 --> 00:19:58,633
Live, live worms.

308
00:19:58,633 --> 00:20:00,508
Use whatever
fucking lights you want.

309
00:20:00,508 --> 00:20:02,299
Can you get me
the morning after pill?

310
00:20:04,133 --> 00:20:06,174
- What?
- The morning after pill.

311
00:20:07,174 --> 00:20:08,966
Don't be dramatic.

312
00:20:09,216 --> 00:20:10,216
I'm serious.

313
00:20:10,216 --> 00:20:12,841
- I'm honored.
- He came in me.

314
00:20:14,299 --> 00:20:17,299
He said something, like,
primal took over.

315
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:18,758
Oh my God.

316
00:20:18,758 --> 00:20:21,133
Vita! Hey, yo.

317
00:20:21,133 --> 00:20:23,091
- Never...
- Thanks.

318
00:20:23,091 --> 00:20:24,049
Yep.

319
00:20:24,049 --> 00:20:25,299
- By the way, I'm--
- Vita,

320
00:20:25,299 --> 00:20:27,549
- the crowd is sort of--
- Are you guys making a movie?

321
00:20:27,549 --> 00:20:29,466
- Just wanna make sure we have some light.
- I can tell them to stop.

322
00:20:29,466 --> 00:20:30,591
Now?

323
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:32,049
- Later.
- ...go out and buy one.

324
00:20:32,049 --> 00:20:33,424
Whoa, there it is.

325
00:20:34,008 --> 00:20:35,174
- Happy day.
- Yeah!

326
00:20:35,799 --> 00:20:37,341
Your bike, I just found it.

327
00:20:37,341 --> 00:20:38,424
I don't know whose that--

328
00:20:38,424 --> 00:20:40,216
- How you doing?
- Good.

329
00:20:40,216 --> 00:20:42,174
Hey, ah, why don't you, like--?

330
00:20:43,424 --> 00:20:45,174
Vita, I want to shoot the scene

331
00:20:45,174 --> 00:20:47,549
so that it feels like we're
in her head and looking at her.

332
00:20:47,549 --> 00:20:49,174
And where do you want me
to put the hard drives?

333
00:20:49,174 --> 00:20:50,424
Vita? How are you?

334
00:20:52,883 --> 00:20:54,633
Is that two shots or one shot?

335
00:20:57,924 --> 00:20:59,216
<i>Cash?</i>

336
00:21:06,924 --> 00:21:09,341
<i>A lot of people showed up
to help me make my film.</i>

337
00:21:09,341 --> 00:21:11,049
- Hey darlin'.
- Hey!

338
00:21:11,049 --> 00:21:16,966
<i>But Cash was the only guy
in a 22.6 mile radius</i>

339
00:21:16,966 --> 00:21:18,883
<i>that could have been
a movie star.</i>

340
00:21:20,133 --> 00:21:22,716
<i>And yes, everyone
was in love with him.</i>

341
00:21:22,716 --> 00:21:24,049
Good, how are you?

342
00:21:28,258 --> 00:21:29,424
- There you go.
- Thanks.

343
00:21:30,383 --> 00:21:31,674
- Wow.
- Alright.

344
00:21:31,966 --> 00:21:33,508
Okay, everybody, listen up.

345
00:21:35,424 --> 00:21:36,424
Hey.

346
00:21:37,424 --> 00:21:40,133
Wow, this is amazing.

347
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:43,299
I know I haven't really been
around much in the last few years,

348
00:21:43,299 --> 00:21:46,508
so it's really nice to
see all your familiar faces.

349
00:21:47,174 --> 00:21:48,508
I wish I could pay you.

350
00:21:48,674 --> 00:21:50,633
But like maybe
you could, maybe?

351
00:21:50,633 --> 00:21:52,549
Well, you know,
there's a lot of beer

352
00:21:52,549 --> 00:21:54,591
and you can have as much
of it as you want,

353
00:21:54,591 --> 00:21:56,133
so that's something.

354
00:21:56,133 --> 00:21:58,216
And this is my producer, Sam.

355
00:21:58,341 --> 00:22:00,216
He will take great care of you.

356
00:22:00,216 --> 00:22:02,216
He will look after
everything you need.

357
00:22:02,216 --> 00:22:04,174
All right. I'll take it
from there. So yeah!

358
00:22:04,383 --> 00:22:06,383
Like she said, just fun,
pretty simple stuff.

359
00:22:06,383 --> 00:22:08,424
We're going to have you all
sort of scattered...

360
00:22:12,758 --> 00:22:15,133
<i>I cast Dina as
the main character in the film</i>

361
00:22:15,133 --> 00:22:18,216
<i>because she seemed
like the perfect muse.</i>

362
00:22:19,008 --> 00:22:21,216
<i>We had the same friends</i>

363
00:22:21,591 --> 00:22:23,216
<i>and boyfriends.</i>

364
00:22:23,633 --> 00:22:27,174
<i>Both of our dads
were larger than life.</i>

365
00:22:28,466 --> 00:22:30,216
<i>She was me,</i>

366
00:22:30,216 --> 00:22:31,508
<i>but beautiful.</i>

367
00:22:32,841 --> 00:22:35,716
<i>And like any great director,
it was my job</i>

368
00:22:35,716 --> 00:22:39,258
<i>to wait patiently
and let the muse take over.</i>

369
00:22:40,008 --> 00:22:41,924
Hey, you know,
I broke up with Billy.

370
00:22:43,924 --> 00:22:45,174
Holy shit.

371
00:22:46,174 --> 00:22:47,216
Finally.

372
00:22:47,216 --> 00:22:48,383
I know.

373
00:22:49,133 --> 00:22:50,716
- That guy's a loser.
- I know.

374
00:22:53,299 --> 00:22:54,424
Good for you.

375
00:23:00,133 --> 00:23:02,549
Make sure your hands,
they're always...

376
00:23:02,549 --> 00:23:03,966
touching something.

377
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:06,341
Your character's trying to...

378
00:23:06,591 --> 00:23:08,174
ground herself

379
00:23:08,174 --> 00:23:10,799
in this world that she just
feels completely alien in.

380
00:23:11,383 --> 00:23:13,174
She's trying to determine
her boundaries,

381
00:23:13,174 --> 00:23:15,549
the rules, just, you know.

382
00:23:15,549 --> 00:23:17,924
And in the end it's just
going to be her in the trees.

383
00:23:24,133 --> 00:23:26,383
Girl enters and crosses
the frame at a diagonal.

384
00:23:27,674 --> 00:23:30,258
She disappears
behind a sand dune

385
00:23:30,383 --> 00:23:32,174
in the foreground,
at the edge of the frame.

386
00:23:32,758 --> 00:23:34,716
Camera at this point
actually stops operating.

387
00:23:35,174 --> 00:23:37,466
<i>The girl walks away
a considerable distance</i>

388
00:23:38,174 --> 00:23:41,400
<i>and takes her place behind
another sand dune, further away.</i>

389
00:23:42,299 --> 00:23:43,924
The camera then resumes
its shooting

390
00:23:43,924 --> 00:23:45,924
and immediately begins to turn

391
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:48,424
<i>in a panoramic movement
toward the direction</i>

392
00:23:48,424 --> 00:23:50,049
<i>of which the girl's
left the frame.</i>

393
00:23:51,424 --> 00:23:53,758
<i>Blah, blah, blah...</i>

394
00:23:54,174 --> 00:23:56,591
<i>Moves out of the frame--
Okay, um, instead,</i>

395
00:23:57,841 --> 00:23:59,508
<i>she emerges much more distant.</i>

396
00:24:00,299 --> 00:24:03,466
And so the alienation of
the girl from the camera

397
00:24:03,466 --> 00:24:05,008
exceeds the actual time

398
00:24:05,008 --> 00:24:08,091
which proceeds what would have
presumably been necessary.

399
00:24:12,466 --> 00:24:13,716
What is that from?

400
00:24:14,008 --> 00:24:15,258
Maya Deren.

401
00:24:15,258 --> 00:24:16,716
You emailed it to me.

402
00:24:16,716 --> 00:24:18,299
This is the best part.

403
00:24:18,299 --> 00:24:20,341
She goes on to say
about filmmaking,

404
00:24:20,883 --> 00:24:23,091
"And so, ready or not,

405
00:24:23,091 --> 00:24:24,591
willing or not,

406
00:24:24,591 --> 00:24:28,299
you must come to comprehend
with full responsibility

407
00:24:28,299 --> 00:24:31,258
the world in which
we've now created."

408
00:24:35,174 --> 00:24:36,216
Wow.

409
00:24:36,883 --> 00:24:37,924
Cool.

410
00:24:38,133 --> 00:24:40,924
Well, you didn't send me any lines
or anything, so I memorized that.

411
00:24:41,966 --> 00:24:43,549
Because I'm an actor now!

412
00:24:58,841 --> 00:25:00,383
Everybody who will be in the bar,

413
00:25:00,383 --> 00:25:02,091
let's get into places. Alright.

414
00:25:02,966 --> 00:25:04,591
Watch your step. Yep.

415
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:06,091
Alright, nice and warm.
Come on.

416
00:25:06,091 --> 00:25:08,258
Hey, I'm not paying you
to hang out.

417
00:25:08,258 --> 00:25:09,424
Get the fuck in there.

418
00:25:09,424 --> 00:25:10,883
Lovely...

419
00:25:10,883 --> 00:25:12,133
- Roll sound.
- Sound speeding.

420
00:25:12,133 --> 00:25:13,299
- Roll camera.
- Rolling.

421
00:25:13,508 --> 00:25:14,841
301 Apple, take one.

422
00:25:15,758 --> 00:25:16,841
Set.

423
00:25:20,383 --> 00:25:22,508
Action!

424
00:25:36,966 --> 00:25:39,508
<i>So the film was
about a young woman.</i>

425
00:25:40,049 --> 00:25:41,716
<i>She lives in a small town.</i>

426
00:25:42,841 --> 00:25:45,549
<i>She's taking care
of her ailing father.</i>

427
00:25:47,133 --> 00:25:48,591
<i>She has a boyfriend.</i>

428
00:25:49,966 --> 00:25:51,424
<i>And a secret lover.</i>

429
00:25:56,758 --> 00:25:59,216
<i>She gets pregnant
and decides to leave home</i>

430
00:25:59,216 --> 00:26:02,174
<i>in search of her mother
who abandoned her at birth.</i>

431
00:26:04,383 --> 00:26:06,049
<i>This is a true story.</i>

432
00:26:08,341 --> 00:26:11,174
<i>This is a true story, except...</i>

433
00:26:12,049 --> 00:26:14,258
<i>and you already know this.</i>

434
00:26:15,883 --> 00:26:17,883
<i>I have two moms.</i>

435
00:26:20,758 --> 00:26:22,633
<i>One of them is a mime.</i>

436
00:26:28,174 --> 00:26:30,383
<i>I was never abandoned.</i>

437
00:26:42,466 --> 00:26:44,383
<i>I did get pregnant, though.</i>

438
00:26:47,174 --> 00:26:49,883
A year and a half
before we shot the film.

439
00:26:51,299 --> 00:26:53,716
<i>I found out
on my 23rd birthday.</i>

440
00:26:53,716 --> 00:26:56,091
<i>My birthday is
November 23rd, so...</i>

441
00:26:56,424 --> 00:26:57,383
Vita.

442
00:26:57,383 --> 00:26:59,591
<i>It was a once in a lifetime year.</i>

443
00:26:59,591 --> 00:27:00,799
Hey.

444
00:27:01,049 --> 00:27:02,799
Go! Everybody to laugh!

445
00:27:03,508 --> 00:27:04,924
Really animated!

446
00:27:05,466 --> 00:27:06,966
Give me party!

447
00:27:14,591 --> 00:27:17,091
On November 24th
I sat at the clinic

448
00:27:17,091 --> 00:27:18,841
and cried and cried.

449
00:27:25,258 --> 00:27:26,758
<i>I asked the nurse,</i>

450
00:27:27,549 --> 00:27:29,466
<i>"Why am I</i>

451
00:27:29,758 --> 00:27:31,966
<i>the only person that I know</i>

452
00:27:32,383 --> 00:27:33,966
<i>who this has happened to?"</i>

453
00:27:40,966 --> 00:27:43,508
<i>And the nurse
looked away from me</i>

454
00:27:44,174 --> 00:27:46,091
<i>and back at me again</i>

455
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:48,008
<i>and said,</i>

456
00:27:48,716 --> 00:27:51,258
"This happens to a lot of people.

457
00:27:54,091 --> 00:27:57,174
It's just that
nobody talks about it."

458
00:28:06,466 --> 00:28:12,549
<i>Do not hasten to bid me adieu</i>

459
00:28:13,966 --> 00:28:20,966
<i>Just remember that Red River Valley</i>

460
00:28:22,341 --> 00:28:23,383
<i>And the--</i>

461
00:28:23,383 --> 00:28:25,174
Okay, can we cut for a second?

462
00:28:25,466 --> 00:28:26,716
Let's hold the roll.

463
00:28:27,508 --> 00:28:29,174
Dina, you have to
see him by now.

464
00:28:29,174 --> 00:28:30,424
See who?

465
00:28:31,133 --> 00:28:33,674
Can you guys be quiet
for just a second?

466
00:28:35,008 --> 00:28:37,841
See him, your secret lover.

467
00:28:38,341 --> 00:28:40,049
Hey, Gideon, will you wave?

468
00:28:40,549 --> 00:28:42,508
He's an actor.
He drove up from the city.

469
00:28:42,508 --> 00:28:44,258
Oh shit.
Hey, sorry.

470
00:28:44,258 --> 00:28:45,966
I didn't know
you were in this scene.

471
00:28:46,591 --> 00:28:47,716
I'm Dina.

472
00:28:47,841 --> 00:28:49,674
Hey, Gideon.

473
00:28:49,674 --> 00:28:51,299
I'm moving to LA.

474
00:28:52,883 --> 00:28:53,966
Cool.

475
00:28:55,091 --> 00:28:57,258
- Okay, wait, we're gonna go from the--
- Okay.

476
00:28:57,424 --> 00:29:04,424
<i>Come and sit by my side if you love me</i>

477
00:29:05,966 --> 00:29:12,799
<i>Do not hasten to bid me adieu</i>

478
00:29:13,799 --> 00:29:20,633
<i>Just remember that Red River Valley</i>

479
00:29:26,508 --> 00:29:28,049
- Fuck!
- No!

480
00:29:34,716 --> 00:29:35,841
Fuck!

481
00:29:36,341 --> 00:29:37,383
Hey.

482
00:29:37,383 --> 00:29:38,924
Hi, hi.

483
00:29:39,174 --> 00:29:40,341
What are you guys doing?

484
00:29:43,133 --> 00:29:44,383
Can you come here
for a second?

485
00:29:44,383 --> 00:29:45,674
Why?

486
00:29:45,674 --> 00:29:47,174
Come, I missed you. Come here.

487
00:29:47,508 --> 00:29:48,966
Why are you wet?

488
00:29:49,924 --> 00:29:51,216
Why are you wet?

489
00:29:51,216 --> 00:29:52,716
We got all wet together.

490
00:29:53,174 --> 00:29:54,633
Why are you wet?

491
00:29:55,424 --> 00:29:58,466
Hi. How are you?

492
00:29:59,174 --> 00:30:01,008
How is the film going?

493
00:30:02,341 --> 00:30:05,383
It's going-- It was going
well before you got here.

494
00:30:05,383 --> 00:30:06,841
What are you wearing?

495
00:30:07,133 --> 00:30:08,383
I like your funny vest.

496
00:30:08,674 --> 00:30:09,674
It's my cameo.

497
00:30:09,674 --> 00:30:11,966
It's the most important
shot of the scene.

498
00:30:12,174 --> 00:30:13,341
Can I take a picture of you?

499
00:30:13,341 --> 00:30:14,424
Baby...

500
00:30:15,883 --> 00:30:18,091
- Sorry...
- Your lens cap is on.

501
00:30:18,383 --> 00:30:20,216
You have to
go back to the bar.

502
00:30:20,341 --> 00:30:21,383
Still rolling, Vita.

503
00:30:22,466 --> 00:30:24,049
- What's happening?
- Okay.

504
00:30:24,049 --> 00:30:26,049
- Hey you gotta go.
- We...

505
00:30:26,049 --> 00:30:28,383
- I gotta get back to work.
- Can you take a break?

506
00:30:28,383 --> 00:30:29,924
- No.
- Is there a lunchtime?

507
00:30:29,924 --> 00:30:31,091
No!

508
00:30:31,758 --> 00:30:32,924
We could go back.

509
00:30:33,341 --> 00:30:35,258
Go-- I just wanted
to have sex with you.

510
00:30:36,299 --> 00:30:37,341
Shut up.

511
00:30:37,341 --> 00:30:40,299
That's so embarrassing.
You're so wet.

512
00:30:40,674 --> 00:30:42,799
Why don't you help?
It'll go by faster.

513
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:44,799
- If you help out...
- Yeah, let's...

514
00:30:45,383 --> 00:30:46,633
Listen to JJ.

515
00:30:47,091 --> 00:30:48,133
I'm going to help.

516
00:30:48,299 --> 00:30:49,758
Come over here,
you're gonna help.

517
00:30:50,049 --> 00:30:51,174
Alright, we're gonna help.

518
00:30:51,174 --> 00:30:52,674
- Go over there?
- Bobby's over there.

519
00:30:52,674 --> 00:30:54,133
- Hey, Bobby.
- Bobby!

520
00:30:54,133 --> 00:30:55,591
I was sent to help you.

521
00:30:55,758 --> 00:30:57,008
- No, no.
- Hey!

522
00:30:57,008 --> 00:30:59,008
- I'm good. Thank you though.
- Yeah. You're good.

523
00:30:59,008 --> 00:31:00,383
You do your thing.
I'm just going to like...

524
00:31:00,383 --> 00:31:02,091
- No, like I'm--
- Don't touch that.

525
00:31:02,091 --> 00:31:03,258
Don't touch that!

526
00:31:03,799 --> 00:31:05,341
- Don't touch that.
- Sorry.

527
00:31:05,341 --> 00:31:06,924
No. I don't--

528
00:31:06,924 --> 00:31:09,341
He asked me to help with the--

529
00:31:09,341 --> 00:31:11,879
Okay. I will not touch the light

530
00:31:12,341 --> 00:31:14,633
- and I will help over here.
- Stop messing with the equipment.

531
00:31:14,633 --> 00:31:16,466
Why are you yelling at me?

532
00:31:16,466 --> 00:31:18,549
You guys were singing.
What were you singing?

533
00:31:19,508 --> 00:31:20,758
Yeah.

534
00:31:20,758 --> 00:31:22,883
<i>...if you love me</i>

535
00:31:23,341 --> 00:31:25,341
Vita, I'll just be in the scene.

536
00:31:27,841 --> 00:31:29,924
<i>...bid me adieu</i>

537
00:31:29,924 --> 00:31:30,924
Adieu!

538
00:31:30,924 --> 00:31:32,049
Thank you.

539
00:31:32,049 --> 00:31:33,258
Vita!

540
00:31:35,633 --> 00:31:37,508
You know, I don't think
we need this shot.

541
00:31:37,841 --> 00:31:38,924
What about the close-up?

542
00:31:41,216 --> 00:31:44,133
Why don't you--
we get the most shooting.

543
00:31:44,758 --> 00:31:47,174
Are you absolutely sure
you don't need this shot?

544
00:31:47,508 --> 00:31:48,591
Vita!

545
00:31:49,633 --> 00:31:50,633
Vita!

546
00:31:50,633 --> 00:31:52,883
<i>...Red River Valley</i>

547
00:31:55,299 --> 00:31:56,341
Yeah, I'm sure.

548
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:14,299
<i>I always wondered if that shot
would have made the film better.</i>

549
00:32:15,758 --> 00:32:17,466
<i>Guess I wonder about
a lot of things.</i>

550
00:32:17,466 --> 00:32:19,758
<i>...bid me adieu</i>

551
00:32:19,758 --> 00:32:22,008
Adieu. Adieu. Adieu.

552
00:32:22,008 --> 00:32:27,508
<i>Just remember that Red River--</i>

553
00:33:09,758 --> 00:33:11,049
Dina, um...

554
00:33:11,424 --> 00:33:15,133
I'm gonna need you to really
dig a little deeper on this one.

555
00:33:15,133 --> 00:33:17,008
I mean, the scream's gotta come from,

556
00:33:17,008 --> 00:33:19,299
like, a really...

557
00:33:19,299 --> 00:33:21,549
- painful place.
- Okay.

558
00:33:30,966 --> 00:33:32,549
Okay, I don't, I don't get it.

559
00:33:33,383 --> 00:33:35,383
Like, where is
this all coming from?

560
00:33:36,841 --> 00:33:38,341
Well, Dina, she's...

561
00:33:39,633 --> 00:33:41,424
emotionally torn.

562
00:33:43,424 --> 00:33:44,466
Okay.

563
00:33:45,216 --> 00:33:47,424
I don't know what
that means, honestly.

564
00:33:48,049 --> 00:33:49,924
Maybe we should try it
from a different angle,

565
00:33:49,924 --> 00:33:51,258
like, shoot from behind,

566
00:33:51,258 --> 00:33:53,216
and then you
can add a better scream.

567
00:33:53,216 --> 00:33:55,258
Yeah, but we have to stay
with her. It's gotta be that.

568
00:33:55,258 --> 00:33:57,383
Dina, maybe try it, like,
you just, like, stubbed your toe,

569
00:33:57,383 --> 00:33:59,133
and it's, like, that one spot,
and you always do it.

570
00:33:59,133 --> 00:34:00,174
No, Sam, it's not...

571
00:34:00,174 --> 00:34:01,799
it's not like
stubbing your toe.

572
00:34:01,799 --> 00:34:03,008
She needs a real life example.

573
00:34:03,008 --> 00:34:05,258
This is after the scene where
she meets her secret lover?

574
00:34:06,049 --> 00:34:07,549
Yeah, but he's not secret.

575
00:34:07,924 --> 00:34:09,174
So is it about the boyfriend?

576
00:34:09,174 --> 00:34:11,758
It's-- we all read the script, right?

577
00:34:11,758 --> 00:34:14,091
I mean, yeah, but
40 pages of mostly prose.

578
00:34:14,091 --> 00:34:16,549
- JJ... Can this please wait?
- Can I just--?

579
00:34:16,549 --> 00:34:19,508
Vita, what if she's, like,
not in pain at all at this point?

580
00:34:23,924 --> 00:34:26,674
- What do you mean?
- Like, what if...

581
00:34:26,674 --> 00:34:28,591
Like, instead, she's...

582
00:34:28,799 --> 00:34:29,966
she's, like,
coming to terms with

583
00:34:29,966 --> 00:34:32,049
who she's, like,
meant to be, you know?

584
00:34:38,508 --> 00:34:41,174
But it's, like,
it's the opposite of that.

585
00:34:43,008 --> 00:34:44,924
I don't know,
it's not like the opposite.

586
00:34:44,924 --> 00:34:47,049
It's just, like, a different--
it's a different take.

587
00:34:47,049 --> 00:34:49,091
- It's, like, the same...
- It's the opposite of that,

588
00:34:49,091 --> 00:34:50,174
I am telling you.

589
00:34:50,299 --> 00:34:51,841
- Okay...
- She's not just cool with it.

590
00:34:53,216 --> 00:34:55,716
Yeah, I'm just, I'm, like,
throwing out an idea.

591
00:34:57,841 --> 00:34:58,924
It could be cool.

592
00:35:00,466 --> 00:35:03,049
We're just gonna,
we're gonna keep, keep going.

593
00:35:03,049 --> 00:35:05,466
Yeah, okay, let's,
let's try it again maybe.

594
00:35:05,466 --> 00:35:07,466
Thank you. Let's keep going.

595
00:35:07,466 --> 00:35:09,758
Why, why does
everything I do just, like,

596
00:35:09,758 --> 00:35:11,591
fucking upset you, up here?

597
00:35:14,383 --> 00:35:15,966
Can we just
get through this scene?

598
00:35:15,966 --> 00:35:19,924
Yeah. I'm just trying to,
like, help out here.

599
00:35:24,174 --> 00:35:25,716
But it's not helping.

600
00:35:34,299 --> 00:35:36,758
Could we, could we, like,
go and talk for a second?

601
00:35:37,966 --> 00:35:39,091
- Right now?
- Yeah.

602
00:35:39,508 --> 00:35:41,299
- You need to talk right now?
- Yeah, yeah.

603
00:35:42,383 --> 00:35:44,299
What are we gonna talk about?

604
00:35:45,841 --> 00:35:47,133
I'd rather just not do this

605
00:35:47,133 --> 00:35:49,258
in front of, like, everyone.

606
00:35:49,591 --> 00:35:51,549
Can you, like, take
just, like, five minutes?

607
00:35:53,841 --> 00:35:55,216
No, I can't.

608
00:35:55,633 --> 00:35:57,716
How can you not see
that I'm busy?

609
00:35:57,716 --> 00:35:59,966
I'm trying to
finish this scene.

610
00:36:01,216 --> 00:36:02,258
Baby.

611
00:36:04,841 --> 00:36:07,008
You make me,
like, feel really bad

612
00:36:08,049 --> 00:36:09,174
being here.

613
00:36:18,174 --> 00:36:19,383
I think I'm just gonna, like,

614
00:36:19,383 --> 00:36:20,841
I'm gonna go back home.

615
00:36:21,174 --> 00:36:24,466
You finish the film,
and yeah, I'll see you later.

616
00:36:40,799 --> 00:36:42,258
Okay, I'm...

617
00:36:42,258 --> 00:36:45,049
I'm gonna be right back.
Just keep, keep it rolling.

618
00:36:48,133 --> 00:36:50,508
No, we can cut.
Cut that.

619
00:36:52,258 --> 00:36:54,799
- Okay...
- Especially when the fucking--

620
00:36:55,341 --> 00:36:57,716
The sexual tension is dripping.

621
00:36:57,716 --> 00:36:59,591
- Bobby.
- Just the regular tension.

622
00:36:59,591 --> 00:37:00,841
His regular attention.

623
00:37:00,841 --> 00:37:01,924
Hey.

624
00:37:04,091 --> 00:37:06,049
Just, Dustin, stop.

625
00:37:06,799 --> 00:37:08,799
You wanted to talk.
Let's talk.

626
00:37:09,883 --> 00:37:12,716
Just try to see
what I'm doing here.

627
00:37:13,508 --> 00:37:14,549
Yeah.

628
00:37:14,758 --> 00:37:18,549
Look, why, why are, why are you
taking this all so fucking seriously?

629
00:37:18,758 --> 00:37:20,216
What do you mean,
why I'm taking it,

630
00:37:20,216 --> 00:37:21,966
why aren't you
taking it seriously?

631
00:37:21,966 --> 00:37:23,508
I'm trying to be,

632
00:37:23,508 --> 00:37:26,216
I'm trying to do this
with my fucking life.

633
00:37:26,216 --> 00:37:27,383
This is me.

634
00:37:27,383 --> 00:37:30,508
Yeah, look, I'm trying to
be here with you, okay?

635
00:37:30,508 --> 00:37:32,508
And you don't even
fucking, like, see me.

636
00:37:32,508 --> 00:37:34,508
I think you should be up here for me.

637
00:37:34,508 --> 00:37:36,216
Yeah, I am up here for you.

638
00:37:36,216 --> 00:37:39,091
Okay, well, you're not really helping
me out on a day like today, okay?

639
00:37:39,091 --> 00:37:42,758
Because you make me feel like
shit in front of, like, your crew!

640
00:37:43,049 --> 00:37:45,508
Okay, well, I'm kind of
dealing with a lot.

641
00:37:45,841 --> 00:37:47,716
Like, Dina's not
fucking screaming.

642
00:37:47,716 --> 00:37:49,258
The crew won't fucking
listen to me

643
00:37:49,258 --> 00:37:50,716
'cause they're all fucking stoned.

644
00:37:50,716 --> 00:37:52,133
You came in me yesterday

645
00:37:52,133 --> 00:37:53,758
and I have to find
a distinct minute

646
00:37:53,758 --> 00:37:56,716
to take the fucking morning after pill
so I don't puke everywhere.

647
00:37:56,716 --> 00:37:58,216
Sorry, I said I was sorry.

648
00:37:58,883 --> 00:38:00,758
You just don't fucking get it.

649
00:38:00,758 --> 00:38:02,508
Like, you are amazing.

650
00:38:02,883 --> 00:38:04,799
Like, you're trying
so fucking hard

651
00:38:04,799 --> 00:38:06,549
to, like, make this fucking art,

652
00:38:06,549 --> 00:38:07,883
but you're like, you're--

653
00:38:07,883 --> 00:38:10,174
You don't even understand how
fucking amazing you are.

654
00:38:11,758 --> 00:38:14,883
You're-- yeah, you're so
much better than me, okay?

655
00:38:15,091 --> 00:38:17,008
- What?
- Yeah, like...

656
00:38:18,258 --> 00:38:20,133
you could do anything
you wanted, okay?

657
00:38:20,133 --> 00:38:23,966
You're capable of...
of, like, everything.

658
00:38:25,591 --> 00:38:27,758
- Like what?
- Like, like, I don't know, like--

659
00:38:27,758 --> 00:38:29,091
You...

660
00:38:29,799 --> 00:38:32,341
You're capable of having, like, a baby.

661
00:38:35,466 --> 00:38:36,674
Like...

662
00:38:42,424 --> 00:38:44,049
Like, you're awesome.

663
00:38:50,299 --> 00:38:52,008
I love you.

664
00:38:54,758 --> 00:38:57,133
And I want to be here for you.

665
00:39:02,633 --> 00:39:05,591
I just want you to,
like, want me with you.

666
00:39:09,133 --> 00:39:10,216
You know?

667
00:39:15,966 --> 00:39:18,508
I don't want to have a baby.

668
00:39:20,091 --> 00:39:21,633
I don't want to have a baby.

669
00:39:21,633 --> 00:39:24,591
Yeah, I didn't, that's not,
I didn't mean, like, right now.

670
00:39:28,841 --> 00:39:30,383
Vita, where are you going?

671
00:39:33,174 --> 00:39:34,841
Vita, where are you going?

672
00:39:34,841 --> 00:39:37,799
<i>Did you know that</i>

673
00:39:38,591 --> 00:39:41,091
<i>after an egg is released
from the ovary,</i>

674
00:39:41,091 --> 00:39:43,883
<i>it is viable for up to 24 hours?</i>

675
00:39:45,174 --> 00:39:49,466
<i>And the morning after pill
can work for 72.</i>

676
00:39:51,758 --> 00:39:57,049
<i>Unless the sperm
and the egg collide first.</i>

677
00:39:58,799 --> 00:40:00,633
<i>I didn't know that then.</i>

678
00:40:02,924 --> 00:40:04,966
<i>I was an idiot.</i>

679
00:40:06,299 --> 00:40:09,674
<i>And convinced that
I was the only one</i>

680
00:40:09,674 --> 00:40:11,883
<i>taking the film seriously.</i>

681
00:40:29,174 --> 00:40:35,008
So, let's do one more scream
before we roll.

682
00:40:36,133 --> 00:40:37,424
When you're ready.

683
00:41:51,174 --> 00:41:54,258
<i>After the egg was released
from my ovaries,</i>

684
00:41:54,258 --> 00:41:57,008
<i>but before I took
the morning after pill,</i>

685
00:41:57,008 --> 00:41:58,133
<i>we filmed this scene</i>

686
00:41:58,133 --> 00:42:00,466
<i>where the main character
screams.</i>

687
00:42:04,216 --> 00:42:05,799
<i>It was meant to represent</i>

688
00:42:05,799 --> 00:42:08,549
<i>the moment that
she became pregnant.</i>

689
00:42:13,258 --> 00:42:16,174
It was at this
moment inside of me

690
00:42:18,091 --> 00:42:20,591
that the sperm
and the egg collided too.

691
00:42:30,174 --> 00:42:34,716
<i>So, the film was about
a young woman</i>

692
00:42:37,174 --> 00:42:40,341
who was taking care
of her ailing father.

693
00:42:41,508 --> 00:42:46,049
<i>She gets pregnant and decides
to escape her hometown in search</i>

694
00:42:46,049 --> 00:42:48,383
<i>of her mother who
abandoned her at birth.</i>

695
00:42:49,049 --> 00:42:51,049
<i>This is a true story.</i>

696
00:42:51,049 --> 00:42:54,633
<i>This is a true story except</i>

697
00:42:55,508 --> 00:42:58,841
<i>I have two moms,</i>

698
00:42:59,508 --> 00:43:02,008
<i>and I had two abortions.</i>

699
00:44:34,049 --> 00:44:36,841
Hi, I'm Vita and
I'm the writer-director

700
00:44:36,841 --> 00:44:39,841
of the feature-length film
<i>Always, All Ways</i>.

701
00:44:39,966 --> 00:44:41,424
Here I am in
my childhood bedroom,

702
00:44:41,424 --> 00:44:43,466
aka my editing suite.

703
00:44:43,466 --> 00:44:45,174
I moved back home
a few weeks ago

704
00:44:45,174 --> 00:44:47,133
to complete the first of three shoots

705
00:44:47,133 --> 00:44:48,799
over the course of nine months.

706
00:44:48,924 --> 00:44:52,133
I've been reviewing the footage
and it looks amazing.

707
00:44:52,133 --> 00:44:54,341
We've decided to start
this crowdfunding campaign

708
00:44:54,341 --> 00:44:56,716
with amazing rewards
for people who donate

709
00:44:56,716 --> 00:44:58,591
to finance
the next two shoots,

710
00:44:58,591 --> 00:45:02,008
which will cost
approximately $18,000.

711
00:45:02,174 --> 00:45:05,841
I want to get as many people
involved in this vision as possible

712
00:45:05,841 --> 00:45:09,424
because your mark on my film
is what I'm looking for.

713
00:45:11,633 --> 00:45:12,883
<i>Okay, cut!</i>

714
00:45:15,383 --> 00:45:16,799
<i>Tail, slating!</i>

715
00:45:18,549 --> 00:45:19,674
Bring it.

716
00:45:21,674 --> 00:45:23,258
You want me to cut this scene?

717
00:45:23,424 --> 00:45:24,466
Cut it.

718
00:45:25,924 --> 00:45:26,966
- Mark.
- Mark.

719
00:45:47,424 --> 00:45:48,841
- Guess what?
- What?

720
00:45:49,341 --> 00:45:52,424
The film is officially listed!

721
00:45:53,633 --> 00:45:55,174
No turning back now, dude.

722
00:45:55,841 --> 00:45:56,841
Look at that!

723
00:45:56,966 --> 00:45:58,133
No way.

724
00:45:58,299 --> 00:46:00,008
- Whoa, we did it!
- Beautiful.

725
00:46:01,174 --> 00:46:02,174
Cool!

726
00:46:10,049 --> 00:46:11,758
Okay and then we--

727
00:46:11,883 --> 00:46:13,174
Take some time to recover

728
00:46:13,174 --> 00:46:16,258
and take, you know,
just take some deep breaths and...

729
00:46:17,549 --> 00:46:19,799
and you crawl over to the worm.

730
00:46:19,799 --> 00:46:21,508
- Okay, crawl over...
- See it?

731
00:46:21,883 --> 00:46:23,466
You pick it up, you hold it.

732
00:46:24,758 --> 00:46:26,591
You know, deal with it,
feel it.

733
00:46:27,883 --> 00:46:29,216
You know, take it in.

734
00:46:30,258 --> 00:46:32,008
- Her nets are going to rip--
- Quiet.

735
00:46:36,549 --> 00:46:38,174
What's the point
of the worm again?

736
00:46:39,633 --> 00:46:40,674
I don't know.

737
00:46:40,841 --> 00:46:43,758
I think it's about her
being pregnant or something.

738
00:46:45,008 --> 00:46:47,883
<i>The film was filled
with thin motifs,</i>

739
00:46:48,633 --> 00:46:50,591
<i>like earthworms,</i>

740
00:46:51,133 --> 00:46:54,424
<i>and a bunch of other
ass-oteric images.</i>

741
00:46:56,758 --> 00:46:59,258
<i>I didn't give a shit
about the audience.</i>

742
00:47:01,716 --> 00:47:04,008
<i>I liked the earthworms
'cause I had read</i>

743
00:47:04,008 --> 00:47:06,966
<i>that they hold
both sexes inside them.</i>

744
00:47:09,383 --> 00:47:11,341
<i>They are beholden to no one.</i>

745
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:14,341
Wait, Bobby,
did you move the light?

746
00:47:14,341 --> 00:47:15,883
I told him to do that

747
00:47:16,008 --> 00:47:17,883
because it's just,
it's a really shitty bathroom.

748
00:47:17,883 --> 00:47:19,133
I'm sorry, I'm confused.

749
00:47:19,133 --> 00:47:20,674
Raise your hand
if you like the light.

750
00:47:20,674 --> 00:47:21,841
I just think it looks better.

751
00:47:25,049 --> 00:47:26,341
- Um, Vita?
- Yeah?

752
00:47:26,341 --> 00:47:27,549
What should we do next?

753
00:47:28,216 --> 00:47:29,549
I don't know,
just fucking go with it.

754
00:47:29,758 --> 00:47:30,758
Okay...

755
00:47:31,841 --> 00:47:35,008
<i>Actually, the more telling
pattern that haunted the set</i>

756
00:47:35,008 --> 00:47:37,299
<i>was that of near death.</i>

757
00:47:40,883 --> 00:47:42,549
First there was the plane.

758
00:47:46,049 --> 00:47:47,049
<i>Then...</i>

759
00:47:47,341 --> 00:47:48,383
<i>the deer.</i>

760
00:47:50,258 --> 00:47:51,508
<i>The lightning.</i>

761
00:47:54,299 --> 00:47:55,966
<i>The goblin weed.</i>

762
00:47:58,299 --> 00:48:00,008
<i>The drama on the pier.</i>

763
00:48:04,299 --> 00:48:06,174
And then there was...

764
00:48:09,383 --> 00:48:10,466
the night.

765
00:48:17,508 --> 00:48:18,841
<i>With Cash.</i>

766
00:48:20,049 --> 00:48:21,299
<i>And the whiskey.</i>

767
00:48:23,758 --> 00:48:25,924
You can dance tonight
if you want.

768
00:48:26,174 --> 00:48:27,508
Whatever you want, darlin'.

769
00:48:28,049 --> 00:48:29,383
Is that the best mask
you could get for me?

770
00:48:29,383 --> 00:48:30,466
It is, it is.

771
00:48:30,466 --> 00:48:32,049
They didn't have much
of a selection, I guess.

772
00:48:32,049 --> 00:48:33,799
With the mustache falling off
and everything?

773
00:48:40,754 --> 00:48:42,087
Keep doing what you're doing.

774
00:48:42,087 --> 00:48:43,237
Wait for my cue.

775
00:48:44,841 --> 00:48:46,049
Get rowdy.

776
00:48:48,466 --> 00:48:49,716
Action!

777
00:48:53,299 --> 00:48:54,341
Darlin'.

778
00:48:55,841 --> 00:48:57,549
Darlin', darlin'.

779
00:48:58,466 --> 00:48:59,508
How's it going?

780
00:48:59,508 --> 00:49:01,133
Did you hear the news?
Did she tell you?

781
00:49:01,799 --> 00:49:03,549
You didn't tell her?

782
00:49:06,674 --> 00:49:08,549
Baby, we're having a baby.

783
00:49:12,466 --> 00:49:13,591
We're having a baby...

784
00:49:13,591 --> 00:49:15,174
Baby, we're having a baby.

785
00:49:15,466 --> 00:49:16,591
Having a baby?

786
00:49:17,049 --> 00:49:18,591
This is great, Cash.
Keep going.

787
00:49:19,674 --> 00:49:20,883
Can I get another?

788
00:49:23,258 --> 00:49:24,841
Yeah, let's pause.

789
00:49:25,133 --> 00:49:27,383
You want to get him
a beer and a shot? Sam?

790
00:49:28,383 --> 00:49:29,716
Come on, brother.

791
00:49:37,966 --> 00:49:39,549
Why did you give him
more to drink?

792
00:49:39,549 --> 00:49:41,549
- Are you joking?
- I didn't give him anything.

793
00:49:41,716 --> 00:49:42,841
They are already drunk.

794
00:49:42,841 --> 00:49:45,133
- How the fuck is this on me?
- Guys, guys, guys. Hey!

795
00:49:47,466 --> 00:49:48,633
What is the problem?

796
00:49:48,633 --> 00:49:49,633
It's fine.

797
00:49:49,633 --> 00:49:51,299
I know these guys.
It's fine.

798
00:49:51,299 --> 00:49:53,549
We're good, we're just having fun.

799
00:49:54,216 --> 00:49:55,341
It's going to be okay.

800
00:49:55,341 --> 00:49:57,049
Don't-- just calm down.

801
00:49:59,216 --> 00:50:00,258
The prosthetic belly is--

802
00:50:00,258 --> 00:50:02,341
Whatever this decision is,
can you just make yourself?

803
00:50:02,883 --> 00:50:04,674
- Okay.
- Thank you.

804
00:50:05,174 --> 00:50:06,174
Action!

805
00:50:06,299 --> 00:50:07,466
Fuck!

806
00:50:08,174 --> 00:50:09,216
Don't stop.

807
00:50:09,716 --> 00:50:10,924
Goddamit.

808
00:50:11,508 --> 00:50:12,841
Motherfucker.

809
00:50:14,466 --> 00:50:16,299
Goddamit.
Where was I?

810
00:50:17,674 --> 00:50:18,716
Baby.

811
00:50:18,716 --> 00:50:19,799
Baby?

812
00:50:19,799 --> 00:50:22,466
Baby. We're having
a motherfucking baby.

813
00:50:22,883 --> 00:50:24,424
We're having a fucking baby.

814
00:50:24,424 --> 00:50:25,966
It's probably going to be
a little fucking girl.

815
00:50:25,966 --> 00:50:27,466
We're having
a fucking baby girl!

816
00:50:27,674 --> 00:50:29,133
Get in here, motherfuckers.

817
00:50:29,591 --> 00:50:32,091
The prodigal son returns!

818
00:50:32,341 --> 00:50:33,924
Go, go, go!

819
00:50:38,174 --> 00:50:39,924
What's going on?

820
00:50:40,216 --> 00:50:41,591
We're having a fucking baby.

821
00:50:42,049 --> 00:50:44,883
- What?
- We're having a fucking baby girl.

822
00:50:45,716 --> 00:50:48,674
- We're having a fucking baby.
- We're having a baby.

823
00:50:48,674 --> 00:50:50,216
We're havin'
a fuckin' baby guys.

824
00:50:50,216 --> 00:50:51,466
We're havin' a baby!

825
00:50:51,674 --> 00:50:52,799
We're havin' a fuckin' baby!

826
00:50:52,924 --> 00:50:54,299
We're havin' a baby?

827
00:50:54,674 --> 00:50:56,383
We're havin' a baby!

828
00:50:58,216 --> 00:50:59,633
We're havin' a baby...

829
00:50:59,966 --> 00:51:01,633
We're havin' a baby!

830
00:51:06,591 --> 00:51:08,758
<i>I remember thinking
I was brilliant.</i>

831
00:51:14,466 --> 00:51:17,424
So that's everything except
those lights upstairs, right? Okay.

832
00:51:17,674 --> 00:51:19,508
Alright. Yeah.
You can give him a little time.

833
00:51:19,508 --> 00:51:20,549
You can come up there.

834
00:51:20,549 --> 00:51:21,924
- Alright.
- Thanks man.

835
00:51:22,758 --> 00:51:24,841
Hey, um, dinner's almost ready

836
00:51:24,841 --> 00:51:26,466
and I got some more
beers for the guys.

837
00:51:26,674 --> 00:51:28,133
- Great.
- And maybe us.

838
00:51:28,133 --> 00:51:29,591
Yeah, and us.
For sure us.

839
00:51:29,591 --> 00:51:31,174
Don't let them steal a bottle.

840
00:51:31,341 --> 00:51:35,299
<i>We're having a baby!</i>

841
00:51:35,508 --> 00:51:37,508
<i>We're having a baby!</i>

842
00:51:37,633 --> 00:51:39,549
<i>We're having a baby!</i>

843
00:51:39,883 --> 00:51:41,924
<i>We're having a baby!</i>

844
00:51:42,133 --> 00:51:45,591
<i>We're having a baby!</i>

845
00:51:45,591 --> 00:51:46,633
Congratulations.

846
00:52:07,966 --> 00:52:10,508
But I knew
I called out to him.

847
00:52:13,216 --> 00:52:14,549
Wait, where are you going?

848
00:52:16,383 --> 00:52:17,966
Hey! Hey, hey, hey!

849
00:52:17,966 --> 00:52:20,174
Wait! Stop! Where are you going?

850
00:52:22,549 --> 00:52:23,674
Cash!

851
00:52:24,383 --> 00:52:25,549
Stop! Don't drive!

852
00:52:25,549 --> 00:52:26,674
Come back!

853
00:52:41,424 --> 00:52:43,174
Or maybe I didn't call out at all.

854
00:52:53,674 --> 00:52:55,883
<i>I don't remember anything
after that.</i>

855
00:53:01,299 --> 00:53:02,799
<i>Except the beans.</i>

856
00:53:04,883 --> 00:53:06,049
<i>And the music.</i>

857
00:53:18,216 --> 00:53:19,633
<i>We were all so hungry.</i>

858
00:54:50,466 --> 00:54:51,466
Hello?

859
00:54:57,549 --> 00:55:00,549
<i>19.5 miles outside of town.</i>

860
00:55:02,591 --> 00:55:06,174
<i>They found Cash's truck
wrapped around a telephone pole.</i>

861
00:55:14,716 --> 00:55:18,258
<i>And the only person
I told was Sam.</i>

862
00:55:19,966 --> 00:55:21,674
Maybe we should
just wait for Cash.

863
00:55:23,466 --> 00:55:24,466
Yeah.

864
00:55:25,966 --> 00:55:27,799
But I think JJ can pass.

865
00:55:31,049 --> 00:55:33,924
I mean, with the jacket
and boots, it's probably fine.

866
00:55:34,174 --> 00:55:35,174
I think it's fine.

867
00:55:49,716 --> 00:55:51,008
So you just let me know...

868
00:55:51,008 --> 00:55:52,091
Yeah.

869
00:55:52,091 --> 00:55:54,174
I mean, I'm kind of tired,
so I don't want to hold it up.

870
00:55:54,174 --> 00:55:55,924
Yeah, I mean, I think
we'll do a couple.

871
00:55:56,174 --> 00:55:57,216
And see.

872
00:56:00,174 --> 00:56:01,799
About how high, or how low?

873
00:56:02,049 --> 00:56:03,966
- Okay...
- Can you even breathe in there?

874
00:56:06,049 --> 00:56:08,633
Well, the only way to do
the scene is with the mask on.

875
00:56:17,133 --> 00:56:19,174
Can you put your arm
over her shoulder?

876
00:56:21,841 --> 00:56:23,758
No, come on, JJ.
Like this.

877
00:56:23,758 --> 00:56:25,216
Like you mean it.

878
00:56:25,674 --> 00:56:27,091
Hang on her, JJ.

879
00:56:27,508 --> 00:56:29,091
Cover her almost.

880
00:56:30,216 --> 00:56:31,674
Man, can you fucking just--

881
00:56:31,674 --> 00:56:32,883
What is going on?

882
00:56:34,174 --> 00:56:35,799
What is going on?
Why are you--

883
00:56:35,924 --> 00:56:37,633
Can we just be a
little bit professional?

884
00:56:37,633 --> 00:56:40,008
This is really annoying
for me to have to

885
00:56:40,008 --> 00:56:41,508
stop my conversation,

886
00:56:41,508 --> 00:56:43,258
to be having this
conversation with you.

887
00:56:43,258 --> 00:56:45,174
It's really annoying
when you touch the boom.

888
00:56:45,174 --> 00:56:47,091
I didn't touch--
You touched me with a boom.

889
00:56:47,091 --> 00:56:49,508
- You never touch the camera.
- That's so fucking weird of you, man.

890
00:56:49,508 --> 00:56:50,966
- I can...
- Just be professional! It's like--

891
00:56:51,091 --> 00:56:53,341
Have we forgotten
how to do our job?

892
00:56:53,466 --> 00:56:54,841
You touched me with
the fucking boom.

893
00:56:54,841 --> 00:56:56,424
- I didn't do shit.
- Stop, stop, stop.

894
00:56:56,424 --> 00:56:57,758
- Stop yelling at people.
- I know we're fucking tired--

895
00:56:57,758 --> 00:56:59,133
- Please Vita. V!
- But let's all be fucking

896
00:56:59,133 --> 00:57:00,258
professional for a second.

897
00:57:00,633 --> 00:57:02,174
We are all here for your movie.

898
00:57:02,633 --> 00:57:04,841
It was an accident.
He didn't mean to hit you.

899
00:57:05,633 --> 00:57:07,383
He's stupid, he's not an asshole.

900
00:57:07,549 --> 00:57:08,549
You good?

901
00:57:25,216 --> 00:57:27,383
I think I drank
too much last night.

902
00:57:56,883 --> 00:57:58,008
Hey, Sam?

903
00:57:58,133 --> 00:57:59,174
Sam...

904
00:58:01,008 --> 00:58:02,383
What are we doing now?

905
00:58:05,716 --> 00:58:06,716
Hi.

906
00:58:08,966 --> 00:58:11,341
Sam told us what happened with Cash.

907
00:58:14,536 --> 00:58:15,841
- Uh-huh.
- Okay?

908
00:58:15,966 --> 00:58:17,383
- Yeah.
- So...

909
00:58:17,883 --> 00:58:19,299
besides the equipment...

910
00:58:20,674 --> 00:58:21,758
and us...

911
00:58:23,591 --> 00:58:25,841
you can still shoot
the rest of your movie.

912
00:58:53,966 --> 00:58:56,216
<i>I remember thinking I was brilliant.</i>

913
00:58:59,133 --> 00:59:00,174
Come get this fucker!

914
00:59:00,174 --> 00:59:02,216
<i>I wanted them to be wasted.</i>

915
00:59:05,299 --> 00:59:07,174
<i>I wanted it to be real.</i>

916
00:59:10,549 --> 00:59:11,591
<i>And...</i>

917
00:59:13,133 --> 00:59:14,799
<i>I guess in this moment...</i>

918
00:59:16,466 --> 00:59:19,133
<i>their performances
were brilliant.</i>

919
00:59:21,299 --> 00:59:23,216
<i>Or at least realistic.</i>

920
00:59:24,633 --> 00:59:26,174
We're having a baby!

921
00:59:27,799 --> 00:59:28,883
<i>Wasted.</i>

922
00:59:33,966 --> 00:59:36,841
<i>And even though
he didn't die...</i>

923
00:59:37,299 --> 00:59:39,133
And you're trying
to get him over here.

924
00:59:39,424 --> 00:59:42,466
<i>No amount of real
is worth someone's life.</i>

925
00:59:43,883 --> 00:59:44,966
Sam...

926
00:59:46,049 --> 00:59:47,049
And then...

927
00:59:47,049 --> 00:59:48,299
Yeah, look back at her.

928
01:00:11,508 --> 01:00:12,508
You alright?

929
01:00:22,299 --> 01:00:24,133
<i>When I was in
the sixth grade...</i>

930
01:00:24,841 --> 01:00:27,549
<i>my dad told me he had HIV.</i>

931
01:00:31,133 --> 01:00:32,966
<i>He'd had it my whole life.</i>

932
01:00:33,883 --> 01:00:35,383
<i>And I didn't tell anyone.</i>

933
01:00:37,508 --> 01:00:40,133
<i>Maybe because saying it out loud
would have made it true.</i>

934
01:00:40,674 --> 01:00:42,299
<i>Or because...</i>

935
01:00:44,841 --> 01:00:48,216
<i>Every person I saw like him
was a character in a movie.</i>

936
01:00:48,841 --> 01:00:50,508
How long was I asleep?

937
01:00:51,383 --> 01:00:52,716
<i>And they all died.</i>

938
01:00:56,758 --> 01:00:57,966
Where is everyone?

939
01:01:02,508 --> 01:01:03,841
I guess they're really gone.

940
01:01:07,924 --> 01:01:09,841
<i>But my dad didn't die.</i>

941
01:01:10,758 --> 01:01:12,841
<i>And so I cast him in my film.</i>

942
01:01:14,049 --> 01:01:15,883
<i>As the father of the main character.</i>

943
01:01:17,174 --> 01:01:18,758
We can film it on this.

944
01:01:19,799 --> 01:01:21,049
What is that?

945
01:01:21,216 --> 01:01:22,633
Your dad gave it to me.

946
01:01:23,424 --> 01:01:25,133
I already got some
pretty cool shots on it.

947
01:01:25,133 --> 01:01:26,716
No, absolutely not.

948
01:01:26,924 --> 01:01:28,091
This is the...

949
01:01:28,591 --> 01:01:31,133
this is the most important scene

950
01:01:31,133 --> 01:01:32,716
of the entire film.

951
01:01:32,716 --> 01:01:34,674
She is saying goodbye
to her dead dad

952
01:01:34,674 --> 01:01:36,174
before she gets
the fuck out of town.

953
01:01:36,174 --> 01:01:38,383
And if we don't get it, it's not
gonna make fucking sense.

954
01:01:38,383 --> 01:01:39,758
It's not gonna be good.

955
01:01:40,258 --> 01:01:42,799
When did being good
ever stop you?

956
01:01:43,758 --> 01:01:44,799
Ah f--

957
01:01:45,591 --> 01:01:48,008
Now come on, let's shoot this scene.

958
01:01:50,299 --> 01:01:53,883
So all I did was lay
in the grave for two hours

959
01:01:53,883 --> 01:01:56,133
contemplating death for nothing?

960
01:01:56,466 --> 01:01:58,258
This is so fucking stupid.

961
01:02:03,577 --> 01:02:04,944
Hello?

962
01:02:15,883 --> 01:02:17,341
Is that a real grave?

963
01:02:20,825 --> 01:02:21,867
You wanna hit?

964
01:02:22,508 --> 01:02:23,591
Stop!

965
01:02:24,216 --> 01:02:26,424
We share everything
on this hill.

966
01:02:35,633 --> 01:02:36,883
When I was your age,

967
01:02:37,424 --> 01:02:39,258
one of us just stood up
on a park bench

968
01:02:39,258 --> 01:02:41,549
and spun around
and pointed north.

969
01:02:42,258 --> 01:02:43,716
We had to get out of the city.

970
01:02:44,466 --> 01:02:46,383
We didn't want
to be with those people.

971
01:02:46,924 --> 01:02:48,049
Live with them.

972
01:02:48,258 --> 01:02:51,341
We certainly didn't want to be
buried near them either, huh?

973
01:02:51,549 --> 01:02:53,883
Dad, she doesn't
want to hear your story.

974
01:02:54,424 --> 01:02:55,591
Did you hear something?

975
01:02:57,299 --> 01:02:59,258
Are you sure
you guys are related?

976
01:03:01,216 --> 01:03:04,549
I know. How could somebody
so beautiful have a father like me?

977
01:03:06,174 --> 01:03:08,633
But I'm sure. I'm sure.

978
01:03:10,174 --> 01:03:13,133
She didn't tell you
how her moms conceived her?

979
01:03:13,466 --> 01:03:14,674
- Dad!
- No.

980
01:03:15,174 --> 01:03:17,174
Don't mind her, I'll tell you.

981
01:03:19,841 --> 01:03:21,133
She had a baby...

982
01:03:21,508 --> 01:03:24,133
and her mom told her
she could...

983
01:03:29,799 --> 01:03:30,883
Really?

984
01:03:31,091 --> 01:03:32,216
Yup.

985
01:03:32,633 --> 01:03:35,091
Imagine growing up your whole life,

986
01:03:35,091 --> 01:03:37,341
people telling you,
"Make a movie!

987
01:03:38,190 --> 01:03:41,065
You got a great fucking story!"

988
01:03:43,633 --> 01:03:44,633
Shit.

989
01:03:44,758 --> 01:03:46,758
That fucking great story is that

990
01:03:46,758 --> 01:03:50,549
your moms are lesbians
and your dad is gonna die.

991
01:03:51,674 --> 01:03:53,258
Maybe you should make a film.

992
01:03:53,508 --> 01:03:55,049
Believe me, I tried.

993
01:03:55,924 --> 01:03:58,466
I bought that
video camera for her birth.

994
01:03:59,216 --> 01:04:00,549
I tried all that.

995
01:04:00,841 --> 01:04:02,549
It was misunderstood.

996
01:04:03,674 --> 01:04:04,924
So I just gave it up.

997
01:04:06,049 --> 01:04:07,133
Well, that's a shame.

998
01:04:07,383 --> 01:04:08,424
Nah.

999
01:04:08,924 --> 01:04:11,216
It's a terrible world out there, girl.

1000
01:04:11,216 --> 01:04:16,049
But the strong women
said to the faggots,

1001
01:04:16,424 --> 01:04:18,341
"There are two important
things to remember

1002
01:04:18,341 --> 01:04:20,049
about the coming revolution.

1003
01:04:21,174 --> 01:04:24,133
The first is that we will
get our asses kicked.

1004
01:04:24,799 --> 01:04:27,508
The second is
that we will win."

1005
01:04:29,716 --> 01:04:30,883
Did you write that?

1006
01:04:31,299 --> 01:04:33,508
No. A friend did. He's dead.

1007
01:04:36,466 --> 01:04:40,299
But it always reminded me
of us up here on this hill.

1008
01:04:48,508 --> 01:04:50,633
<i>So the film was about a young woman.</i>

1009
01:04:53,924 --> 01:04:56,508
<i>Who was taking care
of her dying father.</i>

1010
01:04:58,633 --> 01:05:00,133
<i>She gets pregnant</i>

1011
01:05:00,716 --> 01:05:03,299
<i>and decides to leave home
in search of her mother,</i>

1012
01:05:03,758 --> 01:05:05,633
<i>who abandoned her at birth.</i>

1013
01:05:09,466 --> 01:05:11,174
This is a true story.

1014
01:05:12,841 --> 01:05:13,841
Except...

1015
01:05:14,799 --> 01:05:17,049
<i>I have two moms.</i>

1016
01:05:17,049 --> 01:05:19,008
<i>I had two abortions.</i>

1017
01:05:19,758 --> 01:05:23,383
<i>And my dad survived.</i>

1018
01:05:23,383 --> 01:05:25,966
Okay. So that's a wrap-wrap.

1019
01:05:26,174 --> 01:05:27,174
Wrap!

1020
01:05:27,174 --> 01:05:29,049
I'll probably take
a look at it and see if...

1021
01:05:29,049 --> 01:05:31,424
<i>And I think I made
the main character</i>

1022
01:05:31,424 --> 01:05:33,549
<i>live this parallel life to mine</i>

1023
01:05:33,549 --> 01:05:36,549
<i>because I didn't know how
to talk about these things.</i>

1024
01:05:38,091 --> 01:05:41,758
<i>Or I didn't trust the rules of cinema
to do them justice.</i>

1025
01:05:41,758 --> 01:05:43,591
- Dancing is my life.
- Good!

1026
01:05:43,591 --> 01:05:45,299
- That was so awkward.
<i>- Or...</i>

1027
01:05:45,299 --> 01:05:47,841
- You get to dance again tomorrow.
<i>- I was afraid to.</i>

1028
01:05:51,466 --> 01:05:52,633
<i>Still...</i>

1029
01:05:53,091 --> 01:05:56,299
<i>I wish I could show you
something that is true.</i>

1030
01:06:45,049 --> 01:06:49,758
<i>Did you know that most
filmmakers spend their entire lives</i>

1031
01:06:49,758 --> 01:06:52,591
<i>making some version
of the same movie.</i>

1032
01:06:55,174 --> 01:06:56,299
<i>And I wonder...</i>

1033
01:06:57,133 --> 01:06:58,466
<i>every time...</i>

1034
01:06:59,633 --> 01:07:01,549
<i>are they this alone?</i>

1035
01:07:23,980 --> 01:07:26,508
Okay! Let's go see Mama.

1036
01:07:26,508 --> 01:07:27,591
Boop!

1037
01:08:52,299 --> 01:08:53,508
You're so pretty.

1038
01:08:59,216 --> 01:09:00,799
What's your film about?

1039
01:09:54,633 --> 01:09:55,758
Hey...

1040
01:09:58,466 --> 01:09:59,633
Hey!

1041
01:10:01,924 --> 01:10:03,049
You're naked.

1042
01:10:04,174 --> 01:10:05,591
So are you!

1043
01:10:06,216 --> 01:10:07,924
Go get the fuck outta here!

1044
01:10:10,716 --> 01:10:12,424
Wait, we can't take his truck.

1045
01:10:12,924 --> 01:10:14,133
Just get in.

1046
01:10:15,174 --> 01:10:16,299
I mean, I should pee.

1047
01:10:19,424 --> 01:10:20,799
Yeah, me too.

1048
01:10:24,799 --> 01:10:26,049
Oh God!

1049
01:10:36,591 --> 01:10:38,008
I just decided.

1050
01:10:38,716 --> 01:10:41,424
I am going to go away
after we finish the film.

1051
01:10:42,091 --> 01:10:43,508
Yeah, there's this school.

1052
01:10:43,841 --> 01:10:45,383
I could take some film classes.

1053
01:10:46,758 --> 01:10:50,008
And it's near my dad's
so I can take care of him too.

1054
01:10:51,133 --> 01:10:53,549
And I need to stop smoking.

1055
01:10:58,841 --> 01:10:59,841
What?

1056
01:11:03,174 --> 01:11:05,591
I don't think we're gonna
finish the film.

1057
01:11:06,633 --> 01:11:07,633
Shut up.

1058
01:11:23,383 --> 01:11:24,383
Come on.

1059
01:11:25,174 --> 01:11:26,258
Come on, dance with me.

1060
01:11:29,133 --> 01:11:30,174
Come on.

1061
01:11:30,758 --> 01:11:31,883
Come on.

1062
01:12:14,674 --> 01:12:16,841
You don't need to tell me
what happened, man.

1063
01:12:16,841 --> 01:12:17,924
I get it.

1064
01:12:18,424 --> 01:12:20,174
You know I got pregnant too.

1065
01:12:20,383 --> 01:12:21,716
While you were gone.

1066
01:12:22,174 --> 01:12:23,341
But fuck that.

1067
01:12:23,799 --> 01:12:25,549
Making this film has been

1068
01:12:25,549 --> 01:12:27,508
fucking freeing.

1069
01:12:27,883 --> 01:12:29,966
A real resolution for me.

1070
01:12:51,049 --> 01:12:52,091
Come on.

1071
01:12:55,883 --> 01:12:56,966
Fuck, come on!

1072
01:12:57,799 --> 01:12:59,466
- What are we doing?
- Just come here.

1073
01:12:59,466 --> 01:13:00,549
Okay.

1074
01:13:02,466 --> 01:13:03,924
- Ready?
- Okay.

1075
01:13:04,591 --> 01:13:05,633
And a-one.

1076
01:13:06,508 --> 01:13:07,549
And a-two.

1077
01:13:08,383 --> 01:13:09,591
And a-three!

1078
01:13:20,258 --> 01:13:22,008
I mean tonight was fun but...

1079
01:13:22,174 --> 01:13:24,508
you know, I want more than
dudes who just want to fuck us

1080
01:13:24,508 --> 01:13:26,466
and have their babies.

1081
01:13:29,841 --> 01:13:31,758
You know, we've got to
finish making the film.

1082
01:13:38,924 --> 01:13:41,341
<i>You were always next to me.</i>

1083
01:13:44,258 --> 01:13:46,883
<i>Falling in love
with making something.</i>

1084
01:13:47,883 --> 01:13:50,174
<i>No matter how treacherous,</i>

1085
01:13:50,841 --> 01:13:51,841
<i>biting,</i>

1086
01:13:52,466 --> 01:13:53,549
<i>cruel.</i>

1087
01:13:59,216 --> 01:14:01,258
And so, ready or not,

1088
01:14:01,810 --> 01:14:02,810
willing or not,

1089
01:14:03,174 --> 01:14:04,758
we must come to comprehend

1090
01:14:04,883 --> 01:14:06,216
with full responsibility

1091
01:14:06,633 --> 01:14:09,633
the world in which
we've now created.

1092
01:14:23,230 --> 01:14:25,230
It's the best thing
you ever said to me.

1093
01:14:26,008 --> 01:14:28,133
That was actually
the best thing

1094
01:14:28,133 --> 01:14:30,633
you ever said to me.

1095
01:15:13,091 --> 01:15:14,174
It's going to be okay.

1096
01:16:08,091 --> 01:16:09,299
You okay?

1097
01:16:10,799 --> 01:16:12,216
We'll do that again.

1098
01:16:12,758 --> 01:16:13,841
Okay.

1099
01:16:14,674 --> 01:16:16,049
I think it's going.

1100
01:16:19,174 --> 01:16:20,758
Okay, start walking.

1101
01:16:32,633 --> 01:16:34,924
<i>Same with your legs,
can you put your legs over there?</i>

1102
01:16:42,174 --> 01:16:43,341
<i>Give me...</i>

1103
01:16:44,216 --> 01:16:45,466
<i>just like out.</i>

1104
01:17:09,799 --> 01:17:10,883
<i>Hi.</i>

1105
01:17:20,799 --> 01:17:21,841
What are you doing?

1106
01:17:22,299 --> 01:17:24,549
Just looking for planes.

1107
01:17:33,341 --> 01:17:34,758
Are you a ghost?

1108
01:17:36,424 --> 01:17:37,758
Boo!

1109
01:17:40,591 --> 01:17:42,883
Shouldn't you be going
to the hospital or something?

1110
01:17:46,508 --> 01:17:48,799
I read this story once
in the newspaper

1111
01:17:48,799 --> 01:17:52,258
about this kid who had to be
born in the hospital.

1112
01:17:54,049 --> 01:17:56,341
See, there was this lady.

1113
01:17:56,341 --> 01:17:58,466
She kept trying to have babies.

1114
01:17:58,466 --> 01:18:00,591
But every time she had a baby,

1115
01:18:00,591 --> 01:18:02,383
it would die in her stomach.

1116
01:18:03,258 --> 01:18:04,633
So the grandmother said,

1117
01:18:04,799 --> 01:18:08,966
"Oh, I've already had babies.
I can have another one."

1118
01:18:09,216 --> 01:18:10,466
So that's what they did.

1119
01:18:10,466 --> 01:18:13,549
They took the sperm and
they put it inside the egg,

1120
01:18:13,549 --> 01:18:14,674
and then they took the egg

1121
01:18:14,674 --> 01:18:16,549
and they put it
in the grandmother.

1122
01:18:17,008 --> 01:18:18,341
And when it was ready
to come out,

1123
01:18:18,341 --> 01:18:19,924
they took her to the hospital

1124
01:18:19,924 --> 01:18:23,216
and they cut her open
and took the baby out.

1125
01:18:23,799 --> 01:18:24,841
Whoa.

1126
01:18:24,841 --> 01:18:25,924
Yeah.

1127
01:18:25,924 --> 01:18:27,258
It was really cool.

1128
01:18:27,799 --> 01:18:30,258
Except since it was born
from its grandmother

1129
01:18:31,466 --> 01:18:33,841
it had, like, old lady blood.

1130
01:18:33,841 --> 01:18:35,216
So it was like an old person

1131
01:18:35,216 --> 01:18:37,966
and a young person in one.

1132
01:18:40,591 --> 01:18:42,299
Anyway, that probably
won't happen to you

1133
01:18:42,299 --> 01:18:44,133
because you're not an old person.

1134
01:18:44,674 --> 01:18:45,758
And what am I?

1135
01:18:46,883 --> 01:18:51,174
In this life, ideally, happy.

1136
01:18:52,924 --> 01:18:54,049
You want a hit?

1137
01:18:54,049 --> 01:18:55,216
Cut!

1138
01:18:56,674 --> 01:18:57,966
- What?
- Cut!

1139
01:18:57,966 --> 01:19:01,174
Why did you stop us?
We were just getting going.

1140
01:19:01,174 --> 01:19:03,591
Dad, she's pregnant.
You can't offer her weed.

1141
01:19:03,591 --> 01:19:05,133
You know, I don't even know

1142
01:19:05,133 --> 01:19:07,466
if the film is about
her being pregnant.

1143
01:19:07,758 --> 01:19:09,716
Have you ever
seen a pregnant person?

1144
01:19:10,091 --> 01:19:11,424
Look at that belly.

1145
01:19:13,508 --> 01:19:15,049
What do you mean?
It looks good.

1146
01:19:15,883 --> 01:19:17,258
It looks like a pillow.

1147
01:19:17,258 --> 01:19:18,799
No, it doesn't.

1148
01:19:19,799 --> 01:19:22,216
- It does.
- Totally.

1149
01:19:23,133 --> 01:19:24,924
Why didn't anyone tell me?

1150
01:19:27,091 --> 01:19:28,258
Does it even matter?

1151
01:19:30,258 --> 01:19:31,508
Ah, shit!

1152
01:19:31,924 --> 01:19:33,258
It is a pillow.

1153
01:19:33,549 --> 01:19:35,133
Hang on, this is not
a joke, Dad.

1154
01:19:35,133 --> 01:19:38,133
My whole fucking life is
riding on this movie

1155
01:19:38,133 --> 01:19:41,049
so I need the belly to look
like a fucking pregnancy belly.

1156
01:19:41,049 --> 01:19:42,883
Why didn't we
have this conversation

1157
01:19:42,883 --> 01:19:45,091
like nine months ago, Alexis?

1158
01:19:45,674 --> 01:19:47,174
I think people tried to.

1159
01:19:50,383 --> 01:19:51,758
I'm scared.

1160
01:19:51,758 --> 01:19:54,133
Has the belly looked
fake the whole time?

1161
01:19:54,358 --> 01:19:55,358
I like it.

1162
01:19:55,480 --> 01:19:58,813
It's like an allegory.
Like a metaphor.

1163
01:19:59,674 --> 01:20:02,258
It's like an act of creation.

1164
01:20:02,883 --> 01:20:04,466
Pillow is child,

1165
01:20:04,466 --> 01:20:07,133
soft, weird, hot air,

1166
01:20:07,133 --> 01:20:10,841
cumulus, myth,
way up and way down.

1167
01:20:10,841 --> 01:20:12,924
What does it all mean?

1168
01:20:13,341 --> 01:20:15,258
The belly should be realistic.

1169
01:20:15,258 --> 01:20:16,883
Like, she really is pregnant.

1170
01:20:16,883 --> 01:20:18,758
I feel like it's depends what
movie you want to make,

1171
01:20:18,758 --> 01:20:21,216
if the show is
based in reality, right?

1172
01:20:21,341 --> 01:20:22,383
What?

1173
01:20:22,924 --> 01:20:24,216
Where are you from?

1174
01:20:24,549 --> 01:20:26,674
You can't show everything!

1175
01:20:27,549 --> 01:20:31,383
Reality has never,
will never be safe.

1176
01:20:32,133 --> 01:20:34,424
Not for me, not for you.

1177
01:20:34,424 --> 01:20:37,424
Reality is not art.

1178
01:20:37,424 --> 01:20:39,174
Art is this.

1179
01:20:41,508 --> 01:20:45,883
Up in the clouds,
floating to the future.

1180
01:20:46,424 --> 01:20:48,508
Yeah, you just gotta explain

1181
01:20:48,508 --> 01:20:51,174
to the audience why you
chose to use a pillow.

1182
01:20:51,508 --> 01:20:53,466
Yeah and this one director
who used to...

1183
01:20:54,258 --> 01:20:56,716
<i>And I remember this so well.</i>

1184
01:20:59,383 --> 01:21:02,383
<i>It's just for a moment
I stopped caring.</i>

1185
01:21:03,674 --> 01:21:05,549
<i>'Cause it was so beautiful.</i>

1186
01:21:07,716 --> 01:21:10,049
<i>Just to be making
something with people.</i>

1187
01:21:27,174 --> 01:21:29,383
And I wish I had stayed right here.

1188
01:21:39,508 --> 01:21:40,841
So...

1189
01:21:41,299 --> 01:21:45,383
is this movie about pregnancy?

1190
01:21:49,591 --> 01:21:51,841
<i>I named the main character Anne Marie</i>

1191
01:21:51,841 --> 01:21:53,508
<i>because I had read somewhere</i>

1192
01:21:53,508 --> 01:21:56,341
<i>that it means mother
and daughter in one.</i>

1193
01:21:58,258 --> 01:22:01,466
<i>And the film
had many endings.</i>

1194
01:22:02,216 --> 01:22:06,174
<i>But by the time
Anne Marie finally gives birth,</i>

1195
01:22:06,758 --> 01:22:08,758
<i>which is a scene we actually shot</i>

1196
01:22:08,758 --> 01:22:10,966
<i>before the entire crew quit.</i>

1197
01:22:12,466 --> 01:22:14,883
<i>we were supposed
to understand</i>

1198
01:22:14,883 --> 01:22:18,466
<i>that she's not giving birth to a baby.</i>

1199
01:22:19,883 --> 01:22:21,299
<i>Instead,</i>

1200
01:22:21,591 --> 01:22:23,633
<i>and please hold your laughter,</i>

1201
01:22:25,383 --> 01:22:28,799
<i>the audience has
come to understand...</i>

1202
01:22:29,674 --> 01:22:30,716
Action.

1203
01:22:32,174 --> 01:22:37,091
<i>that she is giving birth to herself.</i>

1204
01:22:46,883 --> 01:22:50,924
<i>And after meticulously
cutting together the montage,</i>

1205
01:22:50,924 --> 01:22:53,133
<i>in which Anne Marie
gives birth to herself</i>

1206
01:22:53,133 --> 01:22:55,549
<i>in all the places
she's already been,</i>

1207
01:22:57,230 --> 01:22:59,021
I went to the post office

1208
01:23:00,216 --> 01:23:02,883
and I mailed the film
to as many film festivals

1209
01:23:02,883 --> 01:23:04,383
as I could afford to.

1210
01:23:04,383 --> 01:23:07,424
Maybe a hundred or...

1211
01:23:08,841 --> 01:23:10,883
fifty, or twenty, or...

1212
01:23:12,633 --> 01:23:13,758
twelve.

1213
01:23:15,341 --> 01:23:16,383
And...

1214
01:23:17,883 --> 01:23:19,424
and I went home.

1215
01:23:22,508 --> 01:23:23,799
And I waited.

1216
01:23:27,424 --> 01:23:31,133
<i>And here's the real plot twist.</i>

1217
01:23:31,466 --> 01:23:32,674
Push!

1218
01:23:34,549 --> 01:23:41,216
<i>The film was not accepted
into a single festival.</i>

1219
01:23:50,591 --> 01:23:54,091
<i>After I received that
final rejection, I pissed blood.</i>

1220
01:23:57,049 --> 01:23:58,549
<i>See, despite doing everything that</i>

1221
01:23:58,549 --> 01:24:01,424
<i>they tell young filmmakers to do</i>

1222
01:24:02,216 --> 01:24:05,591
<i>despite begging
and borrowing and stealing,</i>

1223
01:24:05,966 --> 01:24:07,883
<i>alienating my friends and family,</i>

1224
01:24:08,049 --> 01:24:10,341
<i>and writing from my experience
in crowdfunding,</i>

1225
01:24:10,466 --> 01:24:12,966
<i>and almost
fucking killing someone.</i>

1226
01:24:21,008 --> 01:24:22,674
<i>If you look the film up online</i>

1227
01:24:22,674 --> 01:24:26,008
<i>right now, it is considered abandoned.</i>

1228
01:24:31,174 --> 01:24:35,716
<i>And my film was never seen
by anyone.</i>

1229
01:24:52,633 --> 01:24:54,133
<i>And last night I stayed up</i>

1230
01:24:54,133 --> 01:24:57,383
<i>watching my film again and again.</i>

1231
01:25:04,174 --> 01:25:06,216
And I texted a friend.

1232
01:25:06,799 --> 01:25:09,966
Why am I the only person I know

1233
01:25:09,966 --> 01:25:12,716
who this has happened to?

1234
01:25:16,716 --> 01:25:19,383
<i>And they must have looked
away from their phone.</i>

1235
01:25:21,799 --> 01:25:23,091
<i>And back again.</i>

1236
01:25:24,966 --> 01:25:27,424
<i>And said to me.</i>

1237
01:26:05,883 --> 01:26:07,258
Are you still there?

1238
01:26:16,091 --> 01:26:18,174
So this is my first film.

1239
01:26:22,258 --> 01:26:23,674
<i>I thought that writing it out</i>

1240
01:26:23,674 --> 01:26:25,383
<i>and filming it
and casting an actress</i>

1241
01:26:25,383 --> 01:26:27,341
<i>to play me was going to
make it all feel better,</i>

1242
01:26:27,341 --> 01:26:30,258
<i>but I never thought about it ending.</i>

1243
01:26:34,383 --> 01:26:36,966
<i>I've tried so many times
to tell this story,</i>

1244
01:26:36,966 --> 01:26:39,924
<i>but if I could not get here,</i>

1245
01:26:42,091 --> 01:26:43,383
<i>to you.</i>

1246
01:26:46,383 --> 01:26:48,591
I would abort the project.

1247
01:26:52,758 --> 01:26:54,758
Because abortion is...

1248
01:26:58,591 --> 01:27:00,341
an understanding.

1249
01:27:05,841 --> 01:27:07,508
But abandoned...

1250
01:27:09,341 --> 01:27:10,341
unseen.

1251
01:27:32,049 --> 01:27:33,466
Look what you did.

1252
01:27:38,174 --> 01:27:40,174
I feel like
I'm doing a bad job.

1253
01:28:06,299 --> 01:28:08,674
How does this film end, Zia?

1254
01:28:10,841 --> 01:28:12,966
What do we do now?

1255
01:28:39,174 --> 01:28:41,299
Okay.

1256
01:28:42,341 --> 01:28:43,549
Hey...

1257
01:28:45,383 --> 01:28:46,508
Jessie.

1258
01:28:49,966 --> 01:28:52,174
Hi. Are you ready to move on?

1259
01:28:53,174 --> 01:28:54,924
- Yeah.
- Come on, let's go.

1260
01:28:55,258 --> 01:28:56,341
Okay.

1261
01:28:56,924 --> 01:28:57,966
Yeah.

1262
01:29:08,424 --> 01:29:09,841
<i>It doesn't end.</i>

1263
01:29:12,591 --> 01:29:15,383
<i>But you will make
something again.</i>

1264
01:29:16,633 --> 01:29:18,674
<i>With people you care about,</i>

1265
01:29:19,174 --> 01:29:21,008
<i>and who care about you.</i>

1266
01:29:24,424 --> 01:29:27,049
<i>And it will be hard</i>

1267
01:29:27,049 --> 01:29:28,674
<i>and embarrassing.</i>

1268
01:29:33,383 --> 01:29:37,383
<i>But eventually you will
stop losing sleep.</i>

1269
01:29:38,216 --> 01:29:40,174
<i>And stop worrying.</i>

1270
01:29:43,174 --> 01:29:45,633
<i>You will make things from joy.</i>

1271
01:29:46,091 --> 01:29:48,008
<i>And not despair.</i>

1272
01:29:49,258 --> 01:29:53,424
<i>Even films that should not be films.</i>

1273
01:29:54,883 --> 01:29:58,716
<i>And every time you will
give birth to yourself.</i>

1274
01:29:59,091 --> 01:30:03,549
<i>And every time you will find
a new version of the truth.</i>

1275
01:30:03,966 --> 01:30:06,299
<i>Again and again</i>

1276
01:30:07,258 --> 01:30:08,424
<i>and again.</i>

1277
01:30:19,174 --> 01:30:20,174
Vita.

1278
01:30:21,383 --> 01:30:23,466
Birthday please.

1279
01:30:23,466 --> 01:30:25,091
November 23rd.

1280
01:30:25,633 --> 01:30:26,674
Oh.

1281
01:30:26,674 --> 01:30:27,924
Happy belated.

1282
01:30:28,466 --> 01:30:30,299
23 on 23.

1283
01:30:31,049 --> 01:30:33,508
That is a once in a lifetime year.

1284
01:30:36,716 --> 01:30:37,799
Alright.

1285
01:30:39,633 --> 01:30:40,883
So how are you feeling?

1286
01:30:43,924 --> 01:30:45,841
Okay, I just want to remind you

1287
01:30:45,841 --> 01:30:49,424
that you are absolutely
within your rights to be here.

1288
01:30:52,133 --> 01:30:54,383
And if you've been having
any new doubts

1289
01:30:54,383 --> 01:30:55,674
since you signed the consent,

1290
01:30:55,674 --> 01:30:58,133
you are also absolutely
within your rights

1291
01:30:58,133 --> 01:31:00,924
to leave this room
without this procedure.

1292
01:31:03,299 --> 01:31:05,549
So, may I ask you,

1293
01:31:06,424 --> 01:31:07,924
are you having any doubts?

1294
01:31:10,799 --> 01:31:12,133
- No.
- Okay.

1295
01:31:13,133 --> 01:31:14,716
Then I'd like to tell you something.

1296
01:31:14,716 --> 01:31:16,799
It's something I tell everyone.

1297
01:31:18,883 --> 01:31:20,424
What we're about to do here

1298
01:31:20,424 --> 01:31:22,799
is remove a small group of cells

1299
01:31:22,799 --> 01:31:25,299
that could not exist
outside of your body.

1300
01:31:26,216 --> 01:31:28,133
I just want to be sure
we dissolve any fear

1301
01:31:28,133 --> 01:31:30,216
you might have
about regret, okay?

1302
01:31:30,883 --> 01:31:32,008
Okay.

1303
01:31:32,591 --> 01:31:36,133
So I'm going to talk you
through absolutely everything.

1304
01:31:36,966 --> 01:31:39,091
But first,
would you like a tissue?

1305
01:31:56,008 --> 01:31:57,174
Okay.

1306
01:32:01,549 --> 01:32:02,674
That's better?

1307
01:32:03,966 --> 01:32:07,299
Alright, so go ahead
and lean back

1308
01:32:07,424 --> 01:32:10,424
and put your feet into the,

1309
01:32:10,424 --> 01:32:12,424
into the stirrups here for me.

1310
01:32:13,424 --> 01:32:15,216
Great. And then just

1311
01:32:15,216 --> 01:32:17,799
scooch down
the table just a little.

1312
01:32:18,674 --> 01:32:19,674
And...

1313
01:32:20,091 --> 01:32:22,383
go ahead and place
your hands right here.

1314
01:32:23,883 --> 01:32:25,049
Perfect.

1315
01:32:27,424 --> 01:32:28,424
Oops.

1316
01:32:28,758 --> 01:32:29,883
Okay.

1317
01:32:37,091 --> 01:32:38,174
Okay.

1318
01:32:38,466 --> 01:32:40,549
Cold hands coming through.
Are you ready?

1319
01:32:40,924 --> 01:32:41,966
Yeah.

1320
01:32:51,966 --> 01:32:55,091
It is so cool
to see you as an adult.

1321
01:32:56,799 --> 01:32:58,258
I mean, you wouldn't
remember me.

1322
01:32:58,258 --> 01:33:00,400
You were just that tiny baby.

1323
01:33:02,091 --> 01:33:04,716
I was a midwife's assistant
back then.

1324
01:33:05,216 --> 01:33:07,216
I was at your birth.

1325
01:33:07,216 --> 01:33:08,799
I helped deliver you.

1326
01:33:10,383 --> 01:33:12,549
I'm sorry. Would you like me to be quiet?

1327
01:33:12,883 --> 01:33:14,799
Some people do prefer quiet.

1328
01:33:17,883 --> 01:33:19,466
Did you pick this music?

1329
01:33:21,258 --> 01:33:22,883
It reminds me of
my Enya days.

1330
01:33:22,883 --> 01:33:24,633
It's a really great choice.

1331
01:33:26,216 --> 01:33:27,341
Speculum.

1332
01:33:27,466 --> 01:33:29,674
That's the thing that's
shaped like a duck bill.

1333
01:33:36,174 --> 01:33:39,258
You know,
the story of your conception

1334
01:33:39,383 --> 01:33:41,508
was really pretty extraordinary.

1335
01:33:42,258 --> 01:33:43,549
It's a town myth.

1336
01:33:44,466 --> 01:33:47,258
You're going to feel something
like a small pinch now?

1337
01:33:57,258 --> 01:33:59,383
Actually, would you tell it to me?

1338
01:33:59,966 --> 01:34:01,341
This story of your conception?

1339
01:34:03,883 --> 01:34:05,049
Okay.

1340
01:34:06,549 --> 01:34:08,008
Where should we begin?

1341
01:34:11,549 --> 01:34:13,424
First, your father

1342
01:34:14,341 --> 01:34:17,633
finds a 35mm film canister.

1343
01:34:19,216 --> 01:34:20,966
And then he jerks off into it.

1344
01:34:21,924 --> 01:34:23,424
And then he puts on the top

1345
01:34:23,424 --> 01:34:25,383
and puts it into
his breast pocket.

1346
01:34:28,174 --> 01:34:31,341
He puts on his coat
and goes out into a snowstorm.

1347
01:34:33,549 --> 01:34:35,466
He makes sure
to keep his hand

1348
01:34:36,008 --> 01:34:37,383
over his heart

1349
01:34:37,716 --> 01:34:39,549
to keep that canister warm.

1350
01:34:42,883 --> 01:34:45,633
At the top of the hill,
he knocks on a cabin door

1351
01:34:46,424 --> 01:34:47,924
and your moms answer.

1352
01:34:48,549 --> 01:34:51,258
They take that
35mm canister from him

1353
01:34:51,258 --> 01:34:52,716
and slam the door.

1354
01:34:53,883 --> 01:34:55,591
And then they load the contents

1355
01:34:55,591 --> 01:34:57,924
into a small plastic syringe.

1356
01:34:58,216 --> 01:35:01,883
The kind that's usually used
to feed baby cats.

1357
01:35:05,049 --> 01:35:07,633
And then one of
them uses that syringe

1358
01:35:08,466 --> 01:35:10,383
to inject the contents

1359
01:35:11,758 --> 01:35:13,466
into her cervix.

1360
01:35:16,883 --> 01:35:18,091
And...

1361
01:35:20,841 --> 01:35:22,383
nine months later

1362
01:35:23,883 --> 01:35:25,133
you were born.

1363
01:35:27,424 --> 01:35:29,174
And that's a true story.

1364
01:35:33,716 --> 01:35:34,716
So...

1365
01:35:35,799 --> 01:35:37,758
are you ready for a loud noise?

1366
01:35:41,924 --> 01:35:43,008
Good.

1367
01:35:45,549 --> 01:35:46,924
You know

1368
01:35:47,174 --> 01:35:51,174
all you need
is a body to create.

1369
01:35:52,049 --> 01:35:53,716
But what you create

1370
01:35:55,258 --> 01:35:56,674
that is up to you.
