00:03:12,876 --> 00:03:17,460
HAVANA, 1961. MANY PEOPLE
FLED THE COUNTRY

17
00:04:19,793 --> 00:04:22,418
EXIT

18
00:05:31,668 --> 00:05:34,460
She'll have to work over there...

19
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:38,835
At least until she finds
some dumb guy who'll marry her.

20
00:05:40,293 --> 00:05:42,335
Frankly, she's still good looking.

21
00:05:43,668 --> 00:05:47,418
She'll remember me while
she goes through bad times and then...

22
00:05:48,585 --> 00:05:50,960
I've been really stupid.

23
00:05:51,501 --> 00:05:54,751
Working to support her
as if she'd been born

24
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,835
in New York or Paris

25
00:05:57,501 --> 00:05:59,960
and not on this underdeveloped island.

26
00:06:00,168 --> 00:06:01,126
Excuse me.

27
00:07:14,585 --> 00:07:19,126
<i>“All those who loved me</i>

28
00:07:20,293 --> 00:07:23,418
<i>and...</i>

29
00:07:27,585 --> 00:07:33,335
<i>bugged me up until the last minute</i>

30
00:07:36,085 --> 00:07:38,043
<i>have left."</i>

31
00:07:45,001 --> 00:07:46,960
For years I said that if I had time

32
00:07:47,168 --> 00:07:50,251
I would write a book
and keep a diary.

33
00:07:52,293 --> 00:07:55,335
Now I'll know if I really
have something to say.

34
00:09:05,501 --> 00:09:06,626
Nothing has changed.

35
00:09:14,668 --> 00:09:16,335
Nothing has changed here.

36
00:09:17,876 --> 00:09:21,918
At first sight it looks like a set,
a cardboard city.

37
00:09:29,585 --> 00:09:31,126
The Bronze Titan.

38
00:09:32,293 --> 00:09:35,710
Free and independent Cuba.
Who'd have imagined this?

39
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:39,043
No Imperial Eagle.

40
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:42,335
And the dove
Picasso was supposed to send?

41
00:09:42,585 --> 00:09:46,043
It's real easy to be a communist
and a millionaire in Paris.

42
00:09:52,001 --> 00:09:55,751
"This mankind has said enough
and has started to walk."

43
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,043
Like my parents.

44
00:09:57,293 --> 00:10:01,043
Like Laura. They won't stop
till they get to Miami.

45
00:10:01,251 --> 00:10:04,043
But everything
seems so different today.

46
00:10:04,668 --> 00:10:07,126
Have I changed or has the city?

47
00:10:35,001 --> 00:10:36,751
"It's time to leave.

48
00:10:38,585 --> 00:10:41,626
Oh, abandoned like piers at dawn.

49
00:10:42,085 --> 00:10:44,460
All in you was a shipwreck."

50
00:10:56,876 --> 00:10:58,960
<i>- What are you doing?
- Can't you see?</i>

51
00:11:00,293 --> 00:11:02,335
<i>I meant what are you reading?</i>

52
00:11:03,376 --> 00:11:06,543
<i>A frivolous, decadent thing:
“The Best of Everything“</i>

53
00:11:06,751 --> 00:11:09,043
<i>or “The Best in the World“, whatever.</i>

54
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,043
<i>Oh, that film.</i>

55
00:11:11,293 --> 00:11:12,543
<i>Yeah, that one.</i>

56
00:11:14,168 --> 00:11:15,793
<i>- Leave me alone.
- Me?</i>

57
00:11:16,001 --> 00:11:18,126
<i>I can't read with you looking at me</i>

58
00:11:18,335 --> 00:11:19,960
<i>as if I were a weirdo.</i>

59
00:11:22,168 --> 00:11:23,543
<i>Why don't we chat?</i>

60
00:11:23,751 --> 00:11:24,793
What's come over you?

61
00:11:25,001 --> 00:11:26,751
<i>What's bugging you?</i>

62
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:29,626
<i>These days you only speak of bugs.</i>

63
00:11:30,293 --> 00:11:31,710
<i>Why not?</i>

64
00:11:32,168 --> 00:11:35,835
<i>We are surrounded by bugs,
rabble, filthy people...</i>

65
00:11:36,085 --> 00:11:37,960
<i>This country stymies you.</i>

66
00:11:38,168 --> 00:11:40,543
<i>And you? What do you think?</i>

67
00:11:41,251 --> 00:11:45,751
<i>What? You've never been
interested in what I think.</i>

68
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:46,960
What's come over you?

69
00:11:47,168 --> 00:11:49,918
<i>You're practicing your English
a lot lately.</i>

70
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:51,460
<i>You're planning to leave.</i>

71
00:11:51,668 --> 00:11:53,751
<i>What? Let go of me.</i>

72
00:11:54,585 --> 00:11:57,835
<i>I like it when you get vulgar.</i>

73
00:11:58,168 --> 00:12:00,126
<i>It actually turns me on</i>

74
00:12:00,751 --> 00:12:03,418
<i>to see you switch between flip-flops
and fancy things,</i>

75
00:12:03,626 --> 00:12:05,835
<i>elegance and vulgarity.</i>

76
00:12:09,251 --> 00:12:11,543
<i>I've been looking at you
and I find you funny.</i>

77
00:12:12,293 --> 00:12:13,835
<i>You're acting strangely.</i>

78
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:17,543
<i>You've become
rather disgusting lately.</i>

79
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:21,210
<i>I haven't got
any Yardley brilliantine,</i>

80
00:12:21,418 --> 00:12:22,793
<i>or Colgate toothpaste,</i>

81
00:12:23,001 --> 00:12:25,626
<i>or imperialist aftershave.</i>

82
00:12:26,085 --> 00:12:29,251
<i>- You know that helps a lot.
- Yes, it must be that.</i>

83
00:12:30,668 --> 00:12:32,710
<i>Yet you become more attractive
every day.</i>

84
00:12:33,001 --> 00:12:34,418
<i>- Really?
- Yes.</i>

85
00:12:34,626 --> 00:12:36,251
<i>You're more artificial.</i>

86
00:12:36,668 --> 00:12:39,960
<i>I don't fancy natural beauty.
I like women like you,</i>

87
00:12:40,168 --> 00:12:43,543
<i>who are all about
good clothes, good food,</i>

88
00:12:43,751 --> 00:12:45,960
<i>make-up, massages...</i>

89
00:12:46,501 --> 00:12:48,751
<i>You're no longer
common Cuban riffraff,</i>

90
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:51,543
<i>you've turned into a dazzling beauty.</i>

91
00:12:52,085 --> 00:12:55,751
<i>Are you serious
or are you mocking me?</i>

92
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,210
<i>Both.</i>

93
00:12:57,418 --> 00:12:59,543
<i>Go mock your mommy, honey!</i>

94
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,251
<i>Go to hell!</i>

95
00:13:01,585 --> 00:13:02,918
<i>I like it! I really do!</i>

96
00:13:03,126 --> 00:13:04,960
<i>Are you insane?</i>

97
00:13:05,168 --> 00:13:07,210
<i>Let go of me!
I can't stand you.</i>

98
00:13:07,418 --> 00:13:10,251
<i>I can't stand living here,
with the heat, the sweat...</i>

99
00:13:10,501 --> 00:13:13,626
<i>You sweat too much,
you're disgusting. Let go of me!</i>

100
00:13:16,793 --> 00:13:19,335
<i>You know I'm recording all this?</i>

101
00:13:19,585 --> 00:13:20,460
<i>- What?
- Everything.</i>

102
00:13:21,001 --> 00:13:22,251
<i>Every single word.</i>

103
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:24,918
<i>It will be very fun to listen to.</i>

104
00:13:25,126 --> 00:13:27,460
<i>You're a monster, you're sick!</i>

105
00:13:27,668 --> 00:13:29,418
<i>You're going to break it!</i>

106
00:15:01,085 --> 00:15:03,543
Here women look at your eyes,

107
00:15:03,876 --> 00:15:06,626
as if your gaze could touch them.

108
00:15:12,668 --> 00:15:16,751
This happens
nowhere else in the world.

109
00:15:19,085 --> 00:15:23,335
Perhaps Italian women look
a little more, but not like this.

110
00:15:48,293 --> 00:15:52,335
Since El Encanto burned down,
Havana's a provincial town.

111
00:15:59,501 --> 00:16:01,918
They used to call it
the Caribbean Paris.

112
00:16:05,793 --> 00:16:08,251
OUR WINE IS BITTER,
BUT IT'S OURS.

113
00:16:08,668 --> 00:16:10,918
At least the tourists and whores did.

114
00:16:12,501 --> 00:16:14,251
Now it's more like

115
00:16:15,085 --> 00:16:17,335
the Caribbean Tegucigalpa.

116
00:16:22,876 --> 00:16:27,210
Not just because El Encanto's gone
and there's nothing good to buy,

117
00:16:27,418 --> 00:16:29,126
it's the people too.

118
00:16:56,501 --> 00:16:58,543
What's the sense of life for them?

119
00:17:00,168 --> 00:17:01,210
And for me?

120
00:17:02,085 --> 00:17:04,335
And what does life mean for me?

121
00:17:05,501 --> 00:17:07,210
But I'm not like them.

122
00:17:14,293 --> 00:17:18,543
They're starting the first
Socialist revolution in America.

123
00:17:18,876 --> 00:17:19,751
So what?

124
00:17:20,793 --> 00:17:23,543
They'll fall into barbarism
and starve.

125
00:17:23,751 --> 00:17:27,043
Like the Haitians.
They beat Napoleon, so what?

126
00:17:27,751 --> 00:17:31,251
They used to have
the best sugar industry in the world.

127
00:17:31,501 --> 00:17:34,835
Look at them now:
barefoot and zombie-like.

128
00:17:35,501 --> 00:17:36,835
Times change.

129
00:17:37,085 --> 00:17:39,043
But it's not our problem.

130
00:17:39,293 --> 00:17:41,126
It's between the Russians
and Americans.

131
00:17:41,335 --> 00:17:43,543
It's none of our business.

132
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:47,460
Something is clear: there'll be
a huge hassle in the future.

133
00:17:48,085 --> 00:17:52,043
And you'll know
who'll get hit first: us.

134
00:17:52,293 --> 00:17:53,251
Know why?

135
00:17:53,501 --> 00:17:56,710
Because we're a tiny, little island.

136
00:17:57,376 --> 00:18:00,751
Well, you'll be hit,
because I won't be here, got that?

137
00:18:02,168 --> 00:18:06,043
We've been together
all the time for five years.

138
00:18:08,668 --> 00:18:13,460
Under Batista, things reached a point
where they had to change.

139
00:18:13,668 --> 00:18:14,960
Not me.

140
00:18:16,168 --> 00:18:19,460
I kept out of politics,
I have a clear conscience.

141
00:18:20,585 --> 00:18:24,335
I've done nothing
but work like a mule all my life.

142
00:18:25,668 --> 00:18:27,210
See Anita?

143
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:30,418
So stunning and
her belly is full of black beans.

144
00:18:30,626 --> 00:18:31,835
I saw her eating.

145
00:18:32,793 --> 00:18:34,960
But they have
all the resources, Sergio...

146
00:18:35,168 --> 00:18:38,126
and the know-how
to develop the country's economy.

147
00:18:38,335 --> 00:18:39,043
Fill it up.

148
00:18:39,293 --> 00:18:41,626
- The know-how?
- Yes, the know-how.

149
00:18:42,251 --> 00:18:44,626
Americans know how to do things,

150
00:18:44,835 --> 00:18:46,960
they know how to make things work.

151
00:18:54,376 --> 00:18:55,251
Three.

152
00:18:56,085 --> 00:18:58,751
- Check the oil.
- I have no oil.

153
00:18:59,376 --> 00:19:01,251
But I'll check it anyway.

154
00:19:03,251 --> 00:19:04,543
No... what for?

155
00:19:12,876 --> 00:19:16,793
I wouldn't give a shit but I have to
return it in the same condition it was.

156
00:19:17,001 --> 00:19:17,751
Why?

157
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,043
For inventory.

158
00:19:19,293 --> 00:19:22,335
If I don't, they won't let me leave.

159
00:19:23,293 --> 00:19:27,335
I can't get you a sealed unit,
you'll have to find it yourself.

160
00:19:27,585 --> 00:19:29,460
Things have changed now...

161
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:30,793
Yes, I know.

162
00:19:31,001 --> 00:19:33,251
The paint job won't be the same.

163
00:19:34,085 --> 00:19:37,710
If we can't find wood alcohol
we'll have to use synthetic paint,

164
00:19:37,918 --> 00:19:39,126
it's different.

165
00:19:39,876 --> 00:19:42,751
We'll have to paint that part at least,

166
00:19:43,001 --> 00:19:43,918
so it looks good.

167
00:19:44,126 --> 00:19:45,335
And this dent?

168
00:19:45,585 --> 00:19:47,460
And down there too.

169
00:19:51,001 --> 00:19:53,751
Some say the only thing
Cubans can't stand is going hungry.

170
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:57,710
Yet there's been much hunger
here since the Spaniards came.

171
00:20:01,585 --> 00:20:05,251
In Latin America,
four children die per minute

172
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:07,460
because of diseases
caused by malnutrition.

173
00:20:07,668 --> 00:20:09,043
In ten years

174
00:20:09,251 --> 00:20:11,918
that's 20 million children.

175
00:20:12,126 --> 00:20:15,835
The same number of deaths
in the Second World War.

176
00:20:31,585 --> 00:20:33,126
A real wreck!

177
00:20:33,376 --> 00:20:37,460
I feel better this way,
I don't have to fix it.

178
00:20:37,668 --> 00:20:39,210
Well, if you like to walk.

179
00:20:39,418 --> 00:20:41,251
No, but I'm more relaxed.

180
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:43,918
I don't want problems.

181
00:20:46,501 --> 00:20:49,960
They say that the latest
American cars are fabulous.

182
00:20:50,168 --> 00:20:53,251
I saw it in a magazine
Julio Gómez lent me.

183
00:20:53,501 --> 00:20:56,251
Sealed engine, two spark plugs,

184
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:58,210
a two-year guarantee.

185
00:20:58,418 --> 00:21:01,043
If it breaks,
they give you a new one.

186
00:21:01,251 --> 00:21:02,251
Can you believe it?

187
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:05,543
With the mechanics we have,
that would be the solution.

188
00:21:05,751 --> 00:21:07,751
People seem
more stupid every day.

189
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:10,293
Pablo was right: the French stink.

190
00:21:10,501 --> 00:21:12,543
They're filthy pigs, Laura.

191
00:21:13,751 --> 00:21:15,418
I don't care if they take it all.

192
00:21:15,626 --> 00:21:17,835
It won't last for long anyway.

193
00:21:18,293 --> 00:21:20,251
But now it will be different,
brother!

194
00:21:20,501 --> 00:21:25,335
I won't stay home twiddling my thumbs
as I did under Batista.

195
00:21:26,876 --> 00:21:29,835
I never thought these people
would overthrow him.

196
00:21:31,168 --> 00:21:33,626
But now I know
that if I don't do something,

197
00:21:33,876 --> 00:21:37,043
I won't be able to function
when this falls down.

198
00:21:38,376 --> 00:21:40,460
- That's what they say.
- Who?

199
00:21:40,668 --> 00:21:42,543
The Bay of Pigs prisoners.

200
00:21:43,001 --> 00:21:44,043
Listen.

201
00:21:45,168 --> 00:21:49,626
THE TRUTH OF THE GROUP
IS IN THE MURDERER

202
00:21:55,876 --> 00:21:56,751
We found that

203
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,543
the military organization
of the invaders

204
00:21:59,793 --> 00:22:03,460
has a hierarchy
of social functions that outlines

205
00:22:03,668 --> 00:22:07,126
the division of social and moral labor
of the bourgeoisie.

206
00:22:07,876 --> 00:22:09,043
A priest.

207
00:22:09,585 --> 00:22:11,251
A free trade businessman.

208
00:22:11,793 --> 00:22:13,918
An amateur official.

209
00:22:14,668 --> 00:22:16,043
A torturer.

210
00:22:17,501 --> 00:22:18,918
A philosopher.

211
00:22:20,168 --> 00:22:21,543
A politician.

212
00:22:23,085 --> 00:22:25,751
And many children
of well-to-do families.

213
00:22:28,501 --> 00:22:31,418
Each of them carried out
their specific actions,

214
00:22:31,626 --> 00:22:33,960
but it was all of them,
the group,

215
00:22:34,168 --> 00:22:37,543
that gave sense
to their individual actions.

216
00:22:38,501 --> 00:22:41,459
As an individual,
Calviño is a criminal for whom

217
00:22:41,668 --> 00:22:43,835
the bourgeoisie feel horror.

218
00:22:44,085 --> 00:22:45,627
The dress I wore...

219
00:22:45,876 --> 00:22:48,126
there's still blood on it.

220
00:22:48,793 --> 00:22:50,918
He kicked my abdomen

221
00:22:51,126 --> 00:22:52,210
and I bled.

222
00:22:52,418 --> 00:22:53,543
That's not all!

223
00:22:53,793 --> 00:22:57,751
I fought them

224
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:00,543
and they broke two
of my vertebrae. Remember?

225
00:23:01,168 --> 00:23:05,043
You hit him the first time
with a stick.

226
00:23:05,251 --> 00:23:06,335
He fell to his knees

227
00:23:06,585 --> 00:23:08,751
and you kicked him in the liver.

228
00:23:09,001 --> 00:23:10,335
Then he collapsed.

229
00:23:10,793 --> 00:23:11,960
Remember?

230
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:15,043
After murdering him,
you defiled him too.

231
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:18,626
You're a despicable murderer.

232
00:23:19,001 --> 00:23:20,918
- Right before you?
- Before me.

233
00:23:21,376 --> 00:23:25,460
You shot him to death
and laughed while he died.

234
00:23:25,876 --> 00:23:30,793
In Avellaneda No. 106
on October 6th, at 7 p.m.

235
00:23:31,001 --> 00:23:32,835
Say it's not true!

236
00:23:33,085 --> 00:23:34,543
Tell me it's not true.

237
00:23:34,751 --> 00:23:37,460
Tell me it's not true
that after you killed Morúa,

238
00:23:37,668 --> 00:23:40,126
during the nine days
I was kept prisoner,

239
00:23:40,376 --> 00:23:43,751
you came and told me
how you had done it.

240
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:46,252
- Tell me, Calviño...
- I cannot answer.

241
00:23:50,001 --> 00:23:53,834
In every capitalist society,
the bourgeoisie has men like this

242
00:23:54,085 --> 00:23:57,251
at its disposal. They are entrusted
with these unique tasks.

243
00:23:59,001 --> 00:24:00,918
But in the moral division of labor,

244
00:24:01,126 --> 00:24:03,543
recruited murderers allow for

245
00:24:03,751 --> 00:24:07,918
the existence of those who are
not in direct contact with death

246
00:24:08,126 --> 00:24:10,710
and who, as individuals,
can maintain

247
00:24:10,918 --> 00:24:12,710
a clean conscience.

248
00:24:17,168 --> 00:24:20,126
I speak for myself
and for those who share my ideas.

249
00:24:20,376 --> 00:24:21,751
We may be the minority.

250
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:24,626
I don't speak for Ventura,
or Ventura's drivers,

251
00:24:24,835 --> 00:24:27,835
or for a lot of vile people
you have named.

252
00:24:28,085 --> 00:24:31,335
I didn't know Calviño at the time.

253
00:24:31,585 --> 00:24:34,460
I was only interested
in leading my own life.

254
00:24:34,876 --> 00:24:37,751
They're like disjointed elements
of an overarching principle

255
00:24:38,001 --> 00:24:39,960
that nobody will acknowledge.

256
00:24:40,376 --> 00:24:43,460
Ultimately, I cannot
actually answer for the others,

257
00:24:43,668 --> 00:24:44,751
only they can.

258
00:24:45,001 --> 00:24:47,960
You seem to be trying
to incriminate me,

259
00:24:48,168 --> 00:24:52,418
as if I were to blame
for the invasion and all the rest.

260
00:24:52,793 --> 00:24:55,293
I insist

261
00:24:55,501 --> 00:24:58,543
that my mission is purely spiritual.

262
00:24:58,751 --> 00:25:00,710
I have not touched a weapon,

263
00:25:01,001 --> 00:25:02,043
before or after.

264
00:25:02,293 --> 00:25:06,043
Being involved in a plot
doesn't mean you're a plotter.

265
00:25:06,293 --> 00:25:08,626
At the beginning I said

266
00:25:08,876 --> 00:25:13,626
that I had been a totally
apolitical person all my life.

267
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:16,543
I never had anything to do
with a political party.

268
00:25:16,793 --> 00:25:19,626
Secondly, individual responsibility

269
00:25:19,835 --> 00:25:22,043
is saved through personal behavior.

270
00:25:22,251 --> 00:25:24,126
They retreat into themselves

271
00:25:24,335 --> 00:25:27,626
to escape the misery of others,
to avoid contamination,

272
00:25:27,876 --> 00:25:31,418
or tuck themselves away in the group
to hide their responsibility,

273
00:25:31,793 --> 00:25:33,960
hence contaminating the others.

274
00:25:34,168 --> 00:25:37,126
Well, now there is a group.
It's not just me.

275
00:25:37,501 --> 00:25:41,251
This responsibility,
rejected by the group as a whole,

276
00:25:41,501 --> 00:25:44,751
is brought up and claimed
by one of its members.

277
00:25:45,001 --> 00:25:48,960
You're speaking
of a charge that is not mine,

278
00:25:49,168 --> 00:25:51,126
it's the group's.

279
00:25:51,376 --> 00:25:55,251
The killer-torturer, an extreme case
in this labor division,

280
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:59,751
falls back on the group
to claim his moral guiltlessness.

281
00:26:00,001 --> 00:26:02,710
Listen, I personally
committed no crime.

282
00:26:02,918 --> 00:26:04,251
The meeting is over.

283
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:08,043
In no case was there
a declaration of responsibility

284
00:26:08,251 --> 00:26:11,626
of the actual individual-group
dialectic relationship.

285
00:26:11,876 --> 00:26:14,418
The others who partook
in Calviño's invasion

286
00:26:14,626 --> 00:26:18,251
don't identify with the system
that implicates them or with its acts.

287
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:23,043
In the accounts of Freyre,
the landowner,

288
00:26:23,251 --> 00:26:25,418
in the last rites by Lugo, the priest,

289
00:26:26,293 --> 00:26:29,335
in the refined rationale
of Andreu, the philosopher,

290
00:26:29,751 --> 00:26:32,335
in the layoffs and the book
by Rivero,

291
00:26:33,001 --> 00:26:35,210
in Varona's
"representative democracy",

292
00:26:36,001 --> 00:26:37,251
who could've foreseen

293
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:40,960
the death, that through them,
spread through Cuba?

294
00:26:41,168 --> 00:26:42,960
Death by hunger, disease,

295
00:26:43,168 --> 00:26:46,335
torture, frustration.

296
00:27:15,585 --> 00:27:18,626
She comes to clean
the apartment three times a week.

297
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:22,335
She's been coming for a year
and I'd never noticed her.

298
00:27:22,585 --> 00:27:25,293
If she did herself up,
she'd be very attractive.

299
00:27:25,501 --> 00:27:28,251
She's as slim as a Vogue model.

300
00:27:29,668 --> 00:27:30,835
I like her.

301
00:27:32,668 --> 00:27:34,835
She's from Matanzas
and is a Protestant.

302
00:27:35,085 --> 00:27:36,710
A Baptist, I think.

303
00:27:37,668 --> 00:27:39,835
Were you baptized in a river?

304
00:27:40,085 --> 00:27:41,335
Sure.

305
00:27:41,793 --> 00:27:43,126
How is that done?

306
00:27:45,585 --> 00:27:46,460
Well...

307
00:27:50,376 --> 00:27:51,918
You can't say?

308
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:56,251
Well... people gathered
on the river bank.

309
00:27:56,668 --> 00:27:59,043
The pastor and I entered the water.

310
00:27:59,668 --> 00:28:02,460
Then he explained to me
what a baptism was.

311
00:28:03,085 --> 00:28:07,418
For us, baptism
is the death of sin,

312
00:28:07,626 --> 00:28:09,543
the resurrection to a new life

313
00:28:09,751 --> 00:28:12,835
full of faith, hope, and dignity.

314
00:28:17,668 --> 00:28:20,418
He took me
to the deepest part of the river

315
00:28:20,626 --> 00:28:22,335
and put me in the water.

316
00:28:22,585 --> 00:28:24,335
I was so afraid!

317
00:28:27,085 --> 00:28:29,710
But everything happened
so quickly I hardly noticed.

318
00:28:30,168 --> 00:28:33,626
I was so nervous and got
so worked up, but it was nothing.

319
00:29:43,293 --> 00:29:45,835
Most people are exhibitionists.

320
00:29:47,085 --> 00:29:50,751
They look like
harmless animals, smooth-faced,

321
00:29:51,001 --> 00:29:54,043
precariously balanced on two legs.

322
00:29:55,293 --> 00:29:58,043
Some say that man's
intelligence and physical

323
00:29:58,251 --> 00:30:01,751
imperfection are due to his
being a premature monkey fetus.

324
00:30:22,085 --> 00:30:25,543
There is a delightful period,
between 30 and 35 years old,

325
00:30:25,793 --> 00:30:28,293
when Cuban women
suddenly go from maturity

326
00:30:28,501 --> 00:30:29,960
to rottenness.

327
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:34,335
They are fruit that rots
with an astonishing speed.

328
00:30:43,793 --> 00:30:48,293
<i>The revolution put an end
to Yankee domination,</i>

329
00:30:48,501 --> 00:30:51,460
<i>the U.S. uses
Guantanamo naval base</i>

330
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:54,960
<i>to spy on Cuba.</i>

331
00:30:55,293 --> 00:30:56,918
<i>ICAIC cameramen</i>

332
00:30:57,126 --> 00:31:00,126
<i>film some scenes
of provocations</i>

333
00:31:00,335 --> 00:31:02,126
<i>by the military troops</i>

334
00:31:02,335 --> 00:31:05,460
<i>and counter-revolutionaries
in the base.</i>

335
00:31:39,668 --> 00:31:41,543
You have beautiful knees!

336
00:32:22,085 --> 00:32:23,626
Want to eat with me?

337
00:32:23,876 --> 00:32:24,626
Are you crazy?

338
00:32:24,876 --> 00:32:27,126
No, I just don't like eating alone.

339
00:32:34,085 --> 00:32:35,460
What are you doing here?

340
00:32:36,168 --> 00:32:37,543
Waiting for someone?

341
00:32:39,876 --> 00:32:40,918
Your boyfriend?

342
00:32:41,293 --> 00:32:42,460
Are you crazy?

343
00:32:44,793 --> 00:32:47,710
At your age it is dangerous
to be alone here.

344
00:32:49,793 --> 00:32:51,126
You are crazy!

345
00:32:51,668 --> 00:32:53,626
No, really... it is...

346
00:32:59,793 --> 00:33:04,126
Come with me! I don't digest properly
when I eat alone.

347
00:33:04,376 --> 00:33:07,335
I'm waiting for a man
from ICAIC who offered me a job.

348
00:33:07,585 --> 00:33:08,543
ICAIC?

349
00:33:08,751 --> 00:33:10,751
A screen test for a movie.

350
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:14,543
I've got an important friend there,
he's a director.

351
00:33:14,751 --> 00:33:15,960
- From ICAIC?
- Yes.

352
00:33:16,293 --> 00:33:18,835
I'll introduce you tomorrow
if you want.

353
00:33:20,501 --> 00:33:23,126
- What time is it?
- About 6:30 p.m.

354
00:33:25,668 --> 00:33:27,835
It's late. He won't show up.

355
00:33:30,001 --> 00:33:30,960
Coming?

356
00:33:39,168 --> 00:33:39,835
So...

357
00:33:40,585 --> 00:33:42,710
First a dry Martini.

358
00:33:48,793 --> 00:33:50,335
Why not have a drink?

359
00:33:51,085 --> 00:33:52,126
I can't.

360
00:33:53,001 --> 00:33:55,751
I'm getting injections for my nerves.

361
00:33:57,585 --> 00:33:58,543
Look.

362
00:34:10,668 --> 00:34:12,251
Why an actress?

363
00:34:12,668 --> 00:34:15,043
I'm tired of always being myself.

364
00:34:16,585 --> 00:34:19,626
I can be other people
and not be considered crazy.

365
00:34:20,293 --> 00:34:23,126
Besides, I'm interested
in developing my personality.

366
00:34:24,085 --> 00:34:27,460
But characters in movies
are like broken records.

367
00:34:27,876 --> 00:34:32,626
All an actress does
is repeat a thousand times, by rote,

368
00:34:32,876 --> 00:34:35,126
the same gestures
and the same words...

369
00:36:08,168 --> 00:36:09,710
Where did they get all that from?

370
00:36:09,918 --> 00:36:13,335
They found those tins
with cuts by the commission.

371
00:36:13,585 --> 00:36:14,251
What commission?

372
00:36:14,501 --> 00:36:17,126
The one that checked the films
before the Revolution.

373
00:36:17,335 --> 00:36:20,043
Those were cuts made to films
that were to be shown.

374
00:36:20,293 --> 00:36:22,251
They were considered immoral.

375
00:36:22,501 --> 00:36:25,918
- Moral, proper behavior...
- Yes, I remember that.

376
00:36:26,126 --> 00:36:28,418
- I have a meeting.
- Bye. See you.

377
00:36:29,085 --> 00:36:32,751
It seems these guys
also had moral concerns.

378
00:36:33,293 --> 00:36:35,626
At least, they kept up appearances.

379
00:36:37,585 --> 00:36:41,043
- What will you do with that?
- I want it for a film.

380
00:36:41,251 --> 00:36:42,335
- For a film?
- Yes.

381
00:36:42,585 --> 00:36:45,960
A kind of collage,
a mix of everything.

382
00:36:46,168 --> 00:36:48,043
But it must have a meaning.

383
00:36:48,501 --> 00:36:50,335
It will, you'll see.

384
00:36:50,585 --> 00:36:51,960
Will they approve it?

385
00:36:52,168 --> 00:36:53,043
Yes.

386
00:36:54,001 --> 00:36:54,918
Come.

387
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:00,626
Any experience?

388
00:37:00,835 --> 00:37:03,626
Have you been in theatre, on TV?

389
00:37:03,876 --> 00:37:05,751
No, I haven't been lucky.

390
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:07,751
You haven't studied either?

391
00:37:08,001 --> 00:37:12,418
No, I was going to once,
but I never did go.

392
00:37:14,168 --> 00:37:16,043
Write that down on the form.

393
00:37:17,668 --> 00:37:20,043
Won't I have a screen test?

394
00:37:21,376 --> 00:37:22,960
I can sing, too.

395
00:37:41,293 --> 00:37:42,543
If you say so...

396
00:37:43,585 --> 00:37:44,626
You don't?

397
00:37:45,293 --> 00:37:47,335
- No.
- You sure?

398
00:37:49,168 --> 00:37:50,751
What a beautiful house.

399
00:37:51,668 --> 00:37:53,043
Don't you like it?

400
00:37:54,085 --> 00:37:55,335
I don't know.

401
00:38:02,751 --> 00:38:05,335
There won't be anything between us.

402
00:38:29,251 --> 00:38:32,126
Look, that's where I live.

403
00:38:35,001 --> 00:38:36,043
What's the matter?

404
00:38:36,376 --> 00:38:38,126
- I don't...
- Don't what?

405
00:38:39,293 --> 00:38:42,335
- What about your wife?
- I told you, I'm divorced, she left.

406
00:38:42,585 --> 00:38:43,960
- Well, anyhow...
- Anyhow what?

407
00:38:44,168 --> 00:38:46,918
- What about the neighbors?
- Oh... you don't trust me.

408
00:38:47,126 --> 00:38:48,126
It's not that.

409
00:38:48,335 --> 00:38:49,710
Then what?

410
00:38:53,001 --> 00:38:54,751
Go in first, then I'll come.

411
00:38:55,501 --> 00:38:57,960
It's on the upper floor.
Apartment K-L.

412
00:40:14,001 --> 00:40:15,418
Make yourself at home.

413
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:18,543
I'll make some coffee.

414
00:41:02,668 --> 00:41:04,043
My parents.

415
00:41:05,585 --> 00:41:06,835
And that's Laura.

416
00:41:07,793 --> 00:41:09,626
They left the same day.

417
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:13,960
What about you?

418
00:41:16,293 --> 00:41:17,335
Me what?

419
00:41:18,376 --> 00:41:19,626
Aren't you leaving?

420
00:41:20,168 --> 00:41:20,960
No.

421
00:41:21,668 --> 00:41:23,126
I'm fine here.

422
00:41:27,501 --> 00:41:29,251
Are you a revolutionary?

423
00:41:31,585 --> 00:41:32,751
What do you think?

424
00:41:35,376 --> 00:41:37,543
I think you're not
for or against the revolution.

425
00:41:37,793 --> 00:41:38,626
No?

426
00:41:39,085 --> 00:41:40,835
Well, what am I?

427
00:41:42,168 --> 00:41:44,335
Nothing. You're nothing.

428
00:41:56,876 --> 00:41:58,626
Will they send you things?

429
00:41:58,876 --> 00:41:59,960
No. What for?

430
00:42:02,668 --> 00:42:06,751
Nice shoes... anything.
Even a car if you wanted.

431
00:42:11,168 --> 00:42:13,543
Laura was more or less your same size.

432
00:42:16,501 --> 00:42:19,043
I can show you some of her dresses.

433
00:42:20,293 --> 00:42:23,251
You can have them if you want.

434
00:42:25,585 --> 00:42:26,751
But...

435
00:42:30,585 --> 00:42:32,251
Just check them out.

436
00:42:48,460 --> 00:42:49,126
Perfect!

437
00:42:50,251 --> 00:42:51,335
Take a look.

438
00:42:56,751 --> 00:42:58,251
Fasten this for me.

439
00:45:28,876 --> 00:45:30,626
Come on. Stop crying.

440
00:45:37,668 --> 00:45:39,626
You've ruined me.

441
00:45:39,835 --> 00:45:40,960
Me?

442
00:45:50,668 --> 00:45:53,418
We've done nothing bad.

443
00:45:53,751 --> 00:45:55,960
What will I tell my mother?

444
00:45:57,585 --> 00:45:59,835
Well... nothing.

445
00:46:41,668 --> 00:46:44,251
If you wait a bit,
I'll see you home.

446
00:46:46,168 --> 00:46:48,835
No thanks, I'd rather be alone.

447
00:46:59,668 --> 00:47:00,918
Call me.

448

you're disgusting. Let go of me!</i>

<i>You're going to break it!</i>

470
00:48:17,376 --> 00:48:18,835
Let go of it! Let go!

471
00:48:23,376 --> 00:48:27,751
This is over. I don't want
to see you again, ever!

472
00:48:32,585 --> 00:48:34,460
I'm leaving. I'm leaving alone.

473
00:48:35,001 --> 00:48:37,460
Don't come.
I can't stand this one more day.

474

Leaving me alone?

475
00:48:38,751 --> 00:48:42,418
I don't care! Find a woman
who'll put up with you.

476
00:48:42,626 --> 00:48:43,210
You said...

477
00:48:43,418 --> 00:48:45,543
I won't be a guinea pig

478
00:48:45,793 --> 00:48:48,460
for your whims and games!

479
00:48:48,668 --> 00:48:52,335
I'll lead my own life.
I'm growing old, you hear, old!

480
00:48:53,085 --> 00:48:56,960
I'm going by myself!
I don't want to be with you.

What a surprise!

482
00:49:36,001 --> 00:49:40,543
<i>Before your lips told me
you loved me</i>

483
00:49:40,793 --> 00:49:42,626
<i>I already knew it</i>

484
00:49:44,668 --> 00:49:45,460
You okay?

485
00:49:46,293 --> 00:49:48,960
- Who? Me?
- You were feeling badly.

486
00:49:49,168 --> 00:49:52,293
Before, not now.
I came to see how you were.

487
00:49:52,501 --> 00:49:55,460
Want me to tidy up
and make lunch?

488
00:49:58,876 --> 00:50:00,460
What's the matter?

489
00:50:00,668 --> 00:50:02,126
Nothing.

490
00:50:09,085 --> 00:50:10,335
Listen...

491
00:50:11,001 --> 00:50:14,418
<i>Come on, say we won't go on
That this is the end</i>

492
00:50:15,085 --> 00:50:16,335
<i>That it can be no more</i>

493
00:50:17,168 --> 00:50:18,835
<i>That you don't love me now</i>

494
00:50:25,251 --> 00:50:26,543
Like romance music?

495
00:50:26,793 --> 00:50:28,793
All that drama last night?

496
00:50:29,001 --> 00:50:31,460
- Don't laugh.
- I'm not, but...

497
00:50:31,668 --> 00:50:33,626
You are. And you've got no romance!

498
00:50:34,251 --> 00:50:37,626
<i>You can't criticize
how I live, all I have...</i>

499
00:50:42,376 --> 00:50:45,126
One thing that most shocks me
about people

500
00:50:45,376 --> 00:50:47,751
is their inability to keep up a feeling

501
00:50:48,001 --> 00:50:49,210
without straying.

502
00:50:50,293 --> 00:50:52,918
Elena proved to be
utterly inconsistent.

503
00:50:53,585 --> 00:50:56,251
"Mere alteration", as Ortega said.

504
00:50:56,751 --> 00:50:58,835
She doesn't establish links
between things,

505
00:50:59,376 --> 00:51:01,626
a sign of underdevelopment:

506
00:51:01,876 --> 00:51:04,251
an inability to establish links,

507
00:51:04,501 --> 00:51:07,126
to gather experience and grow.

508
00:51:09,293 --> 00:51:11,293
It is difficult to find a woman

509
00:51:11,501 --> 00:51:13,960
with feelings and culture.

510
00:51:14,168 --> 00:51:16,043
This place is too dull.

511
00:51:16,251 --> 00:51:19,710
Cubans spend all their talent
in adapting to the times.

512
00:51:19,918 --> 00:51:21,918
People are not consistent.

513
00:51:22,876 --> 00:51:25,960
And they always need
someone to think for them.

514
00:51:30,460 --> 00:51:34,335
- Hope to see you there, Sergio.
- Me? No.

515
00:51:35,376 --> 00:51:36,543
I don't think so.

516
00:51:36,751 --> 00:51:38,251
I already know the US.

517
00:51:38,460 --> 00:51:40,626
But what'll happen here
is a mystery to me.

518
00:51:40,876 --> 00:51:43,960
It's no mystery, Sergio.
We all know what will happen.

519
00:51:44,168 --> 00:51:46,710
Well, frankly I don't.

520
00:51:47,168 --> 00:51:50,335
Now it will not be like
the Bay of Pigs.

521
00:51:51,293 --> 00:51:54,710
Perhaps,
but it may be interesting.

522
00:51:54,918 --> 00:51:57,835
Perhaps,
but I'll be on the other side.

523
00:51:58,793 --> 00:52:00,543
It will be safer.

524
00:52:01,793 --> 00:52:04,210
You'll meet old friends over there.

525
00:52:04,418 --> 00:52:06,043
- I know you, Sergio.
- You do?

526
00:52:06,251 --> 00:52:10,043
Yes, but there were
very decent people among them.

527
00:52:10,376 --> 00:52:12,043
At least, that's what they said.

528
00:52:12,251 --> 00:52:16,460
I don't know what they said,
but I have a clean conscience.

529
00:52:18,001 --> 00:52:19,251
You do.

530
00:52:31,501 --> 00:52:33,460
Was I like him before?

531
00:52:35,001 --> 00:52:36,126
Perhaps.

532
00:52:37,793 --> 00:52:39,043
The Revolution may destroy me,

533
00:52:39,251 --> 00:52:42,043
but it's my revenge against
stupid Cuban bourgeoisie

534
00:52:42,293 --> 00:52:44,418
and assholes like Pablo.

535
00:52:49,876 --> 00:52:52,751
I can see Pablo is not Pablo,
but my own life.

536
00:52:53,251 --> 00:52:55,335
Everything I do not want to be.

537
00:52:56,793 --> 00:52:58,293
It's nice to see them leave,

538
00:52:58,501 --> 00:53:00,543
as if ridding myself of them.

539
00:53:02,168 --> 00:53:06,251
I still have my lucidity.
An unpleasant lucidity, a vacuum.

540
00:53:07,001 --> 00:53:10,043
I know what is the matter with me,
but I cannot avert it.

541
00:53:10,501 --> 00:53:12,460
Him, Laura, all of them...

542
00:53:32,793 --> 00:53:35,126
Francisco de la Cuesta
used to live here.

543
00:53:39,460 --> 00:53:42,126
We were 8 or 10 years old.

544
00:53:43,793 --> 00:53:45,835
I wonder where he is now.

545
00:53:50,376 --> 00:53:52,460
Will he remember our games?

546
00:53:55,460 --> 00:53:57,460
I try but cannot.

547
00:54:24,085 --> 00:54:27,210
When we were in school,
the priests were always right.

548
00:54:27,876 --> 00:54:29,543
They held power then.

549
00:54:30,668 --> 00:54:32,960
I got punished for no reason.

550
00:54:33,376 --> 00:54:35,626
Then I understood the link

551
00:54:35,876 --> 00:54:37,751
between Justice and Power.

552
00:54:40,501 --> 00:54:42,960
Armando's father was a freethinker.

553
00:54:43,585 --> 00:54:46,751
He gave him a peso every week
for the whore house.

554
00:54:47,001 --> 00:54:48,751
He took me there my first time.

555
00:54:52,001 --> 00:54:54,751
It was with a fat woman
who cost 50 cents.

556
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:57,210
He told her to be good to me.

557
00:55:40,668 --> 00:55:42,751
I couldn't do anything with her.

558
00:55:45,168 --> 00:55:46,960
I had to find another one.

559
00:55:53,293 --> 00:55:55,918
Then I started going there every week.

560
00:56:02,376 --> 00:56:07,043
Suddenly I discovered Elena
didn't share any of my ideas.

561
00:56:07,585 --> 00:56:09,335
I expected more from her.

562
00:56:09,751 --> 00:56:12,751
I thought she was
more complex and interesting.

563
00:56:13,585 --> 00:56:16,043
I try to live like a European.

564
00:56:16,293 --> 00:56:19,460
She makes me feel
underdevelopment with every step.

565
00:56:34,793 --> 00:56:36,960
I tried to change Elena,

566
00:56:37,251 --> 00:56:38,418
as well as Laura.

567
00:56:39,085 --> 00:56:40,835
But she doesn't understand.

568
00:56:41,751 --> 00:56:44,335
The world in her head
is very different from mine.

569
00:56:45,793 --> 00:56:47,126
She doesn't see me.

570
00:56:53,376 --> 00:56:56,126
ADVENTURE IN THE TROPICS

571
00:56:56,376 --> 00:57:01,126
This gazelle was killed by
Hemingway on his last trip to Africa.

572
00:57:02,793 --> 00:57:05,210
In 1953.

573
00:57:07,085 --> 00:57:10,710
He went with Mary, his fourth wife.

574
00:57:15,960 --> 00:57:20,126
Gazelles are considered
the fastest animals in Africa.

575
00:57:27,085 --> 00:57:30,751
Apart from its speed,
it constantly jumps.

576
00:57:31,876 --> 00:57:34,626
He killed so as not to kill himself.

577
00:57:35,960 --> 00:57:38,251
But he couldn't resist
the temptation in the end.

578
00:57:48,293 --> 00:57:52,126
Hemingway travelled
to Spain several times.

579
00:57:54,001 --> 00:57:56,460
As a war correspondent.

580
00:57:57,668 --> 00:58:01,251
Later he joined
the International Brigades.

581
00:58:12,251 --> 00:58:14,543
That "Mr. Way" lived here?

582
00:58:18,251 --> 00:58:20,210
There's not much:

583
00:58:20,418 --> 00:58:22,251
books and dead animals.

584
00:58:24,876 --> 00:58:28,126
Just like the houses
of Americans in Central Preston.

585
00:58:28,876 --> 00:58:30,126
The same furniture,

586
00:58:31,001 --> 00:58:32,460
the same American smell.

587
00:58:32,668 --> 00:58:34,460
What's the American smell?

588
00:58:34,668 --> 00:58:36,543
Dunno, but you can smell it.

589
00:58:36,751 --> 00:58:39,626
Which do you like best,
the Russian or American smell?

590
00:58:39,835 --> 00:58:41,043
Hey, back off.

591
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:44,960
I know nothing about politics.

592
00:58:48,085 --> 00:58:49,418
The tropics:

593
00:58:51,085 --> 00:58:53,335
that is what
backward countries are for.

594
00:58:53,585 --> 00:58:56,293
Kill wild animals, fish,

595
00:58:56,501 --> 00:58:57,543
get a tan.

596
00:58:58,501 --> 00:59:01,710
There she is:
the "Beautiful Cuban Señorita".

597
00:59:03,293 --> 00:59:05,335
"I'll never be afraid again",

598
00:59:05,585 --> 00:59:07,043
said Macomber to Wilson.

599
00:59:07,501 --> 00:59:10,918
"Something happened when
I saw the buffalo and ran after it.

600
00:59:11,126 --> 00:59:13,293
Like a dam overflowing.

601
00:59:13,501 --> 00:59:15,751
Pure, grandiose excitement."

602
00:59:16,793 --> 00:59:20,543
As if running after
a buffalo were enough for fear...

603
00:59:21,001 --> 00:59:23,543
Anyway, there are
no buffaloes in Cuba.

604
00:59:23,793 --> 00:59:24,960
I'm dumb.

605
00:59:25,168 --> 00:59:28,251
He overcame the fear of death,
but not the fear of life,

606
00:59:28,501 --> 00:59:32,543
of time, of a world that now
was too big for him.

607
00:59:33,960 --> 00:59:36,460
Are you here? Why did you go?

608
00:59:36,876 --> 00:59:38,251
You were quite amused.

609
00:59:38,460 --> 00:59:40,043
- Damned jealousy.
- Please...

610
00:59:40,293 --> 00:59:41,335
What's eating you?

611
00:59:41,585 --> 00:59:43,251
Nothing.

612
00:59:44,376 --> 00:59:46,043
- You don't care.
- About what?

613
00:59:46,293 --> 00:59:48,335
About me... you don't care.

614
00:59:48,585 --> 00:59:50,460
- It's you who doesn't care.
- About what?

615
00:59:50,668 --> 00:59:53,251
Nothing, you don't care about anything.

616
00:59:56,001 --> 00:59:58,251
This was Hemingway's room.

617
00:59:58,460 --> 01:00:01,835
He always worked here,
on this old typewriter,

618
01:00:02,085 --> 01:00:03,710
standing and barefoot.

619
01:00:03,918 --> 01:00:06,460
He never wrote
sitting or with his shoes on.

620
01:00:06,668 --> 01:00:08,835
He woke up early

621
01:00:09,085 --> 01:00:11,960
and worked until 11:00 or 11:30.

622
01:00:12,168 --> 01:00:15,043
Few people entered this room.

623
01:00:15,251 --> 01:00:20,043
I was one of the few.
I moved silently,

624
01:00:20,251 --> 01:00:21,918
from one place to another.

625
01:00:22,126 --> 01:00:24,960
During the rest of the day,
Hemingway used to...

626
01:00:25,168 --> 01:00:26,960
His name is Rene Villareal.

627
01:00:27,168 --> 01:00:28,543
Hemingway found him playing

628
01:00:28,793 --> 01:00:31,460
in the streets of
San Francisco de Paula.

629
01:00:31,793 --> 01:00:33,460
I read that somewhere.

630
01:00:33,876 --> 01:00:35,626
He adapted to his needs.

631
01:00:36,293 --> 01:00:39,043
The faithful servant.

632
01:00:39,376 --> 01:00:41,460
The colonizer and Gunga Din.

633
01:00:42,168 --> 01:00:44,626
Hemingway must have been intolerable.

634
01:00:48,501 --> 01:00:51,460
Here he had his refuge, his tower,

635
01:00:51,668 --> 01:00:53,335
his tropical island.

636
01:00:56,251 --> 01:00:59,543
Boots to hunt in Africa,
American furniture,

637
01:00:59,751 --> 01:01:02,751
Spanish pictures,
magazines and books in English,

638
01:01:03,001 --> 01:01:04,126
a bullfight poster.

639
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:07,210
He was never really
interested in Cuba.

640
01:01:07,668 --> 01:01:10,251
He took refuge here,
he entertained his friends,

641
01:01:10,460 --> 01:01:13,543
wrote in English
and fished in the Gulf Stream.

642
01:01:41,293 --> 01:01:45,543
Around 1947, journalists and people
wanting to interview him

643
01:01:45,751 --> 01:01:46,751
came here

644
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:49,126
and did not let him write in peace.

645
01:01:49,960 --> 01:01:53,460
Mary thought this office
would offer some privacy

646
01:01:53,668 --> 01:01:55,835
and tried to make it
as comfortable as possible.

647
01:01:56,085 --> 01:01:58,043
It had 10 double windows

648
01:01:58,251 --> 01:02:01,126
for fresh air and a nice view.

649
01:02:01,793 --> 01:02:03,710
Simple, comfortable furniture.

650
01:02:03,918 --> 01:02:05,251
Sergio!

651
01:02:17,376 --> 01:02:19,835
Did you see the gentleman
who came with me?

652
01:02:26,668 --> 01:02:27,751
Sergio!

653
01:02:35,751 --> 01:02:37,460
Wait a moment!

654
01:03:09,751 --> 01:03:11,960
ROUND TABLE:
LITERATURE AND UNDERDEVELOPMENT

655
01:03:12,168 --> 01:03:14,626
In an underdeveloped country,

656
01:03:14,876 --> 01:03:18,543
culture cannot be but the costly,

657
01:03:18,751 --> 01:03:22,835
at times painful operation
through which a people

658
01:03:23,085 --> 01:03:27,835
become aware of their capacity
to transform social life,

659
01:03:28,085 --> 01:03:30,043
to write their own history.

660
01:03:30,251 --> 01:03:32,251
They should harness
their best traditions

661
01:03:32,460 --> 01:03:34,918
making them fruitful and enriching them

662
01:03:35,126 --> 01:03:38,543
with the conditions
of the fight for national liberation.

663
01:03:39,085 --> 01:03:40,418
"We were outside,

664
01:03:40,626 --> 01:03:44,710
just steps above the black cooks
and servants in school.

665
01:03:44,918 --> 01:03:46,751
I found out I was a 'spick',

666
01:03:47,001 --> 01:03:50,543
a derogatory term
used for Latin Americans,

667
01:03:50,751 --> 01:03:54,043
the darkies of the continent,
the almost black.

668
01:03:54,376 --> 01:03:58,251
Although I may look like
a white Anglo-Saxon protestant,

669
01:03:58,501 --> 01:04:00,710
I'm actually a black Southerner.

670
01:04:00,918 --> 01:04:05,210
Latin Americans are all
discriminated against, oppressed,

671
01:04:05,418 --> 01:04:07,626
rejected, ignored,

672
01:04:07,835 --> 01:04:10,460
outsiders within that new scam

673
01:04:10,668 --> 01:04:12,418
pretending to be universal:

674
01:04:12,876 --> 01:04:17,460
the American way of life,
the big American white dream."

675
01:04:19,668 --> 01:04:22,335
And now for the devil's advocate,

676
01:04:23,501 --> 01:04:26,960
doubting about doubts,

677
01:04:27,960 --> 01:04:29,626
and asking:

678
01:04:30,251 --> 01:04:31,710
Gentlemen,

679
01:04:31,918 --> 01:04:34,460
can't you see that
the words you are using:

680
01:04:34,668 --> 01:04:37,543
"underdevelopment",
"underdevelopment"...

681
01:04:37,751 --> 01:04:39,251
are sick

682
01:04:39,585 --> 01:04:42,418
or at least sickly?

683
01:04:44,001 --> 01:04:45,710
Can't you see

684
01:04:45,918 --> 01:04:49,626
that perhaps these words are traps

685
01:04:49,876 --> 01:04:53,460
of language,
accomplices of a worn-out culture,

686
01:04:54,376 --> 01:04:57,960
a ruse, a linguistic alibi,

687
01:04:58,668 --> 01:05:01,126
a linguistic-ideological tangle,

688
01:05:01,335 --> 01:05:05,335
that may lead you
to the mental peace of formulae?

689
01:05:06,376 --> 01:05:07,918
Useless to flee

690
01:05:08,126 --> 01:05:11,335
from the linguistic continent
of underdevelopment

691
01:05:11,668 --> 01:05:15,251
while forgetting that
the main contradiction of our times

692
01:05:15,501 --> 01:05:18,335
is not that between U.S. imperialism

693
01:05:18,585 --> 01:05:21,210
and three underdeveloped continents,

694
01:05:21,418 --> 01:05:26,043
but between the forceful development

695
01:05:26,251 --> 01:05:29,126
of productive forces worldwide,

696
01:05:29,793 --> 01:05:34,251
and the forms and productive relations
of capitalism, that is,

697
01:05:34,460 --> 01:05:36,126
between a Socialist Revolution

698
01:05:36,335 --> 01:05:39,418
and the capitalist system
in its final imperialist stage.

699
01:05:40,501 --> 01:05:45,043
You're referring to
the central contradiction

700
01:05:45,251 --> 01:05:48,835
between the proletariat and capitalism.

701
01:05:49,251 --> 01:05:52,960
But I believe
this is thoroughly abstract.

702
01:05:53,168 --> 01:05:56,126
Central contradictions
are verified in real life.

703
01:05:56,335 --> 01:05:59,335
When a central contradiction
becomes embodied

704
01:06:01,293 --> 01:06:03,251
it turns into a war.

705
01:06:03,460 --> 01:06:06,918
For me, the central contradiction

706
01:06:07,126 --> 01:06:08,251
now, is not

707
01:06:08,460 --> 01:06:11,543
between European proletariat
and European capitalists,

708
01:06:11,793 --> 01:06:15,126
but rather it's to be found
in areas where war materializes,

709
01:06:15,585 --> 01:06:18,626
and proves it is
a central contradiction.

710
01:06:18,835 --> 01:06:20,126
Vietnam, for example.

711
01:06:20,876 --> 01:06:23,543
So the issue is a different one.

712
01:06:24,001 --> 01:06:25,543
We're talking...

713
01:06:26,085 --> 01:06:28,418
The discussion here is based

714
01:06:28,626 --> 01:06:31,960
on whether one or the other
is the central contradiction.

715
01:06:32,168 --> 01:06:33,751
- No, no...
- I mean...

716
01:06:34,001 --> 01:06:38,543
From the point of view
of Marxist scholars, I agree,

717
01:06:38,751 --> 01:06:41,460
but I see something different
in its specific embodiment.

718
01:06:41,751 --> 01:06:44,335
What are you doing up there
with that cigar?

719
01:06:44,876 --> 01:06:48,043
The lack of competition seems
to make you feel important.

720
01:06:49,168 --> 01:06:51,460
You would be nothing abroad.

721
01:06:51,668 --> 01:06:54,210
But here you have a place.

722
01:06:55,251 --> 01:06:58,835
You've really come up
in the world, Edmundo Desnoes!

723
01:06:59,793 --> 01:07:00,751
Let's see...

724
01:07:02,001 --> 01:07:03,043
Your name, please?

725
01:07:03,251 --> 01:07:06,335
Jack Gelber.

726
01:07:10,793 --> 01:07:11,918
Yes.

727
01:07:44,585 --> 01:07:48,293
Jack Gelber asked:
if the Cuban revolution

728
01:07:48,501 --> 01:07:50,126
is so original,

729
01:07:50,376 --> 01:07:53,918
why does it resort to conventional
methods like round tables

730
01:07:54,126 --> 01:07:56,626
instead of devising
dynamic ways of creating

731
01:07:56,876 --> 01:08:01,335
a relationship
between the panel and the audience?

732
01:08:05,668 --> 01:08:09,043
I don't get it.
The American was right.

733
01:08:09,793 --> 01:08:11,126
Words swallow words

734
01:08:11,376 --> 01:08:15,460
and leave you in the clouds,
a thousand miles away.

735
01:08:15,668 --> 01:08:17,918
How is underdevelopment
left behind?

736
01:08:18,126 --> 01:08:20,126
It is very difficult.

737
01:08:20,335 --> 01:08:22,460
It leaves its mark on everything.

738
01:08:24,001 --> 01:08:26,335
What are you doing here?

739
01:08:26,585 --> 01:08:28,460
What's the meaning of this?

740
01:08:29,085 --> 01:08:31,335
You have nothing to do
with these people.

741
01:08:31,960 --> 01:08:33,251
You're alone.

742
01:08:34,376 --> 01:08:36,251
There's no continuity
in underdevelopment.

743
01:08:36,501 --> 01:08:37,543
Everything is forgotten.

744
01:08:37,751 --> 01:08:39,710
People are not consistent.

745
01:08:40,501 --> 01:08:44,710
You remember many things.
You remember too much.

746
01:08:46,168 --> 01:08:49,543
Where are your people,
your job, your wife?

747
01:08:50,293 --> 01:08:51,460
You're nothing.

748
01:08:51,668 --> 01:08:53,251
You're dead.

749
01:08:54,168 --> 01:08:57,751
Your final destruction
starts now, Sergio.

750
01:09:21,168 --> 01:09:23,710
It's the same thing
every time mother writes.

751
01:09:24,001 --> 01:09:27,543
She knows I don't chew gum
and I have an electric razor.

752
01:09:28,085 --> 01:09:32,126
I've only asked for books
and magazines, but no.

753
01:09:39,001 --> 01:09:40,960
I can't read her handwriting.

754
01:09:41,876 --> 01:09:42,960
They're crazy.

755
01:09:43,460 --> 01:09:45,126
We don't understand each other.

756
01:10:17,501 --> 01:10:21,126
Hanna is the best thing
that has ever happened to me.

757
01:10:22,876 --> 01:10:25,335
They fled from Hitler
and ended up in Cuba.

758
01:10:26,085 --> 01:10:27,543
She was more mature

759
01:10:27,751 --> 01:10:30,751
than the underdeveloped girls
over here.

760
01:10:32,376 --> 01:10:34,751
How long we were together?

761
01:10:35,460 --> 01:10:37,126
I can't remember.

762
01:10:37,376 --> 01:10:39,751
But it was the best thing
that ever happened to me.

763
01:10:40,501 --> 01:10:44,335
How did I let her go?
Why didn't I run after her?

764
01:11:53,793 --> 01:11:56,543
We were going to marry
when her parents took her abroad.

765
01:11:57,668 --> 01:12:00,960
We did not believe in papers,
but it would've been easier.

766
01:12:01,668 --> 01:12:02,626
We had plans.

767
01:12:02,835 --> 01:12:05,918
I was to go to New York
with her and work.

768
01:12:06,168 --> 01:12:09,335
I still wanted to be a writer
and she believed in me.

769
01:12:09,668 --> 01:12:11,418
She's the only one who ever did.

770
01:12:12,251 --> 01:12:13,418
She'd help.

771
01:12:15,168 --> 01:12:18,043
Then my father gave me
the furniture store.

772
01:12:43,501 --> 01:12:45,751
I buried myself there.

773
01:12:46,293 --> 01:12:48,918
I worked like mad for two years.

774
01:12:51,001 --> 01:12:52,543
"Hanna, my love,

775
01:12:52,793 --> 01:12:55,335
I can't leave this right now.
Please understand.

776
01:12:55,751 --> 01:12:58,626
I don't want to arrive empty handed."

777
01:12:59,460 --> 01:13:00,751
Hanna, darling...

778
01:13:01,793 --> 01:13:03,460
One day it was too late.

779
01:13:04,793 --> 01:13:05,835
I looked for you.

780
01:13:06,085 --> 01:13:07,751
I'll always look for you.

781
01:13:09,460 --> 01:13:11,043
Where are you now?

782
01:13:12,001 --> 01:13:13,710
What do you think about me?

783
01:13:50,376 --> 01:13:52,418
Wait! Stop right here.

784
01:13:58,793 --> 01:14:00,043
Sergio!

785
01:15:12,960 --> 01:15:14,960
Main occupant: first surname.

786
01:15:15,168 --> 01:15:16,251
Carmona.

787
01:15:16,876 --> 01:15:19,043
- Second surname?
- Bendoiro.

788
01:15:19,751 --> 01:15:21,543
- Name?
- Sergio.

789
01:15:23,168 --> 01:15:24,626
- Occupation?
- None.

790
01:15:24,876 --> 01:15:26,251
- Don't you work?
- No.

791
01:15:26,501 --> 01:15:27,626
What do you live on?

792
01:15:27,876 --> 01:15:30,251
My rent.

793
01:15:30,460 --> 01:15:32,335
- Former owner?
- Yes.

794
01:15:33,001 --> 01:15:35,210
- Age.
- 38.

795
01:15:36,168 --> 01:15:37,543
Net income?

796
01:15:38,085 --> 01:15:39,460
600 pesos.

797
01:15:39,793 --> 01:15:41,626
Other family income?

798
01:15:41,876 --> 01:15:43,251
No, I live by myself.

799
01:15:43,585 --> 01:15:45,835
- Did you pay the Reforma Urbana?
- No.

800
01:15:46,585 --> 01:15:49,751
- The last month you paid?
- I've never paid anything.

801
01:15:50,168 --> 01:15:51,293
Are you:

802
01:15:51,501 --> 01:15:54,126
Owner, buyer,
illegal beneficial owner?

803
01:15:54,376 --> 01:15:56,126
No. Owner.

804
01:15:56,585 --> 01:15:59,043
- Any distraints?
- No.

805
01:16:01,501 --> 01:16:04,251
How many square meters
is this place?

806
01:16:04,460 --> 01:16:06,751
- Who knows.
- More or less.

807
01:16:06,960 --> 01:16:07,751
Well...

808
01:16:07,960 --> 01:16:10,043
- It's rather large.
- Yes.

809
01:16:10,376 --> 01:16:13,418
Let's say 100 - 200 square meters?

810
01:16:13,626 --> 01:16:15,793
Maybe more. Want to measure it?

811
01:16:16,001 --> 01:16:17,918
No, we'll take your word for it.

812
01:16:18,126 --> 01:16:19,751
Let's say 300.

813
01:16:20,001 --> 01:16:22,626
If it's not, we'll change it later.

814
01:16:24,085 --> 01:16:25,960
Building materials: bricks.

815
01:16:26,168 --> 01:16:27,418
I think so.

816
01:16:27,793 --> 01:16:31,335
The property is an apartment.

817
01:16:32,876 --> 01:16:33,835
How many bedrooms?

818
01:16:34,085 --> 01:16:36,210
A bedroom and a studio.

819
01:16:36,418 --> 01:16:39,126
- And maid's rooms?
- Oh, yes. Two.

820
01:16:39,335 --> 01:16:41,043
How many sanitary fixtures?

821
01:16:44,376 --> 01:16:45,251
Five.

822
01:16:46,876 --> 01:16:48,751
- How many bathrooms?
- Three.

823
01:16:49,293 --> 01:16:51,126
There are two lifts.

824
01:16:51,751 --> 01:16:53,460
Condition:

825
01:16:54,001 --> 01:16:54,835
good.

826
01:16:55,668 --> 01:16:56,751
Sign here.

827
01:17:01,501 --> 01:17:03,126
What's all this for?

828
01:17:03,376 --> 01:17:05,835
Just a sort of check.

829
01:17:07,168 --> 01:17:09,043
- But this...
- Don't you worry.

830
01:17:09,501 --> 01:17:12,710
If there is any problem,
we'll tell you.

831
01:17:14,876 --> 01:17:16,293
Hey, wait a moment!

832
01:17:16,501 --> 01:17:18,793
- You can't take that turn!
- I'm going there.

833
01:17:19,001 --> 01:17:23,126
- No, you can't turn.
- Don't worry. I'll get out here.

834
01:17:33,168 --> 01:17:36,626
And in the midst of all this,
I still live off my rent.

835
01:17:38,376 --> 01:17:40,626
I'll still have it for 13 years.

836
01:17:40,835 --> 01:17:42,710
No, 12... 11.

837
01:17:43,168 --> 01:17:46,543
It's been two years since
they took my apartment building.

838
01:18:05,960 --> 01:18:08,626
Everything comes
too early or too late for me.

839
01:18:10,168 --> 01:18:14,418
Perhaps there was a time
when I could've understood all this.

840
01:18:15,001 --> 01:18:16,710
Now I can't.

841
01:18:58,876 --> 01:19:01,460
I'm 38 and already old.

842
01:19:02,876 --> 01:19:05,460
I don't feel wiser or more mature.

843
01:19:05,793 --> 01:19:08,543
More stupid. More rotten than mature.

844
01:19:10,001 --> 01:19:13,210
Like a rotten mamey.
Like bagasse.

845
01:19:15,168 --> 01:19:17,710
Perhaps it's because
this is the Tropics.

846
01:19:18,460 --> 01:19:21,543
Everything ripens
and rots very quickly here.

847
01:19:22,085 --> 01:19:23,626
Nothing lasts.

848
01:19:43,668 --> 01:19:45,251
I'm already an old man.

849
01:19:46,876 --> 01:19:49,751
In whore houses since I was 13.

850
01:19:50,001 --> 01:19:52,126
At 15, I thought myself a genius.

851
01:19:52,376 --> 01:19:55,335
At 25, the owner
of a posh furniture store.

852
01:19:56,460 --> 01:19:58,043
Then Laura...

853
01:20:00,251 --> 01:20:02,960
My life is like a monstrous
and flabby plant

854
01:20:03,168 --> 01:20:05,543
with huge leaves and no fruit.

855
01:20:14,085 --> 01:20:15,626
I seem kind of dignified.

856
01:20:21,501 --> 01:20:22,460
Are you Sergio?

857
01:20:23,585 --> 01:20:25,751
- Yes.
- I'm Elena's brother.

858
01:20:30,460 --> 01:20:32,418
Is something wrong, is she sick?

859
01:20:32,626 --> 01:20:35,835
No, she's a very healthy girl,
she's never sick.

860
01:20:36,085 --> 01:20:39,251
It's something else.
She says you took advantage of her.

861
01:20:39,460 --> 01:20:40,210
What?

862
01:20:40,585 --> 01:20:41,543
No, look...

863
01:20:41,751 --> 01:20:43,751
You ruined her,

864
01:20:43,960 --> 01:20:44,835
now fix it.

865
01:20:45,085 --> 01:20:47,960
- I wonder what story...
- It's no story...

866
01:20:48,585 --> 01:20:50,335
Paying her off with a few dresses!

867
01:20:50,585 --> 01:20:52,710
- Sir, please...
- You promised to marry her.

868
01:20:52,918 --> 01:20:54,293
- No way!
- You used her.

869
01:20:54,501 --> 01:20:56,918
- This isn't true.
- I don't know how it was.

870
01:20:57,126 --> 01:21:00,960
I should've known
that she wouldn't stop at anything.

871
01:21:01,251 --> 01:21:03,543
I didn't want
the police to be involved.

872
01:21:03,793 --> 01:21:06,835
I was ready to marry her
if she asked me.

873
01:21:07,085 --> 01:21:08,043
I was afraid.

874
01:21:08,668 --> 01:21:11,460
Say what you said to mother.
Come on, say it.

875
01:21:21,085 --> 01:21:23,251
- You deceived me, sir.
- Sir?

876
01:21:24,001 --> 01:21:25,293
Well, you did.

877
01:21:25,501 --> 01:21:26,543
Why?

878
01:21:28,751 --> 01:21:32,126
You said you'd give me
some of your wife's dresses...

879
01:21:37,501 --> 01:21:38,918
...and then ruined me.

880
01:21:39,126 --> 01:21:40,043
All right.

881
01:21:40,585 --> 01:21:42,043
If that's your story...

882
01:21:45,085 --> 01:21:46,460
But you know it's not true.

883
01:21:47,001 --> 01:21:48,126
And you were not a virgin.

884
01:21:48,376 --> 01:21:50,251
- Show some respect!
- Hey, listen...

885
01:21:50,585 --> 01:21:52,251
My sister is no whore!

886
01:21:55,085 --> 01:21:57,251
How could I get mixed up in this?

887
01:21:58,293 --> 01:21:59,751
I gave up.

888
01:22:00,168 --> 01:22:02,960
I was going to be dragged along
till the end.

889
01:22:03,460 --> 01:22:04,626
I was afraid.

890
01:22:05,001 --> 01:22:06,751
Girls should marry as virgins.

891
01:22:06,960 --> 01:22:09,210
That's their greatest treasure!

892
01:22:09,418 --> 01:22:11,251
Women are liberated now.

893
01:22:11,460 --> 01:22:14,043
Don't speak
as if you were revolutionary!

894
01:22:14,293 --> 01:22:17,460
- If you don't marry, I kill you!
- Shit! Stop it, man!

895
01:22:17,668 --> 01:22:18,960
What's all this?

896
01:22:19,168 --> 01:22:22,751
If I marry her, it'll be because
I want to, not because I'm forced to.

897
01:22:23,001 --> 01:22:24,835
- Nobody messes with her!
- Stop it!

898
01:22:25,376 --> 01:22:28,335
You didn't want to see me.
You wanted to get rid of me?

899
01:22:28,585 --> 01:22:30,960
No, Elena. I'm going
to marry you, am I not?

900
01:22:31,168 --> 01:22:33,335
But first we have to think things over.

901
01:22:33,585 --> 01:22:34,835
What things?

902
01:22:35,460 --> 01:22:37,251
We need the papers, don't we?

903
01:22:37,460 --> 01:22:40,460
The divorce papers...

904
01:22:40,668 --> 01:22:43,543
- You are divorced?
- Yes, madam.

905
01:22:43,751 --> 01:22:46,251
- Then marry at once!
- Stop it!

906
01:22:46,501 --> 01:22:48,710
We'll handle the papers.
Why'd you bring him?

907
01:22:48,918 --> 01:22:50,335
When she came home...

908
01:22:50,585 --> 01:22:52,251
- You shouldn't have.
- She told me.

909
01:22:52,460 --> 01:22:54,251
Her panties were stained with blood!

910
01:22:54,501 --> 01:22:56,043
That's not true!

911
01:22:56,293 --> 01:23:00,751
Stop it, man!
Why the hell did you come here?

912
01:23:01,085 --> 01:23:02,460
Shut up!

913
01:23:02,668 --> 01:23:04,751
Mum, shut up!

914
01:23:04,960 --> 01:23:06,835
Calm down, my dear.

915
01:23:07,376 --> 01:23:09,751
I was sure she was not a virgin.

916
01:23:10,293 --> 01:23:11,835
They're a sorry lot.

917
01:23:12,293 --> 01:23:13,918
What were they after?

918
01:23:17,668 --> 01:23:18,626
Any statement?

919
01:23:19,168 --> 01:23:22,043
All this is false.
I have had intercourse with her,

920
01:23:22,293 --> 01:23:24,043
but she agreed to it.

921
01:23:24,293 --> 01:23:28,543
There was no deceit,
much less rape. It's a lie.

922
01:23:33,085 --> 01:23:34,960
Sergio, sign here.

923
01:24:23,793 --> 01:24:27,126
The defendant, Sergio Carmona,
with the intent of having

924
01:24:27,376 --> 01:24:30,918
sexual intercourse with Elena Dorado,
a 16-year-old minor,

925
01:24:31,126 --> 01:24:34,460
deceived her into going
to his apartment,

926
01:24:34,876 --> 01:24:36,543
in Linea and Paseo,

927
01:24:36,751 --> 01:24:39,251
where he deprived her of her virginity,

928
01:24:39,501 --> 01:24:43,126
although he knew that
she was mentally disturbed,

929
01:24:43,501 --> 01:24:46,335
and thus unable
to oppose resistance.

930
01:24:46,960 --> 01:24:48,418
- Do you want to testify?
- Yes.

931
01:24:48,626 --> 01:24:51,418
Answer the attorney's questions.

932
01:24:53,501 --> 01:24:56,418
- Do you know Elena Josefa Dorado?
- Yes.

933
01:24:56,626 --> 01:24:58,835
Look at the court.

934
01:24:59,085 --> 01:25:00,418
- Yes.
- "Yes, sir".

935
01:25:00,626 --> 01:25:02,251
Sorry. Yes, sir.

936
01:25:02,668 --> 01:25:04,126
Where did you meet her?

937
01:25:04,376 --> 01:25:06,335
On 23rd Street, in Vedado.

938
01:25:06,668 --> 01:25:11,751
Did you take her to your apartment
and have sexual intercourse with her?

939
01:25:12,293 --> 01:25:13,210
Yes.

940
01:25:13,418 --> 01:25:14,960
Tell me,

941
01:25:15,168 --> 01:25:18,335
before the night of the incident,

942
01:25:19,376 --> 01:25:22,960
did the alleged victim
tell you she had engaged in

943
01:25:23,501 --> 01:25:26,460
sexual intercourse with another man?

944
01:25:26,668 --> 01:25:27,543
No.

945
01:25:29,293 --> 01:25:31,626
I was the only consistent one.

946
01:25:31,876 --> 01:25:33,751
And that was the final blow.

947
01:25:34,876 --> 01:25:38,543
They treated me as if I had tricked
a member of "the people".

948
01:25:39,001 --> 01:25:44,418
He gave me some dresses
of his wife who went up North.

949
01:25:44,626 --> 01:25:46,710
Now everything is "the people".

950
01:25:47,876 --> 01:25:52,126
Once I would've been the respectable
person and they the offenders.

951
01:25:52,876 --> 01:25:54,251
I was lost.

952
01:25:55,085 --> 01:25:59,626
Swine, bastard, you took
advantage of my daughter!

953
01:26:03,585 --> 01:26:04,960
Pervert!

954
01:26:11,168 --> 01:26:13,460
Did you threaten to kill Sergio?

955
01:26:13,751 --> 01:26:15,418
If he didn't marry her, yes.

956
01:26:15,626 --> 01:26:16,918
- You threatened him?
- Yes.

957
01:26:17,126 --> 01:26:18,251
What did he say?

958
01:26:18,501 --> 01:26:22,710
That he would take care
of the papers, but he didn't.

959
01:26:22,918 --> 01:26:25,543
When did the doctor see Elena?

960
01:26:25,751 --> 01:26:28,793
Well, mother says...
I don't really know...

961
01:26:29,001 --> 01:26:32,751
Mother says
she took her shortly before...

962
01:26:33,001 --> 01:26:34,793
this problem.

963
01:26:35,001 --> 01:26:37,460
- What did the doctor say?
- I don't know.

964
01:26:38,251 --> 01:26:40,251
And the tests?

965
01:26:40,876 --> 01:26:42,543
Then the sentence came.

966
01:26:43,085 --> 01:26:47,210
First statement of facts:
Defendant, Sergio Carmona Bendoiro,

967
01:26:47,418 --> 01:26:49,418
whose identity has been verified,

968
01:26:49,626 --> 01:26:53,418
invited Elena Dorado, 17 years old,

969
01:26:53,626 --> 01:26:58,210
to take a walk on the night
of January 25, 1962.

970
01:26:58,418 --> 01:27:02,210
They went to the house
of the defendant,

971
01:27:02,418 --> 01:27:06,043
located on Linea and Paseo, where
they engaged in sexual intercourse.

972
01:27:06,293 --> 01:27:07,251
There's no proof

973
01:27:07,460 --> 01:27:11,751
that Elena Dorado shows symptoms
of mental disturbance,

974
01:27:11,960 --> 01:27:14,126
or was deprived
of her mental faculties

975
01:27:14,335 --> 01:27:16,460
when the aforementioned acts
took place.

976
01:27:16,668 --> 01:27:20,918
Second statement of facts:
the Prosecutor maintained

977
01:27:21,126 --> 01:27:25,126
his provisional conclusions
of pages 6 and 7 of the records.

978
01:27:25,668 --> 01:27:29,251
Third statement of facts:
the defendant's attorney

979
01:27:29,460 --> 01:27:31,626
maintained his provisional conclusions

980
01:27:31,876 --> 01:27:36,543
denying each and every conclusion
by the Public Prosecutor,

981
01:27:36,793 --> 01:27:39,835
and demanded the acquittal
of the defendant.

982
01:27:40,085 --> 01:27:41,626
Conclusion:

983
01:27:41,876 --> 01:27:46,418
there is no evidence
as to the crime of rape

984
01:27:46,626 --> 01:27:48,751
the Public Prosecutor
attributes to the defendant.

985
01:27:49,460 --> 01:27:50,751
According to the laws

986
01:27:51,001 --> 01:27:53,418
and the Social Defense Code,

987
01:27:53,626 --> 01:27:59,751
articles 142, 240, 741, and 742
of the Criminal Procedure Code,

988
01:28:00,501 --> 01:28:01,460
we conclude that

989
01:28:01,668 --> 01:28:04,751
we must acquit and we acquit
defendant Sergio Carmona

990
01:28:05,001 --> 01:28:08,751
of the crime of rape the Public
Prosecutor attributes to him.

991
01:28:09,001 --> 01:28:11,126
It was a happy ending.

992
01:28:11,585 --> 01:28:13,710
For once justice was served.

993
01:28:15,001 --> 01:28:16,751
But was it?

994
01:28:17,585 --> 01:28:19,543
I'm not all that good.

995
01:28:19,793 --> 01:28:22,126
I've seen too much to be innocent.

996
01:28:22,376 --> 01:28:25,960
Their mind is too tangled
to make them guilty.

997
01:28:26,251 --> 01:28:29,626
I never saw them again.
Hope she's not institutionalized.

WHEN A WOUND IS INFECTED
WITH THE TETANUS BACILLUS.

1009
01:29:13,793 --> 01:29:15,751
MOST CASES ARE LETHAL.

1010
01:29:16,001 --> 01:29:18,710
VACCINES ARE THE ONLY
FORM OF PROTECTION.

1011

MAO ZEDONG'S WORDS:

1012
01:29:20,376 --> 01:29:23,460
"THE ATTEMPT AT SOLVING
IDEOLOGICAL PROBLEMS

1013
01:29:23,668 --> 01:29:25,251
THROUGH ADMINISTRATIVE ORDERS

AND WITH COERCIVE METHODS

01:29:28,626 --> 01:29:30,793
"WHY DON'T THEY FIX
MY BUILDING'S BALCONY?

I'VE TOLD THE URBAN REFORM
OFFICE SEVEN TIMES

1017
01:29:34,960 --> 01:29:37,126
THAT A PIECE FELL AND IT'S CRUMBLING.

1018
01:29:37,376 --> 01:29:40,210
I DON'T HAVE THE MEANS
OR TOOLS TO FIX THIS,

1019
01:29:40,418 --> 01:29:43,043
SO I'D LIKE TO KNOW WHAT I CAN DO."

1020
01:29:43,293 --> 01:29:44,626
TO WORK WITH JOY AND...

1021
01:30:02,168 --> 01:30:04,335
She brought me
a stack of photographs

1022
01:30:04,876 --> 01:30:07,126
from when she was baptized.

1023
01:30:13,251 --> 01:30:16,460
It wasn't like I thought it would be.
It's nothing.

1024
01:30:16,960 --> 01:30:20,710
The clothes didn't cling to her body.
There were lots of people.

1025
01:30:22,668 --> 01:30:24,751
I hadn't thought about them.

1026
01:30:25,501 --> 01:30:28,126
There are witnesses everywhere.

OCTOBER 22, 1962

1028
01:30:48,876 --> 01:30:49,960
KENNEDY SPEAKS

1029
01:30:50,168 --> 01:30:52,751
<i>Additional sites, not yet completed,</i>

1030
01:30:53,001 --> 01:30:53,960
<i>appear to be designed</i>

1031
01:30:54,168 --> 01:30:56,793
<i>for intermediate range
ballistic missiles,</i>

1032
01:30:57,001 --> 01:31:01,543
<i>capable of striking most of the major
cities in the Western Hemisphere,</i>

1033
01:31:01,793 --> 01:31:04,835
<i>ranging as far north
as Hudson Bay, Canada,</i>

1034
01:31:05,585 --> 01:31:07,543
<i>and as far south as Lima, Peru.</i>

1035
01:31:07,960 --> 01:31:09,835
<i>In addition, jet bombers</i>

1036
01:31:10,085 --> 01:31:12,835
<i>capable of carrying nuclear weapons</i>

1037
01:31:13,085 --> 01:31:15,543
<i>are now being uncrated
and assembled in Cuba</i>

1038
01:31:16,585 --> 01:31:19,835
<i>while the necessary air bases
are being prepared.</i>

1039
01:31:20,085 --> 01:31:23,210
<i>To halt this offensive buildup,
a strict quarantine</i>

1040
01:31:23,418 --> 01:31:28,251
<i>on all military equipment under
shipment to Cuba is being initiated.</i>

1041
01:31:28,501 --> 01:31:31,960
<i>Should these offensive
military preparations continue,</i>

1042
01:31:32,293 --> 01:31:34,751
<i>thus increasing
the threat to the Hemisphere,</i>

1043
01:31:34,960 --> 01:31:37,460
<i>further action will be justified.</i>

1044
01:31:37,668 --> 01:31:41,460
<i>I have directed the Armed Forces
to prepare for any eventualities.</i>

1045
01:31:47,876 --> 01:31:49,043
Nothing makes sense.

1046
01:31:50,168 --> 01:31:52,751
People move and talk
as if war were a game.

1047
01:32:10,585 --> 01:32:12,126
What if it began right now?

1048
01:32:16,001 --> 01:32:17,751
Protesting is useless.

1049
01:32:18,001 --> 01:32:19,751
I'll die just like the others.

1050
01:32:21,085 --> 01:32:22,751
This island is a trap.

1051
01:32:24,293 --> 01:32:26,751
We're too small, too poor.

1052
01:32:27,585 --> 01:32:29,251
It's a very expensive dignity.

1053
01:32:29,501 --> 01:32:36,126
We decidedly reject
any attempt at supervision,

1054
01:32:37,001 --> 01:32:39,751
any attempt at inspection
of our country.

1055
01:32:39,960 --> 01:32:41,918
Our country will not be subjected
to inspection.

1056
01:32:43,001 --> 01:32:44,960
We are the ones who run this country,

1057
01:32:45,168 --> 01:32:49,960
and we know how we can defend
our integrity, our sovereignty.

1058
01:32:50,585 --> 01:32:55,960
They threaten us with being
the target of nuclear attacks.

1059
01:32:56,793 --> 01:32:58,460
They don't frighten us.

1060
01:32:59,251 --> 01:33:02,460
We must know how to live
in the era we find ourselves in

1061
01:33:02,668 --> 01:33:05,251
with the dignity
with which we should live.

1062
01:33:05,793 --> 01:33:08,335
All of us, men, women,

1063
01:33:09,376 --> 01:33:10,751
young and old,

1064
01:33:11,376 --> 01:33:15,043
we are all united
in this time of danger,

1065
01:33:16,001 --> 01:33:20,543
and ours, the fate of all
the revolutionaries and the patriots,

1066
01:33:21,376 --> 01:33:23,960
will be the same fate,

1067
01:33:24,585 --> 01:33:27,751
and the victory will belong to us all.

1068
01:33:28,001 --> 01:33:30,043
Homeland or death,
we shall overcome!

1069
