This movie entitled "The Kumamoto
Stories" contains the trilogy...

2
00:00:16,917 --> 00:00:18,612
...directed by Takashi iike,

4
00:00:24,625 --> 00:00:28,584
KUMAMOTO MONOGATARI

5
00:00:28,662 --> 00:00:33,623
The Dream Legend of Tonkararin The Defenders'
Song A Woman in the Revolt of the Clans

6
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:46,640
THE TSUIKETSU FANTASY:
DREAM LEGEND OF TONKARARIN

7
00:00:55,622 --> 00:01:01,584
A region along the Kikuchi
River, about1500 years ago.

8
00:03:19,466 --> 00:03:21,025
Mother...

9
00:03:22,135 --> 00:03:23,296
Father...

10
00:03:24,438 --> 00:03:28,500
Now, escape to the other side of this cave.

11
00:03:28,809 --> 00:03:30,004
There's nothing to be afraid of.

12
00:03:30,377 --> 00:03:33,156
God will protect you.

13
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:37,378
No, I don't wanna! I don't wanna leave mother!

14
00:03:38,285 --> 00:03:41,585
Listen, my beloved daughter.

15
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:44,585
You cannot look back now.

16
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:53,163
We cannot let the hope of our
country die right here with us.

17
00:03:55,535 --> 00:03:56,798
Other...

18
00:04:04,945 --> 00:04:05,707
Go now!

19
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:22,179
Come over here.

20
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:26,555
You are our offering to ikado.

21
00:05:27,627 --> 00:05:29,527
I will not let you go.

22
00:05:40,073 --> 00:05:40,733
Come.

23
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:17,040
Who is it? Is there anybody there?

24
00:06:52,913 --> 00:06:53,675
Who is it?

25
00:06:54,614 --> 00:06:56,082
Who are you?

26
00:06:57,484 --> 00:06:59,111
Are you god?

27
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:13,864
20 years later

28
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:29,025
"There is a large cave in the east
of the country, called Tsuiketsu.

29
00:07:29,049 --> 00:07:31,327
""In the tenth month, the entire country
gathers to receive the god,Tsui...

30
00:07:31,351 --> 00:07:33,629
"They move it up the east of the
county, and greatly worships it.""

31
00:07:33,653 --> 00:07:34,950
-- Chapter of Kokuri, Gishi Toi Den

32
00:07:35,055 --> 00:07:38,958
In ancient Korea, people practiced
what's called "Demon God Worship" ...

33
00:07:39,192 --> 00:07:42,594
...which was the worship ancestors'
spirits that lived underground.

34
00:07:44,064 --> 00:07:48,467
In the Chapter of Kokuri (Korea) from
the book Gishi Toi Den, it is written...

35
00:07:50,437 --> 00:07:55,500
There is a large cave in the east
of the country, called Tsuiketsu.

36
00:07:57,243 --> 00:08:05,243
In the tenth month, people receive the demon god
that comes through the cave and worship him.

37
00:09:25,365 --> 00:09:33,365
<i>Our country. I will protcct forever. over my life.</i>

38
00:10:30,063 --> 00:10:38,063
<i>I promise to protect our country. over my life.</i>

39
00:10:54,220 --> 00:11:02,220
<i>The good of our home country wandering in
the darkness, may peace be here forever.</i>

40
00:11:44,871 --> 00:11:48,671
Is it true there's a god in that cave?

41
00:11:51,578 --> 00:11:55,708
Yes, a god in the form of a dragon.

42
00:11:56,182 --> 00:11:57,172
A dragon?

43
00:11:58,418 --> 00:11:59,283
Have you seen it?

44
00:11:59,619 --> 00:12:02,884
You cannot hide it if you do something wrong.

45
00:12:03,623 --> 00:12:06,957
He sees through everything we do.

46
00:12:07,293 --> 00:12:08,522
That's a lie.

47
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:14,458
No, that god is always checking in on us.

48
00:12:16,102 --> 00:12:18,662
Where are the bad children?

49
00:12:30,883 --> 00:12:32,317
What are you praying for?

50
00:12:35,555 --> 00:12:39,389
For this peaceful time to last forever.

51
00:12:41,894 --> 00:12:42,986
Yes.

52
00:12:49,035 --> 00:12:52,994
As long as there is the beautiful country...

53
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:57,540
...and there is the beautiful you...

54
00:12:59,312 --> 00:13:00,177
...it will.

55
00:13:58,204 --> 00:14:00,832
Why do they want to destroy us all?

56
00:14:02,241 --> 00:14:04,175
What have we done?

57
00:14:04,777 --> 00:14:07,803
There is nothing we can do.

58
00:14:08,214 --> 00:14:10,911
They do not recognize anything we do.

59
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:14,813
Neither our god nor our rules.

60
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:23,054
This will be a war involving our god and theirs.

61
00:14:23,796 --> 00:14:27,596
Thus, we cannot afford to lose.

62
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:34,868
Our god gave us this fertile land.

63
00:14:36,843 --> 00:14:40,802
We cannot give away this
beautiful land to anyone else!

64
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:43,481
We cannot let it be ruined!

65
00:14:44,751 --> 00:14:45,377
We will...

66
00:14:47,019 --> 00:14:52,253
We shall protect this land at the cost of our lives.

67
00:15:00,266 --> 00:15:05,261
Yes, and our god and you, too.

68
00:17:41,827 --> 00:17:44,421
All of our men were killed by the samurai.

69
00:17:46,032 --> 00:17:47,295
Let us leave quickly!

70
00:17:48,568 --> 00:17:49,364
Hurry!

71
00:18:46,058 --> 00:18:47,150
We cannot leave.

72
00:18:48,761 --> 00:18:51,731
We need to protect our god, our land.

73
00:22:12,731 --> 00:22:14,597
What are you afraid of?

74
00:22:16,869 --> 00:22:19,634
Isn't that the cave where their god resides?

75
00:22:20,406 --> 00:22:22,067
Where their god resides?

76
00:22:22,441 --> 00:22:27,811
I heard a long time ago the god in the form of
a beautiful dragon appeared from the cave...

77
00:22:28,414 --> 00:22:31,349
...and destroyed an army of men in one second.

78
00:22:31,984 --> 00:22:34,146
How dreadful!

79
00:22:34,653 --> 00:22:39,989
If we attack their god's serving
maidens, we will surely be punished, too.

80
00:22:40,292 --> 00:22:41,350
Silence!

81
00:22:43,896 --> 00:22:47,628
Because this neighboring country
worships a god of illusion...

82
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:51,667
...our ikado is having the problems he has now.

83
00:22:54,273 --> 00:22:57,675
A god would not reside in an evil cave.

84
00:22:59,178 --> 00:23:01,169
Destroy immediately.

85
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:02,345
But...

86
00:23:05,317 --> 00:23:10,050
If you cannot, I will destroy you first.

87
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:21,965
Do it!

88
00:26:40,466 --> 00:26:42,332
Quick, escape into our god's cave!

89
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:45,969
Come with me!

90
00:26:47,072 --> 00:26:51,908
My death is my destiny.
But you, I have to protect at all costs.

91
00:26:52,377 --> 00:26:53,621
For me to be all alone again?

92
00:26:53,645 --> 00:26:54,669
You must not die!

93
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:59,213
Protect this land.

94
00:27:03,722 --> 00:27:07,802
I will be reborn to this land again.

95
00:27:07,826 --> 00:27:14,698
At that time, I promise I
will marry you, my dearest.

96
00:27:20,005 --> 00:27:20,699
Now, go.

97
00:27:44,897 --> 00:27:52,897
God... may peace return... to this land again.

98
00:28:23,569 --> 00:28:24,229
Why...

99
00:28:34,613 --> 00:28:42,613
Why do humans continue on
with such a senseless war?

100
00:29:06,478 --> 00:29:07,946
My dearest...

101
00:29:10,916 --> 00:29:11,747
...please forgive me.

102
00:29:15,921 --> 00:29:23,921
I shall sacrifice my life that you
protected, in order to end the war.

103
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:33,267
God...

104
00:29:37,676 --> 00:29:43,012
Please do not be angered by such
senseless state of our being.

105
00:29:47,219 --> 00:29:49,051
Ay you never abandon us.

106
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:59,363
Ay this land be cleansed by
the last blood that is shed.

107
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:16,760
The drops of sorrow turned the two
corpses into small balls of light...

108
00:32:18,437 --> 00:32:25,639
...which live in hearts of people to this day.

109
00:34:16,655 --> 00:34:19,590
We shall see Hakusukinoe soon.

110
00:34:21,092 --> 00:34:23,686
Shall our army be victorious?

111
00:34:24,362 --> 00:34:26,592
What is there to be afraid of?

112
00:34:28,567 --> 00:34:34,336
You are the select brave men from
the great land of Wa (Japan).

113
00:34:35,507 --> 00:34:36,201
So we are!

114
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:49,414
Nagatsu-no-Miya Palace, Northern Kyushu

115
00:34:49,521 --> 00:34:57,360
Prince, our army should be arriving at
Kudara (region in Korea) about now.

116
00:35:05,570 --> 00:35:10,633
Could our army really win?

117
00:35:12,544 --> 00:35:13,909
Sure, they will.

118
00:35:17,415 --> 00:35:18,883
Or rather...

119
00:35:24,723 --> 00:35:28,125
...they need to, Prince.

120
00:35:36,001 --> 00:35:38,868
In the year 663...

121
00:35:39,337 --> 00:35:46,120
Prince Nakano-Oe, the future Emperor Tenji sent his
great army to the Korean Peninsula in order to...

122
00:35:46,144 --> 00:35:52,660
...in order to support restoration of Kudara, destroyed by the
joint armies of Toh (China) and Shiragi (region in Korea).

123
00:35:52,684 --> 00:35:58,214
It was a decision made by the Yamato Imperial Government
that had ruled all of Japan since the Taika Reformation...

124
00:35:58,490 --> 00:36:03,758
...to demonstrate its power
within and without Japan.

125
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:17,296
Kudara...

126
00:37:20,371 --> 00:37:22,669
My homeland!

127
00:37:29,013 --> 00:37:29,809
What?

128
00:37:30,648 --> 00:37:32,013
Our army has lost?

129
00:37:37,522 --> 00:37:39,456
Japan would be in danger if we leave this be.

130
00:37:40,158 --> 00:37:45,255
We must do something quickly, before
Toh and Shiragi decide to invade us.

131
00:37:50,034 --> 00:37:51,593
We need to defend our country.

132
00:37:53,138 --> 00:37:57,439
By all means necessary. Understand?

133
00:38:02,447 --> 00:38:05,781
Anticipating an invasion by Toh and Shiragi...

134
00:38:06,317 --> 00:38:12,051
...the Yamato Imperial Government built a number of castles in
crucial locations and set out on their project to defend Japan.

135
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:17,926
Out of them, many were built on the island of Kyushu which
was located at the closest distance from the continent.

136
00:38:20,498 --> 00:38:28,498
Young soldiers were drafted from the eastern Japan to serve at
these castles, who were called Sakimori (frontline defenders).

137
00:38:45,523 --> 00:38:49,824
From this point on, you will
not need your 3D glasses.

138
00:38:50,829 --> 00:38:56,529
Everyone, take off your
glasses on the count of three.

139
00:38:57,335 --> 00:38:58,097
Ready?

140
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:03,403
One and two and three!

141
00:39:16,287 --> 00:39:18,915
It's the castle! I see the castle!

142
00:39:19,924 --> 00:39:24,054
Wow! It's huge!

143
00:39:25,597 --> 00:39:28,658
So, this is Kikuchi Castle...

144
00:39:45,049 --> 00:39:48,144
The sound of the drum is calling us.

145
00:39:49,921 --> 00:39:50,979
Let's go!

146
00:40:00,565 --> 00:40:08,565
THE SONG OF THE DEFENDERS

147
00:40:13,011 --> 00:40:17,505
Kikuchi Castle was a mountain fortress located
at 60 km south of the capital, Dazaifu.

148
00:40:18,283 --> 00:40:23,221
During the 3 years of their service, they
carried out military duties and farming chores...

149
00:40:23,588 --> 00:40:28,287
...looking forward to the day when their
term would end and they'd return home.

150
00:40:28,893 --> 00:40:30,122
Hey, Kurota!

151
00:40:31,496 --> 00:40:34,261
It hurts, you!

152
00:40:34,899 --> 00:40:37,129
Why don't you keep a solid watch?

153
00:40:39,170 --> 00:40:42,970
I'm so, so bored and can't help falling asleep.

154
00:40:46,377 --> 00:40:49,836
It was such a long time ago
that the country lost the war.

155
00:40:51,683 --> 00:40:56,416
Since then, no enemy ever came
once to attack from overseas.

156
00:40:58,523 --> 00:41:01,322
It won't make any difference if I'm asleep!

157
00:41:01,726 --> 00:41:02,989
Don't say that.

158
00:41:03,361 --> 00:41:06,331
This is our duty as Sakimori.

159
00:41:09,233 --> 00:41:10,894
Our duty, huh?

160
00:41:15,340 --> 00:41:16,466
Time to switch!

161
00:41:25,950 --> 00:41:28,044
So, do you want to go home so badly?

162
00:41:29,387 --> 00:41:30,218
Of course.

163
00:41:33,091 --> 00:41:39,189
I dream of my wife and kids all the time.

164
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,729
They eagerly await my return.

165
00:41:54,512 --> 00:41:56,378
I wish I could be a cloud..

166
00:41:59,150 --> 00:42:07,150
Standing at the end of the rows of reeds, my
wife cried wetting her sleeve, I think of her.

167
00:42:21,672 --> 00:42:24,903
He is an important figure who
teaches salt making here.

168
00:42:25,843 --> 00:42:28,175
I hear he's a noble man from Kudara.

169
00:42:31,149 --> 00:42:31,877
Kudara...

170
00:42:44,028 --> 00:42:48,329
Oh no, what a bad drawing!
Can't even tell what animal it is!

171
00:42:50,101 --> 00:42:52,695
It's not an animal. It's a character.

172
00:42:53,771 --> 00:42:57,230
Oh, a character? A character...

173
00:42:59,977 --> 00:43:02,344
What is this character?

174
00:43:03,448 --> 00:43:04,381
It's Wa.

175
00:43:05,683 --> 00:43:06,377
Wa...

176
00:43:07,051 --> 00:43:09,315
This country where we live in.

177
00:43:09,921 --> 00:43:13,516
This is how people overseas
write to mean our country.

178
00:43:16,060 --> 00:43:17,084
Like that...?

179
00:43:22,166 --> 00:43:26,467
Like this, and this here...

180
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:29,873
What is that?

181
00:43:30,241 --> 00:43:31,333
It's Wa.

182
00:43:32,110 --> 00:43:33,587
So clumsy!

183
00:43:33,611 --> 00:43:34,942
Very sloppy!

184
00:43:35,246 --> 00:43:36,441
You try it.

185
00:44:17,021 --> 00:44:18,420
Kudara...

186
00:44:21,292 --> 00:44:23,283
My homeland!

187
00:44:37,475 --> 00:44:38,499
Dear wife...

188
00:45:57,755 --> 00:46:00,417
Why me as a Sakimori?

189
00:46:00,691 --> 00:46:02,853
Is dad going somewhere?

190
00:46:03,594 --> 00:46:04,220
Uh-huh.

191
00:46:04,528 --> 00:46:06,155
Where is he going?

192
00:46:06,631 --> 00:46:10,329
Far, far away.

193
00:46:11,502 --> 00:46:13,266
Is it too far to see from here?

194
00:46:14,338 --> 00:46:18,775
You can. I can always see you.

195
00:46:20,511 --> 00:46:22,445
Do you miss your wife?

196
00:46:39,230 --> 00:46:41,096
I'm sure you do.

197
00:46:48,239 --> 00:46:49,001
I do.

198
00:46:54,612 --> 00:46:59,413
When I close my eyes, I see
the faces of my wife and kids.

199
00:47:00,785 --> 00:47:04,688
My heart aches so much that I can't fall asleep.

200
00:47:12,363 --> 00:47:14,491
How long will this keep going on?

201
00:47:16,934 --> 00:47:19,904
You don't want to be a Sakimori any longer.

202
00:47:21,339 --> 00:47:24,104
Neither Toh nor Shiragi has ever attacked us.

203
00:47:25,543 --> 00:47:30,640
We just stare at the capital and the
ocean all day long, day after day.

204
00:47:33,317 --> 00:47:36,082
That's how it should be.

205
00:47:37,488 --> 00:47:39,980
It's better not to have a war.

206
00:47:43,427 --> 00:47:44,724
But it's boring.

207
00:47:45,863 --> 00:47:46,921
It's a waste of time!

208
00:47:52,937 --> 00:47:57,966
My wife and kids wait for me back in my village.

209
00:47:58,509 --> 00:48:03,640
I want to go home soon if
there's no war. Don't you agree?

210
00:48:06,650 --> 00:48:13,283
I have no village to return to,
nor my dear wife anymore.

211
00:48:13,691 --> 00:48:14,453
And your kids?

212
00:48:23,567 --> 00:48:26,332
Did they... all die?

213
00:48:33,477 --> 00:48:38,142
Have you ever wondered how sad it
feels to see your country destroyed?

214
00:48:40,084 --> 00:48:45,386
Ever wondered how it feels to regret how
you couldn't save your wife and children?

215
00:48:50,094 --> 00:48:52,722
I'm sure you haven't.

216
00:48:53,264 --> 00:48:56,723
Such pain are beyond your imagination.

217
00:48:59,537 --> 00:49:06,568
No matter how deep your bodily wounds, no
matter how valuable the treasure you lose...

218
00:49:07,545 --> 00:49:12,949
...they are nothing compared to the suffering you feel
from losing your country, and your wife and children.

219
00:49:18,122 --> 00:49:23,652
The people of Kudara had lived
peacefully for a long, long time.

220
00:49:25,296 --> 00:49:30,757
Soon as the war began, the enemy attacked my
country with no mercy and destroyed it completely.

221
00:49:31,735 --> 00:49:39,074
The country our ancestors had built and
handed down to us, in the blink of an eye.

222
00:49:40,511 --> 00:49:44,311
Literally, in the blink of an eye!

223
00:49:46,784 --> 00:49:49,810
Is there anything else in the world
that is as senseless as that?

224
00:49:58,562 --> 00:50:06,526
I don't want to see the same
sad thing happen to this country!

225
00:50:36,567 --> 00:50:37,159
Kurota!

226
00:50:58,389 --> 00:51:01,518
Enemy! Enemy!

227
00:51:14,738 --> 00:51:16,137
Kenichi!

228
00:51:20,177 --> 00:51:21,975
Husband!

229
00:52:03,087 --> 00:52:04,486
What's the matter?

230
00:52:05,356 --> 00:52:07,324
Dreaming of your wife?

231
00:52:09,893 --> 00:52:10,382
The enemy..

232
00:52:10,694 --> 00:52:11,126
What?

233
00:52:11,729 --> 00:52:14,960
They attacked. Where are
the Toh and Shiragi soldiers?

234
00:52:15,833 --> 00:52:21,169
What kind of dream did you have?
Nothing strange is happening here.

235
00:52:43,227 --> 00:52:44,251
It's not a dream.

236
00:52:46,463 --> 00:52:49,262
We need to defend them.

237
00:52:51,802 --> 00:52:53,600
What would you do if this
country were destroyed?

238
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:59,574
Your wife and kids would all be killed!

239
00:53:04,048 --> 00:53:09,487
We are responsible for defending this country.

240
00:54:22,993 --> 00:54:25,860
3years later

241
00:54:47,818 --> 00:54:50,480
At last, we can go home!

242
00:54:51,889 --> 00:54:54,324
We can go home?

243
00:54:54,691 --> 00:55:00,152
Yeah! I heard a boat full of new
Sakimori men has arrived at the port!

244
00:55:01,365 --> 00:55:03,959
So, we really can go home!

245
00:55:04,768 --> 00:55:06,133
It's been 3 years already!

246
00:55:07,104 --> 00:55:10,250
I'm tired of hearing the sound of this drum!

247
00:55:10,274 --> 00:55:12,936
Yeah, we can go home now!

248
00:57:29,112 --> 00:57:29,544
Quick!

249
00:57:30,681 --> 00:57:31,773
Go, quick!

250
00:57:33,750 --> 00:57:35,411
It's alright, just go!

251
00:57:50,867 --> 00:57:53,393
Hey, weren't we going to go home?

252
00:57:54,604 --> 00:57:56,572
Weren't we going back to our village?

253
00:57:58,442 --> 00:58:00,342
Weren't we going to see everyone again?

254
00:58:02,012 --> 00:58:04,344
Isn't our duty over?

255
00:58:05,716 --> 00:58:06,410
Hey!

256
00:58:08,418 --> 00:58:08,976
Hey!

257
00:58:24,167 --> 00:58:30,630
Now you can go home to your wife.

258
00:58:37,247 --> 00:58:42,310
It's because you served to defend here.

259
00:58:44,087 --> 00:58:48,854
Treasure her and keep her safe...

260
00:58:53,163 --> 00:58:54,289
Don't die!

261
00:58:58,235 --> 00:59:00,169
It's fine with me.

262
00:59:02,606 --> 00:59:05,940
My duty is over.

263
00:59:08,745 --> 00:59:12,045
I shall return to Kudara now.

264
00:59:12,849 --> 00:59:16,808
Hey, why don't you come with me to my village?

265
00:59:22,993 --> 00:59:24,620
Your village...?

266
00:59:51,455 --> 00:59:54,015
After losing the war of Hakusukinoe...

267
00:59:54,791 --> 00:59:59,388
...many noble and common people
from Kudara defected to Japan...

268
00:59:59,930 --> 01:00:05,061
...and passed on their heritage of technology,
culture and system to the Japanese.

269
01:00:06,536 --> 01:00:12,669
Much of this heritage laid the foundation
for how Japan was to become.

270
01:01:22,078 --> 01:01:26,914
This here is your village.

271
01:02:50,233 --> 01:02:55,228
""A work in commemoration of the Site of Tanaka Castle, a
National Historic Site Produced by the town of Mikawa in Kumamoto

272
01:02:58,241 --> 01:03:03,256
"The history is said to be a resurrection.
It could also be said to be a review.

273
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:08,694
""No matter what kind of man or incident it's about, the
history loses its shadow if forgotten by the modern man.

274
01:03:08,718 --> 01:03:11,779
""It is the modern man's power of imagination that awakens the
soul that sleeps quietly beneath the source of a spring.

275
01:03:11,855 --> 01:03:15,382
""One incident about to be inducted into the modern history's
hall of fame is "The Revolt of the Clans"" in Higo.

276
01:03:15,425 --> 01:03:19,953
""It was a war waged against the Lord of Province, Narimasa Sassa, led by the
local clans in power in the northeastern Higo at the end of the 16th Century.

277
01:03:19,996 --> 01:03:24,399
""It shook up the Toyotomi administration then in power, and served
as the axis for the Middle Ages to change into the Modern Age.""

278
01:03:24,434 --> 01:03:27,096
Toshiya Hirano

279
01:03:44,120 --> 01:03:48,079
Kitano-Tenmangu Palace

280
01:04:23,693 --> 01:04:24,285
A fine work!

281
01:05:18,047 --> 01:05:22,541
Indeed, the world is vast, isn't it?

282
01:05:26,022 --> 01:05:32,223
Itsunari, there exists someone
who revolts against me still.

283
01:05:39,369 --> 01:05:40,302
Sir Hideyoshi!

284
01:05:49,212 --> 01:05:50,702
Cancel the tea party.

285
01:05:53,817 --> 01:05:54,750
What about Narimasa?

286
01:05:56,853 --> 01:05:58,321
What is Narimasa Sassa doing?

287
01:06:07,330 --> 01:06:09,526
Quiet the rebels right now.

288
01:06:13,803 --> 01:06:15,293
Kill them all!

289
01:06:46,903 --> 01:06:51,841
It was June of Tensho 15, or 1587.

290
01:06:53,009 --> 01:07:00,006
Narimasa Sassa, appointed as the Lord of Higo Province by
Hideyoshi Toyotomi after he had unified the island of Kyushu...

291
01:07:00,750 --> 01:07:08,658
...ordered the 52 local clans to receive a
land value inspection of their territories.

292
01:07:10,293 --> 01:07:15,993
It was an unreasonable order that would cut down their territories
guaranteed them by the official agreement signed by Hideyoshi.

293
01:07:16,432 --> 01:07:23,395
It also broke the promise that there would
be no inspection for a period of 3 years.

294
01:07:24,440 --> 01:07:32,279
What this meant to the clans was for the central government
to interfere with the order they had already established...

295
01:07:32,916 --> 01:07:35,817
...and their autonomy taken away.

296
01:07:37,220 --> 01:07:43,990
Chikanaga Kumabe, the head of Waifu Castle in the
country of Kikuchi, was angered and refused the order.

297
01:07:44,761 --> 01:07:47,253
He raised his army against Narimasa Sassa.

298
01:07:48,665 --> 01:07:56,665
Other clans like the Wani, the Uchi-Koga and the Kai, followed
suit one after another, bringing Higo into a storm of hot winds.

299
01:08:00,944 --> 01:08:06,906
This was the beginning of the
so-called "Revolt of the Clans."

300
01:08:18,928 --> 01:08:23,126
Lady Nigatsu, a war is on again.

301
01:08:26,703 --> 01:08:30,970
It reminds me of when I was
young every time it happens.

302
01:08:33,109 --> 01:08:34,076
Indeed.

303
01:08:35,878 --> 01:08:38,040
We used to prepare for the worst all the time.

304
01:08:39,482 --> 01:08:44,044
If anything had happened to Sir Toshiie,
the aeda clan would cease to be.

305
01:08:45,054 --> 01:08:49,753
So, I was always in readiness to kill myself
and my children to follow Sir Toshiie.

306
01:08:51,728 --> 01:08:52,593
Indeed.

307
01:08:54,330 --> 01:08:58,267
It's not just men who must fight in a war.

308
01:08:59,202 --> 01:08:59,862
Yes.

309
01:09:01,070 --> 01:09:03,869
Women suffer more than anyone else.

310
01:09:07,844 --> 01:09:14,773
It breaks my heart to think about the
women in Higo in the midst of the turmoil.

311
01:09:15,785 --> 01:09:18,516
They must be suffering very much.

312
01:09:55,625 --> 01:09:57,024
Lady Kitano-andokoro!

313
01:11:14,370 --> 01:11:21,834
A WOMAN IN THE
REVOLT OF THE CLANS

314
01:11:30,620 --> 01:11:32,281
Damn the Wani clan!

315
01:11:32,855 --> 01:11:35,347
How long will they go on fighting against us?

316
01:11:36,425 --> 01:11:38,860
It's a matter of time before the castle will fall.

317
01:11:39,629 --> 01:11:41,427
There's no prospect of victory for them.

318
01:11:41,764 --> 01:11:45,530
Yet it's taking us a long time to make it fall.

319
01:11:46,068 --> 01:11:48,036
We're having a difficult time.

320
01:11:48,471 --> 01:11:50,303
It's been two months already since
they shut themselves up in the castle.

321
01:11:51,140 --> 01:11:55,236
Who would have thought the country
folks of Higo would endure for so long?

322
01:11:59,315 --> 01:12:01,306
Right, Sir Sassa?

323
01:12:29,145 --> 01:12:36,677
The Revolt of the Country Families in Higo was settled
by Hideyoshi's army of 20,000 in less than six months.

324
01:12:37,620 --> 01:12:44,925
Chikanaga Kumabe was put in custody of the Tachibanas, his
heir Chikayasu Kumabe in the hands of the ouri clan...

325
01:12:45,595 --> 01:12:48,223
...both dying heroic deaths.

326
01:12:57,807 --> 01:13:05,180
The last ones among them to hold out and fought hard
were the armies of Chikazane Wani and Chikayuki Ebaru...

327
01:13:05,815 --> 01:13:09,683
...who shut themselves up in
the impregnable Tanaka Castle.

328
01:13:11,187 --> 01:13:15,215
According to the Ebaru-Wani Castle
Encamping at that remains today...

329
01:13:15,791 --> 01:13:23,596
...the troop appointed to capture Tanaka Castle consisted of
Hidekane Kobayakawa as the General Commander, with Ekei Ankokuji...

330
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:32,000
...the military man most trusted by Hideyoshi as the Chief Advisor,
and many reputed military men including Tachibana and ouri...

331
01:13:33,476 --> 01:13:37,936
and their men totaling 10,000.

332
01:13:38,948 --> 01:13:42,578
In contrast, the Wani-Ebaru
alliance counted only 900.

333
01:13:43,252 --> 01:13:47,280
Yet they chose never to surrender and
was fighting for over two months now.

334
01:13:47,523 --> 01:13:50,117
We have this great army...

335
01:13:51,827 --> 01:13:57,391
Tanaka Castle is the last
stronghold of the clans...

336
01:13:58,968 --> 01:14:01,079
We could claim our victory if we only captured it!

337
01:14:01,103 --> 01:14:06,371
Well, well. At this rate, I'm not
sure if my army will last long enough.

338
01:14:08,945 --> 01:14:11,004
Sir Ankokuji, what nonsense!

339
01:14:11,747 --> 01:14:14,512
I don't think it would happen.

340
01:14:15,918 --> 01:14:22,324
But, Sir Sassa, isn't it true
we underestimated the clans?

341
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:47,711
Other! other!

342
01:14:50,486 --> 01:14:51,180
Yori!

343
01:16:40,596 --> 01:16:41,392
Brother!

344
01:16:42,264 --> 01:16:45,666
Yori! Why did you come? Why didn't you leave?

345
01:16:46,435 --> 01:16:48,961
I am the wife of Chikayuki Ebaru.

346
01:16:54,610 --> 01:16:57,409
I will perish with this castle. That's my wish.

347
01:17:01,117 --> 01:17:01,913
Yori!

348
01:17:03,052 --> 01:17:04,178
To see you here!

349
01:17:05,121 --> 01:17:08,682
Sir Chikazane, the supply in
our rice storage is almost gone.

350
01:17:09,525 --> 01:17:10,735
Two more days, I say.

351
01:17:10,759 --> 01:17:13,660
Sir Ebaru, so what do you suggest we do?

352
01:17:14,563 --> 01:17:18,193
Are you saying we should kowtow to
the great army and beg for food?

353
01:17:19,301 --> 01:17:20,530
Brother...

354
01:17:22,138 --> 01:17:28,874
Let's hold out until the very end against Hideyoshi's wish and
perish as the brave Higo clan, show them what we're made of!

355
01:17:29,245 --> 01:17:30,337
We can't do that!

356
01:17:31,413 --> 01:17:33,091
None of us would survive.

357
01:17:33,115 --> 01:17:34,259
We're ready to die anyway!

358
01:17:34,283 --> 01:17:35,751
Stop it, Chikanori!

359
01:17:36,619 --> 01:17:41,079
I agree with Sir Ebaru.
We're not fighting to perish!

360
01:17:42,858 --> 01:17:43,723
Brother.

361
01:17:44,860 --> 01:17:46,055
So, do you think we can win?

362
01:17:48,164 --> 01:17:51,190
Do you think we can discourage
Hideyoshi's army into retreat?

363
01:18:11,320 --> 01:18:13,914
Where have you been, Chikamune?

364
01:18:17,560 --> 01:18:19,688
To take a peek at the idiotic
face of Narimasa Sassa.

365
01:18:20,129 --> 01:18:21,290
They're pretty agitated.

366
01:18:21,997 --> 01:18:24,898
We don't have much food in our castle, but their
army is great and they suffer from hunger, too.

367
01:18:25,100 --> 01:18:28,035
It's down to which of us lasts longer.

368
01:18:28,370 --> 01:18:32,830
While this war is on, the peasants and
farmers in this area are sure to be affected.

369
01:18:33,676 --> 01:18:35,337
We're not the only ones suffering.

370
01:18:35,778 --> 01:18:37,542
You are so kind-hearted, brother.

371
01:18:38,747 --> 01:18:43,446
Why don't we just turn ourselves in to Hideyoshi
so that we can save the peasants and farmers?

372
01:18:43,953 --> 01:18:47,583
Of course, we'll bring Sassa's
head as a special gift, too.

373
01:18:49,458 --> 01:18:50,152
I'm in.

374
01:18:50,559 --> 01:18:52,550
I'll take Ankokuji's head with me.

375
01:18:53,696 --> 01:18:54,629
Sir Chikamune!

376
01:18:57,399 --> 01:19:00,369
Sister, please don't be mad.

377
01:19:01,303 --> 01:19:04,273
These are my true feelings.
I'm not fooling around.

378
01:19:07,376 --> 01:19:10,471
We'll be born into this world again.

379
01:19:11,213 --> 01:19:16,982
If in our next life there'll be peace
in this land, what do we care?

380
01:20:33,162 --> 01:20:34,425
Father!

381
01:20:53,549 --> 01:20:54,209
Aki...

382
01:20:56,919 --> 01:21:00,014
If the time comes, then,
with my own hand, I will.

383
01:21:03,025 --> 01:21:08,020
I will end our lives in an honorable
way as the wife of Chikazane Wani.

384
01:21:09,298 --> 01:21:11,232
I, Taromaru, will follow you, father.

385
01:21:15,971 --> 01:21:17,905
Oh, come over here.

386
01:21:22,711 --> 01:21:24,577
Don't worry. Father will be with you.

387
01:21:25,147 --> 01:21:26,706
There's nothing to be afraid of.

388
01:21:28,484 --> 01:21:30,795
I, Nana, am hungry.

389
01:21:30,819 --> 01:21:31,911
I, Chacha, too.

390
01:21:32,488 --> 01:21:34,252
Ah, your father, too.

391
01:21:35,090 --> 01:21:38,549
Shall we ask Koume to make sweet rice dumplings?

392
01:21:38,794 --> 01:21:39,955
When?

393
01:21:40,896 --> 01:21:42,364
Let me see...

394
01:21:43,866 --> 01:21:45,425
Three more.

395
01:21:46,235 --> 01:21:47,634
After three nights, let's have some.

396
01:21:48,036 --> 01:21:50,004
Dumplings get my clothes dirty.

397
01:21:51,373 --> 01:21:54,104
Koume, will you not get mad please?

398
01:21:58,280 --> 01:21:59,839
I won't be mad.

399
01:22:00,616 --> 01:22:05,884
Lady Nana, Lady Chacha,
let's make a lot of dumplings.

400
01:22:12,327 --> 01:22:13,123
That's good.

401
01:22:50,766 --> 01:22:52,825
Hey! Oh, Sir Sakyo.

402
01:23:37,513 --> 01:23:38,708
It's a wasted effort.

403
01:23:43,218 --> 01:23:44,982
You should tell them so.

404
01:23:46,788 --> 01:23:47,846
I can't.

405
01:24:04,806 --> 01:24:05,830
Don't worry.

406
01:24:08,243 --> 01:24:12,373
I will defend the castle for you, too.

407
01:25:16,745 --> 01:25:18,474
Kamio Castle fell at last.

408
01:25:24,653 --> 01:25:26,621
I wonder if we've been wrong?

409
01:25:30,392 --> 01:25:38,392
I wonder if we should have swallowed our pride even if
Hideyoshi were to take away much of our territories...

410
01:25:41,603 --> 01:25:43,765
...rather than to lose many of our
subordinates and seeing our people suffer.

411
01:25:46,108 --> 01:25:50,306
I don't know which course is more meaningful.

412
01:25:52,247 --> 01:25:58,744
But this is our land, that's for sure.

413
01:27:06,321 --> 01:27:09,848
So, are you telling me to escape from the castle?

414
01:27:12,961 --> 01:27:13,826
That's right.

415
01:27:14,896 --> 01:27:19,493
We hear Hideyoshi's army will launch an
assault on this castle as soon as tomorrow.

416
01:27:21,837 --> 01:27:27,003
Yori, you're the only person who can help transfer
the women and little children to a safe place.

417
01:27:30,345 --> 01:27:35,840
Once you're at the foot of the mountain, there's help from our
allies secretly waiting there to guide you to a safe place.

418
01:27:37,185 --> 01:27:40,052
Sir Ebaru has arranged for everything you need.

419
01:27:40,756 --> 01:27:45,002
But why me? Do you want me alone to survive?

420
01:27:45,026 --> 01:27:45,788
Yori!

421
01:27:46,495 --> 01:27:51,042
I will fight to the end along with
Sir Chikayuki and you, brothers.

422
01:27:51,066 --> 01:27:53,467
You are not a Wani to begin with.

423
01:28:01,009 --> 01:28:06,311
Yori, brother wants you to take care
of Lady aki and her daughters.

424
01:28:07,616 --> 01:28:12,679
He wants his children to be safe so
that they can keep the blood line going.

425
01:28:13,688 --> 01:28:18,285
If you're with them, we can relax and
fight without worrying about them.

426
01:28:20,295 --> 01:28:25,096
Yori, I want you to live, too.

427
01:28:26,234 --> 01:28:31,070
If you live, you will be able to
return to this land one day.

428
01:30:11,306 --> 01:30:15,004
Sister, please do not be concerned
about what our brother said.

429
01:30:16,811 --> 01:30:19,610
You are undoubtedly a daughter of the Wanis.

430
01:30:21,016 --> 01:30:24,418
I think he just wanted you to live, too.

431
01:30:26,655 --> 01:30:28,919
Both brother and I were born too late.

432
01:30:29,591 --> 01:30:34,654
If at least we were born about the time Hideyoshi was,
we wouldn't have had to give our land away so easily.

433
01:30:35,931 --> 01:30:40,596
If we were born 20 years earlier, the Wani
clan would have ruled the land of Higo.

434
01:30:41,770 --> 01:30:45,331
Our Brother who leads us could
have been the Shimazu of Higo.

435
01:30:46,041 --> 01:30:50,137
Then we'd conquer the east and defend
against Hideyoshi and Nobunaga Oda.

436
01:30:50,979 --> 01:30:54,847
I too would have been a lord
of a castle ruling a country.

437
01:30:56,251 --> 01:31:01,621
If that ever happened, sister, you would have regretted
being a woman, being such a strong-willed person.

438
01:31:02,324 --> 01:31:02,813
Really.

439
01:31:04,092 --> 01:31:10,623
For the first time in my life,
I'm glad that you are a woman.

440
01:31:11,833 --> 01:31:16,566
I feel the same way brother does. Please survive.

441
01:31:23,979 --> 01:31:25,723
I can walk!

442
01:31:25,747 --> 01:31:26,543
All right.

443
01:31:48,636 --> 01:31:50,126
Keep the fire going.

444
01:31:50,538 --> 01:31:54,566
Draw Hideyoshi's attention to us, so that the
women and the children will safely escape.

445
01:31:56,678 --> 01:31:57,873
Sir Chikanori!

446
01:31:59,681 --> 01:32:00,739
Sir Ebaru!

447
01:32:19,100 --> 01:32:19,999
What's the matter?

448
01:32:51,866 --> 01:32:53,129
What's that?

449
01:32:54,002 --> 01:32:54,798
Looks like some kind of a sign.

450
01:32:58,406 --> 01:32:59,601
Let's return to the castle!

451
01:33:24,432 --> 01:33:25,228
Take the women!

452
01:33:27,502 --> 01:33:28,230
Don't worry!

453
01:33:36,911 --> 01:33:38,379
Now, quick! Now!

454
01:34:03,638 --> 01:34:08,166
There's the sign. Sir Kobayakawa,
looks like Ebaru did it.

455
01:34:09,043 --> 01:34:11,755
But what a long battle it was!

456
01:34:11,779 --> 01:34:15,773
Indeed, it was a castle
almost too precious to lose.

457
01:34:25,493 --> 01:34:27,552
Proceed!

458
01:34:42,610 --> 01:34:43,702
Yori...

459
01:34:51,019 --> 01:34:56,924
Sir Ebaru ... betrayed us.

460
01:35:00,295 --> 01:35:02,559
This may be the end of the Wani clan.

461
01:35:07,435 --> 01:35:08,425
It's all right now.

462
01:35:09,571 --> 01:35:11,164
The war is over.

463
01:35:18,846 --> 01:35:19,904
Koume...

464
01:35:22,817 --> 01:35:25,684
...take care of my daughters.

465
01:35:34,996 --> 01:35:36,088
You can't!

466
01:35:36,598 --> 01:35:37,827
Get off me!

467
01:35:41,436 --> 01:35:43,768
I'm the wife of Chikazane Wani.

468
01:35:45,506 --> 01:35:48,100
I don't wish to be captured and put into shame!

469
01:35:48,476 --> 01:35:49,307
You can't!

470
01:35:50,345 --> 01:35:51,312
Lady aki!

471
01:35:58,753 --> 01:36:06,752
If you and your daughters die
right here, the clan is finished.

472
01:36:09,964 --> 01:36:12,990
Don't you have the guts to survive
like the wife of Sir Chikazane?

473
01:36:13,568 --> 01:36:15,195
If the Want's die right here...

474
01:36:18,740 --> 01:36:24,736
...who's going to tell the generations to come
about the men who stayed at the castle and fought?

475
01:36:29,751 --> 01:36:37,751
If it's men's pride to fight and die,
women's pride is to live and fight.

476
01:36:45,466 --> 01:36:51,030
Lady aki, you should survive, by all means.

477
01:36:53,941 --> 01:36:56,501
The battle for the Want's
women is just beginning.

478
01:37:08,890 --> 01:37:15,125
Never should you cut off the Wani blood line.

479
01:38:07,849 --> 01:38:09,613
Sir Chikamune!

480
01:38:36,577 --> 01:38:37,237
Koume.

481
01:38:38,012 --> 01:38:38,672
Yes.

482
01:38:40,782 --> 01:38:44,309
Take good care of the Lady...

483
01:38:47,622 --> 01:38:49,590
...and her daughters.

484
01:39:10,878 --> 01:39:13,813
No one's got the will to get up any more.

485
01:39:20,054 --> 01:39:21,681
The war is over.

486
01:39:31,566 --> 01:39:33,125
Sir Chikazane!

487
01:39:55,389 --> 01:39:56,467
Curse me if you want.

488
01:39:56,491 --> 01:39:57,925
I won't curse you.

489
01:40:02,296 --> 01:40:04,287
The soldiers will survive.

490
01:40:05,700 --> 01:40:08,192
They shouldn't punish those
of us who won't resist.

491
01:40:13,641 --> 01:40:16,633
Are you sure that our three heads
will bring this war to an end?

492
01:40:25,653 --> 01:40:29,465
I would have liked to knock
Hideyoshi on his ass one more time.

493
01:40:29,490 --> 01:40:34,360
It was an impossible war from the beginning.

494
01:40:40,234 --> 01:40:41,167
What are you laughing about?

495
01:40:43,037 --> 01:40:50,603
They led an army 10 times larger than ours and the
only way to capture our castle was by betrayal.

496
01:40:52,346 --> 01:40:56,078
If Sir Ebaru weren't involved,
Hideyoshi might have lost.

497
01:41:34,989 --> 01:41:36,320
Why is Chikamune here?

498
01:41:40,161 --> 01:41:41,356
Why!?

499
01:42:05,152 --> 01:42:06,176
Chikamune!

500
01:42:12,293 --> 01:42:13,522
No help is necessary.

501
01:42:14,729 --> 01:42:16,026
I'll get him alone.

502
01:42:52,166 --> 01:42:53,463
Sir Chikayuki...

503
01:43:14,221 --> 01:43:15,188
Sir Chikayuki!

504
01:43:16,724 --> 01:43:17,555
Why?

505
01:43:18,826 --> 01:43:20,089
Why did you betray us?

506
01:43:22,797 --> 01:43:26,927
I'm just like you.

507
01:43:29,070 --> 01:43:35,009
I wanted to protect the people of this land.

508
01:43:39,180 --> 01:43:40,511
That's all.

509
01:43:59,700 --> 01:44:01,964
The Wanis and the Ebarus lost the war!

510
01:44:06,707 --> 01:44:09,176
You can abandon this castle
and join the Eastern army.

511
01:44:13,914 --> 01:44:16,315
Or you can fight with Sir Chikazane again.

512
01:44:20,755 --> 01:44:21,916
Do as you wish.

513
01:44:50,684 --> 01:44:52,379
Sir Taromaru!

514
01:44:53,387 --> 01:44:54,354
Why are you here?

515
01:44:57,658 --> 01:44:59,183
What happened to mother and everyone else?

516
01:44:59,760 --> 01:45:01,285
I came to get you.

517
01:45:02,062 --> 01:45:03,325
To escape with you.

518
01:45:03,631 --> 01:45:06,430
No. We will perish here with father.

519
01:45:06,801 --> 01:45:09,379
No! Please escape.

520
01:45:09,403 --> 01:45:10,063
No!

521
01:45:10,738 --> 01:45:14,140
You should not throw your life away for nothing!

522
01:45:15,976 --> 01:45:17,740
Come quickly!

523
01:45:20,447 --> 01:45:21,937
I won't!

524
01:45:38,799 --> 01:45:39,960
Why did you come back!?

525
01:45:40,634 --> 01:45:41,692
Leave the castle right now!

526
01:45:42,236 --> 01:45:43,013
Get off this mountain!

527
01:45:43,037 --> 01:45:44,971
No, I won't.

528
01:45:45,840 --> 01:45:48,810
The soldiers rose up again for
me and for Sir Chikamune.

529
01:45:49,543 --> 01:45:55,038
For their sake, and for Chikamune's
sake, I cannot leave the castle.

530
01:45:57,318 --> 01:46:04,987
Brother, I wish to return you a
favor for having saved me back then.

531
01:46:08,495 --> 01:46:11,089
Brother, I...

532
01:46:14,668 --> 01:46:21,096
I was happy to have lived as
a daughter of the Wanis.

533
01:46:36,090 --> 01:46:36,921
Come on!

534
01:46:39,159 --> 01:46:39,785
Hurry!

535
01:46:46,667 --> 01:46:50,433
Brother, no time to lose, direct us.
Narimasa's army is on their way.

536
01:46:57,912 --> 01:46:58,538
Yori!

537
01:47:02,483 --> 01:47:06,647
You have been too good a daughter for me.

538
01:47:10,925 --> 01:47:16,261
Let's do whatever we can to hold
up until we safely escape. Agreed?

539
01:47:37,384 --> 01:47:38,180
Taromaru?

540
01:47:41,956 --> 01:47:43,446
We will stay at the castle.

541
01:47:44,992 --> 01:47:46,050
You go ahead.

542
01:47:46,527 --> 01:47:47,187
Why?

543
01:47:48,495 --> 01:47:51,658
If you stay, I, Ichikura, will stay, too.

544
01:47:52,533 --> 01:47:54,968
I am the son of Chikazane Wani.

545
01:47:56,003 --> 01:47:57,493
I cannot abandon the fort.

546
01:47:58,105 --> 01:48:00,836
We won't, either.

547
01:48:13,253 --> 01:48:16,120
Ichikura, live for me, too.

548
01:48:17,057 --> 01:48:21,688
Take care of mother and my sisters.

549
01:48:23,630 --> 01:48:24,893
Sir Taromaru.

550
01:48:27,234 --> 01:48:28,360
Go on now!

551
01:48:31,538 --> 01:48:32,164
Go!

552
01:48:34,074 --> 01:48:34,836
Go!

553
01:48:48,555 --> 01:48:49,215
Let's go.

554
01:49:41,542 --> 01:49:43,977
They're here! They're here!

555
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:07,796
Taromaru!

556
01:50:46,140 --> 01:50:47,039
Taromaru!

557
01:50:48,509 --> 01:50:49,999
Father!

558
01:54:38,338 --> 01:54:39,863
Taromaru!

559
01:55:20,947 --> 01:55:28,946
Thus, Tanaka Castle, the last fort in
the Revolt of the Clans, finally fell.

560
01:57:15,362 --> 01:57:16,557
Are you a Wani?

561
01:57:17,197 --> 01:57:20,997
I'm the wife of Chikayuki Ebaru.

562
01:57:24,104 --> 01:57:25,538
Of Sir Ebaru?

563
01:57:26,406 --> 01:57:27,237
I see...

564
01:57:29,509 --> 01:57:31,807
Sir Ebaru was had, too.

565
01:57:33,580 --> 01:57:41,580
Had Ebaru followed me from the beginning, he
wouldn't have had to die with Chikazane Wani.

566
01:57:56,937 --> 01:57:57,699
Sir Sassa.

567
01:57:59,839 --> 01:58:00,431
What is it?

568
01:58:02,142 --> 01:58:04,406
This is the pride of the clans of Higo...

569
01:58:06,413 --> 01:58:07,744
Witness it!

570
01:58:53,793 --> 01:58:58,355
Narimasa Sassa, the Lord of Higo
Province, lost his position after this.

571
01:58:59,532 --> 01:59:05,198
After being harshly accused by
Hideyoshi, he committed harakiri.

572
01:59:13,213 --> 01:59:19,915
Appointed anew for joint lordship for Higo
were Kiyomasa Kato and Yukinaga Konishi.

573
01:59:21,388 --> 01:59:29,388
The era of land owned by clans had come to an end, and Higo
experienced a transition from the middle Ages to the modern Age.

574
01:59:34,401 --> 01:59:42,172
After the fall of Tanaka Castle, Hideyoshi Toyotomi thoroughly
searched out those who were involved in the revolt...

575
01:59:42,676 --> 01:59:47,113
...and the number of those who he had
executed is said to have been 5700.

576
01:59:48,782 --> 01:59:54,983
In the following year, to prevent any
such uprising from happening again...

577
01:59:55,922 --> 01:59:59,950
...he put in effect the orders of the Taiko
Land Value Inspection and the Sword Hunt.

578
02:00:53,747 --> 02:01:01,620
The Revolt of the Clans was a significant historic event in
that it helped establish a new order of the separation...

579
02:01:02,322 --> 02:01:10,322
...of highly-paid soldiers from the peasants and
farmers, and that it put an end to the era of wars.
