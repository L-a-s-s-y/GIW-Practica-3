1
00:00:07,039 --> 00:00:13,846
<i>Ugetsu depicts the greed
within human beings...</i>

2
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:20,186
<i>our lust or carnality —
that is, our sexual desire —</i>

3
00:00:20,386 --> 00:00:23,789
<i>and the ephemeral nature
of human life.</i>

4
00:00:23,956 --> 00:00:27,793
<i>How fleeting it is,
like the Buddhist saying:</i>

5
00:00:28,127 --> 00:00:31,797
“All things change
and nothing is permanent.”

6
00:00:31,964 --> 00:00:35,468
The film shows all these things,

7
00:00:35,735 --> 00:00:38,437
while interweaving

8
00:00:38,604 --> 00:00:43,976
Japanese or Eastern
sensibilities and ideas.

9
00:00:44,277 --> 00:00:47,880
<i>The original story
by Akinari Ueda was written...</i>

10
00:00:48,881 --> 00:00:51,083
<i>in the Edo period.</i>

11
00:00:51,217 --> 00:00:54,053
<i>But to better depict
the abnormal state</i>

12
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:57,423
<i>of a mind consumed
by greed and desire,</i>

13
00:00:57,590 --> 00:01:00,493
<i>the setting for the film
was moved back</i>

14
00:01:00,626 --> 00:01:02,929
<i>to the period of the civil wars.</i>

15
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:08,701
<i>Mizoguchi wanted to depict
the innate ugly qualities</i>

16
00:01:08,834 --> 00:01:11,270
that are a part of human beings,

17
00:01:11,704 --> 00:01:15,441
as well as
the human heart's yearning

18
00:01:15,775 --> 00:01:22,548
<i>to realize the desires
left unfulfilled while one was alive,</i>

19
00:01:22,715 --> 00:01:26,385
<i>even when one has passed on
to the next world.</i>

20
00:01:26,819 --> 00:01:32,425
I think he wanted to depict
that kind of human karma.

21
00:01:38,898 --> 00:01:44,570
<i>Screenwriter Yoshikata Yoda</i>

22
00:01:45,204 --> 00:01:47,607
<i>and Mizoguchi were</i>

23
00:01:47,773 --> 00:01:51,611
<i>longtime collaborators.</i>

24
00:01:52,478 --> 00:01:56,349
But they weren't really friends.

25
00:01:56,649 --> 00:02:02,388
That was because Mizoguchi
tormented Yoda relentlessly.

26
00:02:02,822 --> 00:02:07,059
He wouldn't let up
until he'd wrung out of Yoda

27
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:10,496
everything Yoda could give.

28
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:15,868
<i>With Ugetsu, Yoda had
to rewrite the script five times.</i>

29
00:02:16,035 --> 00:02:17,937
<i>But even then...</i>

30
00:02:18,104 --> 00:02:22,642
<i>Mizoguchi made
further changes to the script</i>

31
00:02:22,808 --> 00:02:25,745
<i>and issued what we used to call
“a special edition.”</i>

32
00:02:25,878 --> 00:02:29,982
So as you can see in this script,

33
00:02:30,116 --> 00:02:31,617
while we were shooting,

34
00:02:31,784 --> 00:02:35,888
he changed lines constantly.

35
00:02:36,789 --> 00:02:40,159
The assistant director
or script supervisor

36
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:44,096
would frantically note these changes.

37
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:46,966
It was hard to keep up.

38
00:02:47,133 --> 00:02:51,203
He'd sometimes cross out lines,
like these you see here.

39
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:54,040
He deleted all this here
while shooting.

40
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:56,609
That was how he worked.

41
00:02:56,742 --> 00:02:58,978
And just like With Yoda,

42
00:02:59,145 --> 00:03:01,380
he was relentless with his actors.

43
00:03:01,547 --> 00:03:05,785
He wouldn't stop
until he'd wrung everything he could

44
00:03:05,951 --> 00:03:08,854
out of the actor.

45
00:03:09,388 --> 00:03:13,759
So sometimes even an incompetent,
second-rate actor would give

46
00:03:13,926 --> 00:03:19,231
an amazing performance
that would surprise us.

47
00:03:19,498 --> 00:03:22,301
<i>Say you're a director
and you're directing</i>

48
00:03:22,468 --> 00:03:24,537
<i>a close-up, for instance.</i>

49
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:26,505
<i>You have to make sure</i>

50
00:03:26,972 --> 00:03:30,910
<i>how much of a close-up
you're getting on film,</i>

51
00:03:31,077 --> 00:03:33,813
<i>so you'd take a look
through the camera.</i>

52
00:03:33,979 --> 00:03:36,048
<i>But he never did.</i>

53
00:03:36,215 --> 00:03:39,018
<i>He'd just remain seated
next to the camera.</i>

54
00:03:39,185 --> 00:03:45,057
<i>Then he'd make the actors
do test shots over and over...</i>

55
00:03:45,624 --> 00:03:49,028
<i>retake after retake.</i>

56
00:03:49,195 --> 00:03:51,430
<i>And the way he did it was</i> -

57
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:54,467
Normally, a director
would say something like...

58
00:03:55,234 --> 00:03:58,838
“Put this kind of emotion into it
when you say this line,”

59
00:03:58,971 --> 00:04:02,775
or “This is an important shot.
Give me this kind of expression.”

60
00:04:02,908 --> 00:04:05,678
You'd give those kinds
of specific instructions.

61
00:04:05,845 --> 00:04:08,314
But he wouldn't say anything specific.

62
00:04:08,614 --> 00:04:10,649
<i>He'd say...</i>

63
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:13,919
“It's no good.
You're not into it.”

64
00:04:14,086 --> 00:04:16,722
Or something vague like that.

65
00:04:19,024 --> 00:04:21,527
He often gave this instruction:

66
00:04:21,827 --> 00:04:25,731
“Grasp the situation and reflect it.”

67
00:04:25,898 --> 00:04:28,701
These were his famous words.

68
00:04:28,868 --> 00:04:33,606
“Reflect” is usually used
as in “reflect light.”

69
00:04:34,039 --> 00:04:37,143
So the actor who was told
to “reflect” was puzzled.

70
00:04:38,544 --> 00:04:41,614
<i>Actors go! all nervous.</i>

71
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:44,183
<i>Even seasoned actors
would get so unnerved</i>

72
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:49,622
<i>hearing Mizoguchi shout,
“Ready! Action!”</i>

73
00:04:49,922 --> 00:04:52,358
<i>That they'd choke on their lines.</i>

74
00:04:52,658 --> 00:04:54,693
<i>He was that intimidating.</i>

75
00:04:55,928 --> 00:04:59,265
<i>The actress Kinuyo Tanaka</i>

76
00:04:59,431 --> 00:05:05,237
<i>was a regular in Mizoguchi's films.</i>

77
00:05:06,438 --> 00:05:09,542
<i>He wasn't demanding
with her at all.</i>

78
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:13,312
<i>Even when her acting didn't seem
up to her usual level,</i>

79
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:15,314
<i>he gave her an okay.</i>

80
00:05:15,681 --> 00:05:20,786
<i>She was a very good actress,
one of the best in Japanese cinema.</i>

81
00:05:22,121 --> 00:05:24,990
<i>During the shooting of Ugetsu,</i>

82
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:29,261
Mizoguchi, myself,

83
00:05:29,428 --> 00:05:32,932
and another assistant director
named Kazuo lkehiro

84
00:05:33,232 --> 00:05:36,035
happened to be standing together,

85
00:05:36,202 --> 00:05:41,273
and Mizoguchi started
a discussion on actors and acting.

86
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,676
He said many things like,

87
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:49,715
“That acting was no good,”
about some actors.

88
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:53,285
<i>Eventually, it turned into
a discourse on Kinuyo Tanaka,</i>

89
00:05:53,786 --> 00:06:00,292
<i>and he said, “Kinuyo Tanaka
is the best actress in Japan.”</i>

90
00:06:00,626 --> 00:06:03,762
Ikehiro and I exchanged glances

91
00:06:03,929 --> 00:06:06,599
and grinned at each other.

92
00:06:06,899 --> 00:06:10,469
Whether or not she was,
as Mizoguchi declared,

93
00:06:11,136 --> 00:06:14,840
the best actress in Japan,

94
00:06:15,174 --> 00:06:19,578
he looked really adorable
when he said that.

95
00:06:19,745 --> 00:06:22,514
His face had this sweet expression.

96
00:06:22,681 --> 00:06:26,952
Seeing that made lkehiro and me
break into a grin.

97
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:32,224
<i>I suppose you must have heard this,</i>

98
00:06:32,758 --> 00:06:36,295
<i>but he was in love with Tanaka.</i>

99
00:06:36,462 --> 00:06:39,298
<i>At the time, he was about 50 —</i>

100
00:06:39,465 --> 00:06:43,035
<i>I guess he was about 55</i>

101
00:06:43,168 --> 00:06:45,404
when <i>he</i> made <i>Ugetsu.</i>

102
00:06:46,071 --> 00:06:49,041
So it was love in old age.

103
00:06:50,809 --> 00:06:55,581
<i>As I said earlier,</i>

104
00:06:55,714 --> 00:06:57,716
Mizoguchi was
a really inscrutable director.

105
00:06:57,883 --> 00:06:59,919
He never looked through the camera.

106
00:07:00,085 --> 00:07:01,954
As for the music,

107
00:07:02,121 --> 00:07:04,890
you look at the script,

108
00:07:05,057 --> 00:07:09,161
and you had to decide
which sections needed music.

109
00:07:09,328 --> 00:07:14,733
Normally,
the director works that out

110
00:07:14,867 --> 00:07:17,603
<i>in consultation with the composer —
in this case, Hayasaka.</i>

111
00:07:17,736 --> 00:07:22,508
<i>Mizoguchi did none of that.</i>

112
00:07:23,275 --> 00:07:26,578
<i>So Mizoguchi did nothing,</i>

113
00:07:26,745 --> 00:07:31,684
<i>and Hayasaka himself
was in bad health...</i>

114
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:37,356
<i>so he couldn't commute
between Tokyo and Kyoto.</i>

115
00:07:37,523 --> 00:07:42,161
This was before
the bullet train, mind you.

116
00:07:42,761 --> 00:07:44,797
This was around 1954.

117
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:49,101
So he couldn't go back and forth.

118
00:07:49,535 --> 00:07:52,938
Mizoguchi intended
to leave the music...

119
00:07:53,939 --> 00:07:56,875
completely up to Hayasaka.

120
00:07:57,209 --> 00:07:59,678
He washed his hands
of the whole thing.

121
00:07:59,845 --> 00:08:02,815
Well, this created a problem.

122
00:08:02,948 --> 00:08:05,884
<i>Hayasaka had an assistant</i>

123
00:08:06,218 --> 00:08:11,256
<i>named Masaru Sara.</i>

124
00:08:11,757 --> 00:08:14,793
<i>He was a fantastic composer.</i>

125
00:08:15,394 --> 00:08:20,599
<i>I was first assistant director,
so Sato and I</i>

126
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:28,240
<i>and the sound technician,
lwao Otani;</i>

127
00:08:28,607 --> 00:08:32,544
had to think
through the music together.

128
00:08:32,711 --> 00:08:37,416
Otani was the sound technician,

129
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:41,887
<i>but since I was assistant director,</i>

130
00:08:42,054 --> 00:08:45,691
<i>I had a better grasp
of the film's theme and overall aim.</i>

131
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:49,261
<i>So the three of us had to decide</i>

132
00:08:49,428 --> 00:08:51,997
<i>where to put the music:</i>

133
00:08:52,431 --> 00:08:56,135
<i>which scenes needed it
and which didn't.</i>

134
00:08:56,301 --> 00:09:01,707
<i>We had to make a rough sketch,</i>

135
00:09:02,307 --> 00:09:06,678
<i>and boy did we grumble about it:
“This isn't our job!”</i>

136
00:09:06,845 --> 00:09:10,783
<i>“The Old Man's going
to complain about this later.”</i>

137
00:09:11,683 --> 00:09:16,655
<i>Anyway, we had some ideas</i>

138
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:20,826
<i>about where the music should go...</i>

139
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:26,565
but when it came to questions like,
“Should we use a drum here,

140
00:09:26,999 --> 00:09:28,600
or a flute there,

141
00:09:28,767 --> 00:09:31,270
or orchestral strings here?”

142
00:09:31,437 --> 00:09:35,340
That kind of thing, of course,
had to be decided by Hayasaka.

143
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:41,847
So Hayasaka would listen
to our ideas, read the script,

144
00:09:42,014 --> 00:09:48,053
and occasionally watch
the daily rushes,

145
00:09:48,487 --> 00:09:50,956
and then decide himself what to do.

146
00:09:51,123 --> 00:09:53,092
That's how it was.

147
00:09:53,258 --> 00:09:56,795
So Miyagawa
was in charge of the camera,

148
00:09:57,162 --> 00:09:59,665
and Hayasaka
was in charge of the music.

149
00:10:00,966 --> 00:10:04,036
Old Man Mizoguchi
didn't touch those things at all.

150
00:10:04,203 --> 00:10:08,907
Then we had to dub the music in,

151
00:10:09,174 --> 00:10:12,644
still complaining all the while.

152
00:10:13,445 --> 00:10:17,983
But it shows how much trust
he had in Hayasaka.

153
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:28,360
What I remember most clearly

154
00:10:28,527 --> 00:10:33,565
is the very first day of shooting
on <i>Ugetsu.</i>

155
00:10:34,032 --> 00:10:38,270
We were on the set
of the Kutsuki manor.

156
00:10:38,604 --> 00:10:42,141
There was a garden,

157
00:10:42,407 --> 00:10:44,977
and a passageway

158
00:10:45,244 --> 00:10:47,579
<i>running all around it.</i>

159
00:10:47,746 --> 00:10:50,749
<i>Masayuki Mori; Machiko Kyo</i>

160
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:55,087
<i>and Kikue Mori</i>

161
00:10:55,254 --> 00:10:57,923
<i>were to walk along
that passageway.</i>

162
00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:00,659
<i>That was to be the whole take.</i>

163
00:11:01,126 --> 00:11:04,363
So Mizoguchi comes on the set,

164
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:09,268
sits down next to the camera,
and stays there a long time.

165
00:11:10,903 --> 00:11:15,507
He says nothing, deep in thought,
making a long face.

166
00:11:15,908 --> 00:11:18,343
After a while he calls me over.

167
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:21,747
“Tanaka,
do you honestly think...

168
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:26,985
this set is how
Kutsuki Manor should feel?”

169
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:29,621
That's what he said to me.

170
00:11:29,755 --> 00:11:33,025
<i>I thought it was a good set,</i>

171
00:11:33,158 --> 00:11:36,128
<i>large enough in scale,
and so on.</i>

172
00:11:36,595 --> 00:11:39,531
<i>The designer, Kisaku Ito,</i>

173
00:11:39,698 --> 00:11:46,338
<i>was experienced
in theatrical set design.</i>

174
00:11:46,805 --> 00:11:52,411
<i>In fact, he was the foremost
theatrical set designer in all Japan.</i>

175
00:11:52,744 --> 00:11:55,447
Perhaps he was a tiny bit lacking

176
00:11:55,614 --> 00:12:00,719
in terms of understanding
what a proper film set required.

177
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:04,756
That's why Mizoguchi
thought so long and hard

178
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:08,827
and asked things like,
“ls this the right atmosphere?”

179
00:12:08,961 --> 00:12:11,330
“Will this pass for Kutsuki Manor?”

180
00:12:11,496 --> 00:12:13,432
He was very blunt about it.

181
00:12:13,599 --> 00:12:15,701
How was I to know?

182
00:12:15,834 --> 00:12:18,470
Ito just made it
according to his own taste.

183
00:12:18,604 --> 00:12:21,473
But the Old Man didn't like it.

184
00:12:22,341 --> 00:12:24,743
<i>We modeled that set</i>

185
00:12:24,876 --> 00:12:28,947
<i>after the Katsura Imperial Villa</i>

186
00:12:29,114 --> 00:12:31,783
<i>and the Shugakuin Imperial Villa.</i>

187
00:12:32,117 --> 00:12:35,787
<i>We researched these sorts
of national treasures of Japan</i>

188
00:12:35,954 --> 00:12:38,090
<i>to make that set.</i>

189
00:12:38,457 --> 00:12:42,628
<i>Even the sliding screen doors
were made</i>

190
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:46,431
<i>after researching their equivalents
in those buildings.</i>

191
00:12:46,732 --> 00:12:52,304
<i>The historical background
of the film's setting</i>

192
00:12:52,704 --> 00:12:55,774
<i>was thoroughly researched
by a group</i>

193
00:12:55,941 --> 00:13:00,912
<i>that consisted
of assistant directors</i>

194
00:13:01,246 --> 00:13:04,449
and members of the art
and prop departments.

195
00:13:04,616 --> 00:13:07,019
We went to libraries
for information,

196
00:13:07,185 --> 00:13:10,489
and when we couldn’t find it,

197
00:13:10,656 --> 00:13:16,528
we sought help from professors
at Kyoto University,

198
00:13:17,262 --> 00:13:23,535
as well as people
knowledgeable in those areas.

199
00:13:24,169 --> 00:13:29,007
<i>So right down to a vase
or anything else,</i>

200
00:13:29,174 --> 00:13:32,577
<i>these ornaments
that were used as props</i>

201
00:13:32,878 --> 00:13:36,748
<i>had to be researched
for historical accuracy.</i>

202
00:13:37,082 --> 00:13:41,486
<i>Nevertheless, though many props
were just re-creations,</i>

203
00:13:41,653 --> 00:13:45,791
<i>you had to check thoroughly.</i>

204
00:13:45,924 --> 00:13:50,162
He wouldn't accept
sloppy or haphazard research.

205
00:13:51,029 --> 00:13:55,400
<i>He repeatedly made that
clear to us.</i>

206
00:13:56,968 --> 00:14:01,940
<i>There are a lot of memorable things
in every scene.</i>

207
00:14:02,274 --> 00:14:05,777
<i>One scene I personally find
very memorable</i>

208
00:14:05,944 --> 00:14:08,146
<i>is the scene on the lake.</i>

209
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:16,355
<i>I think Miyagawa's camera work
in that scene was wonderful.</i>

210
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:22,527
<i>We constructed a pool
in the studio</i>

211
00:14:22,794 --> 00:14:24,963
<i>and filled it with water.</i>

212
00:14:25,564 --> 00:14:28,100
<i>It was quite a large set.</i>

213
00:14:28,233 --> 00:14:31,136
<i>Then we fanned out
a lot of smoke,</i>

214
00:14:31,303 --> 00:14:39,344
<i>which created light and shadow
as the boat cut through the “fog.”</i>

215
00:14:39,811 --> 00:14:44,516
<i>Unfortunately,
the smoke wasn't very cooperative.</i>

216
00:14:44,683 --> 00:14:49,154
<i>Miyagawa would say things like,
“Make it thicker over there.”</i>

217
00:14:49,321 --> 00:14:52,858
<i>“It needs to be thinner
over there on the left.”</i>

218
00:14:53,024 --> 00:14:55,594
<i>But it wasn't that easy
to control the fog.</i>

219
00:14:55,727 --> 00:14:58,897
<i>Kazuo Ikehiro and I
had to take care of it.</i>

220
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:01,299
<i>Generally, the prop managers</i>

221
00:15:01,466 --> 00:15:04,636
<i>had to deal with the smoke,</i>

222
00:15:05,036 --> 00:15:07,506
<i>but Ikehiro and I did it.</i>

223
00:15:08,373 --> 00:15:11,510
<i>This was in February,</i>

224
00:15:11,643 --> 00:15:14,045
<i>the dead of winter.</i>

225
00:15:14,212 --> 00:15:16,515
<i>It was extremely cold.</i>

226
00:15:17,282 --> 00:15:21,119
So we were in the water,
trying to fan the smoke.

227
00:15:21,286 --> 00:15:23,388
Finally, at the very end <i>—</i>

228
00:15:23,555 --> 00:15:26,124
There was this boat,

229
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:31,930
and it had a hole in the rear
to keep it from moving freely.

230
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:35,901
Even if the actors tried to paddle,
it wouldn't move.

231
00:15:36,067 --> 00:15:38,570
So the two of us
were hiding behind the boat,

232
00:15:38,703 --> 00:15:40,806
pushing it along,

233
00:15:40,972 --> 00:15:46,044
and a wire stretched from in front
was pulled by other crew members.

234
00:15:46,511 --> 00:15:50,282
<i>In those days we didn't have
special wetsuits or anything,</i>

235
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:52,818
<i>the way they do today.</i>

236
00:15:52,984 --> 00:15:57,923
<i>We only had thigh-high boots.</i>

237
00:15:58,690 --> 00:16:02,894
<i>The word “cold”
doesn't do it justice.</i>

238
00:16:03,028 --> 00:16:06,765
<i>So we were pushing along.
One take might have been okay.</i>

239
00:16:06,932 --> 00:16:10,769
<i>But we'd hear, “Once more.
The smoke wasn't in the right place.”</i>

240
00:16:12,003 --> 00:16:14,239
<i>So we had to do this</i>

241
00:16:14,539 --> 00:16:16,508
<i>for around two hours.</i>

242
00:16:16,641 --> 00:16:18,743
And the funny thing is,

243
00:16:18,877 --> 00:16:22,747
once we'd finished,
finally getting an okay

244
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:26,818
and getting out of the water,

245
00:16:27,219 --> 00:16:32,257
nobody said a word
of sympathy or thanks.

246
00:16:32,424 --> 00:16:37,329
It was taken for granted that assistant
directors would do those things.

247
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:41,867
<i>Let's see, a Mizoguchi anecdote.</i>

248
00:16:42,367 --> 00:16:48,006
<i>There certainly are plenty.</i>

249
00:16:49,241 --> 00:16:53,445
<i>We went location scouting
for this film.</i>

250
00:16:53,612 --> 00:16:57,983
<i>We were on the far side
of Lake Biwa,</i>

251
00:16:58,116 --> 00:17:03,088
too far away to return to the studio,
so we stayed at an inn.

252
00:17:03,221 --> 00:17:06,458
There were five or six of us:
the cameraman,

253
00:17:06,992 --> 00:17:10,462
production designer, assistant director <i>—</i>
the main production staff.

254
00:17:10,962 --> 00:17:14,432
So five or six of us
were eating and drinking

255
00:17:14,566 --> 00:17:19,204
in a room about this size.

256
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:24,209
I have to tell you, the Old Man
didn't hold his liquor well.

257
00:17:24,809 --> 00:17:27,379
We were talking about this and that.

258
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:29,981
When Mizoguchi was young,

259
00:17:30,348 --> 00:17:33,518
there was this woman who was <i>—</i>

260
00:17:33,685 --> 00:17:39,257
Well, I don't know
if you know about this...

261
00:17:40,859 --> 00:17:45,263
but she was a prostitute.

262
00:17:45,664 --> 00:17:50,368
And the two of them were in love.

263
00:17:50,769 --> 00:17:53,838
This is when he was young,
mind you.

264
00:17:54,472 --> 00:17:59,177
They'd had a lovers' quarrel...

265
00:18:00,345 --> 00:18:06,117
and she had literally sliced
his back with a razor.

266
00:18:07,385 --> 00:18:11,957
There were all sorts of legends
about him like that.

267
00:18:12,357 --> 00:18:15,293
So that day we were talking
about the past

268
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:19,798
when that story came up,
and Mizoguchi grinned.

269
00:18:20,565 --> 00:18:24,035
By the way,
he still had the scar on his back.

270
00:18:24,169 --> 00:18:27,639
He showed it to us.
It was about this long.

271
00:18:28,139 --> 00:18:30,942
“Look here,” he said to me.

272
00:18:31,376 --> 00:18:36,615
“You can't make movies about women
if you don't have one of these.”

273
00:18:36,748 --> 00:18:39,651
<i>Now, that was amusing.</i>

274
00:18:39,818 --> 00:18:45,023
<i>Here he was, a great director,</i>

275
00:18:45,256 --> 00:18:47,926
<i>but he wasn't
a solemn stuffed shirt.</i>

276
00:18:48,093 --> 00:18:50,595
<i>He had a free and easy
manner in person.</i>

277
00:18:51,529 --> 00:18:55,300
<i>He'd been born
in Tokyo's Asakusa district.</i>

278
00:18:57,168 --> 00:18:59,804
<i>If he got worked up on the set,</i>

279
00:18:59,938 --> 00:19:02,741
<i>he'd turn into a fast-talking
Tokyo rascal.</i>

280
00:19:02,874 --> 00:19:06,344
That's what I really
liked about him —

281
00:19:06,511 --> 00:19:10,015
that lovable, childlike quality.

282
00:19:11,049 --> 00:19:14,519
Mizoguchi the human being

283
00:19:14,953 --> 00:19:19,290
was really a unique person.
