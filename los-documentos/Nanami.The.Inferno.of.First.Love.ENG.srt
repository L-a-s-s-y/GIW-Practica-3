00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:02,753
A FILM BY SUSUMU HANI

2
00:00:12,471 --> 00:00:14,682
<i>But isn't it expensive?</i>

3
00:00:15,474 --> 00:00:17,727
<i>Don't worry. I have money.</i>

4
00:00:20,563 --> 00:00:22,857
<i>Everybody does this, you know.</i>

5
00:00:25,985 --> 00:00:28,821
<i>- And if they find out?
- Find out what?</i>

6
00:00:29,196 --> 00:00:30,614
<i>That we are underage.</i>

7
00:00:35,161 --> 00:00:37,913
Let's do it some other time.

8
00:00:38,706 --> 00:00:40,708
But we're almost there.

9
00:00:41,083 --> 00:00:43,502
- Well...
- Well what?

10
00:00:45,171 --> 00:00:47,506
- You know...
- What is it?

11
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:51,719
- This is my first time.
- Really?

12
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,602
<i>Do you want to see nude models?</i>

13
00:00:59,935 --> 00:01:03,647
<i>Your fate is written in your palm.</i>

14
00:01:03,856 --> 00:01:06,859
<i>Come on in, you won't regret it.</i>

15
00:01:07,026 --> 00:01:12,073
<i>This line shows that you
are very sensitive.</i>

16
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:15,576
<i>Your love life is very
demanding.</i>

17
00:01:27,588 --> 00:01:29,590
When did your skin
become so beautiful?

18
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:32,343
You don't make it
with me only.

19
00:01:42,311 --> 00:01:46,524
<i>- You think it will work?
- Don't be afraid.</i>

20
00:01:48,275 --> 00:01:50,861
<i>Do you have big breasts?</i>

21
00:01:51,445 --> 00:01:56,075
INFERNO OF FIRST LOVE

22
00:01:56,617 --> 00:01:59,411
<i>My name is Shun, what's yours?</i>

23
00:02:00,037 --> 00:02:02,456
<i>I'm Nanami.</i>

24
00:02:19,098 --> 00:02:20,432
Short time?

25
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:22,434
Yes.

26
00:02:22,977 --> 00:02:23,853
Want a bath?

27
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:26,647
No, thank you.

28
00:02:26,897 --> 00:02:28,983
Make yourself comfortable.

29
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:42,454
Won't you kiss me?

30
00:03:07,354 --> 00:03:08,854
I'll get undressed.

31
00:03:08,939 --> 00:03:10,064
Aren't you cold?

32
00:03:10,149 --> 00:03:11,525
No, I'm used to it.

33
00:03:11,859 --> 00:03:12,776
Used to it?

34
00:03:13,152 --> 00:03:14,945
I'm a nude model.

35
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:17,655
But...

36
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:18,782
What?

37
00:03:20,743 --> 00:03:21,493
Nothing.

38
00:03:21,702 --> 00:03:23,454
What? Say it.

39
00:03:26,498 --> 00:03:30,878
This is like a dream.

40
00:03:46,101 --> 00:03:48,354
You can do whatever you like.

41
00:03:54,693 --> 00:03:56,070
I'll close the curtains.

42
00:04:06,205 --> 00:04:07,081
What is it?

43
00:04:08,249 --> 00:04:09,917
It's tickling.

44
00:04:38,028 --> 00:04:39,071
You may.

45
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:53,669
Where are you going?

46
00:04:54,211 --> 00:04:56,005
I'm thirsty.

47
00:05:18,861 --> 00:05:25,659
"Attention! Fire risk!
No smoking in bed!"

48
00:05:37,546 --> 00:05:39,131
This is really your first time?

49
00:05:41,175 --> 00:05:42,843
Not even with a prostitute?

50
00:05:43,052 --> 00:05:44,762
Do I look like that?

51
00:05:45,012 --> 00:05:47,348
You're not very sure of yourself.

52
00:05:50,184 --> 00:05:55,606
<i>You're only young once</i>

53
00:05:57,066 --> 00:05:59,777
<i>So if you're a man</i>

54
00:06:00,235 --> 00:06:05,240
<i>Doh-
do what the others can't do</i>

55
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,827
What the others can't do?

56
00:06:09,745 --> 00:06:11,413
Don't we all do the same thing?

57
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:16,960
Why do you close your eyes
when you kiss me?

58
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:19,671
I'm shy.

59
00:06:20,047 --> 00:06:23,717
Don't you want to see,
if I have my eyes shut?

60
00:06:24,927 --> 00:06:28,514
- No.
- But you are sure of yourself.

61
00:06:29,848 --> 00:06:31,517
No, I'm not.

62
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:35,145
But you had a girlfriend,
didn't you?

63
00:06:36,021 --> 00:06:37,022
No.

64
00:06:38,941 --> 00:06:44,988
- When was your first love?
- First love?

65
00:06:47,157 --> 00:06:51,662
- Do you want to talk for a while?
- Talk?

66
00:06:52,663 --> 00:06:54,873
I want to know more about you.

67
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,794
About me?

68
00:07:04,007 --> 00:07:08,095
My father died when I was
seven years old.

69
00:07:35,873 --> 00:07:38,333
<i>My father died when I was
seven years old.</i>

70
00:07:40,294 --> 00:07:43,046
<i>The year I first went to school.</i>

71
00:07:45,174 --> 00:07:49,595
<i>My mother married a boxer
and left me alone.</i>

72
00:07:53,974 --> 00:07:57,060
<i>They didn't have a real
wedding ceremony.</i>

73
00:07:59,271 --> 00:08:04,401
<i>The night she left, she said to me:
"Forgive me!"</i>

74
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:07,529
<i>I forgave her.</i>

75
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:36,141
<i>When I was little, I was naughty.</i>

76
00:08:37,351 --> 00:08:45,150
<i>They sent me to reform school.</i>

77
00:08:45,442 --> 00:08:48,153
<i>People said I was "hopeless".</i>

78
00:08:48,362 --> 00:08:51,073
<i>Then a couple named Otagaki
took me away.</i>

79
00:08:53,951 --> 00:08:56,662
<i>These kind of people are called
benefactors.</i>

80
00:08:58,038 --> 00:09:01,457
<i>They didn't adopt me,</i>

81
00:09:01,542 --> 00:09:04,962
<i>but I call them father and mother.</i>

82
00:09:09,341 --> 00:09:11,385
<i>My stepfather is a goldsmith.</i>

83
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:19,434
<i>I was his apprentice.
Now I'm his journeyman.</i>

84
00:09:19,935 --> 00:09:22,104
<i>I am a good goldsmith.</i>

85
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:45,752
<i>But I'm very reserved.</i>

86
00:09:46,003 --> 00:09:48,714
<i>Therefore my father sent me
to laugh lessons.</i>

87
00:09:54,428 --> 00:09:58,348
<i>It was supposed to make me happier.</i>

88
00:09:58,765 --> 00:10:01,435
<i>"All right now! All together!"</i>

89
00:10:10,193 --> 00:10:11,903
What do you do, usually?

90
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:13,362
Usually?

91
00:10:13,447 --> 00:10:15,822
On your days off.

92
00:10:15,907 --> 00:10:21,163
<i>Go to the park and feed
the pigeons.</i>

93
00:10:38,472 --> 00:10:40,932
<i>I am grateful to my father.</i>

94
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:44,935
<i>Someday I'm going to have
to pay back my debt to him.</i>

95
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:48,607
<i>After all, I'm kind of a criminal, and
though I'm not his own child,</i>

96
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:51,902
<i>he raised me.</i>

97
00:10:53,403 --> 00:10:56,490
<i>Today, both of them went on a trip,</i>

98
00:10:56,657 --> 00:10:59,117
<i>and therefore I have a day off.</i>

99
00:11:01,787 --> 00:11:03,789
<i>I've got a friend, too.</i>

100
00:11:03,955 --> 00:11:05,374
<i>A friend?</i>

101
00:11:05,499 --> 00:11:07,626
<i>Yes, a little girl friend.</i>

102
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:14,049
<i>Once she asked if she could hide between my
legs while she was playing hide and seek.</i>

103
00:11:15,258 --> 00:11:17,594
<i>She has a lot of freckles.</i>

104
00:11:20,514 --> 00:11:23,850
<i>Since that day, we've been
friends.</i>

105
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:28,605
She was the only friend I ever
had before you.

106
00:12:00,721 --> 00:12:03,014
I was born in Shizuoka.

107
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:11,022
<i>I came to Tokyo with a group
of employees.</i>

108
00:12:11,481 --> 00:12:13,900
<i>First, I worked in a shoe factory.</i>

109
00:12:14,651 --> 00:12:17,320
<i>But they didn't pay enough.</i>

110
00:12:23,201 --> 00:12:25,786
<i>"Why's a girl's mother...</i>

111
00:12:25,871 --> 00:12:28,415
<i>like a girl's girdle?"</i>

112
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:34,421
<i>"Because they both stick to her."</i>

113
00:12:44,514 --> 00:12:46,850
<i>Since the money wasn't enough,</i>

114
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:50,145
<i>I found a job at a nude studio.</i>

115
00:12:51,772 --> 00:12:55,275
<i>A friend of mine knew the owner.</i>

116
00:12:56,693 --> 00:12:59,738
<i>Mama-sen told</i> me
<i>that it's pretty hard work.</i>

117
00:13:00,447 --> 00:13:03,492
<i>And that everything depends
on my figure.</i>

118
00:13:15,921 --> 00:13:18,507
<i>I was frightened at first.</i>

119
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:21,676
<i>But everybody
told me I was really good.</i>

120
00:13:22,511 --> 00:13:24,387
<i>To be honest,</i>

121
00:13:24,846 --> 00:13:26,890
<i>I really thought I had a nice body.</i>

122
00:14:30,787 --> 00:14:34,124
<i>Then I acquired some steady customers.</i>

123
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:38,503
<i>Like Mr. Ankokuji - he has a beard.</i>

124
00:14:39,713 --> 00:14:42,132
<i>He says I'm the best in Shinjuku.</i>

125
00:14:42,966 --> 00:14:44,801
<i>He knows everybody.</i>

126
00:14:58,523 --> 00:15:02,569
<i>He looks stern,</i>

127
00:15:03,153 --> 00:15:05,405
<i>but when he smiles
his whole face lights up.</i>

128
00:15:08,658 --> 00:15:12,287
<i>But don't worry, he means nothing
special to me.</i>

129
00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:17,083
<i>But a nude modeling job can't be
all that nice.</i>

130
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:23,632
<i>People always think it's a very bad job.</i>

131
00:15:24,007 --> 00:15:27,427
<i>But I don't care about that.</i>

132
00:15:27,677 --> 00:15:29,804
<i>We're good girls.</i>

133
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:34,976
See you again, Nanami.

134
00:15:35,101 --> 00:15:37,604
Going? Well, come back soon.

135
00:15:45,528 --> 00:15:49,115
- See how much money I've saved?
- Yes.

136
00:15:50,492 --> 00:15:52,327
I think it's a lot of money.

137
00:16:01,753 --> 00:16:04,297
Well, we haven't much time left.

138
00:16:07,509 --> 00:16:09,177
Shun, do you want me?

139
00:16:11,054 --> 00:16:13,014
Would you like to try again?

140
00:16:44,421 --> 00:16:45,714
What is it?

141
00:16:48,717 --> 00:16:50,343
What do you think?

142
00:16:52,053 --> 00:16:53,596
Do I look funny?

143
00:16:55,432 --> 00:16:59,394
Everything feels so curious to me.
I feel embarrassed.

144
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:01,980
You're holding back, aren't you?

145
00:17:06,776 --> 00:17:09,070
Shall we try again some time?

146
00:17:09,946 --> 00:17:11,406
Yes.

147
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:32,510
- Aren't I attractive?
- What?

148
00:17:32,635 --> 00:17:34,054
Aren't I sexy?

149
00:17:34,429 --> 00:17:35,889
Very sexy.

150
00:17:56,743 --> 00:17:57,827
We're going now.

151
00:18:00,163 --> 00:18:02,499
Sorry, wrong door.

152
00:18:06,461 --> 00:18:11,257
I'm sorry. Next time I'll be better.

153
00:18:12,342 --> 00:18:14,761
I was sort of mixed up today.

154
00:18:15,845 --> 00:18:17,138
Do you like me?

155
00:18:17,347 --> 00:18:18,098
Yes.

156
00:18:18,348 --> 00:18:19,849
Then kiss me.

157
00:19:04,227 --> 00:19:06,312
SURPASS YOURSELF

158
00:19:46,936 --> 00:19:49,105
It's cold today, isn't it?

159
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:13,588
When I was young they never gave
us much money.

160
00:20:13,755 --> 00:20:19,135
Only two yen for a whole year's bonus
they'd give us.

161
00:20:19,677 --> 00:20:26,224
We used to go to Asakusa to
eat Sushi.

162
00:20:26,309 --> 00:20:27,810
But one piece of Sushi cost five Rin.

163
00:20:29,646 --> 00:20:33,358
A whole plate was eight sen,
but it was good.

164
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:36,277
It is expensive enough now.

165
00:20:47,622 --> 00:20:51,125
I smell something burning.

166
00:21:06,849 --> 00:21:08,017
Have a look,

167
00:21:10,395 --> 00:21:13,481
I found this in Shun's pocket.

168
00:21:15,608 --> 00:21:17,527
What is it?

169
00:21:18,236 --> 00:21:20,196
It's a toy.

170
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:22,490
Isn't he a bit too old for toys?

171
00:21:46,931 --> 00:21:49,350
Shun's improved a lot.

172
00:21:51,644 --> 00:21:53,354
Is that so?

173
00:22:05,992 --> 00:22:06,826
Momi.

174
00:22:08,703 --> 00:22:10,038
Elder brother.

175
00:22:14,625 --> 00:22:16,377
Kitaro, the devil in the graveyard?

176
00:22:16,794 --> 00:22:19,295
No, that's Enormous-Eyes.

177
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:21,965
He was funny, he was.

178
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:23,801
Long-haired Lion.

179
00:22:26,095 --> 00:22:30,308
I see - the lion, and Kitaro, the devil...

180
00:22:31,642 --> 00:22:34,729
That looks like a sling.

181
00:22:43,112 --> 00:22:45,031
Go! Go! Go!

182
00:22:48,951 --> 00:22:50,620
My pony, go!

183
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,580
Go! Go! Go!

184
00:23:15,228 --> 00:23:17,271
Let's do some riddles.

185
00:23:18,898 --> 00:23:19,982
Who asks first?

186
00:23:20,108 --> 00:23:21,275
Me.

187
00:23:21,609 --> 00:23:26,572
When you peel a cabbage
the core comes out.

188
00:23:26,697 --> 00:23:28,449
What comes outwith an onion?

189
00:23:28,991 --> 00:23:31,994
When you peel an onion...

190
00:23:36,707 --> 00:23:42,338
You peel an onion...
then the core comes out.

191
00:23:43,339 --> 00:23:47,802
Sorry - please try again.
You're no good at it.

192
00:23:48,219 --> 00:23:52,473
What comes out? Come on, tell me.

193
00:25:14,096 --> 00:25:17,183
I'm getting married tomorrow.

194
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:35,910
Come on, Momi darling. Let's go.

195
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,160
Watch it.

196
00:25:37,245 --> 00:25:38,621
See.

197
00:25:40,331 --> 00:25:42,792
Be careful, there's broken
glass lying around.

198
00:25:51,509 --> 00:25:52,550
Let's take this way,
it's safer.

199
00:25:52,635 --> 00:25:56,305
Take care, Momi.

200
00:26:00,351 --> 00:26:02,770
Hey you! Wait a minute! Stop!

201
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:04,772
Child molester!

202
00:26:05,898 --> 00:26:07,356
- Stop!
- What happened?

203
00:26:07,441 --> 00:26:10,695
I have seen everything,
dirty bastard!

204
00:26:10,903 --> 00:26:12,154
Child molester!

205
00:26:53,821 --> 00:26:55,031
Hold him!

206
00:26:55,323 --> 00:26:57,116
Stop him!

207
00:27:02,455 --> 00:27:03,664
Keep quiet!

208
00:27:03,873 --> 00:27:06,083
You child molester, keep quiet!

209
00:27:06,667 --> 00:27:09,337
Beat the shit out of him!

210
00:27:09,754 --> 00:27:11,505
Come up!

211
00:27:12,173 --> 00:27:14,675
Hold him!

212
00:27:16,385 --> 00:27:19,388
Dirty bastard! We have to teach
him a lesson!

213
00:27:21,098 --> 00:27:24,852
Hey, you!
What have you done?

214
00:27:26,896 --> 00:27:29,398
You're a real scumbag!

215
00:27:33,027 --> 00:27:44,330
The guy did something to a
little girl at the graveyard.

216
00:27:44,914 --> 00:27:46,207
Enough now!
Don't go too far with it!

217
00:27:46,415 --> 00:27:48,793
It was a child.

218
00:27:49,085 --> 00:27:51,796
He must be a pervert.

219
00:27:52,046 --> 00:27:56,050
It's of no use to beat him.

220
00:27:56,217 --> 00:28:01,222
Calm down!

221
00:28:31,001 --> 00:28:32,461
Are you Mrs. Otagaki?

222
00:28:32,795 --> 00:28:34,296
Please sit down.

223
00:28:35,005 --> 00:28:36,757
And you are Shun?

224
00:28:36,882 --> 00:28:38,801
Sit down please.

225
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:42,513
Please look at me.

226
00:28:43,431 --> 00:28:45,099
Please look this way.

227
00:28:45,975 --> 00:28:47,727
I hear you are not feeling so good.

228
00:28:52,064 --> 00:28:55,776
Are you still worried about yesterday?

229
00:28:57,069 --> 00:29:00,197
No need to be afraid.

230
00:29:00,573 --> 00:29:02,783
Today I'm going to hypnotize you.

231
00:29:02,908 --> 00:29:06,704
The association-therapy will work
better that way.

232
00:29:06,996 --> 00:29:09,582
Just relax and tell me
whatever you want to say.

233
00:29:10,541 --> 00:29:15,921
- I'm not the police, so just relax.
- The doctor only wants to help you.

234
00:29:17,089 --> 00:29:19,633
There's nothing to be afraid of.

235
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:22,303
Just sit down and relax.

236
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:27,057
Sit over there please.

237
00:29:31,312 --> 00:29:36,025
I'll give you an injection
to make you relax.

238
00:29:36,358 --> 00:29:39,403
- Ms. Sugano.
- Yes, doctor.

239
00:29:51,081 --> 00:29:54,043
Please keep still!
This won't hurt you.

240
00:30:12,770 --> 00:30:15,689
Soon you'll start feeling fine.

241
00:30:19,568 --> 00:30:23,989
Now concentrate on both your hands.

242
00:30:25,616 --> 00:30:28,786
After I've counted to five

243
00:30:29,411 --> 00:30:34,875
they'll become light and will float.

244
00:30:35,167 --> 00:30:36,460
Ready? One...

245
00:30:36,794 --> 00:30:39,588
See, they're lighter already.
Two...

246
00:30:40,089 --> 00:30:43,884
Three...
They're getting lighter and lighter.

247
00:30:44,718 --> 00:30:48,305
Four. They are floating.

248
00:30:49,014 --> 00:30:52,935
Five. See, higher and higher.
They are floating.

249
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:56,814
See how easily they rise?

250
00:30:57,857 --> 00:31:02,820
See? Higher and higher.

251
00:31:03,779 --> 00:31:06,156
They float higher and higher.

252
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:09,994
Higher and higher.

253
00:31:11,036 --> 00:31:12,246
That's good.

254
00:31:13,372 --> 00:31:17,042
More, more...
they float free now.

255
00:31:18,669 --> 00:31:22,631
Now, I'm going to count to three.

256
00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:25,384
When I clap my hands.

257
00:31:25,885 --> 00:31:31,473
Your entire body
will be completely relaxed...

258
00:31:32,182 --> 00:31:36,061
And you will enter a deep hypnosis.

259
00:31:36,312 --> 00:31:37,980
One, two, three, go!

260
00:31:44,904 --> 00:31:48,782
Now watch this carefully.

261
00:31:49,283 --> 00:31:52,036
Your eyelids are getting heavy.

262
00:31:53,412 --> 00:31:56,916
Getting heavier and heavier.

263
00:31:57,374 --> 00:32:01,545
So heavy that your eyes are closing.

264
00:32:01,837 --> 00:32:05,840
Your eyes are closing.

265
00:32:05,925 --> 00:32:07,842
Closing, little by little.

266
00:32:07,927 --> 00:32:09,887
Now, they are closed.

267
00:32:13,766 --> 00:32:19,647
Now you see a screen in front of you.

268
00:32:20,105 --> 00:32:21,899
It's like a movie screen.

269
00:32:23,776 --> 00:32:25,569
Watch it carefully.

270
00:32:27,363 --> 00:32:33,369
When I count to five,
you'll see it.

271
00:32:34,662 --> 00:32:39,875
One, two:
You can see something white.

272
00:32:40,084 --> 00:32:48,300
Three: It is a white screen...
Four, five: Now you see it clearly.

273
00:32:49,385 --> 00:32:55,182
Now when I count to five
you'll see a movie.

274
00:32:55,307 --> 00:33:00,436
One... two... three... it's begun.

275
00:33:00,521 --> 00:33:03,857
Four... you can see it clearly.

276
00:33:05,109 --> 00:33:07,736
Five... everything is very clear now.

277
00:33:08,278 --> 00:33:13,659
Tell me what you see on the screen.

278
00:33:14,535 --> 00:33:16,286
Tell me what you see.

279
00:33:18,539 --> 00:33:19,665
Pigeons.

280
00:33:20,249 --> 00:33:22,543
Pigeons? In a park?

281
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:24,461
Yes.

282
00:33:27,756 --> 00:33:29,299
I see a girl.

283
00:33:29,591 --> 00:33:31,844
A girl... who?

284
00:33:32,970 --> 00:33:33,887
Mo...

285
00:33:34,430 --> 00:33:35,180
What's the matter?

286
00:33:35,681 --> 00:33:38,766
Look at the screen!

287
00:33:38,851 --> 00:33:41,645
Look carefully now.

288
00:33:41,854 --> 00:33:43,480
Tell me, do you see something?

289
00:33:44,189 --> 00:33:48,484
You see something?
What is on the screen?

290
00:33:48,569 --> 00:33:51,655
I've seen what you've done!
Pervert!

291
00:33:52,239 --> 00:33:54,700
- Child molester!
- He did it with a little girl!

292
00:33:54,992 --> 00:33:56,326
What did you see?

293
00:33:57,327 --> 00:33:58,662
What did you see?

294
00:34:00,664 --> 00:34:02,124
What did you see?

295
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:06,211
What did you see?

296
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:11,133
Look carefully now.

297
00:34:11,341 --> 00:34:14,636
You have to look at the screen again.

298
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:19,433
Now, you see something again.
Tell me what you see.

299
00:34:22,019 --> 00:34:24,271
- She must pee.
- She must pee?

300
00:34:24,605 --> 00:34:27,775
Can't you see anything else?

301
00:34:28,859 --> 00:34:30,444
Somebody's peeking.

302
00:34:30,736 --> 00:34:31,737
Go on.

303
00:34:32,988 --> 00:34:35,908
- My face.
- Your own face?

304
00:34:37,242 --> 00:34:39,453
What else?

305
00:34:39,578 --> 00:34:42,039
What's the matter?
Look at the screen!

306
00:34:42,164 --> 00:34:44,374
You can see everything very clearly.
Look at the screen!

307
00:34:45,584 --> 00:34:46,668
Look at the screen!

308
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:49,171
Look at the screen!

309
00:34:51,173 --> 00:34:52,299
Look at the screen!

310
00:34:54,176 --> 00:34:56,678
A very clear image now!
Look at the screen!

311
00:34:58,180 --> 00:35:00,099
You can see everything very clearly!

312
00:35:00,724 --> 00:35:02,142
Everything is very clear!

313
00:35:02,684 --> 00:35:03,811
No...

314
00:35:05,562 --> 00:35:08,107
I can't see.

315
00:35:09,316 --> 00:35:12,444
<i>She's gone out now.
Shun-darling.</i>

316
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:16,240
I'm afraid.

317
00:35:16,615 --> 00:35:17,533
<i>Shun-Darling...</i>

318
00:35:19,201 --> 00:35:20,119
<i>Shun-Darling...</i>

319
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:22,996
<i>She's gone out.</i>

320
00:35:23,122 --> 00:35:24,748
Look carefully now.

321
00:35:25,124 --> 00:35:26,083
<i>Shun-darling.</i>

322
00:35:28,418 --> 00:35:29,837
What do you see? Tell me.

323
00:35:30,087 --> 00:35:31,922
The pigeon's dead.

324
00:35:35,217 --> 00:35:36,593
<i>She's gone out now.</i>

325
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:37,845
Graveyard...

326
00:35:38,262 --> 00:35:39,763
- I see <i>it.</i>
<i>- Shun-darling!</i>

327
00:35:41,849 --> 00:35:43,433
It's getting smaller and smaller.

328
00:35:44,184 --> 00:35:46,145
Smaller and smaller...

329
00:35:46,895 --> 00:35:49,064
Smaller...

330
00:35:53,777 --> 00:35:55,988
I'm a little boy.

331
00:36:01,827 --> 00:36:03,495
I'm a little boy.

332
00:36:09,042 --> 00:36:10,127
Father...

333
00:36:10,669 --> 00:36:11,712
<i>Shun-darling!</i>

334
00:36:12,504 --> 00:36:13,589
<i>Shun-darling!</i>

335
00:36:15,424 --> 00:36:16,842
<i>She's gone out now.</i>

336
00:36:17,843 --> 00:36:19,511
Father's coming.

337
00:36:21,722 --> 00:36:22,431
No!

338
00:36:22,598 --> 00:36:23,765
<i>Shun-darling!</i>

339
00:36:25,142 --> 00:36:26,101
<i>Shun-darling!</i>

340
00:36:28,145 --> 00:36:29,146
<i>She's gone out.</i>

341
00:36:31,648 --> 00:36:32,858
What are you doing?

342
00:36:39,823 --> 00:36:41,325
He's touching me!

343
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:49,541
No...

344
00:36:50,876 --> 00:36:53,545
Don't do that - stop it!

345
00:37:03,805 --> 00:37:08,727
No, no!

346
00:37:15,734 --> 00:37:17,194
I'm afraid!

347
00:37:36,255 --> 00:37:39,339
Stop, Stop it!

348
00:37:39,424 --> 00:37:43,929
Doctor, stop it!

349
00:37:44,054 --> 00:37:47,055
Please stop! Let him!

350
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:49,391
Stop! Stop it now!

351
00:37:49,476 --> 00:37:55,148
Doctor, please stop!

352
00:38:13,542 --> 00:38:17,337
<i>When you peel a cabbage,
out comes the core.</i>

353
00:38:17,629 --> 00:38:19,256
<i>What comes out with an onion?</i>

354
00:38:22,217 --> 00:38:23,510
Why don't you come in?

355
00:38:26,013 --> 00:38:27,306
Come on in!

356
00:38:29,766 --> 00:38:34,938
- Come on in!
- No, I don't want to get in a raid.

357
00:38:37,858 --> 00:38:41,945
- Why don't you come and look?
- Next time!

358
00:38:47,326 --> 00:38:49,201
You want to join the university?

359
00:38:49,286 --> 00:38:51,121
Yeah, I'd like to join Todai university.

360
00:38:51,246 --> 00:38:53,957
State universities are better.

361
00:38:54,583 --> 00:38:56,543
Will you pass the entrance exam
of Todai university?

362
00:38:56,668 --> 00:38:57,753
I don't know.

363
00:38:58,253 --> 00:39:03,508
First of all I have to be accepted
for the exam.

364
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:06,762
What will you do at the university?

365
00:39:07,095 --> 00:39:10,807
I'll study, of course! Read books
and so on.

366
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:19,066
They take their mothers to
the exam? That's weird.

367
00:39:19,649 --> 00:39:22,694
- Yes, it is.
- What kind of mothers are they?

368
00:39:22,903 --> 00:39:26,365
It's very cold!

369
00:39:26,490 --> 00:39:28,492
How long are you going
to hang around here?

370
00:39:29,076 --> 00:39:32,077
You know what naked girls do to you.

371
00:39:32,162 --> 00:39:33,080
I'm sorry.

372
00:39:33,288 --> 00:39:36,291
Wait a moment, your dishes!

373
00:39:39,294 --> 00:39:42,214
I like Tokyo University.

374
00:39:42,422 --> 00:39:46,301
- What's the first thing you'll do, if you pass?
- I don't know.

375
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:48,887
Lots of things - but first
I want to relax.

376
00:39:49,179 --> 00:39:51,390
I know how they feel.

377
00:39:51,807 --> 00:39:56,228
I'll take my child, too, to register
at the university.

378
00:39:57,396 --> 00:39:59,481
You got a boy that big?

379
00:39:59,898 --> 00:40:02,484
Yes, but I'm not married.

380
00:40:02,692 --> 00:40:04,986
- Nanami, you're wanted.
- Yes, coming.

381
00:40:06,905 --> 00:40:08,824
This Mister again?

382
00:40:10,826 --> 00:40:13,036
Maine gachameki gachakuchane.

383
00:40:13,745 --> 00:40:15,831
- What?
- Repeat it.

384
00:40:16,706 --> 00:40:17,916
Maine...

385
00:40:18,125 --> 00:40:22,836
Maine gachameki gachakuchane.
Ain't easy!

386
00:40:22,921 --> 00:40:24,214
It's Aomori dialect.

387
00:40:25,257 --> 00:40:27,134
A real magic word,

388
00:40:28,009 --> 00:40:32,848
if you want to improve your
articulation.

389
00:40:56,246 --> 00:40:57,873
Here, 1,000 Yen.

390
00:41:01,751 --> 00:41:04,880
What? Only a thousand?
Give me another thousand.

391
00:41:05,088 --> 00:41:08,091
- When you undress.
- Another thousand.

392
00:41:08,508 --> 00:41:09,676
- Two thousand?
- Yes.

393
00:41:10,093 --> 00:41:12,929
- Here's the second bill.
- Thanks.

394
00:41:25,358 --> 00:41:28,403
Don't you undress completely
for two thousand?

395
00:41:28,653 --> 00:41:30,405
Wait! Not that fast!

396
00:41:34,910 --> 00:41:39,206
- Lift one leg.
- Higher.

397
00:41:41,166 --> 00:41:42,042
Higher!

398
00:41:42,751 --> 00:41:44,334
- Like this?
- Higher!

399
00:41:44,419 --> 00:41:46,795
That's obscene. I won't.

400
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:48,215
Come here.

401
00:41:49,549 --> 00:41:53,553
- Get this off.
- Pull it down to here.

402
00:41:54,596 --> 00:41:56,263
- Like this?
- No, a little lower.

403
00:41:56,348 --> 00:41:58,141
No, I can't.

404
00:41:58,266 --> 00:42:00,227
But, that's your job!

405
00:42:00,435 --> 00:42:02,062
It's against the law
to show pubic hair.

406
00:42:02,187 --> 00:42:04,898
- Then what did we pay for?
- It's not my fault.

407
00:42:05,106 --> 00:42:08,318
Keep your hands off!
You're not allowed to touch.

408
00:42:09,069 --> 00:42:13,698
- But I like to.
- No, hands off.

409
00:42:17,202 --> 00:42:19,913
- Hi.
- Hi.

410
00:42:20,121 --> 00:42:22,624
- How is it?
- What?

411
00:42:22,791 --> 00:42:24,207
Ma)! <i>I</i> 10in you?

412
00:42:24,292 --> 00:42:25,418
We didn't call you.

413
00:42:26,795 --> 00:42:28,129
If you do it for free.

414
00:42:28,255 --> 00:42:31,131
No. Naturally I'll get paid.

415
00:42:31,216 --> 00:42:32,592
Well, show a lot.

416
00:42:32,717 --> 00:42:34,219
All you want.

417
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:36,805
Is it all right with you?

418
00:42:36,930 --> 00:42:39,222
No, not at all. I'll leave, then.

419
00:42:39,307 --> 00:42:40,640
You leave?

420
00:42:40,725 --> 00:42:42,726
It's all right isn't it?

421
00:42:42,811 --> 00:42:44,563
You're no good anyway.

422
00:42:44,938 --> 00:42:46,523
I'll do better.

423
00:42:49,609 --> 00:42:50,610
Let's go, then.

424
00:42:50,986 --> 00:42:52,445
You've got a nice body.

425
00:42:53,822 --> 00:42:55,949
- Come nearer.
- Let's decide on a price.

426
00:42:56,074 --> 00:42:59,075
- That's all right. Come on.
- How much will you pay?

427
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:00,203
Shut up, and let's go.

428
00:43:00,453 --> 00:43:01,913
How much did you give her?

429
00:43:02,038 --> 00:43:03,206
You've got to show it.

430
00:43:04,082 --> 00:43:04,831
One thousand yen.

431
00:43:04,916 --> 00:43:05,709
How much was it?

432
00:43:06,001 --> 00:43:07,294
One thousand.

433
00:43:07,794 --> 00:43:09,296
It can't be.

434
00:43:09,421 --> 00:43:11,298
- Ask her, then.
- Then I can't show you.

435
00:43:12,257 --> 00:43:13,298
How much then?

436
00:43:13,383 --> 00:43:15,176
<i>_</i> I'm going.
- Okay.

437
00:43:17,178 --> 00:43:18,094
How much, then?

438
00:43:18,179 --> 00:43:21,391
- Show a lot and we pay a lot.
- No, you have to decide first.

439
00:43:21,516 --> 00:43:23,476
We want to see first.

440
00:44:20,533 --> 00:44:23,620
- Someone's there.
- I didn't hear anything.

441
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:26,414
Who is it?

442
00:44:35,507 --> 00:44:38,093
I found something.

443
00:44:45,517 --> 00:44:46,810
How would this be?

444
00:44:49,354 --> 00:44:50,230
Very well.

445
00:44:50,522 --> 00:44:52,022
It was hard to find it.

446
00:44:52,107 --> 00:44:53,316
Lay it there.

447
00:44:55,443 --> 00:44:57,529
What was wrong with the tiger skin?

448
00:44:58,113 --> 00:44:59,739
It looked better.

449
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:14,856
Aren't you cold?

450
00:46:16,649 --> 00:46:18,276
Isn't this a nice kimono?

451
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:20,487
It looks good.

452
00:46:20,904 --> 00:46:22,989
- By the way...
- What?

453
00:46:23,364 --> 00:46:24,991
Otoki's manager asks for money.

454
00:46:25,492 --> 00:46:28,286
- But I paid him last time.
- Yes.

455
00:46:29,078 --> 00:46:30,622
Tell him I'll take care of it.

456
00:47:10,203 --> 00:47:14,958
Is it true that one of them is a
lady doctor?

457
00:47:15,375 --> 00:47:16,334
I don't know.

458
00:47:33,768 --> 00:47:36,771
In Germany I hear they use rawhide.

459
00:47:37,981 --> 00:47:40,483
They wrap up naked girls in it, then...

460
00:47:40,775 --> 00:47:43,903
They leave her there.

461
00:47:44,487 --> 00:47:47,574
Then they wet it, then...

462
00:47:48,032 --> 00:47:51,409
It shrinks and gets tighter, so tight...

463
00:47:51,494 --> 00:47:55,498
That sometimes her eyes can pop right out.

464
00:48:07,343 --> 00:48:08,887
It looks good.

465
00:48:09,429 --> 00:48:14,058
- You look especially good today.
- The chair should stand here.

466
00:49:00,688 --> 00:49:07,654
- Who will win?
- The blonde will get the other!

467
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:16,055
I hear that Ilse Koch died.

468
00:50:16,389 --> 00:50:17,306
When?

469
00:50:17,849 --> 00:50:23,730
Last fall - she hanged herself
in some women's prison.

470
00:50:24,230 --> 00:50:26,941
She had this magnificent whip.

471
00:50:29,694 --> 00:50:32,447
It was made from a bull's penis.

472
00:50:33,448 --> 00:50:38,119
In the concentration camps she cutoff
the foreskin of prisoners...

473
00:50:38,578 --> 00:50:42,915
whenever she found one
with an especially big cock.

474
00:54:02,281 --> 00:54:04,699
<i>If you peel a cabbage,
the core comes out.</i>

475
00:54:04,784 --> 00:54:07,203
<i>What comes out with an onion?</i>

476
00:54:10,915 --> 00:54:13,960
When you peel a cabbage
the core comes out.

477
00:54:14,502 --> 00:54:17,171
What comes outwith an onion?

478
00:54:39,568 --> 00:54:46,158
NA-NA-MI

479
00:54:46,367 --> 00:54:48,202
You - come here.

480
00:54:48,327 --> 00:54:49,537
Come in for a while.

481
00:54:49,662 --> 00:54:51,829
What do you do - undress?

482
00:54:51,914 --> 00:54:54,125
How much?

483
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:55,958
Two thousand.

484
00:54:56,043 --> 00:54:57,128
TWO?

485
00:54:57,628 --> 00:54:59,463
- For two?
- Sure!

486
00:55:00,298 --> 00:55:02,675
It's a good offer.

487
00:55:03,467 --> 00:55:04,884
Let me go.

488
00:55:04,969 --> 00:55:06,262
Wanna know, what he wants.

489
00:55:06,470 --> 00:55:08,097
Come in, its fun. I'll be nice to you.

490
00:55:08,264 --> 00:55:10,850
- Come on in.
- It's cheap.

491
00:55:11,350 --> 00:55:12,560
We show you something beautiful.

492
00:55:12,685 --> 00:55:15,479
- You're a man, aren't you?
- Come on in.

493
00:55:16,814 --> 00:55:20,900
They say, if you pour ink on it,
it will get harder.

494
00:55:20,985 --> 00:55:24,864
A man without a hard-on
is no man.

495
00:55:38,127 --> 00:55:41,839
- Let's have a drink.
- Yes, please.

496
00:55:49,013 --> 00:55:49,680
Who are you?

497
00:55:51,223 --> 00:55:52,600
I'm Nanami's friend.

498
00:55:53,351 --> 00:55:54,352
A friend?

499
00:56:09,450 --> 00:56:10,785
It's backwards!

500
00:56:11,744 --> 00:56:12,995
I don't want it.

501
00:56:22,421 --> 00:56:23,714
What are you laughing at?

502
00:56:25,633 --> 00:56:26,926
I don't laugh.

503
00:56:32,473 --> 00:56:36,852
Where are you taking Nanami?
I watched you.

504
00:56:41,232 --> 00:56:42,858
You wouldn't understand.

505
00:56:58,916 --> 00:57:04,213
Mr. Ankokuji often dreams about fires.

506
00:57:04,505 --> 00:57:05,297
Fires?

507
00:57:07,091 --> 00:57:09,218
Don't you ever dream about fires?

508
00:57:09,552 --> 00:57:10,845
No. I don't.

509
00:57:14,140 --> 00:57:16,058
You're still young.

510
00:57:17,810 --> 00:57:20,229
You still believe in love.

511
00:57:21,355 --> 00:57:23,441
Don't you?

512
00:57:24,817 --> 00:57:26,026
No, I can't.

513
00:57:29,447 --> 00:57:33,826
But I can believe in Nanami's
genfleness.

514
00:57:46,755 --> 00:57:49,091
But you have a wife, haven't you?

515
00:57:50,551 --> 00:57:52,636
She's as cold as ice.

516
00:57:53,929 --> 00:57:57,892
I've often thought of setting her afire
when she's asleep.

517
00:57:58,184 --> 00:57:59,768
That's cruel.

518
00:58:04,690 --> 00:58:07,276
But I gave up.

519
00:58:07,902 --> 00:58:11,405
Now I'm in love with the scars
on Nanami's back.

520
00:58:12,114 --> 00:58:16,619
They're mine - she made them for me.

521
00:58:17,620 --> 00:58:19,205
Think I'm joking?

522
00:58:19,788 --> 00:58:20,789
Shut up! Don't make fun of me!

523
00:58:21,749 --> 00:58:24,043
- Bastard!
- Stop it, Shun, no!

524
00:58:54,490 --> 00:58:58,118
Baked sweet potatoes!

525
00:58:58,536 --> 00:59:07,920
Baked sweet potatoes!
Are you cold, Miss?

526
00:59:09,088 --> 00:59:12,424
How about one? They're fresh.

527
00:59:13,217 --> 00:59:14,425
Shall we?

528
00:59:14,510 --> 00:59:16,512
Thank you.

529
00:59:17,429 --> 00:59:18,347
How much?

530
00:59:18,472 --> 00:59:20,307
50 Yen for you, otherwise it's 70.

531
00:59:23,310 --> 00:59:24,311
Try them - they're good.

532
00:59:24,687 --> 00:59:28,857
The best way to bake potatoes
is never to burn them.

533
00:59:29,692 --> 00:59:32,027
You don't look very happy, young man.

534
00:59:32,861 --> 00:59:36,156
You want to try this one - it's good.

535
00:59:38,075 --> 00:59:40,661
Doesn't it look good?

536
00:59:46,667 --> 00:59:50,129
A little while ago I was here
and this bar girl...

537
00:59:50,421 --> 00:59:51,964
I offered her some potatoes.

538
00:59:52,256 --> 00:59:55,926
She said she wanted hers raw.
So I asked her...

539
00:59:56,677 --> 01:00:00,139
Did she want mine?
We laughed a lot about that.

540
01:00:05,853 --> 01:00:09,355
- Here.
- No, thanks, we have to go.

541
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:12,943
- You have to go?
- Yes. See you.

542
01:00:24,455 --> 01:00:25,914
Thank you very much.

543
01:00:28,959 --> 01:00:32,796
- Would a bowl of noodles be all right?
- Two bowl of noodles, please.

544
01:00:34,673 --> 01:00:36,008
Coming.

545
01:00:39,094 --> 01:00:40,679
Was that the same man
you mentioned before?

546
01:00:41,221 --> 01:00:42,181
Yes.

547
01:00:43,974 --> 01:00:45,184
What does he do?

548
01:00:45,476 --> 01:00:47,394
He's an executive in a large company.

549
01:00:55,736 --> 01:00:56,695
Don't you eat?

550
01:00:57,112 --> 01:00:58,447
I'm not hungry.

551
01:01:00,574 --> 01:01:02,366
Let's go to the movies next Sunday.

552
01:01:02,451 --> 01:01:03,661
What's playing?

553
01:01:03,786 --> 01:01:05,454
"Rustlers on the Range".

554
01:01:05,579 --> 01:01:07,456
I don't like westerns.

555
01:01:20,094 --> 01:01:21,970
You've got a nice handbag.

556
01:01:22,096 --> 01:01:23,472
It was a present.

557
01:01:24,056 --> 01:01:25,055
From that man?

558
01:01:25,140 --> 01:01:26,141
Yes.

559
01:01:34,525 --> 01:01:35,983
Are you still mad,
because of the other day?

560
01:01:36,068 --> 01:01:37,111
Not at all.

561
01:01:38,612 --> 01:01:39,988
Next Sunday -

562
01:01:40,197 --> 01:01:42,991
Next Sunday I have another
photo session.

563
01:02:28,454 --> 01:02:30,247
I'm sure you'd rather be home.

564
01:02:31,874 --> 01:02:36,253
Could you girls smile a bit more?

565
01:02:36,462 --> 01:02:38,672
Your boyfriend's probably waiting.

566
01:02:41,383 --> 01:02:43,677
Hey blondie, look over here.

567
01:02:44,094 --> 01:02:45,596
What do you think of her?

568
01:02:45,971 --> 01:02:48,515
Got breasts like homemade bread.

569
01:02:53,187 --> 01:02:54,605
Does your wife know?

570
01:02:54,772 --> 01:02:55,564
Know about what?

571
01:02:55,898 --> 01:02:58,692
That you're here.

572
01:03:00,444 --> 01:03:03,030
Funny, and you're
just married.

573
01:03:03,155 --> 01:03:07,117
I know but I can't help it.
It's like an addiction.

574
01:03:08,285 --> 01:03:09,870
Nanami, there's your gentleman
friend over there.

575
01:03:34,269 --> 01:03:35,395
Daddy!

576
01:03:35,562 --> 01:03:36,730
Daddy!

577
01:03:42,861 --> 01:03:44,112
I got some firewood.

578
01:03:44,696 --> 01:03:48,867
Mama cook the fish.

579
01:04:03,924 --> 01:04:07,261
Let's have a big smile now.

580
01:04:08,345 --> 01:04:09,972
Let's go on.

581
01:06:30,445 --> 01:06:32,239
What did you want please?

582
01:06:33,323 --> 01:06:34,908
Do you want to talk to the teacher?

583
01:06:43,834 --> 01:06:46,586
- Excuse me.
- What do you want?

584
01:06:47,796 --> 01:06:49,840
It's about the basement.

585
01:06:53,677 --> 01:06:54,553
Well?

586
01:06:55,637 --> 01:06:58,348
Isn't there the photo club
of Mr. Ankokuji?

587
01:06:59,016 --> 01:07:00,517
No, I don't know anyone
by that name.

588
01:07:01,101 --> 01:07:02,477
In the basement.

589
01:07:04,021 --> 01:07:06,606
It's a ballet practice room.

590
01:07:10,777 --> 01:07:12,279
I'm not lying, ask them.

591
01:07:12,404 --> 01:07:14,906
Has it always been ballet?

592
01:07:15,532 --> 01:07:18,326
For about a week now.

593
01:07:19,036 --> 01:07:22,247
But before it was Mr. Ankokuji
wasn't it?

594
01:07:24,249 --> 01:07:25,959
Maybe so.

595
01:07:26,376 --> 01:07:27,919
Don't you know?

596
01:07:29,129 --> 01:07:30,839
Why are you asking so much?

597
01:07:37,429 --> 01:07:39,347
Oh. It's you.

598
01:07:39,848 --> 01:07:40,807
What is it?

599
01:07:41,058 --> 01:07:46,938
You're Nanami who was in
that show last week?

600
01:07:47,272 --> 01:07:49,232
Where is Mr. Ankokuji?

601
01:07:49,858 --> 01:07:52,152
I'm looking for him too.

602
01:07:52,569 --> 01:07:57,866
Tell me what you want -
I'm his friend.

603
01:07:58,450 --> 01:08:01,369
I had an appointment
with him here.

604
01:08:01,745 --> 01:08:02,537
Really?

605
01:08:02,662 --> 01:08:03,704
Yes really.

606
01:08:03,789 --> 01:08:05,707
I don't know where he is.

607
01:08:05,999 --> 01:08:08,500
Me too. This is the only place
I know about.

608
01:08:08,585 --> 01:08:14,341
Bastard! So, he's run out.

609
01:08:15,300 --> 01:08:18,595
And he hasn't even paid me
for the bear skins.

610
01:08:20,097 --> 01:08:23,809
<i>The record for lonely people!
Only 100 Yen.</i>

611
01:08:24,643 --> 01:08:27,145
<i>All possible answers recorded.</i>

612
01:08:27,479 --> 01:08:29,898
What's this one?

613
01:08:30,065 --> 01:08:34,611
This one has fairytales and true stories.

614
01:08:34,778 --> 01:08:37,906
And this one is for old people...

615
01:08:38,031 --> 01:08:43,495
and for singles. You can answer
with "Yes" or "No".

616
01:08:43,662 --> 01:08:45,747
I'm not lonely.

617
01:08:45,956 --> 01:08:47,541
That sounds good.

618
01:08:49,668 --> 01:08:52,754
<i>Records for lonely people!</i>

619
01:08:53,672 --> 01:08:55,257
<i>100 Yen apiece.</i>

620
01:08:56,133 --> 01:08:57,843
<i>Buy them</i> here.

621
01:09:00,220 --> 01:09:02,430
- You sell them?
- Yes!

622
01:09:02,681 --> 01:09:03,764
What does this one contain?

623
01:09:03,849 --> 01:09:07,142
True stories.

624
01:09:07,227 --> 01:09:10,438
This one is for when you're lonely.

625
01:09:11,022 --> 01:09:13,316
- Then the record talks with me?
- Yes.

626
01:09:13,525 --> 01:09:15,569
Do you make a lot with it?

627
01:09:15,777 --> 01:09:17,527
No. Money doesn't matter.

628
01:09:17,612 --> 01:09:22,534
A beautiful girl like you should
be a model or something.

629
01:09:22,659 --> 01:09:25,078
No. I'm very lonely myself.

630
01:09:25,412 --> 01:09:28,830
Thus I try to help other
lonely people.

631
01:09:28,915 --> 01:09:33,128
- I'd like to listen to that record.
- You're welcome.

632
01:09:34,629 --> 01:09:35,964
<i>I understand.</i>

633
01:09:36,131 --> 01:09:38,258
<i>This is very interesting.</i>

634
01:09:47,517 --> 01:09:50,478
<i>I understand, I understand very well.</i>

635
01:09:57,986 --> 01:09:59,571
<i>That sounds good.</i>

636
01:10:02,282 --> 01:10:07,078
<i>You're so right. I agree completely.</i>

637
01:10:11,499 --> 01:10:15,253
MY BOSS IS AN IDIOT

638
01:10:15,462 --> 01:10:19,591
<i>That's an interesting story.</i>

639
01:10:26,932 --> 01:10:28,516
Now I feel better.

640
01:10:35,690 --> 01:10:37,275
<i>That's really great.</i>

641
01:10:53,917 --> 01:10:57,921
- Don't scatter them all over the place.
- Stop making such a fuss.

642
01:11:24,864 --> 01:11:27,200
Look at that crazy man.

643
01:11:33,957 --> 01:11:35,875
Hey, crazy noodleman!

644
01:11:47,178 --> 01:11:50,013
- Who's that?
- The noodleman!

645
01:11:50,098 --> 01:11:53,601
Now he's completely out of his mind!

646
01:12:46,529 --> 01:12:48,907
Shun-darling!

647
01:12:50,992 --> 01:12:54,371
She's gone out now.
Shun-darling!

648
01:13:26,486 --> 01:13:27,987
NA-NA-MI

649
01:13:30,698 --> 01:13:32,242
<i>Am I sexy?</i>

650
01:13:43,086 --> 01:13:45,713
<i>Why do you close your eyes
when you kiss?</i>

651
01:21:20,877 --> 01:21:22,336
Oh, it's you is it?

652
01:21:22,461 --> 01:21:24,295
Hello there, Nanami.

653
01:21:24,380 --> 01:21:25,756
What happened?

654
01:21:28,968 --> 01:21:32,136
This gentleman ate and now
he won't pay for it.

655
01:21:32,221 --> 01:21:34,473
It's one hundred and fifty yen.

656
01:21:36,475 --> 01:21:40,187
You seem to know him -
would you do something about it?

657
01:21:40,980 --> 01:21:43,481
Well I can't say that I know him.

658
01:21:43,566 --> 01:21:45,151
I'll pay you back later.

659
01:21:45,276 --> 01:21:49,113
We have hardly anything
ourselves, you see.

660
01:21:49,488 --> 01:21:50,740
- 150?
- Yes.

661
01:21:51,616 --> 01:21:53,618
Is it true that that's a wig?

662
01:21:54,327 --> 01:21:55,077
That's right.

663
01:21:55,328 --> 01:21:56,370
Where was it made?

664
01:21:56,495 --> 01:21:57,496
Made in Japan.

665
01:21:58,080 --> 01:22:00,540
It's nice - may I touch it?

666
01:22:00,625 --> 01:22:01,417
Please.

667
01:22:03,044 --> 01:22:04,211
Very well-made.

668
01:22:04,337 --> 01:22:05,129
Isn't it?

669
01:22:05,463 --> 01:22:07,381
I didn't know that it wasn't real.

670
01:22:07,924 --> 01:22:12,511
I wanted to make a wig out of
my own hair.

671
01:22:12,678 --> 01:22:15,431
It's nice. You could sell it for a lot.

672
01:22:15,556 --> 01:22:18,392
Really? I'll look into it.

673
01:22:21,187 --> 01:22:27,735
Hallo.
May I speak to Shun please?

674
01:22:29,070 --> 01:22:33,199
I see, when will he be back?

675
01:22:34,492 --> 01:22:37,453
I'm just a friend of his.

676
01:22:39,288 --> 01:22:42,708
Stop, don't do that. He's a sexjack!
Call the police!

677
01:22:54,887 --> 01:22:58,391
Sorry, my joke went too far.

678
01:22:58,516 --> 01:23:00,726
You'd better watch what you're doing.

679
01:23:21,747 --> 01:23:23,332
Come in, please.

680
01:23:23,791 --> 01:23:24,750
Where will we sit?

681
01:23:26,043 --> 01:23:28,087
Let's sit here and watch TV.

682
01:23:28,546 --> 01:23:30,256
I don't like to watch.

683
01:23:30,589 --> 01:23:33,259
TV is no good, is it?

684
01:23:35,970 --> 01:23:36,846
Is noodles all right?

685
01:23:38,139 --> 01:23:39,140
Two noodles, please.

686
01:23:42,226 --> 01:23:45,980
THE VICE OF MASTURBATION

687
01:23:46,897 --> 01:23:49,275
Will you join the university, Daisuke?

688
01:23:50,317 --> 01:23:53,779
Machi and Professor Daige expect
a lot from you.

689
01:23:54,864 --> 01:23:56,282
I'm no good.

690
01:23:56,615 --> 01:23:58,492
But yes, you're brilliant.

691
01:24:01,537 --> 01:24:03,414
I envy your schooling.

692
01:24:04,123 --> 01:24:07,918
It's not all that great,
always studying.

693
01:24:10,546 --> 01:24:11,922
Been back home recently?

694
01:24:12,631 --> 01:24:14,133
No, I don't have the time, you know.

695
01:24:14,425 --> 01:24:16,469
And I can't afford the fare.

696
01:24:18,721 --> 01:24:22,141
How about you?

697
01:24:22,475 --> 01:24:25,770
I went back briefly
during summer vacation.

698
01:24:26,645 --> 01:24:28,064
See Reiko?

699
01:24:29,440 --> 01:24:30,941
Well... let's not talk about it.

700
01:24:32,777 --> 01:24:34,195
I understand.

701
01:24:38,574 --> 01:24:41,160
Shun!
Have you been here for a long time?

702
01:24:41,577 --> 01:24:44,246
I didn't see you sitting there.
I'm sorry.

703
01:24:44,538 --> 01:24:45,456
It's alright.

704
01:24:45,790 --> 01:24:47,166
Come on over here.

705
01:24:48,459 --> 01:24:51,796
May I introduce Daisuke to you?

706
01:24:53,255 --> 01:24:55,549
He were schoolmates back home.

707
01:24:55,674 --> 01:24:58,761
He's the only one of us to go to
high school.

708
01:25:01,639 --> 01:25:02,890
This is Shun.

709
01:25:03,432 --> 01:25:04,517
How do you do?

710
01:25:04,850 --> 01:25:05,893
How do you do?

711
01:25:06,685 --> 01:25:09,605
He's taking us to the School Festival.

712
01:25:10,397 --> 01:25:12,108
What am I supposed to do there?

713
01:25:12,942 --> 01:25:15,861
He's showing a movie that he made.

714
01:25:16,570 --> 01:25:18,114
I'm in the Film Club.

715
01:25:19,240 --> 01:25:20,825
Want to show off?

716
01:25:54,441 --> 01:25:56,193
You're very rude.

717
01:25:56,569 --> 01:25:57,486
Why?

718
01:25:57,903 --> 01:25:59,572
You weren't polite.

719
01:25:59,905 --> 01:26:02,908
I can't pretend things I don't feel.

720
01:26:04,451 --> 01:26:06,412
I'm sorry I invited you.

721
01:26:09,707 --> 01:26:11,917
I should have come alone.

722
01:26:20,050 --> 01:26:23,971
O-n-i-o-n!

723
01:26:27,266 --> 01:26:28,309
Let's go over there.

724
01:26:28,976 --> 01:26:29,727
Where?

725
01:26:30,144 --> 01:26:31,520
Join Daisuke.

726
01:26:31,854 --> 01:26:33,230
Go ahead then.

727
01:26:36,066 --> 01:26:38,736
The School Festivals are all right...

728
01:26:40,821 --> 01:26:44,366
But that doesn't mean you have to
run around with him all the time.

729
01:26:50,372 --> 01:26:52,249
We could have come by ourselves.

730
01:26:54,001 --> 01:26:56,086
I'm not going without Daisuke.

731
01:26:59,340 --> 01:27:03,802
But we don't have to spend
all the time with him.

732
01:27:33,040 --> 01:27:35,709
Look at that short skirt.

733
01:27:35,834 --> 01:27:37,668
She's got too much makeup.

734
01:27:37,753 --> 01:27:40,462
She sure is no student.

735
01:27:40,547 --> 01:27:44,426
She looks pretty flashy
if you ask me.

736
01:27:46,929 --> 01:27:51,725
<i>- Over there, in that building...
- He's in the Film Club.</i>

737
01:27:51,850 --> 01:27:56,687
<i>- Art, Literature...
- With such bandy legs,</i>

738
01:27:56,772 --> 01:27:59,775
<i>- and Music.
...I wouldn't wear a mini.</i>

739
01:28:00,109 --> 01:28:03,487
Cigarette?
No, thanks.

740
01:28:04,029 --> 01:28:05,447
Do you have a match, then?

741
01:28:05,614 --> 01:28:06,573
No, I don't.

742
01:28:08,701 --> 01:28:14,498
- Look at her nails.
- Red like a traffic light.

743
01:28:15,165 --> 01:28:16,208
Do you have a match?

744
01:28:16,417 --> 01:28:17,251
No.

745
01:28:17,626 --> 01:28:19,628
Want a poem instead?

746
01:28:35,811 --> 01:28:39,356
Sensibility and taste
are formed by reading.

747
01:28:39,565 --> 01:28:46,739
What you are really doing
is forming your own life.

748
01:28:46,947 --> 01:28:50,409
Therefore, reading is very important.

749
01:28:58,167 --> 01:28:59,918
Does it have a story?

750
01:29:01,086 --> 01:29:03,088
Well, it's a love story.

751
01:29:03,964 --> 01:29:05,257
There it is.

752
01:29:05,924 --> 01:29:09,094
Great, you've even got a poster.

753
01:29:09,970 --> 01:29:12,014
I made it myself.

754
01:29:12,181 --> 01:29:17,728
It is written, directed, produced, scored,
publicized, and acted in by me.

755
01:29:27,446 --> 01:29:31,115
<i>Does he play in it?
Yes, and he has a sideline job, too.</i>

756
01:29:31,200 --> 01:29:32,951
<i>He's looking good.</i>

757
01:29:37,206 --> 01:29:38,332
When will you start?

758
01:29:38,707 --> 01:29:40,250
Right now.

759
01:29:42,252 --> 01:29:46,423
Now, I'm going to show my film,
"A Record of First Love".

760
01:29:56,934 --> 01:30:00,521
<i>Admiration forever...</i>

761
01:30:01,855 --> 01:30:05,150
<i>Chizuko Kubota, Third Grade, C-Class...</i>

762
01:30:06,068 --> 01:30:08,153
We were classmates and...

763
01:30:09,279 --> 01:30:11,657
<i>I fell in love with her.</i>

764
01:30:13,242 --> 01:30:15,953
<i>"I love you"- written five hundred times.</i>

765
01:30:16,662 --> 01:30:20,124
<i>This book of poems,
this book of praise...</i>

766
01:30:21,583 --> 01:30:23,669
<i>Yet my heart cannot reach her.</i>

767
01:30:25,879 --> 01:30:27,214
<i>Alas, we must part.</i>

768
01:30:28,757 --> 01:30:30,050
<i>The graduation ceremony...</i>

769
01:30:31,552 --> 01:30:33,554
<i>I wanted to talk with you...</i>

770
01:30:35,389 --> 01:30:37,975
<i>But you walked away with another boy.</i>

771
01:30:39,893 --> 01:30:41,895
<i>My heart was broken.</i>

772
01:30:42,771 --> 01:30:46,900
<i>My heart was freezing.
But that doesn't matter anymore.</i>

773
01:30:47,609 --> 01:30:49,528
<i>Now I have forgiven you everything...</i>

774
01:30:50,487 --> 01:30:52,781
<i>But we have no future together.</i>

775
01:30:53,740 --> 01:30:55,826
<i>On our last school trip...</i>

776
01:30:56,201 --> 01:30:57,828
<i>To Komazawa...</i>

777
01:30:59,997 --> 01:31:02,916
<i>You gave me some candy at the gym.</i>

778
01:31:04,751 --> 01:31:06,587
<i>If you'd been only beautiful...</i>

779
01:31:06,753 --> 01:31:11,216
<i>I might have loved another.</i>

780
01:31:12,259 --> 01:31:14,470
<i>But you had something that
was all your own.</i>

781
01:31:15,679 --> 01:31:17,347
<i>The class party...</i>

782
01:31:19,475 --> 01:31:23,437
<i>I came, full of hope.</i>

783
01:31:25,439 --> 01:31:27,149
<i>You weren't there.</i>

784
01:31:28,275 --> 01:31:29,776
<i>You betrayed me.</i>

785
01:31:30,777 --> 01:31:33,280
<i>But I couldn't blame you.</i>

786
01:31:37,534 --> 01:31:38,952
<i>Your bus-stop...</i>

787
01:31:41,663 --> 01:31:44,875
- <i>Even</i> now <i>I</i> wait there.
- From here on, the picture's very shaky.

788
01:31:45,209 --> 01:31:48,170
<i>- At</i> the <i>school</i> gates.
- I followed the bus by bicycle.

789
01:31:48,587 --> 01:31:51,673
- You hadn't changed at all.
- With the running camera in my hands.

790
01:31:51,882 --> 01:31:56,428
- You hadn't changed at all.
- So it's a little shaky.

791
01:31:58,096 --> 01:32:00,474
<i>I pretended not to notice you.</i>

792
01:32:01,517 --> 01:32:04,144
<i>Then I'd turn and look at you.</i>

793
01:32:06,146 --> 01:32:09,024
<i>Then the bus came and
you were gone.</i>

794
01:32:15,322 --> 01:32:19,451
<i>We met again - May 5th.</i>

795
01:32:21,161 --> 01:32:23,163
<i>You were riding a bike.</i>

796
01:32:26,041 --> 01:32:29,962
<i>Remembering how we promised to write...</i>

797
01:32:35,425 --> 01:32:37,344
<i>How empty everything is.</i>

798
01:32:37,886 --> 01:32:40,138
<i>Only school without you...</i>

799
01:32:41,056 --> 01:32:44,476
<i>That is me then, now,</i>

800
01:32:45,894 --> 01:32:47,145
<i>and in the future.</i>

801
01:32:48,272 --> 01:32:50,357
<i>I will never change.</i>

802
01:32:50,482 --> 01:32:55,362
<i>I will admire you, love you, adore you
for all of my life.</i>

803
01:32:55,529 --> 01:32:58,407
<i>You were all the beauty, all the people,</i>

804
01:32:58,865 --> 01:33:00,200
<i>all the longing of my life.</i>

805
01:33:01,034 --> 01:33:02,536
<i>My neverending love.</i>

806
01:33:05,330 --> 01:33:09,835
<i>I am entirely yours and can never
belong to anyone else.</i>

807
01:33:11,670 --> 01:33:13,630
<i>But you are not here now.</i>

808
01:33:16,216 --> 01:33:20,178
<i>If I could live over the school days again...</i>

809
01:33:21,680 --> 01:33:23,724
<i>I should be so happy.</i>

810
01:33:28,228 --> 01:33:33,150
<i>And when, when can I confess
my love for you?</i>

811
01:33:46,580 --> 01:33:48,540
Oh, that was beautiful!

812
01:33:48,790 --> 01:33:50,792
You're a real film director.

813
01:33:52,586 --> 01:33:57,466
Thank you - I only wish she were
here to see it.

814
01:33:58,717 --> 01:34:00,344
I'd like to have seen her.

815
01:34:00,927 --> 01:34:02,638
I wonder what happened to her.

816
01:34:03,597 --> 01:34:05,349
Shall we go have some tea?

817
01:34:05,807 --> 01:34:08,018
No, I'll wait for her a little while.

818
01:34:09,770 --> 01:34:11,313
Thank you very much.

819
01:34:11,897 --> 01:34:12,939
I hope she'll come soon.

820
01:34:13,231 --> 01:34:15,233
- See you again.
- See you again.

821
01:34:32,959 --> 01:34:36,713
What is it?
Anything wrong with you?

822
01:34:37,756 --> 01:34:38,882
Nothing.

823
01:34:39,675 --> 01:34:41,343
Something's wrong.

824
01:34:42,969 --> 01:34:44,221
Well, what kind of film was that?

825
01:34:44,554 --> 01:34:45,305
What?

826
01:34:45,806 --> 01:34:48,475
Rubbish! It was childish.

827
01:34:49,393 --> 01:34:50,852
You thought so?

828
01:34:52,646 --> 01:34:55,482
Well... not completely childish.

829
01:35:21,007 --> 01:35:22,090
Silverfoil.

830
01:35:22,175 --> 01:35:23,051
What?

831
01:35:24,386 --> 01:35:25,637
Shall I keep it?

832
01:35:26,179 --> 01:35:27,013
Throw it away.

833
01:35:27,639 --> 01:35:30,142
The film was called "First Love".

834
01:35:31,518 --> 01:35:33,353
It was sentimental.

835
01:35:35,647 --> 01:35:37,107
You think so?

836
01:35:37,858 --> 01:35:39,566
Throw that away.

837
01:35:39,651 --> 01:35:40,777
No!

838
01:35:44,197 --> 01:35:47,534
Do you still meet the perverse,
bearded man?

839
01:35:49,453 --> 01:35:51,246
He's normal.

840
01:35:52,873 --> 01:35:56,084
Those people are disgusting.

841
01:35:57,878 --> 01:36:00,088
But he was always kind to me.

842
01:36:03,216 --> 01:36:04,593
Want a drink?

843
01:36:16,897 --> 01:36:20,233
When you peel a cabbage
the core comes out.

844
01:36:20,650 --> 01:36:22,235
What comes out when you
peel an onion?

845
01:36:22,360 --> 01:36:23,278
What?

846
01:36:23,445 --> 01:36:26,531
You peel a cabbage and
you get the core.

847
01:36:26,823 --> 01:36:28,448
What do you get when you
peel an onion?

848
01:36:28,533 --> 01:36:29,700
Oh, that one.

849
01:36:29,785 --> 01:36:30,660
You know?

850
01:36:36,041 --> 01:36:37,375
You really do?

851
01:36:37,793 --> 01:36:39,169
It's tears.

852
01:36:39,920 --> 01:36:42,380
From a cabbage you get the core.

853
01:36:42,964 --> 01:36:45,550
From an onion you get tears.

854
01:36:47,344 --> 01:36:48,845
I see!

855
01:36:57,646 --> 01:36:58,980
I understand.

856
01:37:01,316 --> 01:37:05,529
No wonder, I peeled an onion
and still couldn't get it.

857
01:37:06,613 --> 01:37:09,115
But tears came out when you
did, didn't they?

858
01:37:43,525 --> 01:37:44,776
Shall we try again?

859
01:37:46,194 --> 01:37:47,779
This time it will be all right.

860
01:37:48,363 --> 01:37:49,364
Why?

861
01:37:49,865 --> 01:37:51,199
I feel it Will.

862
01:37:51,449 --> 01:37:52,450
Me too...

863
01:37:52,742 --> 01:37:54,160
Tomorrow night...

864
01:37:55,662 --> 01:37:57,038
At the same hotel...

865
01:37:58,164 --> 01:37:59,291
Six o'clock.

866
01:38:00,041 --> 01:38:01,209
Same room.

867
01:38:06,840 --> 01:38:08,174
This time it will be all right!

868
01:38:10,093 --> 01:38:11,428
This is first love!

869
01:38:11,928 --> 01:38:13,305
First love!

870
01:39:13,865 --> 01:39:14,866
Shun-darling.

871
01:39:17,786 --> 01:39:19,287
You dress up?

872
01:39:22,040 --> 01:39:24,042
Interesting newspaper story today.

873
01:39:26,711 --> 01:39:28,588
There was this married businessman.

874
01:39:29,047 --> 01:39:31,299
He worked late with a man from his office.

875
01:39:33,927 --> 01:39:40,850
And ever since then he doesn't want
to sleep with his wife.

876
01:39:56,324 --> 01:39:57,325
What are you doing?

877
01:40:00,036 --> 01:40:03,248
Ungrateful! Get out!

878
01:40:06,084 --> 01:40:10,171
Stupid!
You end up in prison anyway!

879
01:40:13,967 --> 01:40:15,552
A real delinquent.

880
01:40:56,718 --> 01:40:57,802
That's Momi.

881
01:41:10,231 --> 01:41:12,358
Momi! Hi!

882
01:41:16,404 --> 01:41:17,363
Hi!

883
01:41:29,667 --> 01:41:30,752
Hi!

884
01:41:32,170 --> 01:41:33,671
I solved the riddle.

885
01:41:34,089 --> 01:41:35,090
What is it?

886
01:41:38,468 --> 01:41:42,514
You get the core from the cabbage.
And you get tears from onions.

887
01:41:42,847 --> 01:41:44,265
Yes! Yes!

888
01:41:44,557 --> 01:41:45,892
You've been all right?

889
01:41:46,601 --> 01:41:48,810
I don't see you in the park much.

890
01:41:48,895 --> 01:41:50,271
Am I a bad girl?

891
01:41:50,396 --> 01:41:53,441
No, but why?

892
01:41:53,608 --> 01:41:57,695
Was it bad what I did?

893
01:41:58,404 --> 01:42:03,743
No, you're the best little girl
in the whole wide world.

894
01:42:03,952 --> 01:42:05,411
Yes, I am!

895
01:42:11,751 --> 01:42:14,546
- Bye! Bye!
- Bye! Bye!

896
01:42:16,381 --> 01:42:20,385
- Bye!
' See you!

897
01:42:25,140 --> 01:42:27,225
I'm going to bring a girl next time.

898
01:42:28,184 --> 01:42:29,686
Her name is Nanami.

899
01:42:30,353 --> 01:42:32,564
You'll be good friends.

900
01:42:44,868 --> 01:42:49,289
Can you lend me some train fare please?

901
01:42:52,375 --> 01:42:56,462
I'm sorry but twenty, even ten yen will do.

902
01:42:56,671 --> 01:42:57,797
Please, please.

903
01:42:58,006 --> 01:42:59,757
All right, knock it off!

904
01:43:03,344 --> 01:43:07,307
Well, haven't seen you for a long time.
Not since that girlie-show, remember?

905
01:43:08,766 --> 01:43:09,934
Where's that girl?

906
01:43:10,226 --> 01:43:11,436
What girl?

907
01:43:11,936 --> 01:43:13,144
The one called Nanami.

908
01:43:13,229 --> 01:43:16,983
Pretty well-built but short.

909
01:43:17,734 --> 01:43:19,652
I've been wanting to talk to you.

910
01:43:20,445 --> 01:43:22,322
I got a sponsor for the next show...

911
01:43:22,447 --> 01:43:26,159
Make lots of money with shows like that.

912
01:43:26,326 --> 01:43:27,744
Oh, I understand.

913
01:43:28,661 --> 01:43:32,248
I think maybe you'd like to
help us with this?

914
01:43:32,582 --> 01:43:36,085
It's a good deal and I got it all set up.

915
01:43:36,961 --> 01:43:40,798
Can't go on selling corn-on-the-cob
all my life.

916
01:43:41,883 --> 01:43:43,716
As a pimp you'll have a good life.

917
01:43:43,801 --> 01:43:45,386
How about it?

918
01:43:45,678 --> 01:43:47,263
You can't get away.

919
01:43:48,348 --> 01:43:49,349
Stop! Stop!

920
01:43:49,766 --> 01:43:53,978
We'll get you! Stop!

921
01:45:36,539 --> 01:45:41,252
<i>And now: Laugh.
All together.</i>

922
01:46:18,331 --> 01:46:22,752
Look! All the blood!

923
01:46:23,169 --> 01:46:28,299
These kids just don't pay attention.
