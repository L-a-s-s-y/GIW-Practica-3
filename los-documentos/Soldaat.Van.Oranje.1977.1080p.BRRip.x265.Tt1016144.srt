00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Marc2008 (2009), The Netherlands
Soldaat van Oranje - Soldier of Orange (1977).avi

1
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:22,400
After five dark, anxious years
the sun breaks through.

2
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:26,600
The Dakota bringing home
Queen Wilhelmina...

3
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:29,100
...lands in a free country.

4
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:32,800
It is a stirring moment
as the door opens.

5
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:40,600
Resolute and confident,
the Queen sets foot on Dutch soil.

6
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:55,500
After a warm welcome by
civilian and military authorities...

7
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,000
...Her Majesty leaves the airport.

8
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:01,200
A jubilant nation greets
its Sovereign Queen.

9
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:07,800
Her triumphant return
to The Hague.

10
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:11,500
Highlight of these first weeks
of liberation.

11
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,900
Without pomp, accompanied
by a single aid...

12
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:18,900
...Her Majesty passes
the cheering crowds.

13
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,600
Noordeinde Palace awaits her
at the end of the route.

14
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:26,500
Once more flying
the Dutch flag.

15
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,700
Children greet her with flowers.

16
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,900
As Queen Wilhelmina arrives
at her palace...

17
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:53,100
...the realization that the House
of Orange is home again...

18
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,100
...fills the hearts
of the Dutch people with joy.

19
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,200
SOLDlER OF ORANGE

20
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:21,100
Get inside freshmen!

21
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,200
Come with me!

22
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:48,000
Climb!

23
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:52,000
Hello, I'm Jack Ten Brink, sir.

24
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:53,900
Prick, you mean.

25
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,500
- Prick, sir.
- Up, Prick!

26
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:02,700
What do you think of Hitler?

27
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:05,400
Filthy exhibitionist!

28
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:11,500
He builds good motorways.

29
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,300
Are you for or against the sod?

30
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,200
Hitler's a bloody bastard.

31
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:21,500
Let him go!

32
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:26,000
Piss off!

33
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,300
May I introduce myself?

34
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:35,900
Jack Ten Brink.

35
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,600
You might know the name.
My father's on the Council.

36
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:40,200
Two more shirkers.

37
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:41,900
I'm Jack Ten Brink.

38
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,400
- Alex.
- Eric.

39
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,800
- Were they hard on you?
- I've been here a while.

40
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:49,500
Someone made me say
Hitler is a bastard.

41
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:53,500
- Must have been a Jew.
- Can we stay here this long?

42
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,400
They have three weeks.

43
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,400
Enough time for a game of cards.

44
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,900
Freshmen to the dining room!

45
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:03,800
On your butts!

46
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,900
- Jesus, dinner time!
- The Council.

47
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:26,100
Everybody rise!

48
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,600
Down on the floor!

49
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:48,200
On your belly,
prick to the floor!

50
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:49,600
And stay down.

51
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:01,600
Sit, sit, sit. Everybody!

52
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:08,000
And eat, eat, eat!

53
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,100
Bring them here.

54
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:20,100
Filthy shirkers!

55
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:23,000
You lot are in for it!

56
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:31,500
- Shirking, were you?
- No, sir.

57
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:35,700
- Perhaps you'd rather go home?
- I'd like to stay, sir.

58
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:38,400
- Would you?
- Yes, sir.

59
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,500
Sing for us.

60
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:01,600
Hum along.

61
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,900
Off key!

62
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,500
And again.

63
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,900
Off key.

64
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:38,600
Again.

65
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:15,400
Mr. President,
this is a grave matter.

66
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,200
He's bleeding.

67
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:44,900
Hi, Eric.

68
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,000
Can you drink this yet?

69
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,600
Of course.

70
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:54,500
Hi, Esther.

71
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:59,500
I'll stay put if you don't mind.
Eight stitches.

72
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,300
- Unbelievable.
- What happened?

73
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,600
It's a long story.

74
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:07,500
- We were...
- Not now, Eric.

75
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,100
- We're off to play tennis.
- No.

76
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:12,400
Tell us.

77
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:17,800
Well, it was the first evening...

78
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:29,600
- Hello, ma'am.
- Good morning.

79
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:32,800
...puts it on my head
and starts hitting it.

80
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:34,700
Wham, wham...

81
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,300
...and I kept singing.

82
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:41,500
Eric, you have a visitor.

83
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,900
The President.

84
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:46,600
Don't get up, Lanshof.
Your head after all.

85
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,800
Just a few stitches.

86
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:52,800
Telling your young friends
about university life?

87
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,100
- Well...
- I'd like a chat with you, Lanshof.

88
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,300
Please sit down, sir.
You were off!

89
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,200
Are you coming?

90
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:09,400
My apologies for last night.
It was uncalled for.

91
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,700
It was nothing...

92
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:13,000
It was my fault. Is that beer?

93
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,900
Would you like some?

94
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,700
I intend to look after you.

95
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:22,400
There's a vacant room
at my place. Want it?

96
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:23,900
Yes, thank you.

97
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,400
Your health, Lanshof.

98
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:30,600
Your health, sir.

99
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:39,400
- Call me Gus in the future.
- Right, sir.

100
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,100
Prick.

101
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:51,900
Thanks.

102
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:56,700
- Good, I'll copy them.
- You should attend lectures.

103
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,200
Mr. Particular.
You sound like my mother.

104
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:04,200
- I missed you today.
- I was boxing.

105
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:07,400
- Eric's at home.
- I don't blame him.

106
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,400
Shall we go up for a drink?

107
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,900
Let's surprise him.

108
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,600
On my shoulders.

109
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:21,200
Nico? Or are you afraid?

110
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:24,500
No.

111
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,100
Come along with us.

112
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,400
How's the sherry?

113
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:39,900
Disgusting.

114
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,400
- I've got something stronger.
- Nice.

115
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,000
Give us a hand.

116
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,400
Alex!

117
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:49,800
Pull!

118
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:55,700
- Gus might like a drink too.
- Call him, will you?

119
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,500
Gus!

120
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:01,700
Who's slinking about?
Professor Ten Brink.

121
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:05,500
I don't slink.
I was at Professor Teilders.

122
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,700
A prelim.

123
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:12,900
I passed!

124
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,100
A present...

125
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,300
...from my old man.

126
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,600
- That's a good one.
- A Leica.

127
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:23,900
German.

128
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,700
Excellent make.

129
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:30,000
- Want some?
- No, coffee. I'm in training.

130
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:32,400
I'll order some.

131
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:35,000
- One coffee!
- Hello, chaps.

132
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:39,200
- A drink?
- Please, one.

133
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:42,000
Take my chair.

134
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:50,600
- How's your love life?
- I can't keep the landlady off me.

135
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,400
- Good looking?
- A figure...

136
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,700
One coffee.

137
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:58,900
For this gentleman, Greta.

138
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,300
We'll take a photo.
Move closer together.

139
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:07,100
I'm going to Germany for
a few weeks. Like to come?

140
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:10,500
No way. Trainloads of Jews
arrive here every day.

141
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,600
- I don't like swimming upstream.
- Cut it out, will you?

142
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:16,700
Don't move.

143
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,900
Sit still. Watch the birdie.

144
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:26,400
It's coming!

145
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,800
As the nun said to the bishop.

146
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,900
Glass, glass!

147
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:33,100
Four, three...

148
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,200
...two, one...

149
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:36,800
Your health!

150
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:04,100
- Eric's good.
- You're better.

151
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,700
- Yes, at tennis.
- You should've played.

152
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,100
Guard duty.

153
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,600
Shut up!

154
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,100
Gus is a poor loser.

155
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,900
War!

156
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,700
- Jesus, war.
- Oh, the English...

157
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,000
We'll be neutral, as usual.

158
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:59,200
Don't be so damn stupid.

159
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:03,000
- What's with him?
- He's a Jew.

160
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:06,000
- I never noticed.
- Prick.

161
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:08,600
- What was the score?
- Deuce.

162
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,500
Come on, Nico.

163
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,500
Turn off the radio, Robby.

164
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,100
Pencil!

165
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,300
Look, he can write.

166
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,400
May 9th...

167
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:37,200
... 1940.

168
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:07,800
What's the time?

169
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,800
- How's the army?
- A lot of wimps.

170
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,600
We could beat the Papuans.

171
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,400
Nothing will happen.

172
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,600
Do you mind?

173
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:30,100
Yes. A spot of war
would be quite exciting.

174
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,600
Gentlemen, it's time.

175
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:39,800
Robby!

176
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:44,600
We must be off.

177
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:46,900
Nico will take us to the station.

178
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,600
Mr. Particular.

179
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:54,300
Coming with us?

180
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:59,200
She wants to stay.
We'll get her home. Right, Eric?

181
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:01,600
- No problem.
- Well, Es?

182
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,700
I'd like to stay a while.

183
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,400
We'll show you out.

184
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,100
See you next week.

185
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:15,900
Let's get going, Robby!

186
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:19,200
Off we go!

187
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,600
Bye, darling.

188
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,200
Why aren't you in the army?

189
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:40,700
Bad eyes. Everything's
fuzzy at a distance.

190
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:45,000
But close up I see
everything, perfectly.

191
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:48,700
Robby and I are getting
engaged next year.

192
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:54,500
Congratulations.

193
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,300
- Lucky devil.
- Who?

194
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,700
Both of you.
Want to dance?

195
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,400
Airplanes.

196
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:58,800
Are they ours?

197
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,600
We don't have that many.

198
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:05,200
Jerries.

199
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,300
Going to England.

200
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:58,500
Stop!
What do you want?

201
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:02,000
- We've come to volunteer.
- You must be mad!

202
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:05,400
- They're Jerries in disguise.
- We're Dutch.

203
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:08,700
Have them say 'sch'.
Germans can't pronounce it.

204
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:10,600
Scheveningen. Scheveningen!

205
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,900
Schele, schoonmoeder,
Scheveningen.

206
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,900
Let them through.

207
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:43,000
Eric, here.

208
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,400
We've come to volunteer.

209
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:55,500
Come back in ten days.

210
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:58,400
Officials!
We want to help.

211
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:01,700
Come back in ten days.

212
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:04,000
Ten days is quite reasonable.

213
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:07,300
- lt'll be over by then!
- The last war lasted 4 years.

214
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:11,000
Come back in ten days.

215
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,100
Come on.

216
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,000
Come on, Eric.

217
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:46,400
- See you in ten days!
- Or sooner!

218
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,900
Been to a party, have you?

219
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,000
Yes, a party.

220
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:19,300
With schnapps and women?

221
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,900
Let's pay and go.

222
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,400
A tip even. Decent of them.

223
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:59,700
A fifteen minute rest!

224
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,300
Lieutenant.

225
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:08,400
- My folks live here, may I visit them?
- Go ahead.

226
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:29,800
Come in.

227
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:35,000
- You can shoot the lot of them.
- The damn traitors.

228
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,300
Dirty fascist.

229
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:44,500
- Hello, Mother.
- Hello, Son.

230
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:51,000
Bunch of idiots.

231
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:56,400
Just because your mother's German.
Stupid. Stupid!

232
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:59,100
They think they can defeat Germany.

233
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:03,000
They'll pay when we get out.
The lot of them.

234
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:04,400
And how.

235
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,200
- You don't have it so bad.
- We'll see.

236
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:12,800
Did you hear about the Queen?
She fled to England.

237
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:15,100
And you have to fight.

238
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:26,500
German paratroopers!

239
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,100
Behind those wooden shacks.

240
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:32,700
- What's up?
- Paratroopers.

241
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,100
Look, there.

242
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:39,100
Check it out.

243
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,500
Cover us.

244
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:58,700
Wounded.

245
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:10,900
Jesus, what are you up to?
There's a war on.

246
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:12,600
So what?

247
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,500
April fool!

248
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,800
That's Dirk.
There's a madhouse nearby.

249
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:24,600
I fooled you! April fool!

250
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:38,400
Attention! Salute!

251
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:43,700
What's going on?

252
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:46,300
False alarm about paratroopers,
General.

253
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:50,400
The war is over.
Rotterdam's been flattened.

254
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:53,800
Thousands of casualties.
We've surrendered.

255
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,700
Surrendered...

256
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:58,700
- But it just started.
- It's over.

257
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:02,200
The politicians and collaborators
betrayed us.

258
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:06,700
But it's not our fault.
Holland can be proud of its army.

259
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:09,500
Men, I thank you!

260
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:15,600
Now what?

261
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:23,800
Line up!

262
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:26,300
In position.

263
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:28,100
Put it down.

264
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,700
In the water.

265
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:31,900
Go!

266
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:42,300
Come back, that's dangerous.

267
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:47,000
Do you want some more sand?

268
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:52,100
- Jerry slut.
- Mommy's boy.

269
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:54,900
You're attracting attention.

270
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,000
It's free.

271
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:03,600
There's Eric.

272
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:20,100
Outboard motor.

273
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,500
Gasoline.

274
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,000
Put some in.

275
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,600
- The forecast?
- Calm sea.

276
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,400
Good, or I'll puke my guts out.

277
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:35,400
Sure stinks.
Hope the Jerries don't smell it.

278
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,600
Screw it on tight.

279
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:50,800
Stand still.

280
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:55,500
Hey, bastards!

281
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:00,700
Fine little boat.

282
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:07,400
Sherry from Pa, cheese from
my mother for the trip.

283
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:10,600
- Got the charts?
- Couldn't get them.

284
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,300
You said you would.

285
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:16,100
There's only one England
and it's there.

286
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:18,100
No, it's there.

287
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:21,700
Why aren't you coming?

288
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:25,100
Someone's got to do
the dirty work here.

289
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,000
You're just afraid.

290
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:28,900
Let's leave it at that then.

291
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,100
Your health.

292
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:36,900
Celebrating something?

293
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:38,300
Alex!

294
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:43,500
- How about a swim?
- Good idea.

295
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:58,600
Haven't seen much of you lately.

296
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:05,200
At home. My parents
have had a tough time.

297
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:08,600
Who hasn't?

298
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:15,000
Call in some time.

299
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,300
Alex, I like you, but visiting
your parents is a bit much.

300
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:29,700
I'll see you around.

301
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:38,900
That's all we needed.

302
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:42,600
- The dirty fascist.
- Alex is a fine fellow.

303
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:45,500
- I smell petrol.
- What time do we leave?

304
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,300
The beach will be deserted
in an hour.

305
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:50,600
In two days we'll be in London.

306
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:52,000
Knock on wood.

307
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:55,800
- It's a sturdy boat.
- One leak and you've had it.

308
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:57,600
What can go wrong?

309
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:16,700
The petrol!

310
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:21,300
Let's get out of here!

311
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,200
Hello, Robby.

312
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:51,300
How about that Robby?
Hangs the wash for his mother.

313
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:14,200
You'll ask the English
to come and get me?

314
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:19,900
- Is that it?
- In code.

315
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,500
- Really?
- Yes!

316
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:30,400
I can hardly signal:
'Will London come for Mr. Lanshof?'

317
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,600
lsn't it dangerous?

318
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:42,900
If I keep it brief...

319
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,800
...the Jerries can't locate it.

320
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:48,500
We hope.

321
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:10,800
- A potentiometer.
- Want to measure my potency?

322
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,400
Good morning.

323
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:42,600
I'll make contact.

324
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,900
- How do they know it's you?
- I use a code.

325
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:51,500
I always begin with L-O-V-E.

326
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:52,600
Love.

327
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,500
Guess why.

328
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Go!

329
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:43,500
She's on to something.

330
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,400
It stopped.

331
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:02,000
- Well?
- You can go.

332
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:05,100
- As a courier.
- Meaning?

333
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:08,000
Getting stuff from my group across.

334
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:09,900
That's fantastic.

335
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:11,900
When?

336
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:14,400
I'll let you know.

337
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:19,900
lmagine, me helping you!

338
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:26,600
Not a big area.

339
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:29,900
Next time he transmits...

340
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:32,000
...he hangs.

341
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:37,000
You seem to be very happy.

342
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:44,000
Did you tell Eric
about our engagement?

343
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:46,400
That's why you're
called LOVE.

344
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:49,700
- It's a tennis term.
- What are you talking about?

345
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:52,900
It's the best news
I've heard in years.

346
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:56,800
Let me know.

347
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:12,400
UNlVERSlTY EXCLUDES JEWS
Read Volk en Vaderland.

348
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:14,100
Volk en Vaderland!

349
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,500
Hey, look...

350
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:29,300
UNlVERSlTY EXCLUDES JEWS

351
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:31,900
Read Volk en Vaderland!

352
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:40,900
- Here, we'll give you a hand.
- Thanks, I can manage.

353
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,200
We're here to help one another.

354
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:45,600
We've got nothing against Jews.

355
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:48,600
That's fine, thank you.

356
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:50,600
No, we're not finished.

357
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:54,200
Do you have accident insurance?

358
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:11,300
You shouldn't have
got in our way.

359
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,900
Just an accident...
Send the bill to Hitler.

360
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:20,600
What are you staring at?
It was an accident.

361
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:23,300
Cheer up.
It could happen to anyone.

362
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:31,100
Get those things out
of the water.

363
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,500
- I suppose you're a Jew too?
- Yes!

364
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:47,100
I'll kill you, you bastard.
I'll kill you.

365
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:50,800
Don't be so stupid!

366
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:01,400
lnside!

367
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:06,800
You'll get yourself in trouble.

368
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:09,900
- I won't let them do it.
- Go out the back way.

369
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,900
All the Jewish professors
have to leave the university.

370
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,000
Yes, I heard.

371
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:17,500
First the professors,
then the students.

372
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:21,800
All the Jews will be
in the Polish salt mines soon.

373
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:35,000
Student boxing champ
and nowhere to go.

374
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:44,700
You can go to England
instead of me.

375
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:53,200
How? When?

376
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:56,900
You'll hear from me.

377
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:29,100
Robby's expecting me.

378
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:42,200
What's John doing here?

379
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:45,400
He's taking my place.

380
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:48,200
What kind of madness is this?

381
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:53,400
Robby, the Jerries
don't like Jews.

382
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:56,000
I could've sent Esther.

383
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:59,400
Yes, you could have.

384
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:05,300
Come on, we can't stay here.

385
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:34,800
There it is.

386
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:39,900
To the boat!

387
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:47,200
We'll meet again.

388
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:49,000
- In London.
- Hurry up!

389
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:03,500
See that you get this
to London.

390
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:48,800
Jerries!

391
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:03,400
Robby!

392
00:43:55,100 --> 00:43:58,100
I'm stiff from the long trip.

393
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:00,100
The young one first.

394
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:05,300
Come along.

395
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:09,600
- Good morning.
- Morning.

396
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:14,800
- I'm sure you'd like some coffee.
- Smells good.

397
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:17,300
Uncuff him.

398
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:29,800
- Here you are.
- Thank you.

399
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:33,900
Would you like a cup too?

400
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:39,500
You seem surprised.
We've provided for you.

401
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:42,700
Sugar?

402
00:44:47,900 --> 00:44:49,800
Don't I get anything with it?

403
00:44:49,900 --> 00:44:52,300
With your second cup.

404
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:57,000
Egyptian cigarettes...

405
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:01,000
...but quite good. Take one, please.

406
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:10,100
I suppose you were expecting
English ones this morning.

407
00:45:16,700 --> 00:45:20,400
Mr. Weinberg, you realize...

408
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:24,100
...we want some information from you.

409
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:25,900
I know nothing.

410
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:32,900
I was going to England to fight.

411
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:35,100
The war is over.

412
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:38,300
- Not for me.
- Yes, it is.

413
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:41,700
People died today.

414
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:45,800
Remain silent and more will die.

415
00:45:47,300 --> 00:45:49,300
I don't know any of them.

416
00:45:52,900 --> 00:45:54,200
Too bad.

417
00:45:55,100 --> 00:45:57,000
Then I'll see...

418
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:03,200
...if those papers are dry yet.

419
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:22,400
Up!

420
00:46:25,300 --> 00:46:29,100
The English don't send planes
for no reason.

421
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:33,100
Who or what did they come for?

422
00:46:34,100 --> 00:46:35,500
I know nothing.

423
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:37,800
You know nothing, do you?

424
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:49,400
You're tough, aren't you?

425
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:52,600
Boxer's muscles.

426
00:46:53,700 --> 00:46:55,000
Turn him round.

427
00:46:55,900 --> 00:46:58,900
Do you have muscles
on your kidneys?

428
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:07,900
Enough, Breitner!

429
00:47:09,700 --> 00:47:12,700
We don't work like that.
Have you gone mad?

430
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:16,200
My dear boy, I'm sorry.

431
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:17,700
Sit down.

432
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:23,900
Drink the rest of your coffee.

433
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:30,500
Drink.

434
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:33,800
Just tell me what you know.

435
00:47:33,900 --> 00:47:39,600
Today's affair didn't happen
by accident.

436
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:43,200
I wonder who let the cat
out of the bag.

437
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:47,000
The information...

438
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:50,500
...could only have come
from London.

439
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:55,800
Van der Zanden.
Do you know this person?

440
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:58,700
Van der Zanden...

441
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:03,400
He's our contact in London.

442
00:48:04,700 --> 00:48:05,900
That's not true.

443
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:09,900
It's an open secret.

444
00:48:10,900 --> 00:48:13,800
It's all for nothing, anyway.

445
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:18,000
I suggest you talk.

446
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:21,700
Talk!

447
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:26,300
That's your trick.
Butter up a person...

448
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:27,800
...and then beat him.

449
00:48:28,700 --> 00:48:30,100
I know nothing.

450
00:48:34,100 --> 00:48:37,800
Breitner will continue
working on your case.

451
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:03,200
Speak up! Who was there?

452
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:13,000
Tell me their names!

453
00:49:13,300 --> 00:49:15,900
I don't know, I don't know.

454
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:23,500
Sorry about that.

455
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:27,900
Tell me what happened.

456
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:32,100
We tried to get John over
to England, by plane.

457
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:34,500
The big time.

458
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:39,500
- But it went wrong, totally.
- What a pity.

459
00:49:39,900 --> 00:49:41,300
They got John.

If he talks, I'll hang.

Amateurs.

463
00:49:53,700 --> 00:49:57,500
Smirking, well-fed prick.
I'll hang.

464
00:49:57,600 --> 00:49:59,500
So you come to me?

465
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,400
Gus, I need a place to hide.

466
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:06,000
Catch.

467
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:07,800
Key...

468
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:11,400

Stay as long as you like.

472
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:23,700
You'll be safe at my place.

473
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,000
Hello.

474
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:33,800
Any around?

475
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:38,000
Up there.
It's teeming with them.

476
00:50:38,700 --> 00:50:40,400
They're migrating.

477
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,700
A beautiful sight.

478
00:50:47,100 --> 00:50:49,400
I'll try to get a bit closer.

479
00:50:51,900 --> 00:50:52,900
Bye.

480
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:17,600
Is that him?

481
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:21,500
- And he's not after the birds.
- Thanks.

482
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:22,700
My money.

483
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:28,100
You're a good patriot.

484
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:30,700
- Is that all?
- It's the rate.

485
00:51:32,100 --> 00:51:34,000
Well, if it's the rate...

486
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:07,600
Two beers.

487
00:52:17,700 --> 00:52:19,800
You look pleased with yourself.

488
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:24,600
Will you take these to Nico?

489
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:27,000
Sure.

What are you up to?

492
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:46,300
Be more careful.

493
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:50,600
Scared? Your health.

494
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:53,800
Your health.

495
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:02,800
Let me go! Too late!

496
00:53:15,900 --> 00:53:17,000
Take them away.

497
00:53:21,900 --> 00:53:25,100
Let me go!
It's nothing to do with me.

498
00:53:30,700 --> 00:53:33,000
- They must have followed me.
- Nonsense.

499
00:53:33,100 --> 00:53:36,300
- Shit. Why me?
- Risky business.

00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:38,000
I hope I don't talk.

501
00:53:38,100 --> 00:53:39,600
- Try to escape.
- How?

502
00:53:39,900 --> 00:53:41,700
No talking.

503
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:56,800
Stop!

504
00:56:18,100 --> 00:56:21,600
'The traitor is Van der Zanden
in London'

505
00:58:32,500 --> 00:58:33,600
Come with me.

506
00:58:42,700 --> 00:58:45,400
On toilet paper!

507
00:58:49,900 --> 00:58:52,200
- You're Lanshof?
- Yes.

508
00:58:53,600 --> 00:58:55,200
'Yes, sir.'

509
00:58:55,900 --> 00:58:59,000
I'll be courteous when you are.

510
00:59:03,300 --> 00:59:05,100
Did you write this?

511
00:59:09,500 --> 00:59:11,400
Yes, sir.

512
00:59:11,500 --> 00:59:13,900
What did you write it with?

513
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
With shit, sir.

514
00:59:16,700 --> 00:59:18,300
You must be mad.

515
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:25,100
This is no way
to apply for release.

516
00:59:26,300 --> 00:59:28,900
Perhaps I didn't have a pencil.

517
00:59:31,900 --> 00:59:34,800
Next time I'll have you shot.

518
00:59:36,300 --> 00:59:37,700
You may go.

519
00:59:38,900 --> 00:59:39,800
Where?

520
00:59:40,100 --> 00:59:41,100
Home.

521
00:59:52,100 --> 00:59:56,000
- You can't just let him go.
- I'm not.

522
00:59:56,100 --> 00:59:58,600
He'll be followed.

523
00:59:58,900 --> 01:00:01,400
Bait? A lure.

524
01:00:01,500 --> 01:00:02,500
Exactly.

525
01:00:02,900 --> 01:00:07,400
He might try to get in touch
with the resistance.

526
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:12,400
- Then you'll have new guests.
- We have the space.

527
01:00:12,600 --> 01:00:16,400
Here, or in the dunes.

528
01:00:17,800 --> 01:00:21,800
I'll leave it to you,
Obersturmfuhrer. Goodbye.

529
01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:43,200
Hello. Come in.

530
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:50,000
Let me take your coat.

531
01:00:56,400 --> 01:00:59,700
- It's a wonder you're home.
- That's for sure.

532
01:01:07,600 --> 01:01:10,800
I stopped by a few times,
but you were always out.

533
01:01:11,800 --> 01:01:15,000
- I'm back now.
- Yes, so I see.

534
01:01:15,900 --> 01:01:16,900
Sit down.

535
01:01:18,900 --> 01:01:20,700
It's a bit of a mess.

536
01:01:22,600 --> 01:01:24,200
I was working.

537
01:01:25,700 --> 01:01:28,300
- Tea?
- No, I don't have much time.

538
01:01:28,700 --> 01:01:29,900
No need.

539
01:01:31,100 --> 01:01:32,700
Robby is back.

540
01:01:34,800 --> 01:01:37,000
Has he been away?

541
01:01:37,500 --> 01:01:42,200
You know quite well.
He told me about the plane.

542
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:46,900
We can stop pretending now.

543
01:01:48,600 --> 01:01:51,300
Yes. Where is he?

544
01:01:51,800 --> 01:01:54,700
In The Hague.
He wants to talk to you.

545
01:01:58,600 --> 01:01:59,700
Come here.

546
01:02:05,600 --> 01:02:07,200
See that man?

547
01:02:09,300 --> 01:02:11,300
He tails me wherever I go.

548
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:14,400
Security Police.

549
01:02:15,300 --> 01:02:18,300
- Robby wants to see you.
- lmpossible.

550
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:21,100
They'd grab him too.

551
01:04:01,300 --> 01:04:02,200
Alex!

552
01:04:22,700 --> 01:04:24,600
A friend of yours?

553
01:04:25,800 --> 01:04:28,100
Yes, and so what?

554
01:04:34,200 --> 01:04:38,400
Bloody bastards.
And they call themselves Dutchmen.

555
01:04:39,900 --> 01:04:41,700
How have you been?

556
01:04:42,300 --> 01:04:43,900
It was touch and go.

557
01:04:44,700 --> 01:04:48,500
That vet had quite a go at me
on the kitchen table.

558
01:04:48,700 --> 01:04:50,200
Decent chap, though.

559
01:04:51,700 --> 01:04:54,600
My transmitter is operating again.

560
01:04:55,500 --> 01:04:57,100
Join us, Eric.

561
01:04:59,400 --> 01:05:01,000
John is dead.

562
01:05:04,300 --> 01:05:06,400
I've lost the taste for it.

563
01:05:08,100 --> 01:05:09,400
You're scared.

564
01:05:11,400 --> 01:05:14,600
We were betrayed by someone
called Van der Zanden.

565
01:05:14,900 --> 01:05:17,300
- How do you know?
- John told me.

566
01:05:17,600 --> 01:05:19,800
And he's in London.

567
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,200
We have to pass that on, Eric.

568
01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:24,400
Go ahead.

569
01:05:30,300 --> 01:05:33,100
- You really disappoint me.
- Too bad.

570
01:05:33,500 --> 01:05:36,200
- I'm being watched.
- Probably.

571
01:05:36,800 --> 01:05:38,900
I'm a threat to everyone.

572
01:05:39,100 --> 01:05:40,800
We'll decide that.

573
01:05:43,100 --> 01:05:45,000
I'll decide for myself.

574
01:06:02,800 --> 01:06:04,300
Did you see Robby?

575
01:06:07,100 --> 01:06:09,500
Then we can open the curtains again.

576
01:06:10,900 --> 01:06:11,900
Fine.

577
01:06:12,700 --> 01:06:15,100
That chap must be wondering...

578
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:17,000
Let him.

579
01:06:21,500 --> 01:06:22,600
Exciting?

580
01:06:24,300 --> 01:06:25,800
It's a boy's book.

581
01:06:30,600 --> 01:06:32,100
I'll be off then.

582
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,600
The curtains were a good idea.

583
01:06:37,300 --> 01:06:38,900
The things you think of.

584
01:06:44,900 --> 01:06:47,000
Here, your shoes.

585
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:02,900
Are you sure about this?

586
01:07:05,600 --> 01:07:07,300
I want it to happen.

587
01:07:34,500 --> 01:07:35,500
Sir...

588
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,900
Do you know where
Victoria Street is?

589
01:07:41,700 --> 01:07:44,500
If you turn left there...

590
01:07:44,700 --> 01:07:47,500
...you come to a square...

591
01:07:47,600 --> 01:07:49,800
...then you turn right...

592
01:07:51,700 --> 01:07:52,700
Come along.

593
01:07:58,800 --> 01:08:00,100
Good day.

594
01:08:03,700 --> 01:08:07,000
My compliments.
It wasn't easy to find you.

595
01:08:07,800 --> 01:08:10,900
- What do you mean?
- Your transmitter.

596
01:08:11,100 --> 01:08:14,200
It's on the garden shed there, isn't it?

597
01:08:17,100 --> 01:08:19,600
- Do you smoke?
- No.

598
01:08:20,200 --> 01:08:22,200
Do you mind if I do?

599
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:24,700
Thank you.

600
01:08:26,200 --> 01:08:28,200
I have a proposition.

601
01:08:28,600 --> 01:08:33,100
Would you work for us in the future?

602
01:08:33,200 --> 01:08:34,200
No!

603
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:39,000
Look.

604
01:08:48,100 --> 01:08:49,700
Your fiance I believe?

605
01:08:51,400 --> 01:08:54,000
I saw her at Lanshof's.

606
01:08:57,600 --> 01:08:59,300
She looks Jewish.

607
01:08:59,400 --> 01:09:04,100
Jewish. She'll go to
a Polish labor camp.

608
01:09:05,300 --> 01:09:07,800
Not so good for the health.

609
01:09:08,700 --> 01:09:10,200
Many people die there.

610
01:09:15,800 --> 01:09:17,000
Let's go.

611
01:09:29,300 --> 01:09:34,100
Won't you reconsider working for us?

612
01:09:53,300 --> 01:09:54,500
Graduated?

613
01:09:55,300 --> 01:09:56,300
Yes.

614
01:09:56,400 --> 01:10:00,300
Congratulations, Eric!
You're the first from our year.

615
01:10:00,400 --> 01:10:03,800
- I thought it would be you.
- I can't get finished.

616
01:10:03,900 --> 01:10:06,400
Better hurry.
The university is closing.

617
01:10:06,500 --> 01:10:08,000
Damn Jerries.

618
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:12,300
I've heard some
odd stories about you.

619
01:10:12,700 --> 01:10:14,100
The resistance?

620
01:10:15,500 --> 01:10:17,100
All over and done with.

621
01:10:17,800 --> 01:10:22,100
I'm happy to hear it, Eric.
We must consider the future.

622
01:10:22,300 --> 01:10:23,800
Let's go for a drink.

623
01:10:28,200 --> 01:10:31,800
Degrees will count again
after the war.

624
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:36,800
There's Robby's fiance!

625
01:10:37,300 --> 01:10:38,600
How nice.

626
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:40,200
I graduated!

627
01:10:40,400 --> 01:10:41,800
Congratulations.

628
01:10:43,400 --> 01:10:44,700
Flowers for you.

629
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:47,900
Come for a drink with us.

630
01:10:51,600 --> 01:10:53,000
Wait for me.

631
01:11:03,100 --> 01:11:04,400
There they are.

632
01:11:08,200 --> 01:11:10,200
Two gins. One with lemon.

633
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:17,500
So, a lawyer...
What are your plans?

634
01:11:17,700 --> 01:11:20,400
- Take a holiday.
- On the Riviera.

635
01:11:22,500 --> 01:11:25,000
That's impossible with the war on.

636
01:11:25,100 --> 01:11:27,300
Jack, you're so wonderfully naive.

637
01:11:29,400 --> 01:11:31,900
- Where are you going?
- To the bathroom.

638
01:11:38,600 --> 01:11:39,600
Nico.

639
01:11:42,400 --> 01:11:43,900
They're after you.

640
01:11:44,600 --> 01:11:46,000
You're telling me.

641
01:11:47,700 --> 01:11:49,700
Still want to go to England?

642
01:11:50,100 --> 01:11:51,400
Are you joking?

643
01:11:52,100 --> 01:11:56,000
There's a Swiss ship sailing
tomorrow. They'll take you.

644
01:11:58,900 --> 01:11:59,900
Is it safe?

645
01:12:01,300 --> 01:12:02,600
It's a chance.

646
01:12:03,700 --> 01:12:04,900
Nice of you.

647
01:12:05,700 --> 01:12:07,500
You're putting us in danger.

648
01:12:11,600 --> 01:12:13,100
Here are your papers.

649
01:12:14,700 --> 01:12:16,700
Your name's Jean de Kuyper.

650
01:12:19,700 --> 01:12:20,600
Here.

651
01:12:21,900 --> 01:12:24,400
Shake it.
We didn't rent this bathroom.

652
01:12:40,500 --> 01:12:42,300
I'm disappearing for a bit.

653
01:13:20,400 --> 01:13:22,000
We've got visitors.

654
01:13:22,600 --> 01:13:26,000
- Your Gestapo.
- This might take a while.

655
01:13:26,100 --> 01:13:27,500
Have another drink.

656
01:13:28,100 --> 01:13:31,200
- Real Dutch gin.
- Prewar.

657
01:13:35,100 --> 01:13:37,500
Lt. Thelen, Security Police.

658
01:13:37,600 --> 01:13:41,900
Polzer, ship's captain.
Two gentlemen from the Greek navy.

659
01:13:44,300 --> 01:13:46,500
- A drink?
- No.

660
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:51,500
You've taken on a Dutch crew.
We'd like to investigate.

661
01:13:51,900 --> 01:13:53,600
They're not here yet.

662
01:13:54,200 --> 01:13:56,600
But you're sailing in half an hour.

663
01:13:56,800 --> 01:13:59,900
That's right.
In 28 minutes.

664
01:14:00,300 --> 01:14:05,800
You can't sail until
we've seen the entire crew.

665
01:14:05,900 --> 01:14:08,200
That's for us to decide.

666
01:14:11,300 --> 01:14:14,000
- Where are they?
- One moment.

667
01:14:14,900 --> 01:14:15,900
Come with me.

668
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:19,100
There.

669
01:14:30,200 --> 01:14:32,700
Cordon it all off.

670
01:14:35,600 --> 01:14:39,200
Man both ends of the gangway!
Nobody goes aboard!

671
01:14:43,300 --> 01:14:44,400
Attention!

672
01:14:45,800 --> 01:14:48,000
- This is an investigation.
- Jerries!

673
01:14:54,100 --> 01:14:56,500
Stop! That will do.

674
01:15:00,700 --> 01:15:02,000
Murderers!

675
01:15:07,200 --> 01:15:09,700
A net, lads. Before he falls!

676
01:15:17,800 --> 01:15:20,000
Hello, Captain. Hello, Mr. Snooper.

677
01:15:20,200 --> 01:15:23,400
You're drunk. Blind drunk.

678
01:15:23,500 --> 01:15:24,700
What did he say?

679
01:15:25,500 --> 01:15:27,100
You're drunk!

680
01:15:27,400 --> 01:15:30,700
Right! When do we sail, guv?

681
01:15:31,900 --> 01:15:33,500
Nobody comes aboard!

682
01:15:34,500 --> 01:15:36,400
What? Nobody?

683
01:15:36,500 --> 01:15:38,300
Nobody!

684
01:15:41,300 --> 01:15:46,600
We're not allowed on board!
Back to the pub!

685
01:15:46,900 --> 01:15:48,200
Lower away!

686
01:15:57,200 --> 01:15:59,700
Get away from my car!

687
01:15:59,900 --> 01:16:01,900
Get out of it!

688
01:16:06,300 --> 01:16:08,700
Filthy pigs!

689
01:16:09,700 --> 01:16:14,400
That will do.
Have them come aboard at once.

690
01:16:14,500 --> 01:16:17,700
No, I'm fully authorized
to have them locked up.

691
01:16:18,500 --> 01:16:19,900
They're having a row.

692
01:16:21,500 --> 01:16:25,000
The navy will decide this,
Herr Lieutenant.

693
01:16:27,400 --> 01:16:28,800
Let them board.

694
01:16:30,300 --> 01:16:32,000
Come aboard!

695
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:39,900
Form two lines!

696
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:42,100
Music!

697
01:16:51,800 --> 01:16:53,600
Attention!

698
01:16:53,900 --> 01:16:56,200
Salute!

699
01:17:35,700 --> 01:17:37,500
You're sober?

700
01:17:37,900 --> 01:17:39,800
To the stokehold.

701
01:17:40,100 --> 01:17:43,100
We must put to sea before they
change their minds.

702
01:17:44,300 --> 01:17:45,500
Ready, sir.

703
01:18:59,900 --> 01:19:00,900
Eric.

704
01:19:04,500 --> 01:19:05,900
We're on our way.

705
01:19:10,900 --> 01:19:12,400
Gus. Well, I'll be...

706
01:19:22,600 --> 01:19:24,700
We're on our way!

707
01:19:32,200 --> 01:19:35,800
- How did you get here?
- Nico. And you?

708
01:19:36,600 --> 01:19:37,700
Me too.

709
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:39,800
Mr. Particular.

122
01:19:55,000 --> 01:20:08,000
lntermission, 99 sec

123
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:18,000

01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:38,000
lntermission, 10 sec

711
01:21:43,600 --> 01:21:44,700
Seasick?

712
01:21:47,400 --> 01:21:49,200
We're sailing due north.

713
01:21:49,500 --> 01:21:52,100
Nico said it was heading for Russia.

714
01:21:52,600 --> 01:21:54,800
We'll have tea with Stalin.

715
01:22:01,600 --> 01:22:02,700
What's that?

716
01:22:03,200 --> 01:22:04,400
A battleship.

717
01:22:09,100 --> 01:22:11,200
- German?
- I can't bloody tell.

718
01:22:19,600 --> 01:22:21,100
English!

719
01:22:21,400 --> 01:22:23,200
Wait, I'm coming too!

720
01:22:26,300 --> 01:22:28,000
Goodbye, Captain!

721
01:23:35,700 --> 01:23:39,000
- Bloody awful here.
- It won't take long.

722
01:23:39,100 --> 01:23:41,700
The only English I know is
'fuck you'.

723
01:23:41,800 --> 01:23:43,000
Hi, love.

724
01:23:43,400 --> 01:23:47,500
- We're going to fly, with the RAF.
- Are you crazy?

725
01:23:47,800 --> 01:23:50,900
- And you?
- The army. More peaceful.

726
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:52,600
If you get a nice uniform...

727
01:26:20,300 --> 01:26:21,400
Mr. Lanshof?

728
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:26,100
Congratulations.
A daring bit of work, your escape.

729
01:26:26,400 --> 01:26:28,900
Not really.
We could get a ship.

730
01:26:29,400 --> 01:26:31,100
Not so modest.

731
01:26:31,400 --> 01:26:33,200
You're one of 50...

732
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:37,600
...49 to make it over from
Holland alive.

733
01:26:38,100 --> 01:26:41,600
Come straight to the Queen
when you've finished here.

734
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,300
We cherish our freedom fighters.

735
01:26:47,500 --> 01:26:51,500
I'll arrange the audience.
Ask for General Van de Zanden.

736
01:29:34,300 --> 01:29:36,100
You'd better give that to me.

737
01:29:42,400 --> 01:29:43,600
Come along.

738
01:29:44,500 --> 01:29:46,700
You've read too many thrillers.

739
01:29:46,800 --> 01:29:48,600
I can manage from here on.

740
01:29:49,800 --> 01:29:51,800
But you lack training.

741
01:29:54,700 --> 01:29:55,900
Next time better.

742
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:59,600
That would certainly
please the Germans.

743
01:30:05,800 --> 01:30:08,100
Eric! Come and join us.

744
01:30:08,200 --> 01:30:11,100
- What's going on?
- We'll have a cup of tea...

745
01:30:11,200 --> 01:30:13,300
...and then we'll have a chat.

746
01:30:14,900 --> 01:30:16,400
Aren't you Mr. Lanshof?

747
01:30:17,600 --> 01:30:20,700
You may take off your coat
and sit down.

748
01:30:24,400 --> 01:30:25,900
I'll take this.

749
01:30:30,200 --> 01:30:33,100
No, that's where Her Majesty sits.

750
01:30:34,900 --> 01:30:38,300
- Odd way to come in.
- He couldn't find the front door.

751
01:30:39,300 --> 01:30:41,300
That's a nice uniform...

752
01:30:41,400 --> 01:30:44,100
- I'm starving.
- Eat, Willem.

753
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:47,900
Ma'am, what do I call her?

754
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:51,200
You call her 'Your Majesty'.

755
01:30:52,900 --> 01:30:55,900
- Is it 'Her' or 'Your'?
- 'Your'.

756
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:58,100
It's 'Your'.

757
01:30:58,500 --> 01:31:02,200
- No smoking in her presence.
- I hear she's strict.

758
01:31:02,300 --> 01:31:04,300
- Not overly.
- There she is.

759
01:31:18,900 --> 01:31:20,300
I bid you welcome.

760
01:31:20,900 --> 01:31:23,400
You are my link with Holland.

761
01:31:24,600 --> 01:31:26,500
Your Majesty, may I present:

762
01:31:27,400 --> 01:31:29,000
Will Dostgaarde...

763
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:31,200
...Gus Le Jeune...

764
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:33,100
Your Majesty.

765
01:31:33,300 --> 01:31:35,300
...and Eric Lanshof.

766
01:31:37,200 --> 01:31:38,100
Mr. Lanshof.

767
01:31:39,500 --> 01:31:40,400
Your Majesty.

768
01:31:42,100 --> 01:31:44,100
Won't you sit down?

769
01:31:59,800 --> 01:32:01,700
No, my guests first.

770
01:32:25,500 --> 01:32:29,400
Do tell me,
what is the situation at home?

771
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:31,800
Home? Which home?

772
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:35,300
Her Majesty means the situation
in the Netherlands.

773
01:32:35,500 --> 01:32:39,400
Not good. The Jerries are
stripping us bare, Her Majesty.

774
01:32:40,200 --> 01:32:43,700
- Those German bandits!
- I mean, Your Majesty.

775
01:32:44,900 --> 01:32:47,100
But when the war is over...

776
01:32:47,200 --> 01:32:50,700
...what must we do
about the fascists?

777
01:32:51,500 --> 01:32:54,100
Don't you worry
about those shitheads.

778
01:32:56,300 --> 01:33:01,000
Mr. Van der Zanden,
what does that mean, shitheads?

779
01:33:02,100 --> 01:33:06,600
It's a term, Your Majesty, expressing
how we feel about traitors.

780
01:33:06,700 --> 01:33:08,400
Right, Mr. Lanshof?

781
01:33:11,100 --> 01:33:14,100
- Who said I was a traitor?
- John...

782
01:33:14,200 --> 01:33:16,300
...shortly before he was killed.

783
01:33:17,300 --> 01:33:20,700
And then they simply let you go?

784
01:33:21,200 --> 01:33:23,100
I don't see the connection.

785
01:33:23,200 --> 01:33:26,900
It's simple. The Germans wanted
you to believe it...

786
01:33:27,500 --> 01:33:30,100
...and then pass the word around.

787
01:33:33,400 --> 01:33:35,400
What would they gain by that?

788
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:40,400
I am head of intelligence
and I'm Her Majesty's secretary.

789
01:33:40,700 --> 01:33:44,700
They would love the Dutch people
to think I was a traitor.

790
01:33:45,300 --> 01:33:47,200
They did a good job trying.

791
01:35:51,500 --> 01:35:54,100
- How's the army?
- The dregs!

792
01:35:55,400 --> 01:35:58,200
- I've got something else for you.
- What?

793
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:00,000
A trip.

794
01:36:00,900 --> 01:36:02,000
Where to?

795
01:36:02,900 --> 01:36:04,300
To Holland.

796
01:36:04,800 --> 01:36:05,800
No!

797
01:36:16,900 --> 01:36:20,500
- How did you manage that?
- I didn't, she did.

798
01:37:42,800 --> 01:37:45,800
I thought someone
was lying in wait for me...

799
01:37:47,600 --> 01:37:49,300
...with a gun.

800
01:37:54,100 --> 01:37:56,300
Don't go totally bonkers.

801
01:38:09,800 --> 01:38:12,800
- Still seeing her?
- None of your business.

802
01:38:13,900 --> 01:38:14,900
Yes.

803
01:38:17,400 --> 01:38:19,800
- Any progress?
- None of your business.

804
01:38:22,600 --> 01:38:23,600
No.

805
01:38:26,800 --> 01:38:29,100
Forget about her.

806
01:38:29,200 --> 01:38:31,700
Shit, I want to sleep with her...

807
01:38:33,800 --> 01:38:35,400
...while I still can.

808
01:38:36,700 --> 01:38:39,000
Cold feet? For Holland?

809
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:48,800
None of your business.

810
01:39:14,700 --> 01:39:19,200
We consider your presence in London
to be of the utmost importance.

811
01:39:26,700 --> 01:39:27,600
Yes?

812
01:39:36,500 --> 01:39:40,200
Mr. Lanshof, come on through.

813
01:39:44,200 --> 01:39:45,300
Do you smoke?

814
01:39:47,100 --> 01:39:48,300
Thank you.

815
01:39:50,200 --> 01:39:54,000
- And you perhaps?
- No, thank you. I don't smoke.

816
01:39:54,500 --> 01:39:57,900
Let's go for a stroll,
I find that very enjoyable.

817
01:40:08,200 --> 01:40:11,200
You're returning to Holland,
aren't you?

818
01:40:11,600 --> 01:40:12,800
Yes, Your Majesty.

819
01:40:12,900 --> 01:40:16,300
I want you to bring several
people back with you.

820
01:40:16,900 --> 01:40:18,500
lsn't that dangerous?

821
01:40:18,600 --> 01:40:23,600
Our future leaders are in Holland,
in the resistance.

822
01:40:24,500 --> 01:40:26,400
I want them to be here.

823
01:40:28,300 --> 01:40:30,600
They, at least, are of the people.

824
01:40:33,600 --> 01:40:38,200
Gentility belongs to the past.
Things will be different after the war.

825
01:40:38,700 --> 01:40:42,400
The true nobles are
the resistance fighters.

826
01:40:43,500 --> 01:40:44,900
Don't you agree?

827
01:40:45,100 --> 01:40:46,800
Mr. Lanshof?

828
01:40:47,900 --> 01:40:50,300
You're absolutely right, Your Majesty.

829
01:40:50,400 --> 01:40:53,500
I hadn't looked at it that way.
True nobles...

830
01:40:57,200 --> 01:40:59,600
Is there anything else, Your Majesty?

831
01:41:08,400 --> 01:41:10,700
I wish you success.

832
01:41:30,900 --> 01:41:33,500
ldiot, the Queen's
got a front row view.

833
01:41:44,800 --> 01:41:47,700
Here, put your mind to this
instead of neuken.

834
01:42:10,300 --> 01:42:13,100
Stop showing off,
you'll be shitting your pants.

835
01:42:13,200 --> 01:42:15,200
I'm not even wearing pants.

836
01:43:32,200 --> 01:43:35,200
Here. A matchbox to keep it in.

837
01:45:13,200 --> 01:45:17,100
That stuff smells disgusting.
It's enough to make you puke.

838
01:45:19,100 --> 01:45:20,700
...to make you puke.

839
01:45:24,600 --> 01:45:25,700
We've stopped.

840
01:47:08,300 --> 01:47:09,300
Come.

841
01:47:27,900 --> 01:47:29,600
Throw some over me.

842
01:47:32,400 --> 01:47:33,400
Your health.

843
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:41,000
Gus.

844
01:47:50,100 --> 01:47:51,400
Be careful.

845
01:50:17,800 --> 01:50:20,400
GERMANY WlNNlNG
ON ALL FRONTS

846
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:51,300
Filthy Jew

847
01:51:00,400 --> 01:51:01,300
Good Morning.

848
01:51:01,800 --> 01:51:04,100
I'd like birth announcement cards
for my daughter.

849
01:51:04,200 --> 01:51:05,400
What's her name?

850
01:51:06,300 --> 01:51:08,900
Wilhelmina Juliana Bernardina.

851
01:51:09,800 --> 01:51:12,000
Come. They're waiting for you.

852
01:51:23,900 --> 01:51:28,000
- Is this address safe?
- We'd not be here if it wasn't.

853
01:51:28,300 --> 01:51:30,200
You're a Red, aren't you?

854
01:51:30,300 --> 01:51:33,300
I remember seeing you
in the House.

855
01:51:33,400 --> 01:51:35,500
Hardly a pleasant experience.

856
01:51:35,800 --> 01:51:39,100
Possibly.
I don't recognize you at all.

857
01:51:39,300 --> 01:51:41,200
Gentlemen, please...

858
01:51:52,100 --> 01:51:54,400
I can't be part of this.
I refuse.

859
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:57,400
You've pledged yourself
to Her Majesty.

860
01:51:57,500 --> 01:52:00,700
I promised the Germans
I would take no action.

861
01:52:02,300 --> 01:52:06,600
General, the Queen has asked you
to be her adviser...

862
01:52:06,800 --> 01:52:09,100
...for the postwar democracy.

863
01:52:09,700 --> 01:52:13,500
Wilhelmina and democracy,
a belated vocation.

864
01:52:14,600 --> 01:52:18,400
Or rather, she's always
been a little touched.

865
01:52:18,700 --> 01:52:21,700
Religion.
This is her chance...

866
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:26,200
...to play Christ, to save the world.
Count me out.

867
01:52:26,300 --> 01:52:29,300
What an odious way of saying
that you're scared.

868
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:33,600
If I were 20, I'd take exception
to that. Gentlemen...

869
01:52:35,700 --> 01:52:38,700
Perhaps you have doubts
about the new democracy too?

870
01:52:38,800 --> 01:52:40,300
New democracy?

871
01:52:41,300 --> 01:52:43,600
We've never had democracy.

872
01:52:45,400 --> 01:52:46,800
When do we leave?

873
01:52:48,800 --> 01:52:50,400
You'll hear from me.

874
01:52:51,500 --> 01:52:52,400
Fine.

875
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:57,500
Could we get caught?

876
01:52:57,800 --> 01:53:02,300
If they get me and not you, tell
the Queen what the socialists want...

877
01:53:02,400 --> 01:53:03,700
...after the war.

878
01:53:06,400 --> 01:53:07,900
I'll warn them.

879
01:53:14,300 --> 01:53:16,000
Goddamn it!

880
01:53:18,200 --> 01:53:19,800
Waterproof.

881
01:53:30,300 --> 01:53:32,100
Stone dead.

882
01:53:32,500 --> 01:53:35,700
Nothing. How can
I tell London when we're coming?

883
01:55:05,300 --> 01:55:07,200
They only confirm receipt.

884
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:11,100
lnstructions will come tomorrow.

885
01:55:22,800 --> 01:55:26,100
- Anything else I can do for you?
- No, thank you.

886
01:55:27,700 --> 01:55:29,800
I can do more than just transmit.

887
01:55:30,800 --> 01:55:32,800
We'll phone if we need you, okay?

888
01:55:33,800 --> 01:55:34,800
Fine.

889
01:55:36,800 --> 01:55:38,300
See you tomorrow then.

890
01:56:03,300 --> 01:56:04,300
Well?

891
01:56:04,800 --> 01:56:07,800
I don't know their plans.
They're not talking.

892
01:56:07,900 --> 01:56:09,200
Bad show.

893
01:56:09,300 --> 01:56:12,000
They'd be on to me if I asked.

894
01:56:12,300 --> 01:56:14,200
You're not trying hard enough.

895
01:56:18,800 --> 01:56:22,800
Which of Esther's jackets
would this go best with?

896
01:56:23,200 --> 01:56:25,900
I'd love to see you against the wall.

897
01:56:26,500 --> 01:56:28,600
You'd be right next to me.

898
01:56:29,800 --> 01:56:31,500
Goddamn it!

899
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:39,300
ldiot!

900
01:56:58,700 --> 01:57:00,900
A present for your fiance.

901
01:57:02,800 --> 01:57:04,900
Might be the last time.

902
01:57:09,900 --> 01:57:11,600
Who's that jerk?

903
01:57:11,800 --> 01:57:13,800
A friend from the resistance.

904
01:57:13,900 --> 01:57:15,900
If that's one of your friends...

905
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:21,000
Darling, we can't always
choose our friends.

906
02:00:34,900 --> 02:00:37,900
This device uses zinc coins only

907
02:00:39,600 --> 02:00:41,600
Damn it...

908
02:01:10,100 --> 02:01:11,800
An odd uniform.

909
02:01:11,900 --> 02:01:14,500
- U-boat, I think.
- Or a destroyer.

910
02:01:22,800 --> 02:01:23,800
Stop.

911
02:01:25,300 --> 02:01:26,300
Get off.

912
02:01:28,500 --> 02:01:31,000
The German Army
claims this bicycle.

913
02:01:33,500 --> 02:01:35,500
Filthy, goddamn Jerry.

914
02:01:37,700 --> 02:01:39,900
Right, beach huts at 11 pm.

915
02:01:40,400 --> 02:01:42,000
You're going to England?

916
02:01:43,400 --> 02:01:44,500
Police.

917
02:01:45,200 --> 02:01:46,300
On your feet.

918
02:02:19,100 --> 02:02:20,600
They're dead.

919
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:25,200
Damn. That was close.

920
02:02:26,500 --> 02:02:29,100
We've got to get out of here.
To the car.

921
02:02:29,200 --> 02:02:31,900
- What about me?
- You need a place to hide.

922
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:33,900
- Where?
- I'll fix it.

923
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:36,900
- Fix it? I just shot two Nazis!
- Scared?

924
02:02:37,000 --> 02:02:40,100
Yes! Do I have to stay
and wait for them?

925
02:02:40,600 --> 02:02:42,700
Don't leave me here.

926
02:02:43,800 --> 02:02:45,400
I want to go with you.

927
02:02:46,800 --> 02:02:48,100
I object.

928
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:51,900
I decide who comes.

929
02:02:53,500 --> 02:02:55,300
It's only my opinion.

930
02:02:55,400 --> 02:02:57,600
He's coming!
I'll answer for him.

931
02:03:03,700 --> 02:03:07,300
- He'll need tails.
- There are some in the garage.

932
02:03:21,200 --> 02:03:22,400
Let it ring.

933
02:03:38,800 --> 02:03:41,100
They're gone. After them.

934
02:03:43,800 --> 02:03:47,400
If things go wrong,
don't let them take me alive.

935
02:03:51,400 --> 02:03:53,600
This'll do the trick.
Cyanide.

936
02:04:13,500 --> 02:04:14,500
After them.

937
02:04:16,900 --> 02:04:17,900
It worked.

938
02:04:33,200 --> 02:04:34,400
No answer?

939
02:04:41,500 --> 02:04:42,600
Where's Robby?

940
02:04:43,100 --> 02:04:45,500
I don't know.
He comes and goes.

941
02:04:48,300 --> 02:04:49,900
But you're engaged.

942
02:04:50,300 --> 02:04:52,700
He's always busy with his transmitter.

943
02:04:52,800 --> 02:04:56,300
A permanent place is too risky,
he says.

944
02:04:57,900 --> 02:04:59,800
Don't you wear a star?

945
02:04:59,900 --> 02:05:02,400
Forged papers, from Robby.

946
02:05:05,800 --> 02:05:10,000
And the liquor, the chocolate...
From Robby too?

947
02:05:10,500 --> 02:05:12,600
A man from Robby's group brings it.

948
02:05:12,700 --> 02:05:15,300
We can't even get those
things in London.

949
02:05:15,900 --> 02:05:18,900
Robby's in the resistance.
They can get anything.

950
02:05:19,000 --> 02:05:20,500
Do you believe that?

951
02:05:27,700 --> 02:05:31,700
I have to go to my parents' place
and get my tails.

952
02:05:35,700 --> 02:05:37,600
Are you going to a party?

953
02:05:37,700 --> 02:05:40,600
Yes... you could call it that.

954
02:05:48,900 --> 02:05:50,900
Lord, where are you going?

955
02:05:51,300 --> 02:05:53,800
- The lion's den!
- Don't worry.

956
02:05:53,900 --> 02:05:57,100
If anything goes wrong I'll shoot.

957
02:05:57,200 --> 02:05:58,400
Robby, shut up.

958
02:06:05,100 --> 02:06:06,700
Papers, please.

959
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:17,200
Thank you.

960
02:06:25,300 --> 02:06:28,800
My compliments.
An excellent forgery.

961
02:06:29,000 --> 02:06:30,700
They're the real thing.

962
02:06:31,300 --> 02:06:33,000
Mr. Particular.

963
02:06:38,800 --> 02:06:42,200
Phone headquarters.
We'll cordon off the area.

964
02:06:56,000 --> 02:06:58,300
Ah, this messy tomato sauce.

965
02:06:58,400 --> 02:07:02,000
Have the cleaning bill
sent to Berlin.

966
02:07:03,700 --> 02:07:06,000
The Fuhrer will gladly pay.

967
02:07:18,700 --> 02:07:23,000
You there, get out of the way.

968
02:07:26,300 --> 02:07:29,000
We're going to party.

969
02:07:33,400 --> 02:07:34,700
I'll join you.

970
02:07:35,100 --> 02:07:38,100
Come on in. Nice and warm.

971
02:07:38,300 --> 02:07:40,400
Oh, you're a heavy one.

972
02:07:44,300 --> 02:07:45,900
Everything is arranged.

973
02:07:54,200 --> 02:07:55,600
We're here.

974
02:08:02,700 --> 02:08:04,600
Stay with us.

975
02:08:17,900 --> 02:08:19,900
Come on, let's go inside.

976
02:08:20,600 --> 02:08:22,100
All right, I will.

977
02:09:35,600 --> 02:09:38,800
It saddens me to see you
among all these fascists...

978
02:09:38,900 --> 02:09:40,300
...bunker-builders.

979
02:09:40,900 --> 02:09:42,500
Oh, it's war.

980
02:09:43,200 --> 02:09:44,900
And it's a nice party.

981
02:09:48,500 --> 02:09:50,500
I heard you were abroad.

982
02:09:50,700 --> 02:09:51,900
Bullshit.

983
02:09:55,400 --> 02:09:57,300
I heard you were in London.

984
02:09:57,500 --> 02:10:00,200
No, I'm right here.
As you can see.

985
02:10:00,500 --> 02:10:03,500
It's a shame we're not
fighting on the same side.

986
02:10:05,300 --> 02:10:06,800
A shame.

987
02:10:07,400 --> 02:10:09,200
A few years from now...

988
02:10:09,300 --> 02:10:13,100
...the Germans and English will
both be fighting the communists.

989
02:10:13,500 --> 02:10:14,600
I doubt it.

990
02:10:15,000 --> 02:10:16,300
We won't see it.

991
02:10:21,100 --> 02:10:22,800
We won't make
it through the war.

992
02:10:34,800 --> 02:10:37,700
- I'll see if he's down there yet.
- All right.

993
02:10:42,400 --> 02:10:44,500
To London, old spy.

994
02:10:44,600 --> 02:10:47,200
Are you spying for the Germans
in London?

995
02:10:48,400 --> 02:10:51,000
Will you bring back
some nylons for me?

996
02:10:51,100 --> 02:10:53,400
What a lovely brooch!

997
02:10:53,700 --> 02:10:55,300
The lron Cross!

998
02:10:56,000 --> 02:10:59,400
- How'd you earn that?
- I blew up a Russian tank.

999
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:04,700
- Here, you earned it.
- Piss off.

1000
02:11:05,500 --> 02:11:07,800
Spying is a lot riskier...

1001
02:11:07,900 --> 02:11:09,300
It's mine.

1002
02:11:10,500 --> 02:11:12,300
Give it back, dammit!

1003
02:11:12,800 --> 02:11:15,400
- It's not a toy!
- lron Cross, lron Cross!

1004
02:11:59,200 --> 02:12:00,300
Gus!

1005
02:12:06,900 --> 02:12:08,700
It's running like clockwork.

1006
02:12:09,100 --> 02:12:10,900
No. We're in trouble.

1007
02:12:11,700 --> 02:12:12,700
What trouble?

1008
02:12:12,900 --> 02:12:14,800
We've been betrayed, by Robby.

1009
02:12:16,000 --> 02:12:17,300
No. He's with me.

1010
02:12:18,600 --> 02:12:21,800
- He's coming.
- Robby's working for them!

1011
02:12:23,900 --> 02:12:25,900
Jesus Christ.

1012
02:12:27,600 --> 02:12:30,500
- Where is he?
- Up there with the others.

1013
02:12:31,000 --> 02:12:32,100
Wait for me.

1014
02:13:16,300 --> 02:13:17,400
Filthy bastard!

1015
02:13:19,000 --> 02:13:21,900
Stay where you are!
Nobody move!

1016
02:13:22,500 --> 02:13:25,300
- Run to the beach!
- You are surrounded!

1017
02:13:26,500 --> 02:13:29,000
If you move, we'll shoot!

1018
02:13:30,900 --> 02:13:33,400
Stay where you are!

1019
02:13:37,500 --> 02:13:39,000
Don't move!

1020
02:13:39,600 --> 02:13:41,100
We're opening fire!

1021
02:13:48,500 --> 02:13:49,500
Split up!

1022
02:16:50,800 --> 02:16:53,100
I deeply regret what
has happened.

1023
02:16:59,200 --> 02:17:00,900
Mr. Van der Zanden?

1024
02:17:01,000 --> 02:17:02,200
Your Majesty?

1025
02:17:03,000 --> 02:17:05,000
We shall not repeat this.

1026
02:17:11,400 --> 02:17:13,800
Thank you very much
for your efforts.

1027
02:20:21,600 --> 02:20:23,200
That'll never get there.

1028
02:20:24,900 --> 02:20:25,900
So what?

1029
02:20:45,700 --> 02:20:47,900
Bread? Bread?

1030
02:20:48,100 --> 02:20:49,100
Hungry?

1031
02:21:50,700 --> 02:21:51,900
We're going.

1032
02:22:09,600 --> 02:22:13,200
We have to go. Bye.

1033
02:22:56,800 --> 02:22:59,300
'Love from Alex.' Your mascot.

1034
02:22:59,900 --> 02:23:02,200
He'll get a bomb
on his head tonight.

1035
02:23:11,000 --> 02:23:13,300
I'm not that much
of a bloody fool.

1036
02:24:11,300 --> 02:24:12,400
Shut up.

1037
02:24:12,500 --> 02:24:14,800
He's waking the dead
in their graves.

1038
02:24:16,100 --> 02:24:17,100
Open up.

1039
02:24:34,100 --> 02:24:36,000
We won't hear from him again.

1040
02:25:09,900 --> 02:25:12,500
Nuremberg. These Jerries
are good shots.

1041
02:25:12,600 --> 02:25:14,500
They're not drinking this Christmas.

1042
02:25:15,100 --> 02:25:18,400
- How much longer?
- 15 seconds. Cheers.

1043
02:25:18,600 --> 02:25:19,800
Bomb doors open?

1044
02:25:20,400 --> 02:25:23,300
- Bomb doors open.
- Christmas present ready?

1045
02:25:23,400 --> 02:25:26,700
- Count down.
- 10, 9, 8, 7...

1046
02:25:26,800 --> 02:25:29,400
...6, 5, 4, 3...

1047
02:25:29,500 --> 02:25:30,800
...2, 1.

1048
02:25:32,400 --> 02:25:33,600
Bombs away.

1049
02:25:34,300 --> 02:25:36,000
And back home.

1050
02:26:07,700 --> 02:26:11,500
Her Majesty wants you...

1051
02:26:11,600 --> 02:26:14,200
...as her aide.

1052
02:27:16,300 --> 02:27:17,700
Long live the Queen!

1053
02:27:25,200 --> 02:27:28,900
No, thank you, Captain.
This, I would prefer to do alone.

1054
02:28:46,400 --> 02:28:50,500
Couldn't you have accidentally
dropped a bomb on that palace?

1055
02:30:08,500 --> 02:30:09,500
Well?

1056
02:30:11,100 --> 02:30:12,400
It's short.

1057
02:30:14,100 --> 02:30:15,800
lt'll grow again.

1058
02:30:16,000 --> 02:30:18,700
A present from
our liberated compatriots.

1059
02:30:20,100 --> 02:30:21,400
Understandable.

1060
02:30:21,600 --> 02:30:23,400
I've no hard feelings.

1061
02:30:23,800 --> 02:30:25,300
I survived.

1062
02:30:26,000 --> 02:30:29,600
- You did too.
- Yes, that's true.

1063
02:30:30,400 --> 02:30:32,300
Except, you're a hero.

1064
02:30:34,300 --> 02:30:35,800
What will you do?

1065
02:30:35,900 --> 02:30:37,500
Work in the garden.

1066
02:30:38,300 --> 02:30:40,000
Clean up the mess.

1067
02:31:26,600 --> 02:31:27,600
Jack!

1068
02:31:33,800 --> 02:31:36,200
Good Lord, Eric!

1069
02:31:37,300 --> 02:31:38,400
Come in!

1070
02:31:41,200 --> 02:31:43,800
You look absolutely marvelous.

1071
02:31:44,200 --> 02:31:46,300
Medals!
How did you get them?

1072
02:31:46,600 --> 02:31:49,400
Did some flying,
dropped some bombs.

1073
02:31:51,900 --> 02:31:53,600
We scraped through.

1074
02:31:54,400 --> 02:31:55,900
Don't ask me how.

1075
02:31:58,900 --> 02:32:00,400
Would you like a drink?

1076
02:32:00,800 --> 02:32:04,400
I have a nice wine
for special occasions.

1077
02:32:44,300 --> 02:32:47,600
...universities closed. I took
prelims behind closed doors.

1078
02:32:49,100 --> 02:32:51,500
Risky business.
You had to take care.

1079
02:32:55,800 --> 02:32:59,500
We'll simply start where we
left off five years ago.

1080
02:33:08,000 --> 02:33:09,100
Here you are.

1081
02:33:11,300 --> 02:33:12,700
What are your plans?

1082
02:33:13,600 --> 02:33:14,500
I don't know.

1083
02:33:15,100 --> 02:33:16,500
To the future.

1084
02:33:17,000 --> 02:33:18,300
Your health.
