00:07:38,402 --> 00:07:40,500
Hey, come on, wake up.

10
00:07:40,751 --> 00:07:44,000
Wake up, wake up. The other room.

11
00:07:57,358 --> 00:08:00,658
- Hey, listen to this.
- What?

12
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,500
- They're doing it again in the other room.
- Really?

13
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:02,300
- There's a man outside the window.
- A man?

14
00:09:22,182 --> 00:09:24,565
- Let's bring him inside, okay?
- Yes.

15
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,500
Come on... we'll show you something.

16
00:10:09,246 --> 00:10:10,500
Back there.

17
00:10:25,755 --> 00:10:27,962
- Kneel down.
- Through there.

18
00:11:25,626 --> 00:11:26,695
Get off!

19
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:50,800
Somebody help me!
I'm going to be killed! Help!

20
00:14:52,814 --> 00:14:55,800
Help! Do something!

21
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:23,000
Help me!

22
00:15:38,088 --> 00:15:39,406
Help!

23
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,000
Help!

24
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:33,414
Why are you girls watching me?

25
00:25:37,112 --> 00:25:38,230
What are you looking at?

26
00:25:38,330 --> 00:25:40,028
Why are you killing us?

27
00:25:50,130 --> 00:25:51,717
Why are you?

28
00:25:54,112 --> 00:25:55,580
Why are you?

29
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:15,300
Haven't you satisfied yourself yet?

30
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:16,700
Have you?

31
00:26:17,607 --> 00:26:19,826
Calm down and ask yourself.

32
00:26:21,348 --> 00:26:23,133
These people were my...

33
00:26:27,614 --> 00:26:32,404
Why not me?
I'm the oldest of these girls.

34
00:26:32,627 --> 00:26:34,700
I don't care what happens to me.

35
00:26:36,073 --> 00:26:40,201
I'm serious. If you're human,
think about what you're doing.

36
00:26:43,228 --> 00:26:45,929
These girls have just reached maturity.

37
00:26:46,093 --> 00:26:50,153
How can you destroy their future?

38
00:26:51,245 --> 00:26:53,500
If you're human, you understand me.

39
00:26:55,884 --> 00:26:58,300
If you need to kill, then kill me.

40
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:02,929
And let the rest of them live.

41
00:27:03,042 --> 00:27:06,260
Look at the blood... have you
ever lost your own blood?

42
00:27:06,504 --> 00:27:09,303
You're probably the kind who's
afraid to shave with a razor.

43
00:27:10,355 --> 00:27:14,996
Blood is sacred...
and you've wasted it.

44
00:27:16,234 --> 00:27:19,624
If you are arrested and
sentenced to death,

45
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:23,500
You will never be forgiven
for this sacrilege.

46
00:27:26,113 --> 00:27:28,696
What did we do?

47
00:27:29,495 --> 00:27:35,025
If we did something wrong, we'd apologize.
We could give you money.

48
00:27:37,270 --> 00:27:39,370
But that's not it, is it?

49
00:27:47,870 --> 00:27:49,370
Answer me!

50
00:27:49,756 --> 00:27:52,175
Please, say something!

51
00:27:55,570 --> 00:27:57,416
What is it you don't like about us?

52
00:27:57,581 --> 00:28:00,870
Is it our occupation?
Have you had problems with nurses?

53
00:28:02,470 --> 00:28:04,169
Is that why you were watching us?

54
00:28:04,276 --> 00:28:05,335
No.

55
00:28:08,225 --> 00:28:12,416
Then why?
Do you have a reason?

56
00:28:12,581 --> 00:28:15,170
No.  I just...

57
00:28:15,470 --> 00:28:19,970
Just what? What?
Just what?

58
00:28:24,068 --> 00:28:25,570
I don't know.

59
00:28:27,187 --> 00:28:29,500
There must be some reason for doing this!

60
00:28:34,470 --> 00:28:38,170
I refuse to believe
we are being killed for no reason.

61
00:28:43,109 --> 00:28:49,770
If I'm killed, what will
happen to my kid in Katsuura?

62
00:28:52,383 --> 00:28:59,270
Yes. It's a secret, but I have a kid.

63
00:28:59,510 --> 00:29:04,270
This month my child will be two.
A child without a father.

64
00:29:05,669 --> 00:29:07,070
I'll show you the photo.

65
00:29:13,496 --> 00:29:16,570
I put the photo in my wallet...
I left it at the office.

66
00:29:21,205 --> 00:29:22,238
But still...

67
00:29:24,408 --> 00:29:28,170
If I die, what will happen
to my child?

68
00:29:31,695 --> 00:29:34,870
For my child's sake,
please don't kill me.

69
00:29:36,781 --> 00:29:38,870
You can't do it to me!

70
00:29:43,547 --> 00:29:46,893
I'm sorry...
I didn't mean to yell.

71
00:29:48,875 --> 00:29:52,170
Please, calm down and listen to me.

72
00:29:56,887 --> 00:30:00,870
You will probably kill me anyway.

73
00:30:04,122 --> 00:30:06,412
But please, don't!

74
00:30:16,686 --> 00:30:20,751
No... you won't kill me.

75
00:30:24,250 --> 00:30:26,692
You realize what you've done.

76
00:30:27,267 --> 00:30:29,370
You want to stop now.

77
00:30:30,539 --> 00:30:32,606
Don't you agree?

78
00:30:32,852 --> 00:30:36,170
I can see you're frustrated.

79
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:45,062
You're having a difficult time.
You're upset because you don't have sex,

80
00:30:45,247 --> 00:30:48,370
and you've found it easier to
kill for attention.

81
00:30:48,870 --> 00:30:50,941
Do you understand?

82
00:30:53,487 --> 00:30:57,890
If you try, you'll be feeling better.

83
00:31:06,123 --> 00:31:08,644
You can't help yourself.

84
00:31:08,749 --> 00:31:11,009
It's because of your past.

85
00:31:13,916 --> 00:31:16,070
You're just mixed up.

86
00:31:17,051 --> 00:31:18,768
You need to think things out.

87
00:31:20,867 --> 00:31:22,441
Everything will be fine.

88
00:31:23,370 --> 00:31:24,950
Do you understand?

89
00:31:26,870 --> 00:31:30,070
Let's just put all this behind
like a bad dream.

90
00:31:30,870 --> 00:31:35,385
That's exactly what we should do.

91
00:31:37,838 --> 00:31:41,186
You can be forgiven.

92
00:31:42,553 --> 00:31:47,273
Only a devil would knowingly kill a nurse.
You're not a devil.

93
00:31:47,682 --> 00:31:49,110
Kill a nurse?

94
00:31:50,370 --> 00:31:54,870
We are nurses, angels in white dresses.

95
00:31:55,370 --> 00:31:58,214
Are only women angels?

96
00:32:00,622 --> 00:32:03,231
Angels in white dresses
are always women.

97
00:32:08,370 --> 00:32:12,187
- Put this on... show him. Hurry!
- Yes!

98
00:32:16,370 --> 00:32:17,458
Hurry!

99
00:36:05,370 --> 00:36:07,370
Don't kill me!

100
00:37:05,870 --> 00:37:08,170
Please! Don't!

101
00:39:50,619 --> 00:39:52,289
Let me go.

102
00:39:53,061 --> 00:39:55,107
Don't just stare at me,
Let me go!

103
00:40:00,870 --> 00:40:03,222
I'm begging, release me.
Hurry!

104
00:40:03,913 --> 00:40:05,028
What are you doing?

105
00:40:11,670 --> 00:40:14,162
Release me. Quickly!

106
00:41:44,230 --> 00:41:45,870
I will show you an angel.

107
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:53,208
No. Don't. Let me go!

108
00:42:28,370 --> 00:42:33,870
"Parents might be different...
but the heart remains..."

109
00:42:36,267 --> 00:42:37,970
Is that an angel?

110
00:42:38,483 --> 00:42:40,186
Do you want to be an angel?

111
00:42:40,450 --> 00:42:42,270
I'm not an angel.

112
00:42:42,578 --> 00:42:45,870
You liar.  Liar!

113
00:43:00,296 --> 00:43:03,333
Stop! Stop!
Stop...

114
00:43:04,262 --> 00:43:07,652
Everything was a lie.
Even the part about a child.

115
00:43:07,828 --> 00:43:09,575
Stop!

116
00:43:12,081 --> 00:43:16,893
Help. I'll do anything.
Please, spare me!

117
00:43:17,113 --> 00:43:19,370
Please. Anything.

118
00:43:50,134 --> 00:43:51,220
Out of my way!

119
00:43:53,539 --> 00:43:57,744
What? If you're
going to shoot, then do it.

120
00:43:57,905 --> 00:43:59,870
Please don't kill the others!
Just me!

121
00:44:00,870 --> 00:44:03,970
Please let this girl go!

122
00:44:05,263 --> 00:44:08,562
I promise before God and
before all those here today,

123
00:44:08,856 --> 00:44:11,770
I will live my life as destined.
If this is the end, then so be it.

124
00:44:11,924 --> 00:44:13,946
And praise to God who knows everything.

125
00:44:14,061 --> 00:44:16,915
I will forgive the poison and the evil.

126
00:44:17,203 --> 00:44:19,870
I will never allow evil
to taint my soul.

127
00:44:20,406 --> 00:44:26,240
I will offer myself
to the purity of heaven.

128
00:44:26,526 --> 00:44:30,999
I will never allow another
to change my goal.

129
00:44:32,196 --> 00:44:38,728
I offer my soul for the
happiness of the others...

130
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:40,503
Angel whore!

131
00:45:21,570 --> 00:45:24,170
Why have you left me alive?

132
00:45:30,870 --> 00:45:33,870
Why are you looking at me like that?

133
00:45:35,082 --> 00:45:38,002
I asked that question before.

134
00:45:39,423 --> 00:45:42,098
You asked why we were looking at you?

135
00:45:44,435 --> 00:45:47,934
- That's right.
- Of course.

136
00:45:50,846 --> 00:45:53,670
But I don't know the answer.

137
00:45:55,870 --> 00:45:58,770
I don't know you at all.

138
00:45:59,546 --> 00:46:02,224
I don't even want to know you.

139
00:46:03,820 --> 00:46:06,591
You know me.

140
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:10,008
No I don't.

141
00:46:12,474 --> 00:46:15,713
Where are you from?

142
00:46:16,870 --> 00:46:20,410
- That way...
- Tokyo?

143
00:46:20,656 --> 00:46:23,216
- No.
- Where?

144
00:46:23,968 --> 00:46:24,861
Listen...

145
00:46:26,070 --> 00:46:28,111
You can hear the waves.

146
00:46:38,709 --> 00:46:39,911
I can't hear anything.

147
00:46:40,009 --> 00:46:41,204
Yes you can.

148
00:46:42,977 --> 00:46:46,518
From past the forest...
even further.

149
00:46:48,370 --> 00:46:49,995
You think so?

150
00:46:53,018 --> 00:46:54,800
I came from there.

151
00:47:01,370 --> 00:47:05,070
It hurts.
It hurts when you do it so hard.

152
00:47:05,370 --> 00:47:06,513
I'm sorry.

153
00:47:07,546 --> 00:47:11,870
Did you really come from
near the ocean?

154
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:13,870
Yes.

155
00:47:14,970 --> 00:47:16,923
I don't believe you.

156
00:47:18,097 --> 00:47:21,870
Like in a fairy tale?

157
00:47:24,552 --> 00:47:26,870
Where did you come from
before that?

158
00:47:29,989 --> 00:47:31,370
I don't know.

159
00:47:32,491 --> 00:47:35,885
Look, the blood you spilled.

160
00:47:38,770 --> 00:47:40,570
I did that?

161
00:47:41,664 --> 00:47:44,370
I'll ask again.
Why did you do it?

162
00:47:46,802 --> 00:47:49,255
Why have you spilled this blood?

163
00:47:52,581 --> 00:47:54,599
To decorate you.

164
00:47:55,471 --> 00:47:58,291
- Me?
- Yes.

165
00:47:58,870 --> 00:48:03,870
Why did you use
the blood of others to decorate me?

166
00:48:04,621 --> 00:48:07,511
Why didn't you use your own blood?

167
00:48:16,270 --> 00:48:17,870
This is your blood.

168
00:48:19,503 --> 00:48:23,970
This is the only
blood you need to decorate me.

169
00:48:24,870 --> 00:48:30,870
I would've told you before...
before you killed so many.

170
00:48:32,115 --> 00:48:36,370
I didn't know.  Is that why
you were looking at me before?

171
00:48:36,775 --> 00:48:38,482
You're so strange.

172
00:48:40,370 --> 00:48:44,370
Yeah. I said you knew me.

173
00:48:45,151 --> 00:48:46,619
I don't know you.

174
00:48:46,784 --> 00:48:51,370
But you were
waiting for me to decorate you.

175
00:48:51,870 --> 00:48:53,544
Yes, I was waiting.

176
00:48:55,250 --> 00:48:56,718
Who are you?

177
00:48:57,782 --> 00:49:02,460
- Do you know the song 'Ocean Traveler'?
- No.

178
00:49:03,634 --> 00:49:07,370
I am the ocean traveler.

179
00:49:09,370 --> 00:49:15,370
<i>That day the ocean was rough.</i>

180
00:49:16,599 --> 00:49:23,072
<i>Big waves and small waves
kidnapping water.</i>

181
00:49:23,870 --> 00:49:30,956
<i>I'm an ocean traveler collecting
shells on a mysterious beach.</i>

182
00:49:31,132 --> 00:49:38,679
<i>An ocean traveler,
looking for a true love...</i>

183
00:56:23,370 --> 00:56:29,445
The End
