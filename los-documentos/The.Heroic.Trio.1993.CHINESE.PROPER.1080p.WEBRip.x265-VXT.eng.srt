1
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:06,166
The city is shocked
by the missing baby cases.

2
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:10,083
Within three months,
18 babies have gone missing.

3
00:02:10,291 --> 00:02:14,916
No findings have been reported
by the police.

4
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,583
The police commissioner...

5
00:02:18,333 --> 00:02:19,625
We've arrived in no time.

6
00:02:19,708 --> 00:02:21,500
Please stop! Yeah.

7
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:22,916
Here I am!

8
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:24,958
Something's wrong.

9
00:02:28,333 --> 00:02:29,458
Oh, no! Damn!

10
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:30,750
Forget it.

11
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,000
Be careful.

12
00:02:33,666 --> 00:02:34,500
Look!

13
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,250
Very stylish architecture.

14
00:02:37,333 --> 00:02:38,333
Let's go inside.

15
00:02:39,791 --> 00:02:41,250
This way please.

16
00:02:43,916 --> 00:02:45,833
This house is elegant,

17
00:02:46,125 --> 00:02:49,583
and there are no other houses
within 1,000 meters.

18
00:02:50,416 --> 00:02:53,375
Only five minutes' drive
to grocery stores.

19
00:02:53,458 --> 00:02:57,416
-So many pros, what are the cons?
-Of course there are some.

20
00:02:57,666 --> 00:02:59,375
But it's not that bad.

21
00:03:02,625 --> 00:03:04,291
The only con is...

22
00:03:04,375 --> 00:03:05,833
There's not much decoration.

23
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,583
That's how you put it?

24
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:13,166
But the structure is fine.

25
00:03:13,375 --> 00:03:15,416
There was just a little fire.

26
00:03:22,666 --> 00:03:24,000
Let me show you something.

27
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:30,333
You can hear the birds sing!

28
00:03:34,875 --> 00:03:36,958
After you move in, you will love it more.

29
00:03:38,958 --> 00:03:39,875
What do you think?

30
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:41,958
Damn!

31
00:03:42,041 --> 00:03:44,916
I asked the owner to have it renovated
before listing it.

32
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,250
Now my time is wasted. Shoot!

33
00:03:49,041 --> 00:03:50,166
I'm lucky!

34
00:03:51,041 --> 00:03:54,750
God, now no one will buy this!

35
00:03:55,083 --> 00:03:56,541
-Let's go!
-Don't move!

36
00:03:57,458 --> 00:04:00,708
Darling, buy this house. I like it.

37
00:04:00,791 --> 00:04:01,791
It has character.

38
00:04:02,125 --> 00:04:04,791
Character? Really?

39
00:04:04,875 --> 00:04:06,541
You know what kind of house I like.

40
00:04:06,625 --> 00:04:07,541
I know.

41
00:04:08,666 --> 00:04:10,375
Then make a deposit first.

42
00:04:10,666 --> 00:04:11,666
Quiet.

43
00:04:32,416 --> 00:04:34,541
Tried to steal my car? You do it yourself.

44
00:04:34,708 --> 00:04:37,500
Yes, I'll do it myself.

45
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:39,958
Wow, that's incredible!

46
00:04:40,416 --> 00:04:42,916
Of course, my husband is a cop.

47
00:04:45,791 --> 00:04:46,708
Move!

48
00:04:46,791 --> 00:04:47,708
I am.

49
00:04:47,791 --> 00:04:52,000
Eighteen babies have gone missing
in the past two months.

50
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:55,000
It looks like the work of one person.

51
00:04:56,125 --> 00:05:00,916
So far, no missing baby's family
has received a blackmail letter.

52
00:05:01,083 --> 00:05:04,666
Nor has any political or terrorist group
claimed responsibility.

53
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:09,750
Commander, these cases are so strange.
Shall we approach Wonder Woman?

54
00:05:10,208 --> 00:05:13,041
Though she helped us before,

55
00:05:13,333 --> 00:05:15,333
we still don't know who she is.

56
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,750
We can't reach her after all.

57
00:05:18,583 --> 00:05:22,458
All missing babies are male. I think
it has nothing to do with blackmail.

58
00:05:22,541 --> 00:05:24,875
NEXT ONE...

59
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:26,875
Hey...

60
00:05:26,958 --> 00:05:29,375
Maybe it has to do with a cult.

61
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,583
Did you see anyone rushing out?

62
00:05:51,666 --> 00:05:52,666
No.

63
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Commander!

64
00:05:57,458 --> 00:05:58,625
YOUR CHILD WILL BE NEXT

65
00:06:17,666 --> 00:06:18,791
Come with me.

66
00:06:23,208 --> 00:06:25,541
Nursery is upstairs.
Operating room over there.

67
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:29,916
I'm worried about our son.

68
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,625
Let's take him home now.

69
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:33,125
Lau!

70
00:06:33,208 --> 00:06:36,833
The doctor doesn't recommend for us
to bring our newborn baby home so soon.

71
00:06:36,916 --> 00:06:38,875
-Lau...
-All right! Leave him here.

72
00:06:38,958 --> 00:06:40,875
Why not call Wonder Woman for help?

73
00:06:41,791 --> 00:06:43,958
Sorry, we have no way to contact her.

74
00:06:44,583 --> 00:06:46,125
I've sent more men here.

75
00:06:46,208 --> 00:06:49,291
It makes no difference to have
the baby at home or leave him here.

76
00:06:51,666 --> 00:06:53,291
-Please watch my wife.
-Yes, sir.

77
00:06:53,875 --> 00:06:55,541
A bus just got into an accident.

78
00:06:55,625 --> 00:06:58,791
The beds in this ward might be needed.
We were alerted about it.

79
00:06:58,875 --> 00:07:00,750
Stay here, Lau. You can go.

80
00:07:04,708 --> 00:07:08,291
Lau, it's my son they're after.

81
00:07:09,458 --> 00:07:11,625
What about

82
00:07:11,708 --> 00:07:13,416
swapping the baby?

83
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,833
Using whose baby to swap?

84
00:07:15,625 --> 00:07:17,708
That's too immoral, right?

85
00:07:17,791 --> 00:07:20,416
It's your son they want,
they will find him anyway.

86
00:07:21,083 --> 00:07:24,833
Yes, if others find out about the swap,
it'd be no good.

87
00:07:25,916 --> 00:07:27,083
Let's face it.

88
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:29,875
Face it...

89
00:07:32,416 --> 00:07:36,291
Sorry. Officer Lau said no one's allowed
to enter without his permission.

90
00:07:36,375 --> 00:07:37,416
All right, then!

91
00:08:05,916 --> 00:08:07,250
What's wrong?

92
00:08:17,416 --> 00:08:18,833
Babies are falling down!

93
00:08:23,541 --> 00:08:24,750
Catch them!

94
00:08:26,083 --> 00:08:27,541
My son!

95
00:08:27,625 --> 00:08:28,625
Catch our son!

96
00:08:28,833 --> 00:08:30,916
Which is our son?

97
00:08:31,083 --> 00:08:32,625
Either one!

98
00:08:32,708 --> 00:08:33,875
Which one?

99
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:03,416
Wonder Woman!

100
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:07,333
Wonder Woman!

101
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:37,416
She's coming down.

102
00:10:10,333 --> 00:10:12,750
Its blood was left on the wall.
Go get it tested.

103
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:26,958
The baby is not ours!

104
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:30,625
It's a baby girl.

105
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:33,375
A girl? It's my daughter!

106
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,708
Thank God she's okay.

107
00:10:36,375 --> 00:10:37,250
I was terrified.

108
00:10:39,208 --> 00:10:42,541
-Get somebody to collect the blood sample.
-Yes, sir. Come with me.

109
00:10:49,625 --> 00:10:52,583
-Hello?
-Tung, another baby is missing.

110
00:10:52,666 --> 00:10:54,000
I'll be home late tonight.

111
00:10:54,083 --> 00:10:56,250
-All right.
-Are you upset?

112
00:10:56,708 --> 00:10:58,583
No. Go do your job.

113
00:12:31,458 --> 00:12:34,333
You just love to fight.
I'll chop your head off next time.

114
00:12:34,458 --> 00:12:35,416
Guard the door.

115
00:12:42,625 --> 00:12:46,208
Master, here is the baby boy you want.

116
00:13:05,875 --> 00:13:09,958
Take the 19th prince inside,

117
00:13:10,458 --> 00:13:13,541
together with other princes.

118
00:13:13,625 --> 00:13:14,833
Yes, Master.

119
00:13:15,125 --> 00:13:16,291
San.

120
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:22,041
Your heart is beating too fast.

121
00:13:22,416 --> 00:13:23,500
Not quite.

122
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:27,666
Memory does you no good.

123
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:30,541
You can't have feelings and emotions.

124
00:13:30,625 --> 00:13:31,708
I don't have any.

125
00:13:31,791 --> 00:13:35,541
I'll wait for the next propitious day.

126
00:13:35,958 --> 00:13:38,958
And among the babies,

127
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,333
I'll choose one to be the King.

128
00:13:45,833 --> 00:13:50,458
China must have a King.

129
00:13:51,083 --> 00:13:54,583
China must have a King.

130
00:13:54,666 --> 00:13:57,750
China must have a King.

131
00:14:16,583 --> 00:14:18,541
Either you climb up by yourself

132
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,166
or you fall down! No one can help you!

133
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:23,500
Climb up!

134
00:14:24,625 --> 00:14:27,041
Ching, climb up!

135
00:14:30,583 --> 00:14:34,125
Don't fall down! Climb!

136
00:15:29,333 --> 00:15:30,583
Another nightmare?

137
00:15:32,916 --> 00:15:34,083
May I come in?

138
00:15:34,375 --> 00:15:35,750
I'm working.

139
00:15:36,041 --> 00:15:38,250
You know I don't like to be disturbed.

140
00:15:39,208 --> 00:15:42,458
I've been dreaming of
the invisible suit in the past few years.

141
00:15:43,583 --> 00:15:46,708
Last night, I dreamt it finally worked
under the sun.

142
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:49,541
Has it always been kept in the safe?

143
00:15:50,375 --> 00:15:52,208
Yes. Why?

144
00:15:52,291 --> 00:15:54,916
The police called today.

145
00:15:55,208 --> 00:15:59,000
They asked me how one could be invisible.
They wanted my opinion.

146
00:16:03,333 --> 00:16:05,250
Before the invisible suit is finished,

147
00:16:05,333 --> 00:16:07,083
you don't want others to know about it.

148
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:11,083
I want to keep it a secret forever.

149
00:16:11,458 --> 00:16:15,708
Because this invention
may easily be used as a weapon of war.

150
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:19,458
Then what is the purpose of
this invisible suit to you?

151
00:16:19,541 --> 00:16:21,958
When I'm glued to my work,

152
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:24,708
I feel happy.

153
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:27,708
Aren't you worried that I might steal it?

154
00:16:28,041 --> 00:16:29,041
No!

155
00:16:29,125 --> 00:16:31,166
People don't steal from themselves.

156
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:34,666
You want some coffee?

157
00:16:35,416 --> 00:16:36,416
Yes, please.

158
00:17:38,916 --> 00:17:39,875
Miss.

159
00:17:40,458 --> 00:17:43,666
The dates of birth of
those 18 babies you gave me...

160
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:44,958
Are they related in any way?

161
00:17:45,416 --> 00:17:46,916
Strange.

162
00:17:47,208 --> 00:17:50,416
They all have a royal destiny.

163
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,166
All destined to be emperor!

164
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:53,333
Emperor?

165
00:17:53,541 --> 00:17:55,666
Who would want to snatch
so many little emperors?

166
00:17:59,791 --> 00:18:01,083
Sister!

167
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:35,750
You want some? Come over, then.

168
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:47,416
Come on.

169
00:18:49,125 --> 00:18:50,000
Come on.

170
00:18:57,625 --> 00:18:58,750
Are you talking to me?

171
00:19:03,125 --> 00:19:04,166
No.

172
00:19:10,708 --> 00:19:16,333
Sister, may I kiss you?

173
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:25,583
Why are you smiling?

174
00:19:25,708 --> 00:19:27,875
Am I? Not really.

175
00:19:42,916 --> 00:19:45,000
Go down!

176
00:19:45,125 --> 00:19:47,083
Go over there!

177
00:19:51,833 --> 00:19:53,833
Oh, God! Who are they, Lau?

178
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:57,666
Three armed robbers with records
just robbed a armored vehicle.

179
00:19:57,833 --> 00:19:59,833
They were chased to this chemical plant.

180
00:19:59,916 --> 00:20:02,833
Eight hostages inside,
including the driver and the guard.

181
00:20:02,916 --> 00:20:03,833
So, what do we do?

182
00:20:03,916 --> 00:20:05,791
-We'll force them out.
-Give me one!

183
00:20:12,333 --> 00:20:13,333
Get ready!

184
00:20:13,833 --> 00:20:14,833
Fire!

185
00:20:19,166 --> 00:20:22,208
Don't panic, they're only tear bombs.
Wear a mask!

186
00:20:25,375 --> 00:20:26,375
Come out!

187
00:20:27,333 --> 00:20:29,083
Damn! Get out!

188
00:20:31,625 --> 00:20:32,625
Give me the gun.

189
00:20:38,166 --> 00:20:40,375
-Don't shoot!
-Listen, you all!

190
00:20:40,458 --> 00:20:42,583
There are many more hostages inside.

191
00:20:42,666 --> 00:20:44,833
Get me a helicopter within two hours

192
00:20:45,375 --> 00:20:48,250
or I'll kill one every five minutes.

193
00:21:11,333 --> 00:21:13,583
Good morning, everybody!

194
00:21:15,208 --> 00:21:16,291
Who's she?

195
00:21:16,666 --> 00:21:18,083
Professional shooter, Chat.

196
00:21:18,166 --> 00:21:20,208
Sir, don't call me that.

197
00:21:20,416 --> 00:21:22,416
I only kill those that deserve it.

198
00:21:22,583 --> 00:21:23,500
Call me Thief Catcher.

199
00:21:24,125 --> 00:21:26,291
The police won't hire you.

200
00:21:26,416 --> 00:21:27,416
Hire?

201
00:21:27,708 --> 00:21:31,208
Sir, I'll do you a favor this time.

202
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:32,333
It's free!

203
00:22:17,875 --> 00:22:18,916
Get them!

204
00:22:23,458 --> 00:22:26,208
I surrender! Don't shoot!

205
00:22:29,291 --> 00:22:30,291
Rescue the hostages.

206
00:22:37,458 --> 00:22:38,416
Come on.

207
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:39,583
Take them over there.

208
00:22:46,833 --> 00:22:48,000
Check if there are others.

209
00:22:48,083 --> 00:22:48,916
Go.

210
00:23:01,125 --> 00:23:02,125
I'm married.

211
00:23:02,333 --> 00:23:03,291
Stupid.

212
00:23:03,708 --> 00:23:07,250
Looks like I'm the only one
who can get your son back.

213
00:23:07,458 --> 00:23:09,750
Pay me 500 thousand if found alive,

214
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:12,750
150 thousand
if you don't mind that he's dead.

215
00:23:12,833 --> 00:23:15,000
I only take gold. Call me if interested.

216
00:23:15,083 --> 00:23:16,208
My phone number!

217
00:23:59,458 --> 00:24:02,833
The one who used the newspaper
to place the ad wasn't here for babies.

218
00:24:02,916 --> 00:24:04,375
-Put everyone on alert.
-Yes, sir.

219
00:24:04,458 --> 00:24:05,791
Mrs. Lau, you may go.

220
00:24:07,958 --> 00:24:09,250
Please show me your pass.

221
00:24:14,041 --> 00:24:15,500
What brings you here tonight?

222
00:24:15,583 --> 00:24:18,250
I promised the head nurse
to come help every week.

223
00:24:18,375 --> 00:24:19,583
The old lady upstairs...

224
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:21,750
Won't do physiotherapy
until you come, right?

225
00:24:21,833 --> 00:24:22,750
So you know.

226
00:24:23,125 --> 00:24:25,583
I'm so busy,
I'm afraid I can't take care of you.

227
00:24:26,416 --> 00:24:27,958
-Be careful.
-You, too.

228
00:25:08,583 --> 00:25:10,250
You're the one who placed the ad?

229
00:25:10,333 --> 00:25:11,291
You're a cop?

230
00:25:12,833 --> 00:25:13,875
Listen.

231
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,583
I'm going to kill all babies tonight.

232
00:25:26,541 --> 00:25:27,583
What are you doing?

233
00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:32,458
No!

234
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,416
Stay away, or I'll kill her!

235
00:25:36,333 --> 00:25:37,500
Calm down!

236
00:25:37,791 --> 00:25:40,125
Drop that or I'll kill her!

237
00:25:41,041 --> 00:25:42,041
You drop it first.

238
00:25:42,583 --> 00:25:43,625
I'll kill her.

239
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:45,208
Okay, I drop it.

240
00:25:45,375 --> 00:25:47,458
Go inside!

241
00:25:47,916 --> 00:25:48,916
I'll kill her!

242
00:25:50,041 --> 00:25:51,041
Go inside!

243
00:25:52,041 --> 00:25:53,458
Those doctors killed my son.

244
00:25:53,583 --> 00:25:54,875
This is revenge!

245
00:25:57,375 --> 00:26:00,375
-I'll kill all the babies.
-Dr. Wong, please come to the ER.

246
00:26:00,458 --> 00:26:02,541
Dr. Wong, please come to the...

247
00:26:04,875 --> 00:26:06,000
I'll kill all the babies!

248
00:26:07,125 --> 00:26:09,875
You're bleeding! Wipe it off.

249
00:26:10,041 --> 00:26:11,041
I'm fine.

250
00:26:15,416 --> 00:26:17,291
You think we can break down the door?

251
00:26:17,375 --> 00:26:19,250
No way. It's so thick.

252
00:26:20,958 --> 00:26:21,958
Let me try.

253
00:26:36,125 --> 00:26:37,458
The keys are just outside.

254
00:26:40,708 --> 00:26:42,875
I almost can get them.

255
00:26:43,416 --> 00:26:44,458
Keep cool.

256
00:26:44,541 --> 00:26:46,125
The lunatic won't be back that fast.

257
00:26:49,666 --> 00:26:51,375
I'm only worried about the babies.

258
00:26:51,541 --> 00:26:53,583
You heard what he said just now?

259
00:26:54,166 --> 00:26:55,166
Let me try.

260
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Why don't you go?

261
00:27:32,208 --> 00:27:33,208
Roger.

262
00:27:33,833 --> 00:27:35,500
Stay calm. Speak slowly.

263
00:27:38,125 --> 00:27:39,416
-One person only?
-Yes.

264
00:27:41,458 --> 00:27:43,875
Why are you so late? Are you a new guy?

265
00:27:54,666 --> 00:27:56,083
-Take him outside.
-Yes.

266
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,916
Don't move! Get up!

267
00:27:59,541 --> 00:28:01,916
I won't leave any babies alive!

268
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Honey!

269
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:04,541
Honey!

270
00:28:06,458 --> 00:28:07,708
I've subdued the lunatic.

271
00:28:07,791 --> 00:28:09,916
-I know.
-Thanks for informing me in time.

272
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,208
-I didn't come for nothing.
-Come.

273
00:28:21,375 --> 00:28:22,750
-Any reward?
-No!

274
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:27,583
-Don't keep the old lady waiting.
-I'm coming.

275
00:28:33,291 --> 00:28:35,625
Naughty! Laughing at me?

276
00:28:39,083 --> 00:28:40,833
Are you going home with me?

277
00:28:40,958 --> 00:28:42,708
No. The real one hasn't turned up yet.

278
00:28:42,833 --> 00:28:43,833
What?

279
00:28:43,958 --> 00:28:45,166
Why so surprised?

280
00:28:46,291 --> 00:28:49,250
You're so nosy.
I'll take you out for a ride!

281
00:28:53,916 --> 00:28:54,875
Let's go.

282
00:28:56,916 --> 00:28:58,458
Officer Lau, a baby was taken.

283
00:29:11,083 --> 00:29:13,208
Don't shoot! The baby might be there!

284
00:29:17,791 --> 00:29:19,750
Don't shoot! Attention, don't shoot!

285
00:29:27,875 --> 00:29:29,333
I'm leaving!

286
00:29:38,666 --> 00:29:39,666
Go after her!

287
00:29:42,541 --> 00:29:43,541
The Thief Catcher?

288
00:29:50,250 --> 00:29:51,916
Stay awake.

289
00:29:52,166 --> 00:29:54,250
There's more fun to come.

290
00:29:54,458 --> 00:29:55,458
Isn't it fun?

291
00:30:00,333 --> 00:30:02,208
So there you are. Catch me!

292
00:30:23,250 --> 00:30:24,750
Take a rest first.

293
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:29,625
Can't believe it! Lagging behind!

294
00:30:29,791 --> 00:30:31,333
What a shame!

295
00:30:44,166 --> 00:30:45,791
So sinister. Not even a noise?

296
00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:48,500
A woman.

297
00:30:48,875 --> 00:30:50,250
A bitch!

298
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,083
Hey. Hey.

299
00:30:58,041 --> 00:31:01,291
Stop. Stop. Stop!

300
00:31:04,291 --> 00:31:07,208
Tell me, why did you steal so many babies?

301
00:31:07,333 --> 00:31:09,375
What? You blame me for that?

302
00:31:11,166 --> 00:31:12,500
You look pretty smart.

303
00:31:12,666 --> 00:31:14,083
So you're Wonder Woman?

304
00:31:14,166 --> 00:31:17,000
-And you're Thief Catcher?
-Don't get in my way, then.

305
00:31:18,041 --> 00:31:21,875
How can you use the baby as bait?

306
00:31:22,041 --> 00:31:23,041
How despicable!

307
00:31:23,208 --> 00:31:24,125
That's enough!

308
00:31:28,291 --> 00:31:29,500
Put the baby down first.

309
00:31:29,916 --> 00:31:32,041
Let's see if you can make me!

310
00:32:03,708 --> 00:32:05,416
That was just a warm-up. Ready now?

311
00:32:12,916 --> 00:32:14,250
Wait...

312
00:32:23,458 --> 00:32:24,458
What is it?

313
00:32:27,625 --> 00:32:28,625
The invisible thing?

314
00:32:31,666 --> 00:32:32,791
Something else is here?

315
00:32:55,875 --> 00:32:57,000
It seems to be on my side.

316
00:33:07,666 --> 00:33:08,666
The baby!

317
00:33:17,333 --> 00:33:18,166
Be careful!

318
00:33:37,458 --> 00:33:39,458
How's the baby?

319
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:42,625
Wait, who are you?

320
00:33:45,416 --> 00:33:47,958
Everything's fine now.

321
00:34:02,375 --> 00:34:04,250
All right, don't try my patience!

322
00:34:04,333 --> 00:34:05,333
Who are you?

323
00:34:05,416 --> 00:34:06,500
Let's go, Chat!

324
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
San, it's you?

325
00:34:08,083 --> 00:34:09,666
Let's go! Don't pull me.

326
00:34:09,791 --> 00:34:11,458
I can walk on my own.

327
00:34:12,458 --> 00:34:15,750
Hello? I suspect it was
the Thief Catcher you hired.

328
00:34:16,291 --> 00:34:17,833
How do you know?

329
00:34:18,416 --> 00:34:20,333
Ask her to bring the baby back at once!

330
00:34:32,541 --> 00:34:33,541
Call the doctor.

331
00:34:37,541 --> 00:34:39,041
-How's the baby?
-Save him!

332
00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:40,250
You can count on me!

333
00:34:43,291 --> 00:34:44,291
To the ER!

334
00:35:19,333 --> 00:35:20,458
Doctor, how's the baby?

335
00:35:21,666 --> 00:35:23,583
Sorry, it's too late.

336
00:36:07,666 --> 00:36:09,458
-Call the parents.
-Yes, sir.

337
00:36:12,291 --> 00:36:15,791
Ching, don't go!

338
00:36:16,166 --> 00:36:18,583
Master hates dummies like me.

339
00:36:18,708 --> 00:36:20,625
I'll miss you!

340
00:36:21,208 --> 00:36:23,250
Take care of yourself.

341
00:36:24,791 --> 00:36:25,791
Don't cry.

342
00:36:27,958 --> 00:36:28,958
Ching!

343
00:36:29,291 --> 00:36:30,291
Let her go!

344
00:36:33,083 --> 00:36:34,083
Kneel down.

345
00:36:36,208 --> 00:36:38,416
Tung, you must stay here

346
00:36:39,041 --> 00:36:40,500
and finish the task

347
00:36:40,583 --> 00:36:43,000
that I want you both to do by yourself.

348
00:36:43,250 --> 00:36:45,541
You're going to uphold justice for me.

349
00:36:45,875 --> 00:36:47,375
On your own.

350
00:37:04,375 --> 00:37:05,916
Tung, why are you crying?

351
00:37:06,625 --> 00:37:07,625
I'm not.

352
00:37:09,583 --> 00:37:10,583
Tell me why.

353
00:37:11,875 --> 00:37:12,875
It's nothing.

354
00:37:14,208 --> 00:37:15,833
How's the case today?

355
00:37:19,333 --> 00:37:21,500
The stolen baby fell and died.

356
00:37:33,666 --> 00:37:36,625
It's been 10 years. You're still great.

357
00:37:37,125 --> 00:37:39,291
Where did that monster
get the invisible suit?

358
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,708
He has orders to steal more babies.

359
00:37:41,791 --> 00:37:42,958
Will you interfere?

360
00:37:43,666 --> 00:37:44,833
No, thanks.

361
00:37:45,666 --> 00:37:47,708
When I escaped from that cave,

362
00:37:48,083 --> 00:37:50,458
you spared me after you caught me.

363
00:37:50,541 --> 00:37:52,375
Now I take good care of myself.

364
00:37:52,875 --> 00:37:54,666
Why did he snatch so many babies?

365
00:37:55,166 --> 00:37:58,166
He'll choose one to be King
during the next sun eclipse.

366
00:37:58,750 --> 00:38:01,583
And the rest of the babies
will become killers, like us?

367
00:38:01,708 --> 00:38:03,958
Master will turn them like our generation.

368
00:38:04,083 --> 00:38:06,750
San, do them a favor.

369
00:38:07,041 --> 00:38:08,416
Simply kill them.

370
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:10,458
For three years,
that monster corrupted me.

371
00:38:10,625 --> 00:38:14,416
After I escaped from him,
I spent 10 years returning to normal.

372
00:38:14,583 --> 00:38:16,666
I don't want all babies becoming monsters.

373
00:38:16,916 --> 00:38:19,291
Pretend that you know nothing.
Don't interfere.

374
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:20,958
If Master gives the order,

375
00:38:21,166 --> 00:38:22,375
I'll kill you as well.

376
00:38:22,875 --> 00:38:24,041
Then do it now!

377
00:38:28,041 --> 00:38:29,500
You won't be lucky next time!

378
00:38:32,416 --> 00:38:35,583
Can I pretend that I know nothing?

379
00:38:53,958 --> 00:38:55,375
You're not Ching anymore.

380
00:38:55,458 --> 00:38:58,791
From now on, you are San.

381
00:39:11,458 --> 00:39:14,125
Get the invisible suit within 10 days

382
00:39:14,250 --> 00:39:17,916
and kill the doctor.

383
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,625
Do it or die.

384
00:39:31,208 --> 00:39:32,208
What are you doing?

385
00:39:38,625 --> 00:39:42,625
It's dangerous in here. Leave, please!

386
00:39:43,208 --> 00:39:46,041
What's so dangerous?
You're always in here.

387
00:39:46,166 --> 00:39:48,625
Are you keeping something from me?

388
00:39:53,208 --> 00:39:54,208
What don't you know?

389
00:39:54,291 --> 00:39:56,208
The invisible suit belongs to me, too.

390
00:39:56,291 --> 00:39:58,750
Yet I didn't know
that it can stand UV light.

391
00:39:58,833 --> 00:40:00,458
No, it still can't.

392
00:40:00,916 --> 00:40:03,333
If it can, you'll be
the first one to know.

393
00:40:04,333 --> 00:40:06,500
What have you been working on
the past few days?

394
00:40:09,458 --> 00:40:11,958
I'm working on this plant.

395
00:40:15,250 --> 00:40:18,916
They were dead before,
but they're alive again.

396
00:40:24,416 --> 00:40:25,375
Any flowers?

397
00:40:25,458 --> 00:40:27,458
Yes. In a month's time.

398
00:40:32,375 --> 00:40:33,375
Ching.

399
00:40:35,833 --> 00:40:37,916
Will you put them under the sun everyday

400
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,583
and water them at night for me?

401
00:40:42,791 --> 00:40:45,166
Lucky stars.
You taught me how to make them.

402
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,416
You shall see the flowers bloom.

403
00:40:53,416 --> 00:40:56,458
Get the invisible suit within 10 days

404
00:40:57,375 --> 00:41:00,583
and kill the doctor.

405
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:02,458
Do it or die.

406
00:41:04,458 --> 00:41:07,291
Your men detained me for over two hours!

407
00:41:07,375 --> 00:41:09,541
Don't blame me for that.
It was an accident.

408
00:41:09,625 --> 00:41:12,000
Accident? The baby died because of you!

409
00:41:12,083 --> 00:41:14,291
What? I didn't push the baby down.

410
00:41:14,416 --> 00:41:16,291
It's all Wonder Woman's fault.

411
00:41:16,416 --> 00:41:17,375
You may go now.

412
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:19,291
But don't fool yourself.

413
00:41:20,708 --> 00:41:24,250
Don't make a scapegoat of me!

414
00:41:25,125 --> 00:41:27,958
Okay, I'll keep an eye on it.

415
00:41:30,125 --> 00:41:32,666
Mainly keep an eye on my son, miss.

416
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,416
Don't worry, I'll help my client.

417
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:37,708
-Thank you.
-I'm asking for trouble.

418
00:42:02,166 --> 00:42:03,333
Well done.

419
00:42:09,291 --> 00:42:12,041
Why are there so many bird cages?

420
00:42:33,708 --> 00:42:35,541
Oh, no! This will alert the monster.

421
00:43:03,666 --> 00:43:04,666
Hey!

422
00:43:06,625 --> 00:43:07,625
Hey!

423
00:43:20,666 --> 00:43:22,000
Damn. I took a needle.

424
00:43:29,666 --> 00:43:31,458
Let's see how long you can survive.

425
00:43:34,125 --> 00:43:39,083
Do you know who the female intruder was?

426
00:43:39,875 --> 00:43:40,750
No.

427
00:43:40,833 --> 00:43:43,333
I have someone in mind.

428
00:43:43,583 --> 00:43:46,833
But she should have died 10 years ago.

429
00:43:47,875 --> 00:43:48,833
Right!

430
00:43:49,125 --> 00:43:50,833
I killed Chat myself.

431
00:43:51,291 --> 00:43:54,958
Now only Wonder Woman could get in.

432
00:43:55,416 --> 00:43:57,583
She's been meddling with our plan.

433
00:43:58,125 --> 00:43:59,833
She's probably the intruder.

434
00:44:00,541 --> 00:44:02,166
Let me kill her, Master.

435
00:44:02,625 --> 00:44:04,708
Leave such things to others.

436
00:44:05,125 --> 00:44:06,291
Kau.

437
00:44:07,291 --> 00:44:09,250
Kill the woman.

438
00:44:09,666 --> 00:44:12,625
And if necessary, die with her.

439
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:31,750
You monster.

440
00:44:32,208 --> 00:44:34,458
I won't let the poison get to my brain!

441
00:44:59,333 --> 00:45:02,625
This case is not related
to the previous cases.

442
00:45:02,708 --> 00:45:05,791
We promised the mayor
that it wouldn't happen again.

443
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,000
Here's your deposit!

444
00:45:08,625 --> 00:45:09,583
What deposit?

445
00:45:09,666 --> 00:45:11,000
I quit your son's case.

446
00:45:12,416 --> 00:45:14,250
We'll talk later. I'm in a meeting.

447
00:45:14,333 --> 00:45:16,416
No! There's nothing to talk about.

448
00:45:16,541 --> 00:45:18,750
You must have known something.

449
00:45:18,916 --> 00:45:21,291
For the babies' sake, please tell us.

450
00:45:21,541 --> 00:45:23,166
What's the point of telling you?

451
00:45:23,250 --> 00:45:25,875
If you could handle it,
you wouldn't have to hire me.

452
00:45:25,958 --> 00:45:27,833
-For justice, you...
-To hell with justice!

453
00:45:28,333 --> 00:45:30,291
I almost got killed!

454
00:45:57,125 --> 00:45:58,500
You got the child killed!

455
00:46:02,041 --> 00:46:03,583
Tell me what you know.

456
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,375
You think I'll listen to you?

457
00:46:05,708 --> 00:46:06,750
You will.

458
00:46:06,833 --> 00:46:10,166
When that doll fell down just now,
you saved it without a second thought.

459
00:46:40,583 --> 00:46:42,250
Yes, I killed the baby.

460
00:46:43,625 --> 00:46:44,916
But I'm dying, too.

461
00:46:46,250 --> 00:46:47,750
Let's call it even!

462
00:46:50,083 --> 00:46:51,458
Won't you leave me alone?

463
00:46:51,791 --> 00:46:54,208
I only want to die peacefully here.

464
00:46:55,208 --> 00:46:57,791
I want to know who snatched the babies.

465
00:46:59,250 --> 00:47:00,833
Don't hurt the Invisible Woman!

466
00:47:01,208 --> 00:47:03,875
She's only a puppet.

467
00:47:04,041 --> 00:47:05,125
That old monster!

468
00:47:05,708 --> 00:47:07,916
I won't let his needle kill me!

469
00:47:08,583 --> 00:47:09,583
Don't do that!

470
00:47:11,833 --> 00:47:14,000
Go away before I lose my mind.

471
00:47:16,458 --> 00:47:17,458
No.

472
00:47:17,958 --> 00:47:18,958
You'll die!

473
00:47:21,083 --> 00:47:22,708
If it's for a good reason, it's okay.

474
00:47:26,750 --> 00:47:28,875
I can only block the needle for now.

475
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,208
But I can't get it out.

476
00:47:32,541 --> 00:47:36,458
Okay. I'll help you
to get the babies back.

477
00:47:36,750 --> 00:47:39,500
If we are to succeed,
we must get San to help us.

478
00:47:39,583 --> 00:47:41,000
-The Invisible Woman?
-Yes.

479
00:47:41,833 --> 00:47:44,416
We must be careful.

480
00:47:45,083 --> 00:47:48,541
Because the monster found me
entering his cave last time.

481
00:47:48,625 --> 00:47:49,875
He thought I was you.

482
00:47:50,125 --> 00:47:51,875
So, he's sent Kau to get you.

483
00:48:10,875 --> 00:48:14,291
Officer Lau, a madman's holding
hostages in the train station.

484
00:48:14,375 --> 00:48:16,375
He's destroyed the computer system, too.

485
00:48:16,458 --> 00:48:18,541
A cargo train is speeding
toward the station now.

486
00:48:19,250 --> 00:48:22,125
-When will the train hit the station?
-In about five minutes.

487
00:48:22,208 --> 00:48:23,125
I've got it.

488
00:48:42,541 --> 00:48:43,375
All units get ready.

489
00:48:51,458 --> 00:48:52,541
Watch out for the mines!

490
00:48:55,416 --> 00:48:56,375
Don't step on it!

491
00:49:00,875 --> 00:49:01,875
Don't move!

492
00:49:04,250 --> 00:49:06,750
Watch out! There are mines!

493
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:17,958
Go now!

494
00:49:18,041 --> 00:49:20,250
The train will crash in one minute.

495
00:49:20,333 --> 00:49:21,333
Get inside!

496
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,583
Save the hostages in there first!

497
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:30,500
Why don't you go?

498
00:49:57,708 --> 00:49:59,291
Run!

499
00:50:28,708 --> 00:50:30,458
Watch out! It's crashing!

500
00:50:34,041 --> 00:50:35,041
I got it.

501
00:50:46,916 --> 00:50:47,916
Go to hell!

502
00:51:06,041 --> 00:51:07,541
Run!

503
00:51:13,541 --> 00:51:15,083
Run! Go!

504
00:51:15,166 --> 00:51:16,875
Supervisor, how can we stop the train?

505
00:51:17,250 --> 00:51:19,208
The computer system has been destroyed.

506
00:51:19,291 --> 00:51:20,875
We can't stop it now! Run!

507
00:51:25,291 --> 00:51:26,583
LEE RIVER
CHAK FUNG

508
00:51:33,875 --> 00:51:36,583
Run! The train is here!

509
00:52:07,666 --> 00:52:08,666
Catch it!

510
00:52:15,166 --> 00:52:16,166
Let's go!

511
00:52:56,083 --> 00:52:57,083
Honey.

512
00:53:02,375 --> 00:53:03,583
What did the doctor say?

513
00:53:04,958 --> 00:53:08,458
If you're lucky,
you could walk within six months.

514
00:53:09,333 --> 00:53:10,375
Otherwise?

515
00:53:12,833 --> 00:53:14,000
Otherwise...

516
00:53:16,916 --> 00:53:18,333
You may become a cripple.

517
00:53:22,125 --> 00:53:23,250
Cheer up.

518
00:53:24,458 --> 00:53:28,375
As Wonder Woman's husband,
I'll stand by you.

519
00:53:30,166 --> 00:53:31,291
When did you find out?

520
00:53:32,666 --> 00:53:33,875
At the station,

521
00:53:35,541 --> 00:53:36,750
when you looked at me,

522
00:53:37,791 --> 00:53:39,458
unwilling to go in.

523
00:53:45,625 --> 00:53:48,750
No more snickering from now on

524
00:53:50,958 --> 00:53:52,458
and no more hidden tears.

525
00:53:53,833 --> 00:53:56,541
Just tell me everything.

526
00:54:04,875 --> 00:54:05,875
Okay?

527
00:54:11,166 --> 00:54:12,166
Oh, darling.

528
00:54:50,375 --> 00:54:52,000
Hey! There are flower buds!

529
00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:04,791
What's wrong? Sit down.

530
00:55:04,875 --> 00:55:07,583
No, I just got a clue.

531
00:55:08,708 --> 00:55:10,000
I must write it down now!

532
00:55:10,708 --> 00:55:11,875
Sit down first.

533
00:55:12,375 --> 00:55:13,375
Get out now!

534
00:55:28,333 --> 00:55:29,791
How long have you known this?

535
00:55:30,666 --> 00:55:35,250
I've known it since I started
working on the invisible suit.

536
00:55:36,458 --> 00:55:39,083
I discovered that it emitted toxins.

537
00:55:40,291 --> 00:55:42,458
So I've always told you
to stay out of here.

538
00:55:42,750 --> 00:55:45,375
But the plant have buds now.

539
00:55:46,541 --> 00:55:49,791
That means I'll be all right.

540
00:55:51,291 --> 00:55:52,541
Come on, get out of here.

541
00:55:53,208 --> 00:55:56,041
We're partners.
How can I leave you like this?

542
00:56:00,916 --> 00:56:01,916
Where are my glasses?

543
00:56:02,791 --> 00:56:03,833
You're wearing them.

544
00:56:13,125 --> 00:56:15,083
I will not die

545
00:56:15,625 --> 00:56:17,000
before the suit is completed.

546
00:56:19,250 --> 00:56:21,333
I can smell the fragrance of your hair.

547
00:56:52,916 --> 00:56:54,916
Let's look at the flowers outside.

548
00:57:05,833 --> 00:57:06,833
I'll be all right.

549
00:57:07,666 --> 00:57:08,666
You get out of here!

550
00:57:15,791 --> 00:57:16,791
Let me in!

551
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:19,000
Let me in!

552
00:57:21,333 --> 00:57:23,791
I'll stay even if you can get in.

553
00:57:27,958 --> 00:57:31,708
The suit will be ready
when the flowers bloom.

554
00:57:32,875 --> 00:57:35,166
You've promised
to take care of them till then.

555
00:57:35,541 --> 00:57:36,791
Did you forget?

556
00:57:48,833 --> 00:57:49,833
San.

557
00:57:51,250 --> 00:57:53,041
You still go to see that monster?

558
00:57:53,583 --> 00:57:55,833
You think he will let the doctor live?

559
00:57:56,166 --> 00:57:58,541
He'll kill him once the suit is completed.

560
00:57:59,208 --> 00:58:00,833
You're poisoned by his needles?

561
00:58:03,333 --> 00:58:04,583
If you help us,

562
00:58:05,333 --> 00:58:07,333
Wonder Woman and I can kill him.

563
00:58:27,708 --> 00:58:30,208
If you fear death, how can you help her?

564
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:32,666
I won't thank you anyway.

565
00:58:32,750 --> 00:58:34,125
You saved my life.

566
00:58:34,250 --> 00:58:37,625
But to protect the doctor,
you let that monster control you.

567
00:58:37,708 --> 00:58:39,666
You know you've harmed so many babies.

568
00:58:41,208 --> 00:58:43,375
You can deceive others, but not yourself.

569
00:58:43,916 --> 00:58:45,916
Wonder Woman can help you now.

570
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:47,833
See you at the same spot tomorrow.

571
00:58:48,125 --> 00:58:49,500
I'll wait till you come.

572
00:58:53,250 --> 00:58:54,416
You have to come.

573
00:59:02,666 --> 00:59:04,791
I can't wait, hurry up.

574
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:11,000
I've done it!

575
00:59:13,083 --> 00:59:14,291
Ching. Ching!

576
00:59:15,083 --> 00:59:16,000
Ching!

577
00:59:25,625 --> 00:59:26,666
Lucky star.

578
00:59:27,750 --> 00:59:29,583
Ching, I've completed the invisible suit.

579
00:59:36,250 --> 00:59:40,166
Why you still haven't got that suit?

580
00:59:40,250 --> 00:59:43,833
It doesn't work under the sun yet.

581
00:59:44,166 --> 00:59:46,375
Without it, the King's army
may be weakened.

582
00:59:46,666 --> 00:59:49,333
It will soon be finished.

583
00:59:49,708 --> 00:59:52,250
Give the doctor a few more days.

584
00:59:52,875 --> 00:59:56,375
Get it anyway

585
00:59:56,666 --> 00:59:59,041
before tomorrow's sunset.

586
00:59:59,125 --> 01:00:01,416
Kau will help you then.

587
01:00:02,458 --> 01:00:04,333
Master, in your plan,

588
01:00:04,458 --> 01:00:07,458
all my work is so inconsequential.

589
01:00:07,875 --> 01:00:12,666
If I find a King among those babies,

590
01:00:12,750 --> 01:00:15,250
you'll be honored for your services.

591
01:00:25,500 --> 01:00:28,250
All princes should be asleep.

592
01:00:28,875 --> 01:00:31,166
You should go to sleep, too.

593
01:00:41,250 --> 01:00:42,458
The 18th of September.

594
01:00:45,375 --> 01:00:46,375
Today,

595
01:00:48,041 --> 01:00:51,500
I finally solved the UV light problem.

596
01:00:57,375 --> 01:00:59,958
But it's the end of my life, too.

597
01:01:00,375 --> 01:01:02,625
From the first working day,

598
01:01:04,041 --> 01:01:06,458
I knew I would die of toxins.

599
01:01:07,833 --> 01:01:09,625
If Ching weren't here,

600
01:01:10,666 --> 01:01:12,625
I wouldn't be able to face my life.

601
01:01:14,208 --> 01:01:17,708
If she knows that I only hope

602
01:01:18,750 --> 01:01:20,458
to take her hands

603
01:01:20,833 --> 01:01:22,750
and see the blooming flowers with her,

604
01:01:23,875 --> 01:01:26,666
will she still kill me?

605
01:01:28,125 --> 01:01:30,500
The day will come soon.

606
01:01:31,041 --> 01:01:34,875
Get the invisible suit anyway,

607
01:01:35,833 --> 01:01:38,458
no matter what,

608
01:01:40,291 --> 01:01:44,750
and kill the doctor!

609
01:01:59,208 --> 01:02:01,958
Doctor, I'll never return to you.

610
01:02:03,208 --> 01:02:06,000
I won't leave until I see you.

611
01:02:06,583 --> 01:02:07,750
Believe me,

612
01:02:08,916 --> 01:02:10,541
you are in great danger.

613
01:02:10,666 --> 01:02:12,333
Leave the lab now.

614
01:02:16,833 --> 01:02:18,291
Damn it!

615
01:02:18,375 --> 01:02:19,875
Even Wonder Woman is late!

616
01:02:20,291 --> 01:02:23,416
I shouldn't have said
I'd wait until she showed up.

617
01:02:24,125 --> 01:02:25,791
Should I leave or not?

618
01:02:37,500 --> 01:02:38,916
Great. You're here!

619
01:02:39,041 --> 01:02:40,500
Master sent me to kill you.

620
01:02:43,083 --> 01:02:44,375
Wait, San.

621
01:02:44,458 --> 01:02:47,250
Go ahead. I won't let you go this time.

622
01:02:47,833 --> 01:02:49,375
You can kill me without conscience?

623
01:02:50,083 --> 01:02:51,958
I must execute Master's order.

624
01:02:52,625 --> 01:02:54,041
But I can promise you

625
01:02:54,166 --> 01:02:56,208
that I'll do you a favor after you die.

626
01:02:56,291 --> 01:02:58,708
Wait! Maybe I'm not the one
who will get killed.

627
01:02:58,791 --> 01:03:02,083
It could be you.
Tell me your last wish now!

628
01:03:03,500 --> 01:03:05,750
-Take care of the doctor for me.
-The doctor?

629
01:03:23,583 --> 01:03:24,583
Save the doctor for me.

630
01:03:35,250 --> 01:03:37,000
San, what are you doing?

631
01:03:37,083 --> 01:03:39,791
She's not coming to kill you.
She came to kill herself.

632
01:03:40,500 --> 01:03:42,083
You give up your life to save him?

633
01:03:42,375 --> 01:03:43,375
My life?

634
01:03:44,708 --> 01:03:47,375
I am just a beast to kill.

635
01:03:47,916 --> 01:03:49,375
A beast doesn't have feelings

636
01:03:49,458 --> 01:03:51,333
or sacrifice itself for another.

637
01:04:01,541 --> 01:04:05,541
Life is more meaningful than death,
if you can face yourself.

638
01:04:06,041 --> 01:04:07,500
I simply can't face myself.

639
01:04:07,791 --> 01:04:08,958
I can't face him, either.

640
01:04:09,375 --> 01:04:11,166
San!

641
01:04:16,333 --> 01:04:17,500
So you're all leaving?

642
01:04:19,250 --> 01:04:21,500
Damn it! Can't you stand still?

643
01:04:21,583 --> 01:04:23,291
My bike is better!

644
01:04:25,541 --> 01:04:26,708
Wait for me!

645
01:04:32,166 --> 01:04:33,166
San!

646
01:04:33,416 --> 01:04:35,250
You can change yourself from now on?

647
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:37,791
So what? I'm still San!

648
01:04:37,875 --> 01:04:39,750
You can be another Chat! Like her.

649
01:04:39,833 --> 01:04:42,833
Too late! Leave me alone!

650
01:04:48,208 --> 01:04:50,916
Shit! Even a bike can't catch up to them?

651
01:04:51,083 --> 01:04:52,083
Go!

652
01:04:57,541 --> 01:05:00,416
You've shunned the past.
So this is your true self!

653
01:05:01,208 --> 01:05:02,583
Then I don't deserve to live!

654
01:05:06,333 --> 01:05:07,458
No!

655
01:05:20,666 --> 01:05:21,666
Oh, God!

656
01:05:27,083 --> 01:05:29,500
You two are in great trouble.

657
01:05:30,208 --> 01:05:32,791
How lucky. Brace yourselves!

658
01:05:47,041 --> 01:05:48,041
Tung?

659
01:05:49,208 --> 01:05:50,208
Ching?

660
01:05:51,333 --> 01:05:55,000
Let go of my hand, or we'll both fall!

661
01:05:55,250 --> 01:05:56,250
No!

662
01:05:58,458 --> 01:06:00,083
Grab it!

663
01:06:03,625 --> 01:06:05,083
I can't hold on any longer!

664
01:06:08,750 --> 01:06:11,000
I won't let go! We must stay together.

665
01:06:13,208 --> 01:06:14,250
It's you!

666
01:06:15,041 --> 01:06:16,250
You two knew each other?

667
01:06:20,416 --> 01:06:21,458
I don't remember.

668
01:06:21,666 --> 01:06:23,000
The past is not important.

669
01:06:23,083 --> 01:06:25,416
What's important is the thing
you want to do now.

670
01:06:26,500 --> 01:06:28,666
So tell me, what do you want to do?

671
01:06:31,083 --> 01:06:33,708
Master sent Kau to kill the doctor.
I need to go save him.

672
01:06:34,416 --> 01:06:35,416
The doctor?

673
01:07:07,083 --> 01:07:08,083
Give it to me.

674
01:07:38,958 --> 01:07:41,083
The invisible suit is UV light-proof now.

675
01:07:41,625 --> 01:07:43,041
Nobody can find it.

676
01:07:44,916 --> 01:07:45,750
No!

677
01:07:51,250 --> 01:07:52,250
Ching.

678
01:07:53,583 --> 01:07:55,333
I want to tell you a lot of things.

679
01:07:56,666 --> 01:07:58,333
It's all inside the gift box.

680
01:08:12,583 --> 01:08:14,333
No matter how hard you hit, it's useless.

681
01:08:14,416 --> 01:08:16,416
He won't quit till he gets what he wants.

682
01:08:16,500 --> 01:08:17,416
No!

683
01:08:23,541 --> 01:08:24,833
You can't give it to him.

684
01:08:24,916 --> 01:08:26,166
I've got nothing left.

685
01:08:26,916 --> 01:08:28,083
I can't let him die.

686
01:08:46,916 --> 01:08:47,916
Sorry.

687
01:08:48,916 --> 01:08:51,625
I know Master can't make you kill me.

688
01:09:09,791 --> 01:09:11,041
It's not that easy!

689
01:09:18,500 --> 01:09:20,333
Wait...

690
01:09:48,125 --> 01:09:50,125
Idiot, here's the tape.

691
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:52,458
Come and get it!

692
01:10:01,583 --> 01:10:02,583
Goodbye!

693
01:10:04,375 --> 01:10:06,208
It's too hot to stay here.

694
01:10:32,875 --> 01:10:36,041
San, it's better

695
01:10:36,541 --> 01:10:38,250
to have this thing destroyed.

696
01:10:38,916 --> 01:10:40,083
Let's go!

697
01:10:46,458 --> 01:10:47,458
You guys go.

698
01:10:47,583 --> 01:10:49,333
-What about you?
-Leave her alone.

699
01:10:51,416 --> 01:10:52,500
Where are we going?

700
01:10:52,916 --> 01:10:54,666
To save the babies from the cave.

701
01:10:54,958 --> 01:10:57,875
Just the two of us?
Let me get my weapons first.

702
01:11:01,833 --> 01:11:05,125
May I look at the blooming flowers?

703
01:11:50,791 --> 01:11:52,291
All the babies are here.

704
01:11:52,375 --> 01:11:53,875
Don't touch anything.

705
01:11:53,958 --> 01:11:56,333
Babies will die if there's a fight.

706
01:12:19,416 --> 01:12:21,291
Monster, come out and die!

707
01:12:21,458 --> 01:12:23,750
Beware, it's full of methane here.

708
01:12:30,083 --> 01:12:32,291
Monster, you like methane
more than oxygen.

709
01:12:32,458 --> 01:12:33,541
I'll kill you.

710
01:12:38,166 --> 01:12:40,166
How dare you two come here?

711
01:12:40,791 --> 01:12:41,791
Attack her.

712
01:12:44,958 --> 01:12:45,958
Supernatural powers?

713
01:13:04,375 --> 01:13:06,125
You kneel down? Where are your guts?

714
01:13:08,250 --> 01:13:10,458
I can't help it. My legs went limp.

715
01:13:11,166 --> 01:13:13,458
You think you can beat me?

716
01:13:13,875 --> 01:13:16,833
It's no use kneeling. Guards, get them.

717
01:13:17,666 --> 01:13:18,958
We've got no choice now.

718
01:13:19,041 --> 01:13:21,041
You get Master, I'll get the others.

719
01:13:21,666 --> 01:13:22,750
Go!

720
01:14:01,750 --> 01:14:04,458
It's your honor to die before me.

721
01:14:05,458 --> 01:14:08,625
Oh, no. Maybe the methane is
having an effect on me? What do I do?

722
01:14:08,708 --> 01:14:09,708
I can't fight him.

723
01:14:09,791 --> 01:14:11,291
Don't let him concentrate.

724
01:14:12,250 --> 01:14:13,916
I'll kill you this time.

725
01:14:35,083 --> 01:14:36,416
Tung, go with Chat.

726
01:14:36,958 --> 01:14:38,291
No, I'll fight to the end!

727
01:14:38,416 --> 01:14:39,333
No.

728
01:14:40,416 --> 01:14:41,833
You'll get poisoned if you stay.

729
01:14:42,791 --> 01:14:43,875
Let's go!

730
01:14:51,083 --> 01:14:52,833
Get some oxygen first.

731
01:15:14,583 --> 01:15:17,500
Go to hell, all of you!

732
01:15:43,875 --> 01:15:45,958
He's been blown to pieces this time.

733
01:15:48,958 --> 01:15:50,583
Why did this one blow so late?

734
01:15:50,666 --> 01:15:51,791
He's still alive!

735
01:16:12,333 --> 01:16:13,333
To hell with you!

736
01:16:19,291 --> 01:16:20,291
He's afraid of light.

737
01:16:20,708 --> 01:16:21,791
Throw some more.

738
01:17:18,458 --> 01:17:20,666
Does my face still look good?

739
01:17:23,041 --> 01:17:24,833
What?

740
01:17:24,916 --> 01:17:27,583
I don't know if you're all right.
But you scare me.

741
01:17:44,666 --> 01:17:45,666
He isn't dead yet?

742
01:18:12,125 --> 01:18:13,125
How can it be?

743
01:18:13,583 --> 01:18:16,875
His body is gone,
but his mind still there.

744
01:18:41,833 --> 01:18:43,166
He's taken control of me.

745
01:18:44,500 --> 01:18:45,500
Let me help you.

746
01:18:45,958 --> 01:18:46,958
Stay away!

747
01:18:52,625 --> 01:18:53,916
I can't control myself.

748
01:18:59,083 --> 01:19:01,583
Go. Quick!

749
01:19:02,250 --> 01:19:03,458
Go with Chat!

750
01:19:32,916 --> 01:19:34,166
-What do we do?
-Let's go!

751
01:19:51,625 --> 01:19:52,458
Ching.

752
01:19:52,875 --> 01:19:55,208
Don't make me do it again.

753
01:19:55,583 --> 01:19:57,375
You bastard!

754
01:19:58,750 --> 01:20:00,250
Go to hell!

755
01:20:02,166 --> 01:20:03,958
Go!

756
01:20:05,791 --> 01:20:07,000
You son of a bitch!

757
01:20:26,666 --> 01:20:28,333
He's controlling my mind! Go!

758
01:20:28,416 --> 01:20:30,250
We won't leave you behind.

759
01:20:30,375 --> 01:20:32,541
I'm so glad that I could see you again!

760
01:20:34,416 --> 01:20:35,958
I'm sorry!

761
01:20:37,250 --> 01:20:38,583
San!

762
01:20:42,916 --> 01:20:44,375
-San!
-Ching!

763
01:20:44,458 --> 01:20:47,833
Monster, I'd rather die than let you win!

764
01:20:47,916 --> 01:20:53,208
China must have a King.

765
01:21:00,375 --> 01:21:01,916
China must have a King.

766
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,000
What's important is today, not the past.

767
01:21:04,083 --> 01:21:08,833
China must have a King!

768
01:21:08,958 --> 01:21:11,750
China must have a King!

769
01:21:13,708 --> 01:21:16,916
Let's watch the flowers bloom together.

770
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:20,541
Let's watch the flowers bloom together.

771
01:21:20,625 --> 01:21:22,916
Doctor!

772
01:21:51,291 --> 01:21:52,291
Ching.

773
01:21:55,166 --> 01:21:56,166
You won't die.

774
01:21:58,625 --> 01:21:59,833
Hey!

775
01:22:00,666 --> 01:22:02,375
Get to the ground first!

776
01:22:02,458 --> 01:22:03,750
Otherwise I'll die!

777
01:22:12,875 --> 01:22:13,833
Are you all right?

778
01:22:14,375 --> 01:22:16,458
I'm okay. Where's Chat?

779
01:22:17,750 --> 01:22:19,875
I've got something good.

780
01:22:20,125 --> 01:22:24,750
Take one. We can't look too shabby
in case reporters show up.

781
01:22:26,041 --> 01:22:27,333
Come on, put it on.

782
01:22:59,541 --> 01:23:03,041
The police has solved
the case of the missing babies.

783
01:23:03,708 --> 01:23:06,250
Most of the missing babies
have been found.

784
01:23:07,166 --> 01:23:09,583
Our reporter is reporting
live at the scene.

785
01:23:09,666 --> 01:23:12,833
We hear that three unknown
heroines solved the case.

786
01:23:12,916 --> 01:23:14,666
How are they connected to the police?

787
01:23:15,708 --> 01:23:17,916
They are close friends of the police.

788
01:23:18,250 --> 01:23:19,625
What are their identities?

789
01:23:19,708 --> 01:23:20,625
No comment.

790
01:23:20,708 --> 01:23:23,208
Do you know when they will appear again?

791
01:23:23,666 --> 01:23:25,458
Whenever they are needed.

792
01:23:26,208 --> 01:23:27,750
What are their names?

793
01:23:28,625 --> 01:23:30,500
Yeah. What are their names?

794
01:23:31,375 --> 01:23:33,000
They are called The Heroic Trio.

795
01:23:34,500 --> 01:23:35,833
When did we get that name?

796
01:23:35,916 --> 01:23:37,000
How do you know that?

797
01:23:37,125 --> 01:23:38,625
Where does the name come from?

798
01:23:38,708 --> 01:23:40,083
It's top secret, sorry.

799
01:23:40,166 --> 01:23:41,541
It's just an improvisation.
