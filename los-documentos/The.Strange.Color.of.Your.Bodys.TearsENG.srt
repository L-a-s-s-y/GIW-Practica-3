You've reached 02.503.16.12.

2
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,989
Leave a message after the beep.

3

Honey, it's me.

00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,235
I've just arrived.

00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:59,869
I'll be home in half an hour.

00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,837
See you.

7
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,751
THE STRANGE

8
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,990
COLOR

9
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:11,469
OF YOUR BODY'S

10
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:14,791
TEARS

11
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:42,829
Edwige?

12
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,792
Honey?

13
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,792
Edwige?

14
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,716
Honey? Are you there?

15
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:18,672
I've arrived safely. I'll cal you tomorrow.

16
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:21,035
I am going to sleep.

17
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,076
Love you.

18
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:27,272
Honey, it's me. We are making progress.

19
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,830
We should be able to sign pretty soon.

20
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,638
Love you.

21
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,839
Honey, it's me.

22
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:46,275
I've just arrived.

23
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:49,989
I'll be home in half an hour.

24
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:50,870
See you.

25
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,919
Have you seen my wife?

26
00:06:59,000 --> 00:06:59,910
What?!

27
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,911
- I don't know her!

28
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,078
Yes?
- Edwige?

29
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:27,151
You've got the wrong person.

30
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,869
I told you I don't know her!

31
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,792
It's almost midnight!

32
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:38,111
Edwige...

33
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,513
Yes...

34
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,509
I am looking for my wife.

35
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,591
She has disappeared.

36
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,719
Come upstairs.
7th floor.

37
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,395
Sit down.

38
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,634
How do you know my wife?

39
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:01,160
I don't know her.

40
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:20,077
Turn right here, is my husband, Paul.

41
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:31,555
He was a doctor. He also disappeared.

42
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:31,555
It happened a couple of days
after he had retired.

43
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:20,473
Who are you calling?
- The police.

44
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:25,397
You want them to think you are crazy?!

45
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,432
Honey?

46
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,758
Honey?

47
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,792
Honey?

48
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:37,669
Honey!

49
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,478
I am up here!

50
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:42,393
- Paul! Come down!
- There is no light.

51
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,198
Hand me some matches!

52
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,436
Hurry up!

53
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:53,039
Paul?

54
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,958
Paul?

55
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,269
Yes!

56
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,399
Paul?

57
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,192
Paul?

58
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,352
- Paul? - That's incredible!

59
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,112
- The people who live there are ...
- Come down now!

60
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,356
- Give me some matches!
- No, come down!

61
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,512
- Give me some matches!
I don't even see the way out!

62
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,553
Give me some!

63
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,198
Honey!

64
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:12,992
Honey!

65
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,673
Paul!

66
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:17,952
Paul...!

67
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,312
Paul...!

68
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:10,474
I wiped off the drop of blood
and I appoached the hole.

69
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:14,599
I saw an eye staring at me,

70
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:19,754
filled with hatred, madness, fear...

71
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,119
I saw ....

72
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:41,391
Get out of here!

73
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,831
Get out of here!

74
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:19,869
What are you doing here?

75
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,757
And you?

76
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,558
I live downstairs.

77
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:35,319
Are you the neighbour of
the crazy old woman?

78
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:38,198
Did you come up here because of her?

79
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,316
Barbara.
- Dan.

80
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,592
I am looking for my wife.

81
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:08,036
Dan Kristensen?

82
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:10,833
- Dan.
- Inspektor Vincentelli.

83
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:17,192
- Vincentelli.
- Dan Kristensen.

84
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:25,193
Your wife disappeared just like that,
Mr. Kristensen?

85
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:29,353
How do you know?
- You called the police last night.

86
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:32,273
Don't you remember?
- Yes... Yes.

87
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:38,159
A burglary?
- No... I broke the chain...

88
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:41,998
Beatiful apartment...

89
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:44,799
I am working in the
telecommunications business.

90
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:51,629
So, when did she disappear?
- I left for Frankfurt on Tuesday evening.

91
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:55,156
- Do you often go on holiday without your wife?
- I often go abroad om business.

92
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:58,516
- I am in the telocommunications business!
- Have you called her?

93
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,830
Every day since Tuesday
and she's never home!

94
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:03,878
Have you left any messages?
- Yes!

95
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:09,034
Do you have children?
- No.

96
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,637
What does your wife do?

97
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:15,679
Nothing! She can afford anything she wants!

98
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:20,038
How does she spend her days?
- I often go abroad on business

99
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:23,032
- I work in the telecommunications business!
- Is everything all right between you two?

100
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,872
- Yes, of course. Look!

101
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,750
Are you the last person to have seen her?
- Yes..

102
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:32,115
No, you have to ask the other tenants!

103
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,270
These people say you are loud!

104
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:37,079
Do you drink often? My wife has disappeared.

105
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:39,674
I am worried! Worried...

106
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,953
I worked for a man
who worried about his wife,

107
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:44,871
like you...

108
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:48,472
She left me a souvenir...

109
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:52,352
She hadn't disappeared,
it was he who was afraid of disappearing.
110
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:31,872
- I quit! - You have done a good job.

110
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:35,589
I need you.
- You have nothing to fear!

111
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:37,392
Give me my money!

112
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,752
Pardon.

113
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,598
Sir!

114
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:29,435
Sir, Sir, Sir!

115
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:33,155
Sir!
- What?

116
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:37,119
Will you take my sweets?
- I don't any sweets! Go away!

117
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:39,915
Take my sweets, please!

118
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,671
Give me back my doll!

119
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:49,072
What has it got to do with my wife?

120
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:53,111
What are you intending to do
about my wife?

121
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:04,550
As long as i don't have any evidence,
I can't do nothing!

122
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:06,676
And the door that was locked
from the inside yesterday?!

123
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:11,595
People disappear every day and often
it's less serious than one might think...

124
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:17,076
When can you come to fix the chain?

125
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:20,118
Very good... Ok... Thank you.

126
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:23,670
Freedom online, hello. - Dora!

127
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:26,877
Dan?
- I am back from Frankfurt.

128
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:31,553
I am going to take couple of days off.
I won't come in before Monday.

129
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:34,359
You can cancel all my appointments.

130
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:36,635
Are you ok, Dan?

131
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:39,555
I don't know where Edwige is.

132
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:42,637
I need to rest.

133
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:45,029
I'll cal you, Dora!

134
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:05,317
Hello? - Dan, if you need anything, I am here...

135
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:06,833
No.
- I can come over.

136
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:09,275
It's complicated enough already!

137
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:12,228
I'll call you, Dora!

138
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:14,559
Yes!

139
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:16,679
Hello?

140
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:21,598
Hello?

141
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:09,151
Somebody is in my apartment!

142
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:20,953
I wasn't dreaming...

143
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:24,157
Somebody was here, watching me...

144
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:28,677
Your less is about to expire
and everybody is complaining about you!

145
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:32,229
Mister Dermont, my wife's disappeared!

146
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:35,312
She may have good reasons!

147
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:40,920
I don't like to sniff around my tenants,
but I advise you to be more discreet.

148
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:08,120
Free at last.

149
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:13,356
I just have to get rid of
that despicable man, Dan.

150
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:17,191
Now that I have discovered my true nature,

151
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:21,239
I know my vice as they call it,
is nothing other than my pleasure,

152
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:24,198
and my pleasure will be
to make him suffer.

153
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,038
Are you sure?

154
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:50,151
Do you know my wife?

155
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,912
I want to get to know you.

156
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:13,392
So you like mysterious phone calls?...

157
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:11,839
Edwige?

158
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:15,632
Honey...

159
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:50,994
Hello? Hello? Vincentelli?

160
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:55,112
I've been waiting for you for hours!
What have you been doing?!

161
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:17,270
Who is it?
- It's me!

162
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:21,590
Open up! Quick!

163
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:02,832
Open up! Quick!

164
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:11,677
Open up! Quick!

165
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:15,912
What is it? What do you want from me?
- I want help you!

166
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,150
Somebody is in your apartment...

167
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:20,629
...and wants to kill you!

168
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:45,673
What?

169
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:51,189
Yes, locked...

170
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:54,030
And I had put the security chain up
that I'd had fixed.

171
00:53:54,120 --> 00:53:56,236
Are you sure? - Yes...

172
00:53:56,320 --> 00:53:59,437
- So how could anybodyut your wife's head
in your apartment?

173
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:03,149
There is no sign of a break-in, Mr. Kristensen.

174
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:06,437
But I told you,
when returning from Frankfurt,

175
00:54:06,520 --> 00:54:09,239
the security chain had been put...

176
00:54:09,320 --> 00:54:12,312
and yet... there wasn't anybody
in the apartment.

177
00:54:16,520 --> 00:54:19,592
somebody threatened me on the phone...

178
00:54:21,320 --> 00:54:23,356
Wait...

179
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,434
Free at last...

180
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:31,798
I just have to get rid of
that despicable man, Dan.

181
00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:35,429
Now that I have discovered my true nature,

182
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:38,193
I know that my vice as they call it...

183
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:41,352
...is nothing other than my pleasure,
and my pleasure will be to make him suffer,

184
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:44,113
as much as he made me suffer
during all those years.

185
00:54:44,200 --> 00:54:46,111
His adoration is the worst of all gifts,

186
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:47,792
his gaze is the worst of all prisons.

187
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:49,916
He can keep my image to get lost in it,

188
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,116
there is nothing to find...

189
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:54,714
Is this your wife's voice?

190
00:54:57,160 --> 00:55:00,630
There is a man with a beard

191
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:03,678
who sneaked into my apartment.

192
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:07,790
I know where to find him. He lives on the ground floor.

193
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,309
Are you sure it's him?
- Positive.

194
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:20,119
This is Mister Thys,
the tenant of the ground floor.

195
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:24,034
Does he live with anybody?
- Not since his sister died.

196
00:56:24,120 --> 00:56:26,395
Does he have a beard?
- I don't know,

197
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:28,994
not to my knowledge.

198
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:40,756
Why are you asking me all these questions?
Is this still about Kristensen?

199
00:56:40,840 --> 00:56:45,356
Mister Kristensen's wife has been found decapitated
with a stab wound at the top of her skull.

200
00:56:47,120 --> 00:56:50,237
The suspect has a beard.
Is there a man with a beard living here?

201
00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:52,880
No. I wouldn't know...

202
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:30,153
I'm afraid of what's inside me..

203
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:32,800
Something was inside me
and changed me...

204
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:35,075
My body became a stranger
and took over...

205
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:37,116
Sometimes I resist
but I feel the strenght...

206
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:39,509
As if there was another person
that lived with me inside me...

207
00:57:39,640 --> 00:57:43,394
His strength becomes mine...

208
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:47,877
I couldn't control him any longer... I don't know what's true anymore...

209
00:57:47,960 --> 00:57:49,279
He wants tome control me,

210
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:51,311
Sometimes it comes out of me... but it's always coming back...

211
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:53,960
I believe that I live in a constant nightmare.

212
00:57:54,040 --> 00:57:55,871
I do not want to be ... more open ...

213
00:57:55,960 --> 00:57:58,235
The desire silent ... or resist ...

214
00:57:58,320 --> 00:58:01,357
How long can I go on resisting?

215
01:05:01,800 --> 01:05:04,189
I know he'll be back..

216
01:05:04,280 --> 01:05:06,748
How much longer can I resist?

217
01:05:24,520 --> 01:05:26,476
Delivery service.

218
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,230
And? And Kristensen?

219
01:07:11,520 --> 01:07:13,192
And ...

220
01:07:14,080 --> 01:07:17,516
Come closer. I am the one
you are looking for.

221
01:07:22,680 --> 01:07:24,955
You put me in danger.

222
01:07:25,680 --> 01:07:28,558
- Do you hear me? - Yes!

223
01:07:30,040 --> 01:07:32,600
All the apartments are connected.

224
01:07:32,680 --> 01:07:35,319
I live in other people's places
when they are out.

225
01:07:35,400 --> 01:07:39,712
There are old walls hidden behind
new ones in this building.

226
01:07:39,800 --> 01:07:44,715
Walls from before it was spl,t
into apartments.

227
01:07:44,800 --> 01:07:47,917
There are many ways to get into your place.

228
01:07:48,560 --> 01:07:51,472
- Are you still there? - Yes!

229
01:07:52,560 --> 01:07:56,473
Because of you,
I have to get away from this house.

230
01:07:57,080 --> 01:08:01,517
I know a few secrets of the people
who live here.

231
01:08:01,600 --> 01:08:04,353
Your wife knew some, too.

232
01:08:06,280 --> 01:08:10,193
She knew some of a certain Laura.

233
01:08:10,280 --> 01:08:14,068
All of this started as a game
that went further and further.

234
01:08:14,160 --> 01:08:17,072
Your wife pushed the limits of her body

235
01:08:17,160 --> 01:08:19,435
to find what was hiding inside.

236
01:08:19,520 --> 01:08:22,637
Instead of finding
what she was looking for

237
01:08:22,720 --> 01:08:25,109
she discovered Laura.

238
01:08:25,200 --> 01:08:26,838
Laura...

239
01:08:35,080 --> 01:08:38,038
Laura's secret tormented your wife...

240
01:08:43,920 --> 01:08:47,151
Laura ... Your wife wanted to escape...

241
01:08:58,600 --> 01:09:00,192
However ...she got caught

242
01:09:00,320 --> 01:09:03,676
where Laura had found a new way...

243
01:09:03,760 --> 01:09:07,150
where Laura keeps her secrets...

244
01:09:25,840 --> 01:09:29,071
Vincentelli.
Leave a message after the beep.

245
01:09:29,760 --> 01:09:31,273
Hello?

246
01:09:32,120 --> 01:09:34,270
This is Dan Kristensen.

247
01:09:35,160 --> 01:09:40,109
I... I am calling to tell you
I've found the man with the beard...

248
01:09:40,920 --> 01:09:43,309
Behind a wall...

249
01:17:34,160 --> 01:17:35,718
Laura...
- Laura?

250
01:17:35,800 --> 01:17:37,392
Yes, Laura.

251
01:17:37,480 --> 01:17:39,914
I saw her behind the walls.

252
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:43,754
She is a brunette with long hair.

253
01:17:43,840 --> 01:17:47,435
- She turned towards me. - What are you talking about?

254
01:17:49,760 --> 01:17:52,991
- Do you know her? - I knew a Laura.

255
01:17:53,560 --> 01:17:54,959
She used to live here...

256
01:17:55,040 --> 01:18:00,194
At the time she was a brunette...
but know she must be rather white-haired.

257
01:18:00,320 --> 01:18:03,915
I doubt she is still alive.

258
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,912
Where is all this blood coming from?
- I cut myself.

259
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:08,911
It won't heal over.

260
01:18:13,440 --> 01:18:16,557
Now that you know the old hallways
of the building,

261
01:18:16,640 --> 01:18:20,713
You can't stay here any longer.
You can't just come in like that.

262
01:18:20,840 --> 01:18:23,434
I want you to leave...!

263
01:18:40,880 --> 01:18:43,872
"Your dark side is the most
beatiful thing you possess

264
01:18:43,960 --> 01:18:46,952
and it will always belong to me. Sorry for your loss."

265
01:22:32,160 --> 01:22:35,869
So you like mysterious phone calls?...

266
01:22:58,240 --> 01:22:59,912
Laura...

267
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:38,274
You're crazy!

268
01:23:38,360 --> 01:23:40,794
If hadn't shot, he'd be dead!

269
01:23:44,120 --> 01:23:47,078
Somebody switch off the sound,
it's awfull!

270
01:24:52,480 --> 01:24:53,879
Dora?...

271
01:24:55,800 --> 01:24:57,677
It was you...

272
01:24:58,960 --> 01:25:01,793
You're throwing away my flowers, darling?

273
01:25:01,880 --> 01:25:04,440
Don't call me "darling" any more...
275
01:25:04,520 --> 01:25:07,478
We broke up over 20 years ago...

274
01:25:07,560 --> 01:25:09,357
Don't be mean!...

275
01:25:10,240 --> 01:25:12,629
Please, put your clothes back on!

276
01:25:13,560 --> 01:25:18,031
Now that she's gone, I can take care of you

277
01:25:18,680 --> 01:25:22,559
- Like before. - Give me back my keys and leave!

278
01:25:22,640 --> 01:25:24,631
I don't want to see you any more!

279
01:25:46,640 --> 01:25:47,470
No!

280
01:38:03,960 --> 01:38:14,632
THE STRANGE COLOR OF YOUR BODY'S FEARS
