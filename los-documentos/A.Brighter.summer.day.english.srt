3
00:00:44,586 --> 00:00:48,215
My son's always done well in Chinese literature.
SUMMER 1959

4
00:00:48,549 --> 00:00:50,926
He couldn't have scored just 50.

5
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:53,762
He got close to 100
in everything else.

6
00:00:56,223 --> 00:00:59,893
There must be some mistake.

7
00:01:00,519 --> 00:01:03,313
Mr. Wang is our friend as well.

8
00:01:03,438 --> 00:01:05,941
He understands our procedure.

9
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:08,902
We'll double-check
your son's scores.

10
00:01:09,278 --> 00:01:13,323
I'm afraid I can't show you
the exam papers.

11
00:01:13,448 --> 00:01:16,743
It's against our regulations.

12
00:01:17,869 --> 00:01:20,664
You idiot!
Hot tea in this weather?

13
00:01:21,498 --> 00:01:24,585
I promise
to double-check his scores.

14
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:27,462
If the examination board
made any mistakes,

15
00:01:27,588 --> 00:01:30,716
we'll make
any necessary adjustments.

16
00:01:30,841 --> 00:01:33,176
You can trust me.

17
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:38,140
You know, night school
at Jianguo High isn't bad.

<i>Hsu Hsin-Iiang, Wang Shi-yeh...</i>

41
00:03:44,683 --> 00:03:47,894
Millions of mainland Chinese
fled to Taiwan in 1949

42
00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:51,565
with the Nationalist government
after its defeat in the civil war

43
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:53,900
by the Chinese Communists.

44
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:57,529
Their children were brought up
in an uneasy atmosphere

45
00:03:57,654 --> 00:04:00,490
created by their parents'
uncertainty about the future.

46
00:04:00,615 --> 00:04:03,243
Many formed street gangs
to search for an identity

47
00:04:03,368 --> 00:04:06,163
and to strengthen
their sense of security.

48
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:12,419
SEPTEMBER 1960

49
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:17,382
Why this color?

50
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:23,263
Why worry about the color?

51
00:04:23,764 --> 00:04:26,516
It's a black-and-white film!

52
00:04:26,725 --> 00:04:30,479
How can I wear
such an awful color?

53
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:34,399
I told you to change,
so change!

54
00:04:35,025 --> 00:04:37,110
There's no dressing room.

55
00:04:37,235 --> 00:04:40,113
I told you to change,
not to go nude!

56
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:43,158
What are you so upset for?
Move!

57
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:47,913
Didn't we agree on the dress?

58
00:04:48,038 --> 00:04:52,125
Now you're changing things
on the spot!

59
00:04:57,714 --> 00:05:00,926
Listen, everyone:
This is our last shot.

60
00:05:01,051 --> 00:05:03,220
Let's get it over with!

61
00:05:13,897 --> 00:05:15,732
Someone's up there!

62
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:20,987
Kid, what are you doing up there?

63
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:32,332
You're not getting away,
you little brat!

64
00:05:54,396 --> 00:05:56,815
Think you can run away?

65
00:05:56,940 --> 00:06:00,360
You should be in school.
What are you doing here?

66
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:02,612
What's your name?

67
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:06,199
Night school? What class?

68
00:06:07,534 --> 00:06:10,036
I have ways to make you talk!

69
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:13,540
8-6-O-8-9.

70
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:18,211
Who's that? Don't run off!

71
00:06:20,964 --> 00:06:22,966
Stay where you are!

72
00:06:35,896 --> 00:06:38,023
Fucking kids! <i>I'll</i> kill you!

73
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:41,902
Smooch, smooch!

74
00:06:44,029 --> 00:06:47,741
Have a kiss! Score a Miss!

75
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:50,869
Hanky-panky time!

76
00:06:55,457 --> 00:06:57,375
<i>Attention.</i>

77
00:06:58,501 --> 00:06:59,836
<i>Salute.</i>

78
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:01,671
<i>Be seated.</i>

79
00:07:29,741 --> 00:07:31,952
<i>Hey, Airplane!
Fly over here!</i>

80
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:37,666
Where'd you get the flashlight?

81
00:07:37,832 --> 00:07:40,669
Xiao Si'r snatched it
from the film studio.

82
00:07:41,836 --> 00:07:45,298
Shut up, Underpants!
Stop asking about the test!

83
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:50,428
Panty, panty, flimsy and fancy!

84
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:53,139
If you get sweaty,
use it as a hanky.

85
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:55,517
Get one for your mommy!

86
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:58,144
Hush up. it's Red Bean.

87
00:07:58,269 --> 00:08:00,146
Shine it on her.

88
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:01,731
Go on!

89
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:03,733
How's it work?

90
00:08:04,109 --> 00:08:06,069
What are you little brats up to?

91
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:08,655
- I bet you they're red!
- Bullshit!

92
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:10,657
- Wanna bet?
- How much?

93
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:13,159
- Ten bucks.
- No, one.

94
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:16,329
- One buck?
- You call that a bet?

95
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:19,040
Shit, what a Cheapskate!

96
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:21,584
You're too cheap to bet with.

97
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:23,837
You never pay up.

98
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:28,008
- Looks like somethings up.
- Must be something bad.

99
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:30,510
It's none of your damn business.

100
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:37,100
There's a fight.
Sly's cornered at the grade school.

101
00:08:37,225 --> 00:08:40,061
Si'r, let me have that.
- Okay.

102
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:42,397
- Sex Bomb, we need your help.
- No problem.

103
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:44,899
- I'm not going.
- Who asked you?

104
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:46,860
Forget about him.
Let's go.

105
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:50,530
- He'll hit the porn stand again.
- Porn freak!

106
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:52,258
Hold it!

107
00:10:13,905 --> 00:10:16,074
Sly, you okay?

108
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:54,696
Shit!

109
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:57,157
What took you so long?

110
00:10:58,741 --> 00:11:01,870
Can't even take care
of our own turf!

111
00:11:04,122 --> 00:11:06,374
Are we giving it up or what?

112
00:11:12,797 --> 00:11:14,757
Got a smoke on you?

113
00:11:19,762 --> 00:11:21,723
Hey, Deuce.

114
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:25,268
Shit! How did this happen?

115
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:28,730
They got me alone, that's all.

116
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:32,358
I held them off
by myself till now.

117
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:35,195
You try that next time.

118
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,822
I'm not blaming you.

119
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:42,702
But what are you
doing here so late?

120
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:45,163
None of your business.

121
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:53,880
How could we let the 217 gang
mess with our turf?

122
00:11:54,005 --> 00:11:57,675
I tell you,
everyone's out to get us.

123
00:11:57,967 --> 00:12:01,346
If it weren't the 217 boys,
it'd be others.

124
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:07,101
If your brother doesn't
come back soon, we're through.

125
00:12:07,518 --> 00:12:10,521
- Honey's not here. I am.
- You are!

126
00:12:10,772 --> 00:12:14,234
Please don't beat me up!

127
00:12:14,943 --> 00:12:18,071
I'm sorry!
Don't beat me up!

128
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:21,241
I was just tagging along.

129
00:12:21,366 --> 00:12:25,286
I'm not one of them.
We're not enemies!

130
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:31,709
So you two want
to go big time?

131
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:34,921
This kid's too noisy.
Shut him up.

132
00:12:37,966 --> 00:12:40,510
Don't hit me!

133
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:53,731
Watch closely.

134
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,984
Get a good look.

135
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,409
We don't need
chickenshit cowards.

136
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:13,126
Get up.

137
00:13:14,377 --> 00:13:15,628
Get up!

138
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:34,897
Go back
and tell your big brother!

139
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:39,819
Never fuck
with the Little Park boys!

140
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:22,528
<i>Why are you switching
the lights on and off?</i>

141
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:25,990
My eyes go blurry.
I don't know why.

142
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:29,660
Get to bed earlier
and you'll be okay.

143
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,169
Why are you home so late?

144
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:41,798
We all stayed afterwards
to talk about the test.

145
00:15:12,036 --> 00:15:14,455
<i>It won't work!</i>
I <i>can 'I button it!</i>

146
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:17,708
Make it work for now.
The bus is coming.

147
00:15:19,127 --> 00:15:22,296
<i>Lao Er, why aren't you up?</i>

148
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:31,639
<i>Do I have to drag you
out of bed every day?</i>

149
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:33,641
Morn, it fell off!

150
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:37,728
There's no time to sew it on.
Use a pin for now.

151
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:41,315
<i>What's wrong?
Outgrew your clothes again?</i>

152
00:15:41,566 --> 00:15:45,069
Mom, I can't find a pin!

153
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:40,500
<i>- I'm o“.
- Where are you going this early?</i>

154
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:43,586
- <i>It's</i> Saturday.
<i>- /z"s r00 early even for Saturday.</i>

155
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:46,088
It's our class's turn
at the weekly meeting.

156
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:10,613
- No shoes in the house!
- I need my compass!

157
00:17:10,821 --> 00:17:14,116
- Wow! Just out of the tub!
- What do they teach you!

158
00:17:14,242 --> 00:17:17,370
You're like Americans,
bathing in the morning.

159
00:17:17,537 --> 00:17:20,039
- It's none of your business!
- Let's go.

160
00:17:20,206 --> 00:17:22,208
Good-bye.

161
00:17:25,253 --> 00:17:26,879
<i>I'll</i> be available

162
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:30,007
every Saturday afternoon
at the infirmary.

163
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:33,135
I owe so much to my alma mater

164
00:17:33,261 --> 00:17:37,265
and to Principal He
for what I've achieved today.

165
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:42,645
I honestly feel
I don't deserve this recognition.

166
00:17:43,521 --> 00:17:48,359
I feel it's my duty to volunteer
to serve in your clinic.

167
00:17:48,568 --> 00:17:50,486
Thank you.

168
00:17:57,493 --> 00:18:02,415
Student 8-6-0-8-9!

169
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:05,126
Report to the conduct office
at once!

170
00:18:06,544 --> 00:18:10,006
Those of you
who like baseball, listen up.

171
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:13,092
A day school student

172
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:15,928
hurt Mr. Chen yesterday
with a baseball bat.

173
00:18:16,053 --> 00:18:18,097
Did you hear about it?

174
00:18:18,222 --> 00:18:19,932
Starting today,

175
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:23,311
all baseball bats
must be registered.

176
00:18:23,603 --> 00:18:26,522
All unregistered bats
will be confiscated.

177
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:28,441
You hear me?

178
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:32,778
<i>It was him! I'm positive!</i>

179
00:18:32,903 --> 00:18:34,697
<i>I didn't take your flashlight.</i>

180
00:18:34,822 --> 00:18:36,365
<i>Where's the other boy?</i>

181
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:37,783
<i>Who's the other boy?</i>

182
00:18:37,908 --> 00:18:39,201
<i>We didn't mean any harm.</i>

183
00:18:39,327 --> 00:18:41,287
He didn't take it, I swear.

184
00:18:41,454 --> 00:18:43,497
- Were you with him yesterday?
- Yes.

185
00:18:43,623 --> 00:18:45,666
Get over there!

186
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:49,920
- Was it you who broke my window?
- No.

187
00:18:50,046 --> 00:18:52,006
What's going on?

188
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:54,425
Zhang Zhen was hanging
around the film studio.

189
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:56,385
Now something's missing.

190
00:18:56,636 --> 00:18:59,972
These students get
craftier every year.

191
00:19:00,181 --> 00:19:03,601
But your film studio
is right next door.

192
00:19:03,934 --> 00:19:05,978
No, thanks.

193
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:09,190
I can't solve
this problem for you.

194
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:11,400
Of course not.

195
00:19:12,193 --> 00:19:15,154
A student cracked
a teacher's skull

196
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:17,490
with one of those recently.

197
00:19:17,615 --> 00:19:19,158
It's a real problem!

198
00:19:19,325 --> 00:19:22,328
You'd better come down
hard on them.

199
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:25,331
Our principal insists
on developing their free spirits.

200
00:19:25,456 --> 00:19:27,500
Our school gate's never locked.

201
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:30,378
You better lock your gates tight.

202
00:19:30,503 --> 00:19:33,506
You leave yours open,
and we'll leave ours open.

203
00:19:33,631 --> 00:19:36,175
We can visit each other!

204
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:44,475
Why are you spreading
rumors about me?

205
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,143
What did I say?

206
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:49,480
You said I was with a girl
that night at the school.

207
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:51,691
You didn't see a thing,
understand?

208
00:19:51,816 --> 00:19:54,527
- That's my seat.
- Take mine in the back.

209
00:19:56,362 --> 00:19:58,197
<i>Salute.</i>

210
00:19:58,322 --> 00:20:00,199
Let me copy off you.

211
00:20:02,702 --> 00:20:06,539
Just see what happens
if you don't.

212
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:29,061
- Did you answer No. 4?
- Forget it. Let's play ball.

213
00:20:29,186 --> 00:20:30,104
Okay.

214
00:20:36,861 --> 00:20:38,404
Fuck you!

215
00:20:40,281 --> 00:20:42,450
Don't give me that look.

216
00:20:42,992 --> 00:20:45,661
Wouldn't let me copy, huh?

217
00:20:48,164 --> 00:20:52,001
Keep staring, tough guy.

218
00:20:55,629 --> 00:20:57,882
Just try it. I dare you.

219
00:21:02,136 --> 00:21:04,054
Hello, sir.

220
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:06,515
We're just playing around.

221
00:21:27,411 --> 00:21:30,289
You boys enjoy
coming to my office?

222
00:21:30,873 --> 00:21:33,334
If so,
I'm at your service anytime.

223
00:21:46,555 --> 00:21:48,641
He's not your regular bookworm.

224
00:21:48,808 --> 00:21:51,852
If you lock horns,
he doesn't fuck around.

225
00:21:55,523 --> 00:21:57,650
What about my bat?

226
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:01,153
<i>I'll</i> get you another one.

227
00:22:01,487 --> 00:22:03,489
I just bought that one.

228
00:22:05,783 --> 00:22:07,618
Seventy bucks!

229
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:17,253
<i>Please deliver this, Uncle Fat.</i>

230
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:21,590
<i>You've got men in the family.
They can pick it up!</i>

231
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:23,926
Si?!

232
00:22:24,093 --> 00:22:26,428
Stop drinking, will you?

233
00:22:37,523 --> 00:22:39,441
You'd better go.

234
00:22:43,946 --> 00:22:46,073
What happened to your face?

235
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:48,534
I hurt it playing baseball.

236
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:54,039
You hurt it playing baseball?

237
00:23:06,176 --> 00:23:10,347
Let's not buy from Uncle Fat
on credit anymore.

238
00:23:10,931 --> 00:23:14,059
He's been real mean lately.
I have no idea why.

239
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:16,395
He's jealous of you
going to the university.

240
00:23:16,562 --> 00:23:19,064
His daughter failed
the exam again this year.

241
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:28,699
That music
from the fruit stand again!

242
00:23:28,824 --> 00:23:30,868
It's louder every day.

243
00:23:33,913 --> 00:23:35,873
Eight years of war
with the Japanese.

244
00:23:35,998 --> 00:23:39,710
Now we live in a Japanese house
and listen to Japanese music.

245
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:48,928
Don't forget we're invited
to Wang's for dinner Sunday.

246
00:23:49,053 --> 00:23:52,932
Do I have to go?
Won't it be all grown-ups?

247
00:23:53,057 --> 00:23:56,226
- Why'd you eat so little?
- There'll be lots of children.

248
00:23:56,352 --> 00:23:58,354
I'm full.

249
00:24:05,027 --> 00:24:07,363
Shall we bring a present?

250
00:24:08,989 --> 00:24:10,950
Sure.

251
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:40,896
“The score with Sly
will be settled by this day.”

252
00:24:42,856 --> 00:24:44,733
<i>Here, 70 bucks.</i>

253
00:24:44,858 --> 00:24:48,404
All right!
Where'd you get it?

254
00:24:48,529 --> 00:24:51,156
Don't ask too many questions.

255
00:24:53,701 --> 00:24:56,495
<i>Kennedy's experience
in foreign affairs</i>

256
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:58,914
<i>is very limited.</i>

257
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:02,042
<i>Faced with the world's
communist community,</i>

258
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:05,796
<i>the American public
won't entrust the presidency</i>

259
00:25:05,963 --> 00:25:08,674
<i>t0 a young,
inexperienced fellow like him.</i>

260
00:25:09,008 --> 00:25:11,885
<i>Thomas, get in the back.</i>

261
00:25:13,053 --> 00:25:16,265
<i>Little girl,
stand behind your mother.</i>

262
00:25:17,808 --> 00:25:21,895
Wan-wan, don't hide in back.
You're always so shy.

263
00:25:22,271 --> 00:25:26,358
<i>Wang, you have us over every time
you return from an official trip.</i>

264
00:25:26,483 --> 00:25:30,612
“Official trip”!
I go for the fun of it.

265
00:25:30,904 --> 00:25:35,034
America's incredible.
The skyscrapers -

266
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,286
<i>- Are you kidding?
- Absolutely not!</i>

267
00:25:37,411 --> 00:25:39,663
They've got skyscrapers,
and Disneyland!

268
00:25:39,788 --> 00:25:43,042
Mickey Mouse.
A great place for kids.

269
00:25:43,167 --> 00:25:46,211
They gave me a tour
of an atomic bomb factory.

270
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:48,088
If I were an expert,

271
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:50,549
I'd have learned to make
my own A-bomb.

272
00:25:50,716 --> 00:25:53,635
Then I could blow
the Communists to hell.

273
00:25:53,761 --> 00:25:57,056
<i>Okay, time for the picture.</i>

274
00:25:57,598 --> 00:25:59,725
<i>Everyone look this way.</i>

275
00:26:00,309 --> 00:26:04,563
Don't say anything
until it's officially announced.

276
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:07,900
Thank you.

277
00:26:08,317 --> 00:26:10,235
This is a nice surprise.

278
00:26:10,527 --> 00:26:14,114
Don't mention it.
We're such old friends.

279
00:26:14,573 --> 00:26:17,785
But there's something
I must remind you of.

280
00:26:18,035 --> 00:26:20,746
It's been 12 years

281
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:23,415
since we came here
from Shanghai.

282
00:26:23,749 --> 00:26:27,211
It's unlikely
we'll ever make it back.

283
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:29,880
While there's still time,

284
00:26:30,005 --> 00:26:33,258
we should make
some long-term plans.

285
00:26:34,176 --> 00:26:37,179
Your old Shanghai
intellectual mentality -

286
00:26:37,304 --> 00:26:39,306
get rid of it.

287
00:26:39,473 --> 00:26:41,558
Watch your temper.

288
00:26:41,767 --> 00:26:44,645
You have to learn to be flexible.

289
00:26:46,355 --> 00:26:48,357
On the surface,

290
00:26:48,482 --> 00:26:51,693
I'm helping you
get this promotion.

291
00:26:51,819 --> 00:26:55,072
Actually, you'll be helping me
in the future.

292
00:26:55,322 --> 00:26:58,117
We're classmates.
Old friends.

293
00:26:58,242 --> 00:26:59,785
Like in a gang.

294
00:26:59,952 --> 00:27:01,829
Understand?

295
00:27:06,375 --> 00:27:09,837
Getting Si'r transferred
back to day school

296
00:27:10,129 --> 00:27:14,633
is no problem
with my current connections.

297
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:17,136
Thanks.

298
00:27:18,387 --> 00:27:22,099
The night school's awful.

299
00:27:24,601 --> 00:27:26,645
I worry about him turning bad.

300
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:35,821
What are you doing?

301
00:27:35,946 --> 00:27:37,865
Get lost.

302
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:45,455
- You picked a good spot to watch.
- What?

303
00:27:45,581 --> 00:27:47,833
Out of the way!

304
00:28:26,914 --> 00:28:30,250
Mom, I'm bored.
Let's go home.

305
00:28:30,584 --> 00:28:32,544
Soon,soon.

306
00:28:34,588 --> 00:28:36,757
It's still like new.

307
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:39,384
I almost never use it.

308
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:42,888
I rarely have the occasion
to wear such a nice watch.

309
00:28:45,057 --> 00:28:46,850
How time flies.

310
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:51,563
When I gave you that watch...

311
00:28:55,484 --> 00:28:58,403
Why did you mention Professor Hsia
in front of Mrs. Hsia?

312
00:28:58,528 --> 00:29:00,113
I didn't.

313
00:29:00,239 --> 00:29:02,658
She saw my watch.

314
00:29:03,909 --> 00:29:06,578
Why did Professor Hsia
go back to Shanghai alone?

315
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:09,998
Bringing more relatives over
must have been an excuse.

316
00:29:10,123 --> 00:29:13,168
Mrs. Hsia's lived
like a widow ever since.

317
00:29:14,878 --> 00:29:16,838
What was Wang
talking to you about?

318
00:29:17,005 --> 00:29:19,216
Oh, nothing.

319
00:29:21,093 --> 00:29:24,763
He can help get Si'r
transferred to day school.

320
00:29:24,888 --> 00:29:27,057
There shouldn't be any problem.

321
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:29,601
What about
my teaching certificate?

322
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:34,398
You don't seem too concerned
about my problems.

323
00:29:34,648 --> 00:29:37,359
Luckily my letter of employment
came early this year.

324
00:29:37,484 --> 00:29:40,279
Every year I go
through the same stress.

325
00:29:40,445 --> 00:29:42,614
You know what I mean.

326
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:44,783
Whose fault is that?

327
00:29:45,409 --> 00:29:49,371
I told you to bring your official papers
when we left Shanghai.

328
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:54,209
I did. I put them
in the candy tin that we brought.

329
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:04,803
Don't read on the bus.
You'll ruin your eyes.

330
00:30:08,307 --> 00:30:11,768
Those night classes
must be hurting Si'r's eyes.

331
00:30:11,935 --> 00:30:15,689
They claim the free shots
at school will help.

332
00:30:15,897 --> 00:30:19,651
I hope it will save us
from having to buy him glasses.

333
00:30:20,027 --> 00:30:22,237
He has a secret to tell you.

334
00:30:22,404 --> 00:30:23,697
What secret?

335
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:26,616
Tell her.
She'll give you a freebie.

336
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:31,621
I come here often
because you're so pretty.

337
00:30:32,581 --> 00:30:36,543
<i>I'll</i> take this.
- You have to pay! Give it back!

338
00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:40,464
- I have no money.
- Then give it back.

339
00:30:40,589 --> 00:30:42,007
<i>No.</i>

340
00:30:42,174 --> 00:30:43,842
No?

341
00:30:44,301 --> 00:30:45,844
Don't unwrap it!

342
00:30:46,011 --> 00:30:48,013
Don't you unwrap it!

343
00:30:48,138 --> 00:30:51,475
Give it back!

344
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,435
They're red!

345
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:55,687
- You owe me 1O bucks!
- No, one!

346
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:15,207
Tiger, you're cheating!

347
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:24,049
<i>Don't touch that!</i>

348
00:31:28,845 --> 00:31:32,557
One at a time.
Don't you know how to line up?

349
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:34,393
Wang Chun-ming.

350
00:31:35,018 --> 00:31:38,688
Four times a day.
Come back if it doesn't help.

351
00:31:40,482 --> 00:31:42,609
A stomachache?

352
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:44,653
You're sure?

353
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:46,863
You're not trying to fool me?
- No.

354
00:31:46,988 --> 00:31:49,783
You can't get sent home
that easily.

355
00:32:02,712 --> 00:32:06,174
Come to my clinic tomorrow
for another treatment.

356
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,468
Miss Ling.

357
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:13,723
Can you walk by yourself?
- I think so.

358
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:15,767
Give it a try.

359
00:32:15,892 --> 00:32:18,603
Let's do this. You there.

360
00:32:19,479 --> 00:32:21,773
Please help her back
to her classroom.

361
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:24,276
It's okay.
I can walk by myself.

362
00:32:41,001 --> 00:32:43,545
It's okay.
I can walk by myself.

363
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:46,131
You can go back to class.

364
00:32:49,092 --> 00:32:50,719
I'm fine.

365
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,604
Our military adviser.

366
00:33:18,455 --> 00:33:21,500
- A pack of New Paradise.
- Three fifty.

367
00:33:21,625 --> 00:33:23,418
- You're new here.
- That's right.

368
00:33:24,461 --> 00:33:26,922
- Where are you from?
- Taichung.

369
00:33:27,047 --> 00:33:29,341
He caught me
cutting class once.

370
00:33:29,508 --> 00:33:32,385
I used to live near Taichung,
at the CCK air base.

371
00:33:32,761 --> 00:33:35,514
It reminds me of Wuhan,
on the mainland.

372
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:38,850
We can't stay here forever.

373
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:55,200
<i>You can't keep me
waiting here forever.</i>

374
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:58,787
<i>The boss is taking me
to Hong Kong next month.</i>

375
00:33:58,912 --> 00:34:00,872
<i>You want anything
from Hong Kong?</i>

376
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:04,668
<i>Let me think about it.
I'll tell you tonight.</i>

377
00:34:04,793 --> 00:34:06,878
<i>Time for makeup.</i>

378
00:34:07,504 --> 00:34:10,590
<i>Oh, I can't make it
tomorrow evening.</i>

379
00:34:10,715 --> 00:34:13,051
<i>Field Marshal Wong
is taking me to dinner.</i>

380
00:34:13,176 --> 00:34:15,929
<i>We made the date yesterday...
uh, last month.</i>

381
00:34:17,681 --> 00:34:21,726
<i>If you want to quit, tell the boss
and save us both the trouble!</i>

382
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:24,980
<i>I didn't say that.
Stop looking for excuses.</i>

383
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:28,692
Me look for excuses?

384
00:34:28,817 --> 00:34:31,611
You're the one
looking for excuses!

385
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:33,947
Me look for excuses?

386
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:38,243
And why all the heavy makeup?
It doesn't show my finest features.

387
00:34:38,368 --> 00:34:40,036
What features?

388
00:34:40,161 --> 00:34:43,373
Besides the boss liking you,
what else have you got?

389
00:34:44,416 --> 00:34:46,543
There's no talking to you!

390
00:34:48,169 --> 00:34:50,297
Did I say anything
about your script?

391
00:34:50,463 --> 00:34:52,424
Where'd you copy it from?

392
00:34:52,674 --> 00:34:55,218
I'm telling the boss.
To hell with you!

393
00:34:55,343 --> 00:34:57,095
Get the hell out!

394
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:59,598
Who's the director here,
you or me?

395
00:34:59,723 --> 00:35:02,100
Bitching about
too much makeup!

396
00:35:02,267 --> 00:35:04,227
What the hell!

397
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:06,938
Look in the mirror!

398
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:10,609
That face needs
all the makeup it can get!

399
00:35:16,448 --> 00:35:18,283
Young lady.

400
00:35:25,999 --> 00:35:27,792
What grade are you in?

401
00:35:27,917 --> 00:35:29,419
Eighth.

402
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:32,547
Assistant!

403
00:35:36,426 --> 00:35:39,804
This young girl isn't bad.
What do you think?

404
00:35:40,597 --> 00:35:42,724
Get her address.

405
00:35:44,684 --> 00:35:47,395
The role calls for a teenager.

406
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:51,483
You're pushing 40,
and you have the nerve to bitch?

407
00:35:54,069 --> 00:35:57,280
Would you be interested
in a screen test?

408
00:35:58,948 --> 00:36:01,618
So you live
by Little Park too?

409
00:36:01,868 --> 00:36:04,329
Lots of my classmates
live there.

410
00:36:07,791 --> 00:36:10,043
You gonna do the screen test?

411
00:36:11,461 --> 00:36:14,422
My boyfriend will be angry
if he finds out.

412
00:36:18,718 --> 00:36:20,679
You going back to class?

413
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:22,889
Where else can we go?

414
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:32,148
<i>How do you know about this place?</i>

415
00:36:32,273 --> 00:36:34,359
<i>I used to live near here.</i>

416
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:39,531
<i>I don't see any houses.</i>

417
00:36:43,993 --> 00:36:47,414
If I were a guy,
I'd love to be in the army.

418
00:36:47,706 --> 00:36:50,709
Why are you guys
all afraid of the army?

419
00:37:05,682 --> 00:37:07,726
We're afraid of that.

420
00:38:24,427 --> 00:38:27,013
Oh, look. A couple.

421
00:38:28,431 --> 00:38:31,851
Dating one of our girls, eh?

422
00:38:33,186 --> 00:38:36,022
<i>It'll</i> cost you, you hear?

423
00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:38,566
- Ignore him.
- Ignore me?

424
00:38:39,275 --> 00:38:41,194
He wouldn't dare!

425
00:38:41,903 --> 00:38:44,489
You hiding your watch
or what?

426
00:38:44,614 --> 00:38:46,157
I don't have one.

427
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:49,619
Aren't you the soft-spoken one!
Want me to search you?

428
00:38:54,082 --> 00:38:55,834
Lousy pen.

429
00:38:56,626 --> 00:38:59,587
Dating a girl
without the dough -

430
00:39:00,672 --> 00:39:03,174
No, don't! Let's go!

431
00:39:03,383 --> 00:39:06,094
Hurry! Let's go, Si?!

432
00:39:21,526 --> 00:39:23,736
Get on.
<i>I'll</i> give you a ride.

433
00:39:23,862 --> 00:39:27,323
It's out of your way.
There's a bus up ahead.

434
00:39:32,787 --> 00:39:34,831
I'm heading for Little Park too!

435
00:39:40,795 --> 00:39:43,172
Don't you want to win back
what you lost?

436
00:39:43,590 --> 00:39:46,509
You've got some attitude!
<i>I'll</i> keep it myself.

437
00:39:48,136 --> 00:39:49,512
Leave me alone!

438
00:39:49,637 --> 00:39:52,765
Threads, where you been?

439
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:57,979
It's so dark in here.
How about turning on some lights?

440
00:39:58,730 --> 00:40:01,065
You owe 2,140.

441
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:05,403
Wanna pay up now
or try to win it back?

442
00:40:05,862 --> 00:40:08,239
Win it back, of course.

443
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:11,659
Crazy, how about letting him
have a shot?

444
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:17,457
That bookworm?

445
00:40:17,582 --> 00:40:19,000
Wow, from Jianguo High!

446
00:40:19,125 --> 00:40:21,210
Scared you'll lose?

447
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:25,965
Rack 'em up.

448
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:28,509
That's it.
Let him learn from experience.

449
00:40:28,635 --> 00:40:31,930
Lao Er, let's do it.
- Wait a minute.

450
00:40:35,183 --> 00:40:37,435
Lao Er? “Prick”?

451
00:40:37,602 --> 00:40:40,104
Haven't you got one already?

452
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:42,023
This one's for you.

453
00:40:42,148 --> 00:40:44,609
Don't let him bother you.

454
00:40:45,652 --> 00:40:48,947
Baldy, this kid's called Prick.

455
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:53,910
What's wrong?
- Nothing.

456
00:40:54,077 --> 00:40:56,120
Nothing?
You look like shit.

457
00:41:06,214 --> 00:41:08,633
What have you
been up to lately?

458
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:11,803
Not much.
Things have been tough.

459
00:41:12,845 --> 00:41:15,890
I hear
you're putting on a concert.

460
00:41:16,015 --> 00:41:20,269
There's no money in that.
Not like your racket here.

461
00:41:21,729 --> 00:41:25,483
Got something going
with those rock and roll boys again?

462
00:41:25,650 --> 00:41:27,860
That's about all
they've got going.

463
00:41:28,027 --> 00:41:30,780
Not those Little Park boys again!

464
00:41:30,905 --> 00:41:32,907
Five ball, side pocket.

465
00:41:48,965 --> 00:41:51,009
Seven ball, corner pocket.

466
00:42:10,862 --> 00:42:13,114
Four ball, corner pocket.

467
00:42:18,494 --> 00:42:22,290
What a fluke!
The kid's got all the luck!

468
00:42:26,419 --> 00:42:28,796
Damn! Set 'em up.

469
00:42:28,921 --> 00:42:31,007
Come on, set 'em up.

470
00:42:32,050 --> 00:42:34,969
You guys are going easy on us.

471
00:42:37,346 --> 00:42:40,641
Take your time.
We'll win it all back.

472
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:42,643
Keep your cool.

473
00:42:49,692 --> 00:42:52,236
Take your time.
Take it easy.

474
00:42:52,403 --> 00:42:55,323
Plenty of time.
Two hundred a game.

475
00:43:01,537 --> 00:43:04,499
Interesting... interesting.

476
00:44:10,773 --> 00:44:12,775
Didn't you ditch class to go home?

477
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:15,153
Yeah, but I didn't go home.

478
00:44:20,158 --> 00:44:22,785
Come help me with this.

479
00:45:07,079 --> 00:45:09,457
Who the fuck you take me for?

480
00:45:10,333 --> 00:45:12,877
Stay the hell out of my business!

481
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:19,175
My old man's in charge
of the auditorium.

482
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:22,094
We share the profits
from the concert.

483
00:45:23,095 --> 00:45:25,389
Why give Threads
such a big cut?

484
00:45:25,681 --> 00:45:28,601
- Threads is here to help!
- Help how?

485
00:45:28,726 --> 00:45:31,604
He's taking advantage
of our gang.

486
00:45:32,563 --> 00:45:34,232
Let me tell you something.

487
00:45:34,690 --> 00:45:38,110
I'm gonna tell him
he can't use the hall.

488
00:45:39,362 --> 00:45:41,906
The question is:
Would you stop singing?

489
00:45:42,031 --> 00:45:44,575
What the fuck are you saying?

490
00:45:44,992 --> 00:45:46,953
Let me go!

491
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:49,705
Let him go. it's cool.

492
00:45:51,457 --> 00:45:53,668
Fuck you, man!

493
00:45:53,793 --> 00:45:56,212
What the fuck are you saying?

494
00:45:56,337 --> 00:45:59,924
Jade, it's none
of your business! Get out!

495
00:46:00,091 --> 00:46:02,593
Let me go!

496
00:46:03,552 --> 00:46:05,846
You've gone too far this time!

497
00:46:07,598 --> 00:46:09,684
Motherfucker!

498
00:46:11,936 --> 00:46:13,938
Don't go inside.

499
00:46:15,648 --> 00:46:18,276
You started it.
- Me?

500
00:46:18,401 --> 00:46:21,362
You said you saw Jade
with Sly that night.

501
00:46:21,487 --> 00:46:23,447
Now the shit's hit the fan.

502
00:46:23,572 --> 00:46:26,784
- I didn't say it was Jade.
- Who else would it be?

503
00:46:27,618 --> 00:46:30,079
My precious little baby!

504
00:46:30,204 --> 00:46:32,498
<i>I'll</i> swallow you up in one bite!

505
00:46:32,623 --> 00:46:35,459
Blind Man's jealous
of you already.

506
00:46:36,502 --> 00:46:38,254
If Honey were here,

507
00:46:38,379 --> 00:46:40,923
none of this
would have happened.

508
00:46:41,048 --> 00:46:43,134
Threads wouldn't dare
underestimate us.

509
00:46:43,301 --> 00:46:46,220
Now both Deuce and Sly
want to be boss.

510
00:46:46,721 --> 00:46:48,973
Cat, you're on!

511
00:46:55,396 --> 00:46:57,231
Now what?

512
00:47:42,610 --> 00:47:45,613
Why did you say
I was with Sly that night?

513
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:49,700
I didn't say it was you.
I couldn't see clearly.

514
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:54,413
Wasn't it you?

515
00:47:58,376 --> 00:48:00,711
Yeah... it was.

516
00:48:52,138 --> 00:48:55,599
Sorry! I didn't mean it!
I thought no one was home!

517
00:48:55,766 --> 00:48:59,270
Little thief! If anything's stolen,
we'll come looking for you!

518
00:48:59,937 --> 00:49:02,273
Where's Si'r?
- I guess he's out.

519
00:49:03,732 --> 00:49:05,276
What are you doing here?

520
00:49:05,443 --> 00:49:09,280
Ask your big sister to transcribe
some lyrics for me, okay?

521
00:49:10,573 --> 00:49:13,409
Sis, can you help him?

522
00:49:14,201 --> 00:49:16,036
Transcribing lyrics again?

523
00:49:16,162 --> 00:49:19,957
You want to sing American songs
when you don't know a word of English!

524
00:49:20,124 --> 00:49:22,918
Don't be mad.
I didn't look on purpose.

525
00:49:23,043 --> 00:49:25,087
I didn't see anything.

526
00:49:25,296 --> 00:49:29,091
But I gotta say
that dress looks great!

527
00:49:32,428 --> 00:49:34,805
I don't have a lot of time.

528
00:49:35,473 --> 00:49:37,391
She fell for it.

529
00:49:38,058 --> 00:49:40,686
Your sweet talk worked again.

530
00:49:45,149 --> 00:49:49,445
Sis, I forgot my lunch box.
Morn says to reheat it for me.

531
00:49:49,570 --> 00:49:50,946
Where's Morn?

532
00:49:51,071 --> 00:49:52,823
Supervising an exam.

533
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:56,660
Wow, a new dress!

534
00:49:58,287 --> 00:50:00,080
That's strange.

535
00:50:06,670 --> 00:50:08,631
Did you plug it in?

536
00:50:08,839 --> 00:50:10,341
Yeah.

537
00:50:10,841 --> 00:50:12,676
Damn it.

538
00:50:13,177 --> 00:50:15,346
It's not working.

539
00:50:16,430 --> 00:50:18,140
What now?

540
00:50:18,474 --> 00:50:21,352
I know.
Bring me your radio.

541
00:50:28,984 --> 00:50:32,363
Wow, you copied this one!

542
00:50:42,039 --> 00:50:45,876
- What are you doing?
- Nothing. Just fixing it.

543
00:50:46,043 --> 00:50:49,046
- I'm going!
- Without your lunch?

544
00:50:49,421 --> 00:50:52,174
Don't spend your pocket money
on junk food!

545
00:50:52,341 --> 00:50:54,218
Make it last!

546
00:50:56,512 --> 00:50:58,472
Will this work?

547
00:50:59,014 --> 00:51:01,058
Nothing smaller?

548
00:51:01,225 --> 00:51:03,519
Si'r, you boys want lunch?

549
00:51:03,769 --> 00:51:06,730
- Not right now.
- I ate.

550
00:51:14,029 --> 00:51:17,116
- Why isn't it working?
- It should be.

551
00:51:17,324 --> 00:51:19,368
Sure you put it
back together right?

552
00:51:19,535 --> 00:51:23,664
Don't be stupid.
I numbered everything.

553
00:51:25,583 --> 00:51:27,376
You fucked it up.

554
00:51:27,543 --> 00:51:29,587
Stay cool, man.

555
00:51:31,797 --> 00:51:33,632
See?

556
00:51:39,430 --> 00:51:43,392
Piece of shit.
<i>I'll</i> find you a new one.

557
00:51:50,482 --> 00:51:52,526
Got any money?

558
00:51:54,695 --> 00:51:57,072
When have I ever had money?

559
00:51:57,448 --> 00:52:00,284
_' And you?
<i>'</i> T'Y'"9 to rip me off?

560
00:52:00,451 --> 00:52:04,163
Come on.
Go inside and get some.

561
00:52:04,622 --> 00:52:06,415
You see that?

562
00:52:06,957 --> 00:52:08,208
What?

563
00:52:08,334 --> 00:52:10,210
My old man's inside.

564
00:52:11,795 --> 00:52:14,214
What a day, man.

565
00:52:36,695 --> 00:52:38,405
Tiger.

566
00:52:39,156 --> 00:52:41,659
What's the deal
with Ming's injured leg?

567
00:52:41,909 --> 00:52:45,245
I heard it was from
playing basketball with you.

568
00:52:46,121 --> 00:52:48,957
Come on.
Let's talk somewhere else.

569
00:52:49,083 --> 00:52:51,377
Why can't we talk here?

570
00:52:51,627 --> 00:52:53,337
If we talk here,

571
00:52:53,796 --> 00:52:55,798
it won't look good for you.

572
00:52:57,216 --> 00:53:01,053
Interesting.
Tell me what won't look good.

573
00:53:01,887 --> 00:53:04,682
You should be clear
about whose girl Ming is.

574
00:53:04,848 --> 00:53:07,810
- I am.
- Good.

575
00:53:08,310 --> 00:53:10,813
If Honey found out,
he wouldn't be pleased.

576
00:53:11,021 --> 00:53:14,233
My job is to make sure
he doesn't find out.

577
00:53:14,566 --> 00:53:16,694
He won't find out.

578
00:53:17,361 --> 00:53:19,154
He better not.

579
00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:21,323
Keep that in mind.

580
00:53:21,490 --> 00:53:23,409
Hey, I'm not done with you.

581
00:53:23,534 --> 00:53:25,536
What's the big idea?

582
00:53:25,661 --> 00:53:27,621
What are you doing?

583
00:53:27,746 --> 00:53:29,748
This is between him and me.

584
00:53:29,873 --> 00:53:32,334
You two are classmates.
Why all the fuss?

585
00:53:33,043 --> 00:53:34,211
Fuck you!

586
00:53:34,378 --> 00:53:37,631
- This is between him and me.
- And Ming!

587
00:53:37,756 --> 00:53:40,008
Isn't he going out with Ming too?

588
00:53:40,134 --> 00:53:42,928
Someone saw them
in a classroom that night.

589
00:53:43,137 --> 00:53:45,431
Tell us what's wrong.

590
00:53:45,597 --> 00:53:47,933
Tell us.
We want to know.

591
00:54:14,918 --> 00:54:16,920
Go tell your Little Park gang.

592
00:54:17,087 --> 00:54:19,673
I've known Honey for years.

593
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:22,259
<i>I'll</i> take all you sissies on
anytime!

594
00:54:22,426 --> 00:54:24,720
Now get back to class.

595
00:54:33,395 --> 00:54:34,772
Get back to class!

596
00:54:35,981 --> 00:54:39,443
Mom, let me borrow
your earrings and watch.

597
00:54:39,610 --> 00:54:43,363
Sure, but be extra careful
with the watch.

598
00:54:51,830 --> 00:54:53,791
How come
there's only NT$8OO left?

599
00:54:53,957 --> 00:54:55,959
I paid our tab at Uncle Fat's

600
00:54:56,084 --> 00:54:59,713
so he won't squawk
next time we buy on credit.

601
00:55:00,130 --> 00:55:02,424
Wang got you a promotion

602
00:55:02,549 --> 00:55:04,676
but not a raise in pay.

603
00:55:06,762 --> 00:55:08,639
What's wrong?

604
00:55:10,516 --> 00:55:12,309
Nothing.

605
00:55:13,644 --> 00:55:15,979
What's with the radio?

606
00:55:32,913 --> 00:55:34,790
What's going on?

607
00:55:37,835 --> 00:55:41,421
I saw Si'r taking it apart
at lunchtime.

608
00:55:42,172 --> 00:55:43,257
Damn it.

609
00:55:44,216 --> 00:55:46,009
Stand up.

610
00:55:46,635 --> 00:55:48,512
Where's your composition?

611
00:55:48,679 --> 00:55:51,723
You're the only one
who didn't hand one in.

612
00:55:52,266 --> 00:55:54,184
Excuse me.

613
00:55:54,518 --> 00:55:57,729
This is Ma,
our new transfer student.

614
00:55:57,855 --> 00:56:00,148
Let's welcome him.

615
00:56:08,615 --> 00:56:10,617
As I was saying,

616
00:56:10,742 --> 00:56:14,037
Chinese characters
reveal a great logic.

617
00:56:14,496 --> 00:56:16,415
Foreign languages
can't compare.

618
00:56:16,540 --> 00:56:20,002
Twenty-six letters
mixed and matched - that's all.

619
00:56:20,127 --> 00:56:22,504
Monotonous and tedious.

620
00:56:23,171 --> 00:56:26,884
Take the character shan,
meaning “mountain.”

621
00:56:27,551 --> 00:56:30,387
Spell it in English for me.

622
00:56:44,401 --> 00:56:46,278
How tedious!

623
00:56:46,403 --> 00:56:50,365
He's the guy who knifed someone
at Banqiao High.

624
00:56:50,532 --> 00:56:53,577
Wang Mao, stand up.

625
00:56:54,620 --> 00:56:57,664
You have something to add?

626
00:56:57,789 --> 00:56:58,957
<i>No.</i>

627
00:56:59,082 --> 00:57:01,793
Then what
were you discussing?

628
00:57:02,544 --> 00:57:04,963
Sir, what about “I”?

629
00:57:05,130 --> 00:57:07,424
What do you mean,
what about you?

630
00:57:07,591 --> 00:57:11,720
No, I mean from what you said,
what about the character for “I”?

631
00:57:12,971 --> 00:57:15,349
Come up here.

632
00:57:15,641 --> 00:57:17,434
Come up front.

633
00:57:21,188 --> 00:57:23,106
You know
the character W0 means

634
00:57:23,273 --> 00:57:25,275
- Yeah.
- Then write it.

635
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:32,699
You're fond of that word,
aren't you?

636
00:57:32,991 --> 00:57:34,952
Write it a hundred times.

637
00:57:35,911 --> 00:57:37,454
Go on!

638
00:57:37,579 --> 00:57:39,998
You seem to enjoy it.

639
00:57:40,248 --> 00:57:41,917
Keep writing!

640
00:57:45,087 --> 00:57:47,506
That's two. Good.

641
00:57:47,631 --> 00:57:49,216
Keep going.

642
00:57:56,807 --> 00:57:58,809
Who's hissing?

643
00:57:59,643 --> 00:58:02,020
Zhang Zhen, stand up.

644
00:58:03,188 --> 00:58:06,525
Who hissed at me?
Speak up.

645
00:58:06,942 --> 00:58:08,652
I don't know.

646
00:58:08,902 --> 00:58:11,113
Then who were you looking at?

647
00:58:11,321 --> 00:58:13,740
Who was it?

648
00:58:14,199 --> 00:58:15,993
I didn't see anyone.

649
00:58:16,159 --> 00:58:17,661
Fine.

650
00:58:17,828 --> 00:58:20,038
If you won't say, it was you.

651
00:58:20,205 --> 00:58:22,290
Stay standing.

652
00:58:22,416 --> 00:58:25,794
Let's turn to page 33.

653
00:58:57,242 --> 00:58:58,994
<i>Mao 8/ 'r./</i>

654
00:59:03,707 --> 00:59:05,542
Xiao Si'r!

655
00:59:08,045 --> 00:59:11,381
- You got any porn?
- Yes.

656
00:59:15,427 --> 00:59:17,095
Xiao Si'r!

657
00:59:26,646 --> 00:59:29,816
- Didn't you hear me calling?
- No.

658
00:59:31,026 --> 00:59:34,488
The screen test is tomorrow.
Wanna come?

659
00:59:34,613 --> 00:59:36,239
Sure.

660
00:59:38,992 --> 00:59:40,619
What's wrong?

661
00:59:40,744 --> 00:59:42,079
Nothing.

662
00:59:42,204 --> 00:59:44,081
You seemed scared to see me.

663
00:59:44,206 --> 00:59:47,084
You afraid
we'll be seen together?

664
00:59:48,502 --> 00:59:50,962
Whoa, out on a date, huh?

665
00:59:52,380 --> 00:59:54,591
Come on.
Let's not talk here.

666
00:59:57,260 --> 01:00:00,097
- Let me have that porn.
- Here.

667
01:00:20,450 --> 01:00:24,496
I thought your boyfriend wouldn't like it
if you took the screen test.

668
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:33,922
Is that why you're afraid
of being seen with me?

669
01:00:36,133 --> 01:00:38,468
I just don't want any trouble.

670
01:00:41,638 --> 01:00:44,307
I know Honey
is your boyfriend.

671
01:00:44,683 --> 01:00:47,144
You still won't admit
you're afraid of me?

672
01:00:53,733 --> 01:00:55,735
You're funny.

673
01:00:58,363 --> 01:00:59,990
What are you laughing at?

674
01:01:00,157 --> 01:01:04,161
You're so honorable.
<i>It'll</i> get you in trouble.

675
01:01:10,709 --> 01:01:12,335
Why?

676
01:01:13,670 --> 01:01:15,547
Honey's like you.

677
01:01:15,672 --> 01:01:18,049
Everyone's scared of him,

678
01:01:18,884 --> 01:01:23,096
but they don't realize
he's straight as an arrow.

679
01:01:24,347 --> 01:01:26,516
He can't stand things
that are unfair.

680
01:01:26,683 --> 01:01:30,353
He takes it on himself
to straighten things out.

681
01:01:32,063 --> 01:01:34,274
I tried to convince him

682
01:01:34,399 --> 01:01:37,819
that he can't change
the world by himself.

683
01:01:38,737 --> 01:01:40,947
He'd argue with me

684
01:01:41,364 --> 01:01:43,825
and blame me
for discouraging him.

685
01:01:50,373 --> 01:01:53,710
But now that he's gone,

686
01:01:54,252 --> 01:01:56,421
I miss him so much.

687
01:01:56,588 --> 01:01:59,633
I just cry and cry.

688
01:02:08,600 --> 01:02:11,436
I heard
it was because of you

689
01:02:11,811 --> 01:02:14,606
that Honey killed Redhead,
the former 217 boss,

690
01:02:14,731 --> 01:02:16,733
and then went on the run.

691
01:02:16,900 --> 01:02:18,693
Is that true?

692
01:02:34,459 --> 01:02:36,962
Will you come watch
my screen test tomorrow?

693
01:02:37,087 --> 01:02:39,631
If I come, <i>I'll</i> be up there.

694
01:02:49,766 --> 01:02:51,810
You gonna do it?

695
01:03:04,322 --> 01:03:10,996
<i>There is a place
of peace and calm</i>

696
01:03:13,290 --> 01:03:16,876
Are you sure your weekly
Bible class and choir

697
01:03:17,002 --> 01:03:19,379
won't affect
your grades at school?

698
01:03:30,515 --> 01:03:32,559
Did you have a good time?

699
01:03:34,894 --> 01:03:36,563
Careful!

700
01:03:40,734 --> 01:03:45,030
Your father and I met
at a dance back in Shanghai.

701
01:03:45,155 --> 01:03:49,534
We girls at the Teachers College
were very westernized.

702
01:03:50,368 --> 01:03:53,955
Who'd have dreamed
I'd meet this peasant boy?

703
01:03:56,541 --> 01:04:01,171
He'd just arrived in Shanghai
from Guangzhou.

704
01:04:02,172 --> 01:04:05,842
Luckily Wang took him around
and showed him the real world.

705
01:04:10,597 --> 01:04:12,849
He was a real peasant boy.

706
01:04:13,308 --> 01:04:16,936
Lots of girls liked him,
and he didn't even know it.

707
01:04:20,690 --> 01:04:23,109
I thought he was real special.

708
01:04:32,994 --> 01:04:34,579
<i>S? r.</i>

709
01:04:34,996 --> 01:04:36,748
Come with me.

710
01:04:52,222 --> 01:04:53,890
What's the matter?

711
01:04:55,475 --> 01:04:57,352
- Where's the watch?
- What watch?

712
01:04:57,477 --> 01:05:00,105
Mom's watch.
Did Cat steal it?

713
01:05:00,230 --> 01:05:02,190
Impossible!

714
01:05:02,732 --> 01:05:06,069
I had it at lunchtime,
but tonight it was gone.

715
01:05:06,236 --> 01:05:08,405
Wasn't he here this afternoon?

716
01:05:08,530 --> 01:05:10,031
I took it.

717
01:05:10,156 --> 01:05:13,243
What?
What got into you? Why?

718
01:05:13,576 --> 01:05:15,453
I owe someone money.

719
01:05:15,578 --> 01:05:17,497
Owe someone money?

720
01:05:19,749 --> 01:05:22,168
How much?
- Four hundred.

721
01:05:22,669 --> 01:05:24,879
You pawned it, didn't you?

722
01:05:26,005 --> 01:05:28,216
I swear,
you'll be the end of me!

723
01:05:28,341 --> 01:05:30,927
Mom will skin you alive
if she finds out!

724
01:05:33,346 --> 01:05:35,098
How come you owed so much?

725
01:05:35,265 --> 01:05:38,268
Threads took me to shoot pool
with the Village boys.

726
01:05:38,435 --> 01:05:40,270
We lost big.

727
01:05:40,437 --> 01:05:42,730
Now he's messing
with the Little Park boys.

728
01:05:42,856 --> 01:05:45,942
I gotta get out clean
before all hell breaks loose.

729
01:05:46,401 --> 01:05:48,403
Morn never wears
the watch anyway.

730
01:05:48,570 --> 01:05:49,904
Here.

731
01:05:51,281 --> 01:05:54,284
Go get the watch back.

732
01:05:56,077 --> 01:05:58,830
I'll say I sent you
for some language books.

733
01:05:58,955 --> 01:06:01,207
Be sure you bring one back.

734
01:06:22,770 --> 01:06:24,981
Mrs. Fang!

735
01:07:00,225 --> 01:07:02,852
Has she had asthma long?

736
01:07:03,019 --> 01:07:06,523
She's had attacks before,
but never this serious.

737
01:07:06,689 --> 01:07:09,943
Most asthma medication
is no longer effective on her.

738
01:07:10,068 --> 01:07:13,530
She must be especially careful
when the weather changes.

739
01:07:13,696 --> 01:07:15,865
Don't let her be
in unventilated places

740
01:07:16,032 --> 01:07:17,742
or get too tired.

741
01:07:17,867 --> 01:07:19,869
Isn't this your address?

742
01:07:20,036 --> 01:07:21,996
They live with me.

743
01:07:25,208 --> 01:07:26,668
It's that much?

744
01:07:26,793 --> 01:07:28,753
Couldn't you give me
a little discount?

745
01:07:29,462 --> 01:07:32,048
Her daughter said
she knows you.

746
01:07:32,173 --> 01:07:33,925
That's why I brought her here.

747
01:07:34,092 --> 01:07:37,470
You've treated
her daughter before, right?

748
01:07:38,054 --> 01:07:39,764
Well... yes.

749
01:07:39,889 --> 01:07:44,018
But I can't make
decisions like this.

750
01:07:46,771 --> 01:07:49,399
<i>Are you thinking
about something sad?</i>

751
01:07:54,404 --> 01:07:56,489
<i>Can you tell me about it?</i>

752
01:07:59,242 --> 01:08:02,287
<i>Maybe you don't know
where to start.</i>

753
01:08:07,792 --> 01:08:09,836
<i>Can you tell me now?</i>

754
01:08:13,256 --> 01:08:14,841
<i>okay-</i>

755
01:08:23,516 --> 01:08:26,269
<i>Not bad. Very good.</i>

756
01:08:27,854 --> 01:08:30,231
What now, sir?

757
01:08:31,357 --> 01:08:34,277
Let's try a historical costume.

758
01:08:34,527 --> 01:08:36,362
Are you sure?

759
01:08:38,323 --> 01:08:40,116
All right.

760
01:08:44,454 --> 01:08:46,873
Sir, the boss lady's here!

761
01:08:55,131 --> 01:08:58,051
What's this I hear
about my leading lady?

762
01:08:59,510 --> 01:09:01,804
The part calls for a teenager,

763
01:09:01,929 --> 01:09:04,307
so we got a teenager.

764
01:09:04,432 --> 01:09:06,809
Can you guarantee
the box office?

765
01:09:09,145 --> 01:09:12,899
Well, times are hard...

766
01:09:13,024 --> 01:09:14,692
it's very obvious.

767
01:09:14,817 --> 01:09:16,694
You two made
the exact same mistakes.

768
01:09:16,819 --> 01:09:19,656
I didn't let him copy.
He just did.

769
01:09:19,822 --> 01:09:23,493
Who are you trying to fool?
The exact same mistakes.

770
01:09:23,618 --> 01:09:25,912
Not one word more
or one word less.

771
01:09:26,037 --> 01:09:28,164
Demerits for both of you.

772
01:09:28,331 --> 01:09:31,501
I made mistakes on purpose,
and he copied them.

773
01:09:31,626 --> 01:09:33,419
You still dare to talk back?

774
01:09:33,544 --> 01:09:35,380
I didn't do anything wrong.

775
01:09:35,505 --> 01:09:37,674
You speak
to a teacher like that?

776
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:39,550
I didn't do anything wrong.

777
01:09:39,676 --> 01:09:43,137
Keep talking back.
<i>It'll</i> get you another demerit!

778
01:09:43,262 --> 01:09:44,472
Why?

779
01:09:44,597 --> 01:09:48,726
Who's talking back
to a teacher like that?

780
01:09:50,311 --> 01:09:52,313
You two again!

781
01:10:00,613 --> 01:10:03,324
<i>We have our regulations.
My hands are tied.</i>

782
01:10:04,534 --> 01:10:07,870
Try this new tea for a change.

783
01:10:11,874 --> 01:10:14,001
He was obviously a victim,

784
01:10:14,127 --> 01:10:17,296
and you're punishing him
without an investigation.

785
01:10:17,463 --> 01:10:19,549
This isn't fair!

786
01:10:21,426 --> 01:10:23,386
I send my son to you,

787
01:10:23,553 --> 01:10:26,347
hoping he'll become
a decent, honest person.

788
01:10:26,889 --> 01:10:29,684
If he makes mistakes,
I hope you'll correct him.

789
01:10:29,809 --> 01:10:32,061
But when you act like this -

790
01:10:32,186 --> 01:10:34,731
it's just not fair!

791
01:10:34,897 --> 01:10:37,191
What is this? Lao Fan!

792
01:10:38,901 --> 01:10:41,571
What the hell is this?
- What's the matter?

793
01:10:41,738 --> 01:10:43,531
None of your business.

794
01:10:45,032 --> 01:10:47,827
Your son's lucky.
The other boy's been expelled.

795
01:10:47,952 --> 01:10:52,373
Because of all his demerits!
That's irrelevant!

796
01:10:53,708 --> 01:10:55,752
You think your son
is a model student?

797
01:10:55,918 --> 01:10:58,087
I've nabbed him myself
many times.

798
01:10:58,254 --> 01:11:00,256
That has nothing
to do with this!

799
01:11:00,381 --> 01:11:03,092
This isn't education!
You harass the good students!

800
01:11:03,259 --> 01:11:04,552
Don't get excited.

801
01:11:04,677 --> 01:11:07,764
We have our regulations.
There's no way I can help.

802
01:11:07,889 --> 01:11:10,516
I'm not here for your help.
I'm here for justice.

803
01:11:10,808 --> 01:11:14,270
I'm not looking for personal favors.
I don't need your help.

804
01:11:14,395 --> 01:11:18,274
How can you have
such a bureaucratic attitude?

805
01:11:18,775 --> 01:11:20,777
I can't believe it!

806
01:11:26,282 --> 01:11:28,117
It's my fault.

807
01:11:28,409 --> 01:11:30,328
I lost my cool.

808
01:11:31,370 --> 01:11:33,706
It's a bad habit of mine.

809
01:11:36,334 --> 01:11:38,795
I can't help it.
When I see these bureaucrats -

810
01:11:38,920 --> 01:11:42,048
He deserved it.

811
01:11:42,632 --> 01:11:44,717
But you really surprised me.

812
01:11:44,842 --> 01:11:47,261
That's not what
you should be learning.

813
01:11:48,763 --> 01:11:50,890
You might as well
take the demerit.

814
01:11:52,058 --> 01:11:54,352
A person who'll apologize

815
01:11:54,477 --> 01:11:56,813
for wrongs he didn't commit

816
01:11:57,230 --> 01:12:00,149
is capable of all sorts
of terrible things.

817
01:12:01,317 --> 01:12:05,571
But that kind of thing
seems to happen so often.

818
01:12:05,988 --> 01:12:07,532
Exactly.

819
01:12:08,783 --> 01:12:12,078
The purpose of education
is to search for the truth of life

820
01:12:12,203 --> 01:12:14,121
to believe in.

821
01:12:14,413 --> 01:12:17,667
If you can't be brave enough
to believe in it,

822
01:12:17,792 --> 01:12:19,877
then what's the purpose of life?

823
01:12:24,006 --> 01:12:25,925
Si'r, you're lucky.

824
01:12:27,051 --> 01:12:29,053
I hope this incident

825
01:12:29,178 --> 01:12:32,932
proves to be something positive
and not a setback.

826
01:12:33,808 --> 01:12:36,227
You must believe that your future

827
01:12:36,352 --> 01:12:38,896
is determined
by your own hard work.

828
01:12:43,693 --> 01:12:45,653
You still unhappy?

829
01:12:48,447 --> 01:12:50,491
About me getting you
this demerit?

830
01:12:50,616 --> 01:12:54,704
No, I'm worried
about what Mom will think.

831
01:12:55,830 --> 01:12:57,748
I'm worried for your sake.

832
01:12:58,666 --> 01:13:00,001
Your poor mother.

833
01:13:00,167 --> 01:13:04,088
All these years,
and she still worries about me.

834
01:13:05,089 --> 01:13:06,799
Remember:

835
01:13:07,258 --> 01:13:10,970
Things with a hole in the middle
bring headaches.

836
01:13:11,721 --> 01:13:13,639
What's that mean?

837
01:13:15,224 --> 01:13:18,519
Nothing. You'll find out
when you grow up.

838
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:26,569
What are you studying?

839
01:13:28,404 --> 01:13:30,531
I'm studying at a cram school.

840
01:13:30,656 --> 01:13:33,409
No, I mean the book.
It's so thick.

841
01:13:33,576 --> 01:13:35,995
We all know
that your daughter goes

842
01:13:36,120 --> 01:13:38,331
to the best college.

843
01:13:38,998 --> 01:13:40,750
I didn't mean that.

844
01:13:40,875 --> 01:13:42,752
Yeah, <i>I'll</i> bet.

845
01:13:43,377 --> 01:13:45,379
But who cares where she goes?

846
01:13:45,504 --> 01:13:49,383
My daughter doesn't go
running around with boys

847
01:13:49,592 --> 01:13:51,469
and holding their hands.

848
01:13:52,345 --> 01:13:54,096
Now, wait a second.

849
01:13:54,263 --> 01:13:56,474
We're all neighbors.
Why that tone?

850
01:13:56,682 --> 01:13:59,602
Exactly. I'm saying
this for your own good.

851
01:13:59,769 --> 01:14:01,646
Don't get me wrong.

852
01:14:02,605 --> 01:14:05,191
Kids nowadays
aren't what you think,

853
01:14:05,316 --> 01:14:08,527
with their dating
and their street gangs.

854
01:14:11,155 --> 01:14:15,451
Take him, for example,
at night school and all.

855
01:14:15,576 --> 01:14:18,287
He must be tough to handle.

856
01:14:19,789 --> 01:14:23,125
So a good school
isn't everything, is it?

857
01:14:23,292 --> 01:14:26,754
Find something better to do
with your time!

858
01:14:28,422 --> 01:14:31,092
So I don't have
a cushy job like yours.

859
01:14:31,217 --> 01:14:34,720
I worked for the railroads,
you know!

860
01:14:34,845 --> 01:14:37,932
And I quit myself!
No one fired me!

861
01:14:38,140 --> 01:14:40,476
If you had better things
to do with your salary,

862
01:14:40,643 --> 01:14:42,812
you wouldn't turn it over to me!

863
01:14:42,979 --> 01:14:45,272
Without my credit,
you'd starve!

864
01:14:45,398 --> 01:14:48,651
What's gotten into you, Father?

865
01:14:49,485 --> 01:14:51,988
You want another heart attack?

866
01:14:52,321 --> 01:14:55,157
- You've been drinking again.
- Mind your own business!

867
01:14:55,491 --> 01:14:59,078
When people negotiate,
they defuse the issue.

868
01:14:59,203 --> 01:15:02,289
You end up getting him
a major demerit!

869
01:15:02,456 --> 01:15:04,750
<i>The demerit is beside the point.</i>

870
01:15:04,875 --> 01:15:07,253
<i>He must learn
to be just and honorable.</i>

871
01:15:07,837 --> 01:15:10,506
<i>This is the time
to insist on principles</i>

872
01:15:10,881 --> 01:15:13,342
<i>and set a good example
for the children.</i>

873
01:15:13,509 --> 01:15:15,845
This isn't the time for principles!

874
01:15:16,012 --> 01:15:17,847
I'm going to the bathroom.

875
01:15:18,889 --> 01:15:22,309
- You always mess things up.
- <i>Nonsense.</i>

876
01:15:22,935 --> 01:15:27,648
<i>I've lived my life
at peace with myself.</i>

877
01:15:27,773 --> 01:15:29,692
<i>I've never messed things up.</i>

878
01:15:32,528 --> 01:15:35,322
What's your problem?
I was reading.

879
01:15:35,448 --> 01:15:37,116
Gimme!

880
01:15:40,036 --> 01:15:41,871
<i>Going out this late?</i>

881
01:15:42,038 --> 01:15:44,665
I need to borrow
a book from a friend.

882
01:15:48,044 --> 01:15:50,588
Hurry home,
and don't be running around!

883
01:15:55,384 --> 01:15:57,720
Mrs. Fang was kind to us.

884
01:15:58,387 --> 01:16:00,723
My asthma's done it again.

885
01:16:00,848 --> 01:16:03,559
I can't blame her
for letting me go.

886
01:16:17,281 --> 01:16:18,741
Ming...

887
01:16:18,908 --> 01:16:20,743
hurry and grow up.

888
01:16:21,535 --> 01:16:24,038
My future depends on you.

889
01:16:24,371 --> 01:16:26,082
Finally.

890
01:16:26,999 --> 01:16:29,043
You kept us all waiting.

891
01:16:30,002 --> 01:16:31,629
Get inside.

892
01:16:32,463 --> 01:16:33,798
Move!

893
01:16:33,923 --> 01:16:36,509
What are you staring at?
You got a problem?

894
01:16:36,634 --> 01:16:38,010
Move!

895
01:16:38,677 --> 01:16:40,304
Hurry UP-

896
01:16:40,930 --> 01:16:44,391
it's okay.
They want you inside.

897
01:16:46,936 --> 01:16:49,522
Come on in, Lao Er.

898
01:16:49,647 --> 01:16:52,691
Take the bike for him.

899
01:17:12,837 --> 01:17:16,173
<i>You can't blame
Mrs. Fang for this.</i>

900
01:17:17,424 --> 01:17:19,677
<i>You know my asthma condition.</i>

901
01:17:19,802 --> 01:17:22,096
<i>Who knows when it'll act up?</i>

902
01:17:23,222 --> 01:17:26,809
<i>Why make a big thing
about us moving back?</i>

903
01:17:26,934 --> 01:17:28,936
Things are different now.

904
01:17:29,854 --> 01:17:33,190
Look at all these mouths
I have to feed.

905
01:17:34,150 --> 01:17:36,694
<i>You're the only relative we have.</i>

906
01:17:37,987 --> 01:17:40,239
Where else can we go?

907
01:17:40,364 --> 01:17:42,950
You brought us to Taiwan
with your regiment.

908
01:17:43,075 --> 01:17:46,162
If you don't want us,
send us away.

909
01:17:47,288 --> 01:17:49,123
Why all the fuss?

910
01:17:49,248 --> 01:17:52,042
I always move out
the minute I find work.

911
01:17:53,961 --> 01:17:56,922
This place belongs
to the army.

912
01:17:57,089 --> 01:17:59,258
You're a freeloader here too.

913
01:17:59,508 --> 01:18:01,260
A freeloader?

914
01:18:01,802 --> 01:18:05,806
At her age, I was fighting
the Japs and the Commies!

915
01:18:07,016 --> 01:18:09,977
Let me tell you:
I am this country.

916
01:18:10,102 --> 01:18:12,438
This place belongs to the army,
so it's mine.

917
01:18:12,563 --> 01:18:14,190
What a joke!

918
01:18:14,773 --> 01:18:17,193
So we'll say
you owe 350 of it.

919
01:18:17,318 --> 01:18:19,528
I'm not responsible for it.

920
01:18:24,575 --> 01:18:28,537
You're not? He says
he's not responsible for it.

921
01:18:29,705 --> 01:18:31,790
What do you take us for?

922
01:18:31,957 --> 01:18:34,460
I've been a little short
on cash recently.

923
01:18:34,710 --> 01:18:39,381
Shandong,
you trust me, don't you?

924
01:18:43,594 --> 01:18:46,805
Come this way. Do as I say.

925
01:18:47,056 --> 01:18:49,225
Don't be a hothead like me.

926
01:18:49,391 --> 01:18:51,727
Cool down a bit.

927
01:19:01,362 --> 01:19:03,113
I heard...

928
01:19:04,823 --> 01:19:07,576
your concert tickets
have been selling well.

929
01:19:08,035 --> 01:19:09,620
Not at all.

930
01:19:09,745 --> 01:19:12,498
Someone's trying to ruin it all.

931
01:19:13,499 --> 01:19:17,002
Your concert
with the Little Park boys

932
01:19:17,127 --> 01:19:19,672
has made us look bad.

933
01:19:20,256 --> 01:19:24,385
You always share the goodies
with the other guys.

934
01:19:24,677 --> 01:19:27,263
In this greasy little head of yours,

935
01:19:27,429 --> 01:19:30,099
what are we really?

936
01:19:31,267 --> 01:19:33,227
I'm gonna kick your ass

937
01:19:33,352 --> 01:19:35,646
even if Shandong
lets you off easy.

938
01:19:35,771 --> 01:19:37,314
Shit, the power again!

939
01:19:37,439 --> 01:19:40,776
Threads, don't run off.
Stay where you are.

940
01:19:44,571 --> 01:19:47,491
How could a jerk like Sly
have so much pull?

941
01:19:47,616 --> 01:19:50,869
It's his old man who has
all the clout, not him.

942
01:19:50,995 --> 01:19:53,205
What do you expect me to do?

943
01:19:59,044 --> 01:20:00,963
I tell you what.

944
01:20:03,257 --> 01:20:07,177
<i>I'll</i> give you a break
on the money you owe me.

945
01:20:11,140 --> 01:20:13,267
Just do me one favor.

946
01:20:22,318 --> 01:20:24,653
I want to meet with Sly.

947
01:20:26,113 --> 01:20:29,658
Impossible! The two gangs
are bitter enemies.

948
01:20:36,623 --> 01:20:38,959
<i>Wheres the Independent News?</i>

949
01:20:39,251 --> 01:20:42,838
Orders from upstairs.
We only get the Central <i>Daily</i> now.

950
01:20:43,630 --> 01:20:46,759
Going to the movies again?
What about school work?

951
01:20:47,509 --> 01:20:49,678
Just play your game.

952
01:21:04,193 --> 01:21:08,113
<i>The days drag
since you got expelled, huh?</i>

953
01:21:10,282 --> 01:21:13,577
Shit.
What are you doing here?

954
01:21:18,999 --> 01:21:22,127
I've becomes partners
with them in the concert.

955
01:21:22,795 --> 01:21:24,713
Then I'm out.

956
01:21:25,047 --> 01:21:28,550
Come on, don't be so rash.

957
01:21:28,675 --> 01:21:31,261
Why let such a beautiful hall
sit vacant?

958
01:21:31,387 --> 01:21:32,888
Look at it this way.

959
01:21:33,013 --> 01:21:36,308
As long as the two of you
can work together,

960
01:21:36,433 --> 01:21:40,479
there's no limit
to the bucks that'll roll in.

961
01:21:40,604 --> 01:21:42,606
Think about it.

962
01:21:42,731 --> 01:21:45,234
The whole 217 gang
will be behind you.

963
01:21:45,359 --> 01:21:49,738
Who else will the Little Park boys
follow but you?

964
01:21:50,989 --> 01:21:53,075
You want me
to betray my brothers.

965
01:21:53,242 --> 01:21:54,827
Not a chance.

966
01:21:57,913 --> 01:22:00,707
Make peace over a smoke.

967
01:22:01,250 --> 01:22:02,584
Come on, have one.

968
01:22:02,709 --> 01:22:05,546
Shit!
Now you're playing the Indian?

969
01:22:22,062 --> 01:22:24,273
It seems you have...

970
01:22:25,107 --> 01:22:27,109
woman problems.

971
01:22:29,611 --> 01:22:31,321
Jade?

972
01:22:31,613 --> 01:22:33,282
No problem there.

973
01:22:35,367 --> 01:22:37,828
I'm not talking about Jade.

974
01:22:41,457 --> 01:22:43,876
I've kept it under wraps...

975
01:22:45,002 --> 01:22:48,005
or else we wouldn't
be here talking.

976
01:22:48,672 --> 01:22:50,340
Right?

977
01:22:56,221 --> 01:22:58,515
If you've got problems...

978
01:23:03,353 --> 01:23:05,981
I can solve them for you.

979
01:23:08,734 --> 01:23:10,569
Not that one.

980
01:23:10,944 --> 01:23:13,822
The first song on side A.

981
01:23:27,044 --> 01:23:29,129
Don't anyone move.

982
01:23:29,922 --> 01:23:33,342
Which one of you is Tiger?

983
01:23:37,012 --> 01:23:39,014
Won't show yourself, huh?

984
01:23:39,264 --> 01:23:42,309
What a load of crap!

985
01:23:42,434 --> 01:23:46,146
When can I get the lyrics?
- Depends on my big sister.

986
01:23:46,271 --> 01:23:48,190
Tomorrow, okay?

987
01:23:49,024 --> 01:23:51,860
- Still trying to hide?
- I'm not Tiger.

988
01:23:51,985 --> 01:23:53,946
You're not, huh?

989
01:23:54,238 --> 01:23:55,864
No!

990
01:23:56,198 --> 01:23:57,407
It's not me!

991
01:23:57,533 --> 01:24:02,287
Then who was the guy with Ming
at the shooting range?

992
01:24:06,041 --> 01:24:07,709
Move it.

993
01:24:13,340 --> 01:24:15,717
Did you get your kicks

994
01:24:16,093 --> 01:24:18,845
fooling around
with one of our girls?

995
01:24:19,638 --> 01:24:22,224
- Stand at attention!
- Attention!

996
01:24:23,517 --> 01:24:26,562
Don't you know
how to stand at attention?

997
01:24:26,687 --> 01:24:28,605
<i>Where are you boys from?</i>

998
01:24:28,730 --> 01:24:31,900
Looking for trouble, fucker?

999
01:24:32,401 --> 01:24:35,237
<i>You know whose turf you're on?</i>

1000
01:24:35,654 --> 01:24:38,240
It's Ma, General Ma's son.

1001
01:24:38,574 --> 01:24:40,909
Fuck you!
Where's your turf?

1002
01:24:41,076 --> 01:24:43,120
Wherever I am is my turf.

1003
01:24:52,713 --> 01:24:54,715
It was all a misunderstanding.

1004
01:24:55,924 --> 01:24:58,844
Okay, then it's all settled.

1005
01:25:00,304 --> 01:25:02,306
Let's get back to the village.

1006
01:25:09,938 --> 01:25:11,189
Thanks.

1007
01:25:11,315 --> 01:25:14,568
No problem.
Some of them recognized me.

1008
01:25:15,152 --> 01:25:17,487
I thought you were
a model student,

1009
01:25:17,863 --> 01:25:20,699
but you mess around with girls
and get into fights.

1010
01:25:20,824 --> 01:25:23,410
They picked a fight with me.

1011
01:25:23,785 --> 01:25:26,872
Getting in trouble over a girl
is just plain dumb.

1012
01:25:26,997 --> 01:25:28,624
Understand?

1013
01:25:30,417 --> 01:25:31,918
Where'd they go?

1014
01:25:32,044 --> 01:25:33,295
It's over.

1015
01:25:33,920 --> 01:25:37,382
What the hell's all this?

1016
01:25:37,507 --> 01:25:39,384
We came to save you.

1017
01:25:39,968 --> 01:25:43,805
You've actually used these
in fights? Shit!

1018
01:25:47,184 --> 01:25:49,645
You wanna fight?
Take this.

1019
01:25:49,895 --> 01:25:51,647
This is a real weapon.

1020
01:25:51,772 --> 01:25:54,316
Holy smokes! Cool, man!

1021
01:25:55,317 --> 01:25:58,737
Is this what you used
on that guy at Banqiao High?

1022
01:26:00,656 --> 01:26:02,491
Where'd you get it?

1023
01:26:02,658 --> 01:26:04,910
Right here, above the ceiling.

1024
01:26:05,035 --> 01:26:08,330
A Japanese general
used to live here.

1025
01:26:08,497 --> 01:26:12,167
Check your attic at home.
You might find something.

1026
01:26:12,292 --> 01:26:15,504
I found a bullet
for a Japanese rifle once.

1027
01:26:16,296 --> 01:26:18,799
Shit! What's this now?

1028
01:26:19,508 --> 01:26:22,886
A tape recorder from when
Eisenhower came here.

1029
01:26:23,011 --> 01:26:26,473
An American reporter left it
to my old man.

1030
01:26:26,807 --> 01:26:31,311
It can record a barking dog
ten miles away.

1031
01:27:04,636 --> 01:27:07,347
<i>What are you doing, Cat?</i>

1032
01:27:07,556 --> 01:27:09,433
<i>Tearing the house apart?</i>

1033
01:27:09,725 --> 01:27:11,977
I'm looking for rats.

1034
01:27:28,368 --> 01:27:30,537
You've moved back again.

1035
01:27:38,587 --> 01:27:42,591
They say every time you move,
you find a new boyfriend.

1036
01:27:46,011 --> 01:27:48,680
How about me this time?

1037
01:28:00,317 --> 01:28:02,694
Don't understand
what I'm saying?

1038
01:28:14,664 --> 01:28:16,792
You understand that,
don't you?

1039
01:28:33,099 --> 01:28:37,103
You got some nerve,
moving back at a time like this.

1040
01:28:44,486 --> 01:28:47,614
We'll probably all end up
in trouble because of you.

1041
01:28:57,833 --> 01:29:01,545
Shit! Putting on
that “poor little me” look again?

1042
01:29:18,353 --> 01:29:20,939
Any word from Honey?

1043
01:29:25,026 --> 01:29:28,363
- Look who finally shows up!
- Did they call roll?

1044
01:29:28,488 --> 01:29:30,532
No, it was a study period.

1045
01:29:30,657 --> 01:29:32,784
What the hell's that?

1046
01:29:32,909 --> 01:29:34,995
Cat's record player.

1047
01:29:35,120 --> 01:29:38,373
Hey, can you get me
some tickets?

1048
01:29:38,540 --> 01:29:41,835
For the concert?
Ask Cat.

1049
01:29:42,002 --> 01:29:45,380
Neither he nor Airplane
showed up.

1050
01:29:45,547 --> 01:29:47,674
<i>I'll</i> ask him for you.

1051
01:29:52,721 --> 01:29:55,432
<i>- Where do you come from?
- Hualien.</i>

1052
01:29:55,557 --> 01:29:58,143
<i>Hualien?
That's a nice place.</i>

1053
01:29:58,393 --> 01:30:00,896
<i>I was stationed there
for a month.</i>

1054
01:30:01,229 --> 01:30:03,189
<i>What made you come to Taipei?</i>

1055
01:30:03,315 --> 01:30:05,525
<i>There's a lot more
happening here.</i>

1056
01:30:05,650 --> 01:30:08,403
<i>You young people go
where the crowds are.</i>

1057
01:30:08,570 --> 01:30:10,906
<i>It's true,
a lot's happening in Taipei,</i>

1058
01:30:11,031 --> 01:30:14,200
<i>but nothing compared
to my hometown.</i>

1059
01:30:14,576 --> 01:30:18,580
<i>Take my hometown,
for example.</i>

1060
01:30:18,747 --> 01:30:20,624
I come from Qingdao.

1061
01:30:21,041 --> 01:30:23,001
Qingdao is -

1062
01:30:24,419 --> 01:30:26,463
A shot for your eyes?

1063
01:30:26,588 --> 01:30:29,841
I've run out. Try next week.

1064
01:30:31,509 --> 01:30:34,930
The architecture in Qingdao
is very special.

1065
01:30:35,096 --> 01:30:36,765
The Germans built it.

1066
01:30:36,932 --> 01:30:39,142
The drainage system
is remarkable,

1067
01:30:39,267 --> 01:30:41,436
with big wide canals.

1068
01:30:41,561 --> 01:30:43,939
It doesn't matter
how hard it rains.

1069
01:30:44,064 --> 01:30:47,108
Once it stops, there's never
any water on the ground.

1070
01:30:47,275 --> 01:30:48,944
Not like Taipei.

1071
01:30:49,110 --> 01:30:51,112
When it rains,
there's water everywhere.

1072
01:31:04,960 --> 01:31:08,672
Didn't you say you'd come
to my screen test?

1073
01:31:11,049 --> 01:31:13,093
Why didn't you show up?

1074
01:31:13,426 --> 01:31:16,221
Didn't you hear
I got a major demerit?

1075
01:31:17,555 --> 01:31:20,350
And remember when
some 217 guys saw you and me

1076
01:31:20,475 --> 01:31:22,894
at the shooting range?

1077
01:31:23,186 --> 01:31:26,481
They came after me
the other night at school.

1078
01:31:28,566 --> 01:31:32,570
I've had a string
of bad luck lately.

1079
01:31:38,326 --> 01:31:41,162
Cat told me to go
to the ice cream parlor.

1080
01:31:41,329 --> 01:31:43,581
He seemed nervous,
like something was up.

1081
01:31:43,707 --> 01:31:45,417
You saw Cat?

1082
01:31:45,583 --> 01:31:48,503
No wonder he and Airplane
cut <i>class</i> today.

1083
01:31:49,045 --> 01:31:52,424
<i>I'll</i> go with you.
I've got something for him.

1084
01:31:52,841 --> 01:31:56,052
Aren't you afraid of getting
into trouble again?

1085
01:31:56,177 --> 01:31:59,848
Nothing's going on between you and me.
What's to be afraid of?

1086
01:32:57,363 --> 01:33:00,283
- What are you doing here?
- Returning this to you.

1087
01:33:00,408 --> 01:33:02,577
The lyrics are inside.

1088
01:33:25,767 --> 01:33:28,269
- What are you doing here?
- You own the place?

1089
01:33:28,436 --> 01:33:31,272
It's cool, man.
He's here to see me.

1090
01:33:32,273 --> 01:33:35,819
You're acting gutsier
than last time I saw you.

1091
01:33:36,736 --> 01:33:40,782
I hear you two are having
a real sweet time lately.

1092
01:33:41,116 --> 01:33:42,700
Who are you talking about?

1093
01:33:42,826 --> 01:33:44,869
What an actor!

1094
01:33:45,370 --> 01:33:47,914
A real Gregory Pecker!

1095
01:33:51,042 --> 01:33:53,044
Now you're in deep shit.

1096
01:33:54,170 --> 01:33:56,256
Don't run off.

1097
01:33:57,132 --> 01:33:59,217
We're all brothers.
Forget it.

1098
01:33:59,926 --> 01:34:01,970
Tough guy, eh?

1099
01:34:02,637 --> 01:34:04,639
Where'd you learn it from?

1100
01:34:04,806 --> 01:34:08,476
Fuck! I'm gonna
teach you a lesson.

1101
01:34:11,396 --> 01:34:13,940
This doesn't hurt anymore, huh?

1102
01:34:14,232 --> 01:34:16,484
Just itches, huh?

1103
01:34:19,154 --> 01:34:23,116
Aren't you a model student?
How come you're getting angry?

1104
01:34:23,241 --> 01:34:25,285
He's not.

1105
01:34:26,536 --> 01:34:28,872
Want me to teach you
a lesson too?

1106
01:34:29,038 --> 01:34:31,457
Picking on a squirt like that -

1107
01:34:31,583 --> 01:34:33,543
pretty pathetic.

1108
01:34:41,134 --> 01:34:42,844
Come with me.

1109
01:34:48,183 --> 01:34:51,144
I was just taking care
of business for you.

1110
01:34:53,521 --> 01:34:57,025
- You look like a good kid.
- I'm here to see Cat.

1111
01:35:00,153 --> 01:35:02,363
You have no business here.

1112
01:35:05,158 --> 01:35:06,868
Get going.

1113
01:35:25,094 --> 01:35:27,639
You done talking?

1114
01:35:30,016 --> 01:35:32,393
Most of the guys
feel the same way.

1115
01:35:32,560 --> 01:35:36,314
Things can't go on
as they are now.

1116
01:35:36,481 --> 01:35:38,358
Someone has to take charge.

1117
01:35:38,483 --> 01:35:41,194
Things have to go on
when you're not here.

1118
01:35:43,404 --> 01:35:47,533
Your problems with
the 217 boys are personal.

1119
01:35:48,326 --> 01:35:51,371
They came for peace
on their own initiative.

1120
01:35:51,871 --> 01:35:54,624
The guys all think
we should consider it.

1121
01:35:55,917 --> 01:35:57,710
Think it over.

1122
01:35:58,920 --> 01:36:01,339
Let us know
what you think next time.

1123
01:36:11,557 --> 01:36:13,101
Shit!

1124
01:36:13,768 --> 01:36:15,770
This is open mutiny.

1125
01:36:17,063 --> 01:36:18,523
Brother.

1126
01:36:19,274 --> 01:36:22,318
Things aren't
as simple as you think.

1127
01:36:22,860 --> 01:36:25,446
Go tell Eastgate Ling
and Third-ring Ye

1128
01:36:25,613 --> 01:36:27,323
that I'm in town.

1129
01:36:28,366 --> 01:36:30,285
Tell them to come over.

1130
01:36:30,827 --> 01:36:32,954
Don't say anything else.

1131
01:36:42,297 --> 01:36:43,631
Shit.

1132
01:36:43,756 --> 01:36:47,468
Shandong and Threads have turned
the concert into quite an affair.

1133
01:36:47,593 --> 01:36:49,804
Let's add a little heat.

1134
01:36:53,016 --> 01:36:55,768
Does it have to be
during the concert?

1135
01:36:57,020 --> 01:37:00,523
Shit! No wonder you'll never be
a match for Sly.

1136
01:37:01,649 --> 01:37:04,777
All you worry about is
getting on stage and singing.

1137
01:37:05,403 --> 01:37:07,113
Am I right?

1138
01:37:08,448 --> 01:37:10,241
You're hopeless.

1139
01:37:41,814 --> 01:37:44,442
- Didn't you say Lao Er knows?
- About what?

1140
01:37:44,567 --> 01:37:47,403
What Threads
and the 217s are up to.

1141
01:37:52,533 --> 01:37:54,619
Lao Er.

1142
01:37:55,119 --> 01:37:56,454
Get up.

1143
01:38:53,928 --> 01:38:57,473
This is no time for talking.
Let's kill 'em!

1144
01:38:57,598 --> 01:39:00,601
Fuck! Why look for help
from Eastgate and Third-ring?

1145
01:39:00,726 --> 01:39:03,104
I've got enough guys
to do the job.

1146
01:39:03,312 --> 01:39:05,606
- What?
- Matches.

1147
01:39:08,359 --> 01:39:10,236
Shit, let's kill 'em!

1148
01:39:13,114 --> 01:39:15,491
How'd you get mixed up
with Threads?

1149
01:39:15,616 --> 01:39:19,954
I met him in a pool hall
near school.

1150
01:39:20,121 --> 01:39:23,332
He said he knew
a way to make money.

1151
01:39:23,458 --> 01:39:25,960
The money sounded good, so -

1152
01:39:26,085 --> 01:39:28,838
I was only down south
a few months

1153
01:39:28,963 --> 01:39:32,133
before you guys here
started itching to make money.

1154
01:39:32,467 --> 01:39:34,927
Is life in Taipei really that hard?

1155
01:39:36,762 --> 01:39:39,599
Sly used to beg me

1156
01:39:40,099 --> 01:39:42,351
to take him into our gang.

1157
01:39:42,727 --> 01:39:46,147
If it weren't for you saying

1158
01:39:46,647 --> 01:39:51,110
his old man could let you use
the auditorium for your concerts,

1159
01:39:51,235 --> 01:39:54,363
I wouldn't give a shit
about that asshole.

1160
01:39:55,615 --> 01:39:58,451
Now that the 217 gang
is behind him,

1161
01:39:58,576 --> 01:40:00,828
he's showing his true colors.

1162
01:40:02,997 --> 01:40:04,999
All for a few bucks.

1163
01:40:06,834 --> 01:40:10,171
He's the boss of Little Park now,

1164
01:40:10,505 --> 01:40:12,381
understand?

1165
01:40:14,634 --> 01:40:17,345
Go tell Eastgate's
and Third-ring's boys

1166
01:40:17,512 --> 01:40:19,805
that we've decided
not to crash the concert.

1167
01:40:20,348 --> 01:40:23,017
Since both Shandong
and Threads know I'm back,

1168
01:40:23,142 --> 01:40:25,353
they'll take precautions.

1169
01:40:25,686 --> 01:40:29,190
<i>I'll</i> settle this score
some other time.

1170
01:40:31,359 --> 01:40:32,944
All right.

1171
01:40:37,406 --> 01:40:40,618
You going back
to Doggie's in Tainan?

1172
01:40:40,743 --> 01:40:43,287
You're welcome
to hide out here with us.

1173
01:40:43,871 --> 01:40:45,831
I'm going back to Tainan.

1174
01:40:45,957 --> 01:40:48,918
There's no future in hanging out
with these mainland kids.

1175
01:40:49,043 --> 01:40:52,004
I can speak Taiwanese
like you locals now.

1176
01:40:52,129 --> 01:40:54,590
I was like a mute in Tainan

1177
01:40:54,715 --> 01:40:58,886
not speaking the native language.
Thanks for all the hospitality.

1178
01:40:59,220 --> 01:41:01,556
Don't mention it.

1179
01:41:01,681 --> 01:41:04,934
A friend of Doggie's
is a friend of mine.

1180
01:41:08,312 --> 01:41:10,147
Deuce.

1181
01:41:11,023 --> 01:41:13,401
Go ahead and sing
at the concert.

1182
01:41:13,526 --> 01:41:16,237
It's no big deal.
Don't sweat it.

1183
01:41:16,529 --> 01:41:19,407
Relax and put on a good show.

1184
01:41:28,666 --> 01:41:30,251
You there.

1185
01:41:31,752 --> 01:41:33,254
Come over here.

1186
01:41:51,439 --> 01:41:54,817
Ming tells me
she likes you a lot.

1187
01:41:56,777 --> 01:42:01,282
I could tell right away
when I first met you.

1188
01:42:06,704 --> 01:42:09,707
Ming's been waiting
for you to get back.

1189
01:42:15,963 --> 01:42:19,091
When I got bored
while I was hiding out,

1190
01:42:19,967 --> 01:42:23,346
I'd read tons
of martial arts novels a day.

1191
01:42:24,221 --> 01:42:29,018
I'd tell them to get me
the thickest novels they could find.

1192
01:42:32,480 --> 01:42:34,607
I discovered people in the past

1193
01:42:34,857 --> 01:42:38,152
who were just like us street gangs.

1194
01:42:41,155 --> 01:42:43,324
There was this one guy.

1195
01:42:44,158 --> 01:42:46,952
Everyone thought he was crazy.

1196
01:42:49,580 --> 01:42:51,123
I remember...

1197
01:42:51,832 --> 01:42:54,627
everyone had run away...

1198
01:42:55,586 --> 01:42:58,005
and the city was set ablaze.

1199
01:42:58,422 --> 01:43:01,384
He alone stayed behind
to assassinate Napoleon.

1200
01:43:03,260 --> 01:43:06,514
In the end,
he failed and was caught.

1201
01:43:09,517 --> 01:43:12,186
<i>War and Peace.</i>

1202
01:43:13,020 --> 01:43:16,107
I've forgotten the names
of all the other novels.

1203
01:43:16,232 --> 01:43:18,693
That's the only one I remember.

1204
01:43:21,070 --> 01:43:23,114
Any problems?

1205
01:43:23,614 --> 01:43:26,075
No. Come and sit.

1206
01:43:34,625 --> 01:43:37,002
This is Horsecart.
Your name is...?

1207
01:43:37,211 --> 01:43:39,380
Xiao Si'r.

1208
01:43:41,090 --> 01:43:43,551
Ming will stay here a few days.

1209
01:43:43,801 --> 01:43:47,054
They know I'm in Taipei.
They'll put a tail on her.

1210
01:43:47,388 --> 01:43:49,974
She'll be very uncomfortable.

1211
01:43:54,186 --> 01:43:57,523
You know,
if you'd written back...

1212
01:43:58,232 --> 01:44:00,651
none of this
would have happened.

1213
01:44:01,026 --> 01:44:02,611
Shit!

1214
01:44:02,737 --> 01:44:05,906
If I could write,
I'd have written a novel!

1215
01:44:06,073 --> 01:44:08,909
For people like me
to read in the future.

1216
01:44:12,830 --> 01:44:14,665
It's too late now.

1217
01:44:14,790 --> 01:44:16,876
I didn't study hard enough.

1218
01:44:52,119 --> 01:44:54,455
Si'r, Sly's over there.

1219
01:44:55,289 --> 01:44:57,875
Just look at him. Shit!

1220
01:45:00,294 --> 01:45:03,589
Sly, let me introduce you
to a big shot.

1221
01:45:03,964 --> 01:45:06,717
Don't tag along everywhere!

1222
01:45:09,136 --> 01:45:11,597
Officer, this is the one
I told you about.

1223
01:45:11,722 --> 01:45:14,642
He's the manager's son.

1224
01:45:35,454 --> 01:45:37,039
What is it?

1225
01:45:37,373 --> 01:45:41,252
Who you tryin' to scare
with these cops from Juvenile?

1226
01:45:44,505 --> 01:45:46,924
I knew you were taking
precautions,

1227
01:45:47,174 --> 01:45:49,343
so I took my own.

1228
01:45:50,511 --> 01:45:54,348
You want to be responsible
if something happens?

1229
01:46:05,526 --> 01:46:07,361
Students.

1230
01:46:11,782 --> 01:46:14,451
We of course endorse

1231
01:46:14,702 --> 01:46:17,788
extracurricular activities like this.

1232
01:46:18,122 --> 01:46:21,458
But we must exercise restraint
as we have fun.

1233
01:46:21,876 --> 01:46:25,045
Trouble will only spoil it
for everyone.

1234
01:46:25,963 --> 01:46:27,756
Is that clear?

1235
01:46:27,882 --> 01:46:30,134
Yes, sir!

1236
01:47:04,418 --> 01:47:06,545
It's the national anthem!

1237
01:47:07,296 --> 01:47:09,548
Stand at attention, all of you!

1238
01:47:48,128 --> 01:47:49,838
Where's your ticket?

1239
01:47:50,673 --> 01:47:52,716
Who let you put on this concert?

1240
01:47:53,008 --> 01:47:55,302
You don't even consult me,

1241
01:47:55,427 --> 01:47:58,138
then you dare ask me
for a ticket?

1242
01:48:05,396 --> 01:48:07,773
Don't smoke when I'm talking!

1243
01:48:10,442 --> 01:48:13,612
Come on. I've been
through this number before.

1244
01:48:16,865 --> 01:48:18,909
Come on. <i>I'll</i> take you on.

1245
01:48:26,417 --> 01:48:29,628
Where's your boss?
Tell Shandong to come out.

1246
01:49:10,377 --> 01:49:12,212
<i>I'll</i> be right back.

1247
01:49:20,554 --> 01:49:23,891
Get your ass over here!

1248
01:49:35,319 --> 01:49:37,362
Distinguished guest...

1249
01:49:37,488 --> 01:49:39,740
please come in
and enjoy the music.

1250
01:49:40,240 --> 01:49:43,744
You're too kind.
I hear you want an agreement.

1251
01:49:43,911 --> 01:49:45,454
Here I am.

1252
01:49:45,579 --> 01:49:47,998
If you want an agreement,
talk to me first.

1253
01:49:48,791 --> 01:49:51,460
Hey, it's a happy day.

1254
01:49:51,710 --> 01:49:54,421
Let's talk things over
some other time.

1255
01:49:54,963 --> 01:49:57,216
There's nothing happy
between you and me.

1256
01:49:57,341 --> 01:50:00,969
If you've got the balls,
play for the money.

1257
01:50:01,095 --> 01:50:03,889
Who said you could have
this concert on my turf?

1258
01:50:04,014 --> 01:50:06,058
Fine. Come on and play.

1259
01:50:06,183 --> 01:50:09,269
Juvenile Division's inside.
Let's see you play now.

1260
01:50:19,571 --> 01:50:22,574
Think you're tough
'cause you outnumber me?

1261
01:50:22,699 --> 01:50:25,244
Come on.
All together now.

1262
01:50:25,661 --> 01:50:27,579
Or one at a time?

1263
01:50:28,247 --> 01:50:30,082
Let him go.

1264
01:50:33,836 --> 01:50:35,796
- Motherfucker!
- Hold it!

1265
01:50:46,640 --> 01:50:48,433
Let's talk out there.

1266
01:50:50,060 --> 01:50:53,564
This is how you 217 boys
always operate.

1267
01:50:53,772 --> 01:50:57,317
The Navy of the Republic! Shit!

1268
01:50:57,484 --> 01:50:59,027
I know that trick.

1269
01:50:59,153 --> 01:51:02,531
Chickenshits like him
put on uniforms to fool the cops.

1270
01:51:02,656 --> 01:51:05,701
<i>I'll</i> turn you in to the navy!

1271
01:51:05,868 --> 01:51:07,619
Autograph!

1272
01:51:07,744 --> 01:51:10,497
Sorry, folks!
This way, please.

1273
01:51:15,836 --> 01:51:18,630
You looking for someone?
No one's allowed backstage.

1274
01:51:18,755 --> 01:51:21,508
Just for a minute.
What'll it hurt?

1275
01:51:21,675 --> 01:51:24,845
Who the hell are you?
You're not on staff.

1276
01:51:25,846 --> 01:51:27,931
You really wanna know?

1277
01:51:34,146 --> 01:51:36,857
Okay, <i>I'll</i> give 'em a message.

1278
01:51:37,024 --> 01:51:39,193
It's private business.
No messages.

1279
01:51:39,735 --> 01:51:43,906
Cool it. Tell us who you want
and we'll send for him.

1280
01:51:44,406 --> 01:51:46,700
Airplane from Little Park.

1281
01:52:00,172 --> 01:52:03,717
So you get by because
you have lots of people, huh?

1282
01:52:03,842 --> 01:52:08,055
If you want to gang up on me
and kick my ass, fine.

1283
01:52:10,349 --> 01:52:13,560
This is between you and me.
Let's go over there.

1284
01:52:16,271 --> 01:52:18,232
I'm okay. Let him go!

1285
01:52:21,068 --> 01:52:25,364
That was for setting up
the concert behind my back.

1286
01:52:25,572 --> 01:52:28,325
Okay, let's start talking.

1287
01:52:29,243 --> 01:52:32,996
This is a peace talk.
You're all witnesses.

1288
01:52:37,709 --> 01:52:39,503
Come on.

1289
01:52:48,095 --> 01:52:51,014
Only two types of people
scare me, Shandong:

1290
01:52:51,139 --> 01:52:53,392
the type
that's not afraid to die,

1291
01:52:53,600 --> 01:52:56,603
and the type that has no shame.

1292
01:52:57,688 --> 01:52:59,398
Which type are you?

1293
01:53:02,442 --> 01:53:03,944
Not talking?

1294
01:53:04,111 --> 01:53:06,530
Don't wanna talk,
or afraid to talk?

1295
01:53:08,282 --> 01:53:11,535
You don't seem the type
that's not afraid to die.

1296
01:53:13,453 --> 01:53:15,289
I thought not.

1297
01:53:16,206 --> 01:53:18,417
You look so dark and dreary.

1298
01:53:19,126 --> 01:53:21,128
Don't be so unhappy.

1299
01:53:22,379 --> 01:53:24,381
What's there to be afraid of?

1300
01:54:09,968 --> 01:54:13,138
Put that away!
You lookin' for trouble?

1301
01:54:21,229 --> 01:54:22,439
Can't find him.

1302
01:54:22,564 --> 01:54:24,191
Fuck you!

1303
01:54:24,316 --> 01:54:26,610
Don't give me that shit.

1304
01:54:28,695 --> 01:54:30,530
Don't let me catch you alone.

1305
01:54:40,499 --> 01:54:42,834
What are you doing out here?

1306
01:54:43,043 --> 01:54:44,878
Get back inside.

1307
01:55:28,296 --> 01:55:31,091
Next time let me sing
an Elvis song, okay?

1308
01:55:31,216 --> 01:55:33,593
Shit! You singing Elvis!

1309
01:55:33,760 --> 01:55:35,887
Then <i>I'll</i> sing Connie Francis!

1310
01:55:36,054 --> 01:55:37,931
Take a look in the mirror!

1311
01:55:38,265 --> 01:55:40,809
You only pick
on your own people.

1312
01:55:40,934 --> 01:55:42,436
<i>I'll</i> show you I can.

1313
01:55:42,686 --> 01:55:44,729
Then start your own band.

1314
01:58:15,922 --> 01:58:17,924
Fine. I understand.

1315
01:58:18,091 --> 01:58:21,344
We doctors should show
a charitable spirit.

1316
01:58:31,354 --> 01:58:33,732
I told my father
about the medical expenses.

1317
01:58:33,857 --> 01:58:35,942
He understands
your financial situation.

1318
01:58:36,443 --> 01:58:38,445
There's no need to worry.

1319
01:58:38,570 --> 01:58:40,780
- Thank you.
- Don't mention it.

1320
01:58:41,114 --> 01:58:44,492
It appears her problem
is only partly physical.

1321
01:58:44,951 --> 01:58:47,621
Let her rest here a few days.

1322
01:58:48,496 --> 01:58:50,457
<i>I'll</i> take good care of her.

1323
01:58:59,549 --> 01:59:03,637
They all say Honey
was killed by the 217s,

1324
01:59:04,137 --> 01:59:08,183
but the newspapers say
it was a traffic accident.

1325
01:59:09,392 --> 01:59:11,770
Some people say he's AWOL
from the military.

1326
01:59:11,895 --> 01:59:13,855
Didn't he go back south?

1327
01:59:13,980 --> 01:59:17,525
Stop nagging!
It's none of your business!

1328
01:59:18,068 --> 01:59:22,197
Tell me. I made a bet
that the news was wrong.

1329
01:59:22,322 --> 01:59:24,991
How could he go AWOL?

1330
01:59:26,660 --> 01:59:30,163
Didn't you see it happen, Ma?

1331
01:59:30,330 --> 01:59:33,458
None of your fucking business!
Quit shooting off your mouth!

1332
01:59:33,583 --> 01:59:35,919
<i>I'll</i> beat the shit out of you.

1333
01:59:55,438 --> 01:59:57,524
Let's go. Time for class.

1334
01:59:57,941 --> 01:59:59,984
Already?

1335
02:00:06,991 --> 02:00:08,952
I've gotta go to the bathroom.

1336
02:00:09,077 --> 02:00:11,079
Why don't you go between classes?

1337
02:00:23,299 --> 02:00:27,178
I've been looking for you for days.
You didn't come to class.

1338
02:00:28,847 --> 02:00:30,724
Were you sick?

1339
02:00:36,271 --> 02:00:39,441
I thought he went back south.

1340
02:00:42,569 --> 02:00:44,946
Before leaving Taipei...

1341
02:00:47,699 --> 02:00:50,452
he left me the address
of his hideout.

1342
02:00:53,663 --> 02:00:56,166
I was planning to go see him.

1343
02:00:57,500 --> 02:00:59,419
He even laughed at me...

1344
02:01:00,879 --> 02:01:03,089
for being so worried.

1345
02:01:10,263 --> 02:01:12,098
It was strange.

1346
02:01:13,433 --> 02:01:17,395
For many days
while I lay sick in bed,

1347
02:01:17,520 --> 02:01:20,064
I couldn't recall Honey's face.

1348
02:01:20,648 --> 02:01:23,902
I was scared and confused.

1349
02:01:59,979 --> 02:02:02,816
Ming, don't be afraid!
You have to be brave!

1350
02:02:02,941 --> 02:02:05,318
I'm with you.
You needn't be afraid!

1351
02:02:05,485 --> 02:02:08,780
<i>I'll</i> always be with you!
<i>I'll</i> be your friend forever!

1352
02:02:09,239 --> 02:02:10,990
<i>I'll</i> protect you.

1353
02:02:15,995 --> 02:02:18,873
I don't need anyone's help.
No one can help anyway.

1354
02:02:44,858 --> 02:02:47,110
Hey, it's Ming! By herself.

1355
02:02:47,235 --> 02:02:50,446
- You got ideas?
- Shit! I wouldn't dare.

1356
02:02:53,283 --> 02:02:55,159
Hey, look.

1357
02:02:59,956 --> 02:03:02,083
Still blame me
for your leg injury?

1358
02:03:02,458 --> 02:03:05,628
- Wasn't Tiger going out with her?
- She's not talking to him.

1359
02:03:05,753 --> 02:03:07,422
Here he comes.

1360
02:03:19,601 --> 02:03:21,811
Weren't you going out with her?

1361
02:03:24,147 --> 02:03:26,107
Honey's dead.

1362
02:03:26,608 --> 02:03:28,443
Now she's anyone's game...

1363
02:03:28,943 --> 02:03:31,529
but I don't think
you stand much of a chance.

1364
02:03:31,654 --> 02:03:34,949
Honey's no problem,
dead or alive.

1365
02:03:35,325 --> 02:03:39,454
The idiot acted like
an arrogant prick at the concert.

1366
02:03:40,204 --> 02:03:44,292
He wasn't hit by no car.
The 217 boys let him have it.

1367
02:03:45,501 --> 02:03:47,587
You got something to say?

1368
02:03:48,588 --> 02:03:50,214
Goddamn it!

1369
02:04:12,862 --> 02:04:15,198
Hurry up
or <i>I'll</i> miss the last bus.

1370
02:04:15,448 --> 02:04:18,034
Take it easy.
<i>I'll</i> give you a ride.

1371
02:04:18,159 --> 02:04:21,412
Think <i>I'll</i> fall for that again?

1372
02:04:47,689 --> 02:04:50,525
<i>Try throwing it
at me again, boy.</i>

1373
02:04:55,363 --> 02:04:57,490
<i>Look at this guy.</i>

1374
02:04:58,116 --> 02:05:00,868
<i>Is he for real?</i>

1375
02:05:00,994 --> 02:05:02,870
<i>I guess so.</i>

1376
02:05:23,725 --> 02:05:26,644
Think it over.
Don't feel pressured.

1377
02:05:41,409 --> 02:05:44,078
I've got to go. it's late.

1378
02:05:51,252 --> 02:05:54,380
Getting Si'r transferred
to day school

1379
02:05:55,548 --> 02:05:57,258
is complicated.

1380
02:05:57,425 --> 02:05:59,761
I thought I could talk
my way through it

1381
02:05:59,927 --> 02:06:02,513
so he wouldn't have to take
the transfer exams.

1382
02:06:02,638 --> 02:06:05,558
I'll try my friends
on the Board of Education again.

1383
02:06:05,683 --> 02:06:07,351
Thanks a lot.

1384
02:06:08,352 --> 02:06:11,147
I'm still working
on your teaching certificate.

1385
02:06:11,272 --> 02:06:13,483
<i>It'll</i> take some time.

1386
02:06:14,150 --> 02:06:16,611
Good-bye.

1387
02:06:22,492 --> 02:06:25,620
How could he ask me
for a favor like that?

1388
02:06:28,456 --> 02:06:30,958
Try to just play along-

1389
02:06:31,084 --> 02:06:33,294
Don't be too hardheaded.

1390
02:06:33,419 --> 02:06:36,047
Don't let it get to you.

1391
02:06:36,714 --> 02:06:40,009
Try not to make enemies.

1392
02:06:41,135 --> 02:06:43,096
This isn't Shanghai,

1393
02:06:43,221 --> 02:06:46,140
where you had
Professor Hsia to back you up.

1394
02:06:46,265 --> 02:06:49,102
Being stubborn
won't make you any friends.

1395
02:06:49,811 --> 02:06:51,979
This time
it's the new office furniture.

1396
02:06:52,313 --> 02:06:54,816
Next time it'll be
the new building contract.

1397
02:06:55,316 --> 02:06:57,485
There'll be no end to it.

1398
02:06:57,610 --> 02:06:59,862
Haven't you figured him out yet?

1399
02:07:00,154 --> 02:07:02,156
You're the last person on his list.

1400
02:07:02,323 --> 02:07:04,867
God knows
how many others are involved.

1401
02:07:05,368 --> 02:07:07,036
What do you women know?

1402
02:07:07,161 --> 02:07:10,748
He must have his own problems.
<i>I'll</i> try to talk to him.

1403
02:07:10,873 --> 02:07:14,377
Are you crazy?
MING CAME TO SCHOOL TODAY, BUT...

1404
02:07:15,211 --> 02:07:18,172
Why'd you have to take him on?

1405
02:07:18,381 --> 02:07:21,425
Let's go find him.
We'll try the basketball court.

1406
02:07:23,344 --> 02:07:25,179
Shit! What's that?

1407
02:07:26,347 --> 02:07:30,893
- Follow me if you have the balls.
- It's suicide, man!

1408
02:07:31,018 --> 02:07:34,188
Suicide? <i>I'll</i> show them!

1409
02:07:34,438 --> 02:07:36,149
Take that!

1410
02:07:36,524 --> 02:07:38,109
And that!

1411
02:07:39,026 --> 02:07:41,195
It's useless.

1412
02:07:45,241 --> 02:07:47,743
This knife is for girls.

1413
02:07:47,994 --> 02:07:49,912
They'll laugh at you.

1414
02:07:53,708 --> 02:07:55,376
Where'd you get it?

1415
02:07:55,543 --> 02:07:59,338
In the attic,
with all the rest of it.

1416
02:08:02,091 --> 02:08:05,303
Cool it.
Stick to your tapes.

1417
02:08:11,225 --> 02:08:14,979
I've got an idea.
Let's get Ma's help.

1418
02:08:15,104 --> 02:08:17,315
<i>Sh, you guys are dose.</i>

1419
02:08:18,441 --> 02:08:20,568
Why ask other people
for favors?

1420
02:08:20,735 --> 02:08:23,070
We gotta get revenge,
damn it!

1421
02:08:23,196 --> 02:08:25,865
At least borrow
his samurai sword.

1422
02:08:29,410 --> 02:08:31,120
What's up?

1423
02:08:31,329 --> 02:08:33,414
That's what I want to know.

1424
02:08:36,584 --> 02:08:39,045
Cat said you wanted me.

1425
02:08:39,253 --> 02:08:40,755
No, I didn't.

1426
02:08:50,348 --> 02:08:52,558
Why the long face?

1427
02:08:52,683 --> 02:08:54,602
Is it a girl?

1428
02:08:55,311 --> 02:08:56,854
<i>No.</i>

1429
02:08:57,772 --> 02:08:59,649
I told you it wasn't that.

1430
02:09:01,150 --> 02:09:04,862
Getting worked up
over some chick looks bad.

1431
02:09:05,988 --> 02:09:07,490
Understand?

1432
02:09:07,949 --> 02:09:10,993
Look what happened to Honey.

1433
02:09:11,494 --> 02:09:14,580
Everyone on the street
was scared of him.

1434
02:09:15,206 --> 02:09:18,542
Then, all because
of some chick, he ends up -

1435
02:09:19,794 --> 02:09:21,796
Is it Tiger?

1436
02:09:22,255 --> 02:09:23,631
<i>No.</i>

1437
02:09:24,048 --> 02:09:25,925
That's good.

1438
02:09:38,229 --> 02:09:39,647
Load it.

1439
02:09:40,273 --> 02:09:43,401
Now hold on tight and aim up.

1440
02:09:46,153 --> 02:09:47,905
Go on.

1441
02:09:50,199 --> 02:09:51,951
Feels great, huh?

1442
02:09:52,493 --> 02:09:54,829
Unload and put in a new one.

1443
02:11:46,315 --> 02:11:48,275
Go over there, man.

1444
02:14:13,254 --> 02:14:16,006
Shit, I'm showing you
a good time!

1445
02:14:16,382 --> 02:14:18,133
Well?

1446
02:14:18,259 --> 02:14:20,094
Did you get a kiss out of her?

1447
02:14:20,886 --> 02:14:23,264
All this and not even a kiss?

1448
02:14:23,597 --> 02:14:25,724
She wouldn't let you?

1449
02:14:29,478 --> 02:14:31,230
Go on.

1450
02:14:31,772 --> 02:14:34,024
Take Jade around back.

1451
02:14:34,775 --> 02:14:36,443
Hurry UP-

1452
02:14:38,195 --> 02:14:39,947
She won't mind.

1453
02:14:40,781 --> 02:14:42,950
Shit! What is this?

1454
02:14:43,200 --> 02:14:45,953
I'm bending over backwards
for you, and you -

1455
02:14:46,996 --> 02:14:48,664
Forget it.

1456
02:15:14,023 --> 02:15:17,526
<i>Dumplings and buns!</i>

1457
02:15:33,208 --> 02:15:35,544
Si'r, where are you going?

1458
02:15:36,629 --> 02:15:38,839
Won't even answer!

1459
02:15:46,680 --> 02:15:50,392
Little punk!
Watch where you're going!

1460
02:15:58,651 --> 02:16:01,904
I love the night...

1461
02:16:11,038 --> 02:16:13,957
She's always nagging!

1462
02:16:14,124 --> 02:16:16,085
I can't stand her nagging!

1463
02:16:21,715 --> 02:16:24,051
Tough shit!

1464
02:16:58,043 --> 02:17:00,546
You again?
Working extra hours?

1465
02:17:00,671 --> 02:17:02,089
Making some money?

1466
02:17:02,256 --> 02:17:03,757
Every penny counts.

1467
02:17:03,924 --> 02:17:06,677
Why make so much?
Saving it for a wife?

1468
02:17:06,802 --> 02:17:10,389
Not one like yours.
You can't even drink at home.

1469
02:17:56,435 --> 02:17:59,688
What are you doing?
Don't act like a hooligan!

1470
02:18:03,609 --> 02:18:05,360
Don't come near me!

1471
02:18:12,034 --> 02:18:14,411
<i>Sergeant Chad.!</i>

1472
02:18:16,079 --> 02:18:18,332
- What is it?
- Come quick!

1473
02:18:23,086 --> 02:18:25,798
Another heart attack.
Take it easy.

1474
02:18:28,842 --> 02:18:31,178
You sure are heavy.

1475
02:18:40,145 --> 02:18:43,023
I was afraid you'd have trouble
finding this place.

1476
02:18:43,899 --> 02:18:45,567
Xiao Si'r.

1477
02:18:45,692 --> 02:18:48,153
Let's kill Mao Zedong!
Skin Zhou Enlai!

1478
02:18:48,278 --> 02:18:50,405
Let's take back the mainland!

1479
02:18:50,531 --> 02:18:52,282
<i>Horsecart!</i>

1480
02:18:56,662 --> 02:18:59,498
How many vehicles you got?
- Plenty.

1481
02:18:59,623 --> 02:19:01,375
You gotta be careful.

1482
02:19:02,709 --> 02:19:06,421
You trust the drivers?
- They're all our people.

1483
02:19:06,547 --> 02:19:08,048
Good.

1484
02:19:09,466 --> 02:19:13,011
Who's that kid?
- He's with me.

1485
02:19:15,848 --> 02:19:18,141
<i>Why'd you turn it off?</i>

1486
02:19:18,350 --> 02:19:19,893
I didn't.

1487
02:19:21,228 --> 02:19:23,564
It took forever to tune.

1488
02:19:23,689 --> 02:19:26,859
Now I have to start all over.

1489
02:19:27,192 --> 02:19:29,611
Why'd you use
my comic books?

1490
02:19:29,736 --> 02:19:31,864
I looked all over for them.

1491
02:19:32,072 --> 02:19:34,825
You know how long
it takes to tune this?

1492
02:19:34,950 --> 02:19:37,244
<i>Go get it fixed, will you?</i>

1493
02:19:37,578 --> 02:19:40,455

02:19:43,584 --> 02:19:46,044
<i>What are you doing?</i>

1495
02:19:47,087 --> 02:19:49,673
- Damn you, Blind Man!
- Goddamn it!

1496
02:19:50,716 --> 02:19:52,426
Go to hell!

1497
02:19:56,638 --> 02:19:58,849
Selfish bastard!

1498
02:19:59,433 --> 02:20:01,268
You took advantage of me!

1499
02:20:01,518 --> 02:20:03,979
Take your records with you!

1500
02:20:04,104 --> 02:20:06,940
I don't want them!

1501
02:20:08,275 --> 02:20:11,612
You'll be sorry when I'm dead!

1502
02:20:11,778 --> 02:20:15,198
You no-good,
shameless bastard!

1503
02:20:15,324 --> 02:20:18,076
Any woman
who touches you is cursed!

1504
02:20:19,494 --> 02:20:23,290
Cheat! Asshole!
You're not a man!

1505
02:20:29,129 --> 02:20:31,715
<i>You picked a great time

1506
02:20:31,840 --> 02:20:33,967
<i>the night of a typhoon!</i>

1507
02:20:36,511 --> 02:20:38,472
Even Baldy hasn't shown up.

1508
02:20:38,639 --> 02:20:42,267
Ka Wu's gone to get him.
Why so jittery?

1509
02:20:46,521 --> 02:20:48,315
Where you going?

1510
02:20:48,482 --> 02:20:49,983
To take a shit.

1511
02:20:50,150 --> 02:20:51,652
Don't out out on us.

1512
02:20:54,321 --> 02:20:57,950
The typhoon's coming.
Why haven't you closed up?

1513
02:20:58,492 --> 02:21:01,453
Useless old motherfucker.
Go home and jerk off!

1514
02:21:03,121 --> 02:21:04,831
Fuck you!

1515
02:21:46,373 --> 02:21:48,041
Relax.

1516
02:21:52,838 --> 02:21:54,506
The power's out.

1517
02:21:56,299 --> 02:21:58,593
How come no one's around?

1518
02:23:03,325 --> 02:23:05,702
You two go watch the back door.

1519
02:23:18,673 --> 02:23:20,717
What do we do about this guy?

1520
02:23:23,929 --> 02:23:25,931
Can we go back now?

1521
02:23:55,669 --> 02:23:57,671
Put that cleaver down!

1522
02:25:38,480 --> 02:25:40,315
You all right?

1523
02:25:40,440 --> 02:25:42,108
Go after them!

1524
02:25:48,448 --> 02:25:52,369
The initiation's starting
and you're home asleep!

1525
02:25:52,827 --> 02:25:55,580
- It was mahjong.
- Mahjong my ass!

1526
02:25:55,705 --> 02:25:57,958
You still owe me from last time,
remember?

1527
02:25:58,083 --> 02:26:00,543
Let's play another game
afterwards.

1528
02:26:02,963 --> 02:26:04,547
Ka Wu!

1529
02:26:07,425 --> 02:26:09,511
Ka Wu!

1530
02:26:30,198 --> 02:26:35,245
Do you know
how lonely life can be?

1531
02:26:36,830 --> 02:26:39,249
You know what it feels like

1532
02:26:39,457 --> 02:26:42,877
in the depths of despair?

1533
02:26:45,839 --> 02:26:47,674
Then go kill yourself!

1534
02:26:48,341 --> 02:26:50,927
You're a fuckin' drag.

1535
02:26:55,181 --> 02:26:57,851
No one respects me.

1536
02:26:59,185 --> 02:27:03,064
What's the use of living?
I'm better off dead.

1537
02:27:04,566 --> 02:27:07,277
Please let me borrow that.
Help me -

1538
02:27:08,820 --> 02:27:10,363
Run!

1539
02:28:36,616 --> 02:28:38,618
Crazy...

1540
02:29:06,688 --> 02:29:08,982
Did you kill Honey?

1541
02:29:19,742 --> 02:29:21,369
<i>Shandong!</i>

1542
02:29:34,507 --> 02:29:36,384

1543
02:29:37,302 --> 02:29:38,887
Shandong!

1544
02:29:42,849 --> 02:29:44,601
Please get UP!

1545
02:29:47,687 --> 02:29:49,939
Come on, get up.

1546
02:30:08,875 --> 02:30:10,585
Shandong!

1547
02:30:59,259 --> 02:31:03,179
I could swear he sings
<i>“...a</i> brighter summer day.”

1548
02:31:05,098 --> 02:31:07,267
But is that grammatically correct?

1549
02:31:27,620 --> 02:31:29,122
Mr. Zhang.

1550
02:31:29,747 --> 02:31:31,249
What is it?

1551
02:31:58,610 --> 02:32:01,321
Could we do this tomorrow
during office hours?

1552
02:32:01,696 --> 02:32:04,616
It's a rather unusual matter...

1553
02:32:06,117 --> 02:32:07,702
All right.

1554
02:32:08,244 --> 02:32:10,121
Let me get a jacket.

1555
02:32:19,213 --> 02:32:21,215
Is it something Si'r did?

1556
02:32:28,890 --> 02:32:36,939
<i>Residents in southwest Taiwan
should be prepared for floods.</i>

1557
02:32:37,523 --> 02:32:41,444
<i>People on ships

1558
02:32:41,569 --> 02:32:43,946
<i>should also be on the alert...</i>

1559
02:32:59,629 --> 02:33:02,840
You go to bed.
<i>I'll</i> wait up for Morn.

1560
02:33:12,475 --> 02:33:16,437
Mom went to Mr. Wang's house.
She's been gone two hours.

1561
02:33:17,021 --> 02:33:19,107
People came and took Dad away.

1562
02:33:19,232 --> 02:33:21,901
I think they were
with the Secret Police.

1563
02:33:30,034 --> 02:33:33,746
You're soaking wet!
- I forgot my raincoat.

1564
02:33:44,424 --> 02:33:47,260
You seem to lack inner calm.

1565
02:33:48,344 --> 02:33:50,596
Don't give me your religion.

1566
02:33:53,516 --> 02:33:55,435
<i>I've lived an honest life.</i>

1567
02:33:55,601 --> 02:33:57,770
<i>I have nothing to hide.</i>

1568
02:33:58,730 --> 02:34:01,274
<i>We have no doubt of that.</i>

1569
02:34:02,692 --> 02:34:04,569
May I go, then?

1570
02:34:04,944 --> 02:34:06,946
I have to go to work.

1571
02:34:10,825 --> 02:34:13,119
You'd better rest a bit first.

1572
02:35:03,795 --> 02:35:07,632
Is this about
Professor Hsia again?

1573
02:35:07,840 --> 02:35:10,426
We only touched
on one element last night.

1574
02:35:10,551 --> 02:35:12,178
Here.

1575
02:35:13,429 --> 02:35:14,806
Relax.

1576
02:35:14,931 --> 02:35:18,184
Write what you feel.
Don't hold back.

1577
02:35:20,061 --> 02:35:22,939
I studied music.
I'm an artistic type.

1578
02:35:23,064 --> 02:35:25,900
You're really my superior
in that regard.

1579
02:35:26,859 --> 02:35:29,987
I really do understand
how educated people feel.

1580
02:35:31,364 --> 02:35:34,283
Well, <i>I'll</i> leave you alone
for a while.

1581
02:35:36,244 --> 02:35:38,204
Oh, one other thing.

1582
02:35:38,329 --> 02:35:42,083
There's no actual sign,
but smoking's not allowed.

1583
02:35:42,208 --> 02:35:44,335
Sorry. it's the rules.

1584
02:35:44,794 --> 02:35:46,712
But before -

1585
02:36:19,787 --> 02:36:23,749
<i>The blood and tears
I shed for you know no end</i>

1586
02:36:23,875 --> 02:36:27,587
<i>As I cast aside the red bean
symbol of my longing</i>

1587
02:36:27,753 --> 02:36:31,799
<i>The spring willows
bloom eternally</i>

1588
02:36:31,924 --> 02:36:35,553
<i>And spring flowers
fill my painted chambers</i>

1589
02:36:35,761 --> 02:36:39,765
<i>My sleep's disturbed
by the wind and rain</i>

1590
02:36:39,932 --> 02:36:43,811
<i>Pattering on the screen window
after dusk</i>

1591
02:36:43,936 --> 02:36:47,940
<i>I'm unable to forget
my new woes</i>

1592
02:36:48,107 --> 02:36:51,777
<i>Or my old sorrows</i>

1593
02:36:52,445 --> 02:36:56,282
<i>I can't swallow my delicate foods</i>

1594
02:36:56,449 --> 02:37:00,286
<i>And I choke
on the golden brasenia soup</i>

1595
02:37:00,494 --> 02:37:04,457
<i>I can't believe</i>

1596
02:37:04,790 --> 02:37:08,461
<i>How frail I look
in my flowered mirror</i>

1597
02:37:08,711 --> 02:37:12,006
<i>I can't unfurrow
my knitted brow</i>

1598
02:37:12,965 --> 02:37:16,260
<i>Nor bear to feel
another tear fall</i>

1599
02:37:22,350 --> 02:37:24,602
Do you know Li Nan-tien?

1600
02:37:24,810 --> 02:37:27,313
<i>Uh... yes.</i>

1601
02:37:27,980 --> 02:37:29,315
<i>College classmate.</i>

1602
02:37:29,482 --> 02:37:31,484
So why didn't you write it down?

1603
02:37:31,651 --> 02:37:34,779
<i>He didn't come to Taiwan.
We've lost contact.</i>

1604
02:37:34,987 --> 02:37:36,948
Didn't come to Taiwan?

1605
02:37:38,324 --> 02:37:40,660
You know Liang Jin-chen?

1606
02:37:40,868 --> 02:37:43,454
<i>Liang Jin-chen?</i>

1607
02:37:44,580 --> 02:37:46,832
<i>I don't think
I've heard the name before.</i>

1608
02:37:46,958 --> 02:37:50,002
Think carefully. Are you sure?

1609
02:37:51,337 --> 02:37:53,047
<i>I don't think so.</i>

1610
02:37:53,172 --> 02:37:55,049
Think carefully.

1611
02:37:58,260 --> 02:38:01,305
In July 1939 you began work
in an accounting department.

1612
02:38:01,430 --> 02:38:04,100
Who trained you
to take over his job?

1613
02:38:04,642 --> 02:38:06,602
<i>Oh... Mr. Liang.</i>

1614
02:38:07,311 --> 02:38:10,189
<i>A sort, chubby guy
with gold-rimmed glasses.</i>

1615
02:38:10,356 --> 02:38:13,401
So you <i>do</i> remember.
Why didn't you write it down?

1616
02:38:14,235 --> 02:38:15,861
<i>I wasn't lying.</i>

1617
02:38:15,987 --> 02:38:18,823
We work so hard
to learn the truth.

1618
02:38:18,948 --> 02:38:23,077
Leaving out something you know
is the same as lying.

1619
02:38:26,539 --> 02:38:28,749
You know Chao Nien-lu?
- No.

1620
02:38:28,874 --> 02:38:31,544
Hsun Feng-shih?
Kuo Li-an?

1621
02:38:31,669 --> 02:38:33,129
<i>Yes.</i>

1622
02:38:36,132 --> 02:38:38,050
<i>Shh Chun-chuan'?</i>

1623
02:38:38,384 --> 02:38:39,885
<i>Shih Chun-chuan?</i>

1624
02:38:40,302 --> 02:38:41,637
<i>Yes.</i>

1625
02:38:42,013 --> 02:38:43,889
How do you know him?

1626
02:38:44,140 --> 02:38:46,267
<i>He was a friend of a coworker.</i>

1627
02:38:46,392 --> 02:38:48,436
<i>When we first came to Taiwan,</i>

1628
02:38:48,561 --> 02:38:51,230
<i>I bought an old bike
from him real cheap</i>

1629
02:38:51,355 --> 02:38:54,900
<i>so the kids could get to school.
I only met him once.</i>

1630
02:38:56,569 --> 02:38:58,738
<i>A reporter or something.</i>

1631
02:38:58,863 --> 02:39:01,824
<i>His name was kind of odd.
That's why I remember it.</i>

1632
02:39:01,949 --> 02:39:03,242
Is that all?

1633
02:39:03,409 --> 02:39:04,493
<i>Yes.</i>

1634
02:39:04,702 --> 02:39:07,580
Why didn't you write it down?
Who was the coworker?

1635
02:39:12,084 --> 02:39:13,836
Mr. Tseng.

1636
02:39:15,129 --> 02:39:17,882
Tseng Hung-yuan.
- How do you write that?

1637
02:39:18,007 --> 02:39:19,300
“Hung” as in “swan.”

1638
02:39:19,425 --> 02:39:23,387
You and your wife married secretly
in Shanghai in 1940.

1639
02:39:23,512 --> 02:39:25,431
We had witnesses
and a dinner-

1640
02:39:25,598 --> 02:39:27,808
Without a marriage certificate,
it's a secret marriage.

1641
02:39:27,933 --> 02:39:29,977
We registered at city hall,
and we -

1642
02:39:30,102 --> 02:39:32,730
Did Professor Hsia
introduce you to your wife?

1643
02:39:32,855 --> 02:39:35,649
No, we met at a dance.

1644
02:39:35,775 --> 02:39:39,153
In June of 1942, your wife
was teaching elementary school.

1645
02:39:39,278 --> 02:39:41,530
Why did she resign?

1646
02:39:41,781 --> 02:39:44,116
My eldest daughter was born.

1647
02:39:44,575 --> 02:39:46,619
My salary was enough
at the time.

1648
02:39:46,744 --> 02:39:49,872
I preferred to have her
care for the baby.

1649
02:39:49,997 --> 02:39:51,874
Is that the only reason?

1650
02:39:54,001 --> 02:39:57,338
This says she left for her uncle's
in Shanghai at age 11.

1651
02:39:57,880 --> 02:40:01,759
Shouldn't it say
her father's brother-in-law?

1652
02:40:03,677 --> 02:40:05,471
Well, I -

1653
02:40:05,971 --> 02:40:08,015
You seem to lack inspiration.

1654
02:40:08,140 --> 02:40:10,309
There's much
you still don't recall.

1655
02:40:10,476 --> 02:40:13,604
Don't worry. We have
all the time in the world.

1656
02:40:58,357 --> 02:41:01,527
<i>You grow so fast.
Hold your breath.</i>

1657
02:41:03,988 --> 02:41:08,409
<i>Remind me to let it out
for you tonight.</i>

1658
02:41:26,010 --> 02:41:27,845
<i>What happened
with your old man?</i>

1659
02:41:27,970 --> 02:41:29,263
<i>What do you mean?</i>

1660
02:41:29,388 --> 02:41:32,766
<i>That night after the fight, did he notice
anything when you got home?</i>

1661
02:41:32,892 --> 02:41:35,811
No, he'd gone to a movie
with my mom.

1662
02:41:37,563 --> 02:41:40,065
Wow, your sister's really cool!

1663
02:41:43,944 --> 02:41:45,446
Thanks.

1664
02:41:45,571 --> 02:41:47,072
Move.

1665
02:42:13,015 --> 02:42:15,267
I found that picture
with the knife.

1666
02:42:15,392 --> 02:42:18,312
She must have used it
in a love suicide.

1667
02:42:21,190 --> 02:42:25,069
Quit staring at it.
Take it if you want.

1668
02:42:29,031 --> 02:42:31,951
Hey, I talked to Horsecart!
- What for?

1669
02:42:32,076 --> 02:42:35,120
I told him I'm your buddy.
He'll help us.

1670
02:42:36,288 --> 02:42:37,957
Stand up straight.

1671
02:42:44,213 --> 02:42:46,966
Don't make me repeat myself.

1672
02:42:48,467 --> 02:42:50,052
You got that?

1673
02:44:33,572 --> 02:44:35,574
There's no one here.

1674
02:44:52,007 --> 02:44:54,009
I knew you'd be here.

1675
02:44:58,764 --> 02:45:00,891
What you told me last time...

1676
02:45:01,016 --> 02:45:03,310
did you really mean it?

1677
02:45:16,490 --> 02:45:18,742
I hope you weren't lying.

1678
02:45:19,535 --> 02:45:21,787
I couldn't bear that.

1679
02:45:46,228 --> 02:45:48,021
It's Saturday again.

1680
02:45:48,647 --> 02:45:50,524
Want to cut class?

1681
02:45:52,609 --> 02:45:56,822
No, we have all the time
in the world.

1682
02:46:04,455 --> 02:46:06,707
<i>Spring disappears</i>

1683
02:46:06,832 --> 02:46:08,625
<i>Without a trace</i>

1684
02:46:08,750 --> 02:46:13,839
<i>Leaving nothing behind...</i>

1685
02:46:24,349 --> 02:46:27,478
Here for your shot?
Go over there.

1686
02:46:59,384 --> 02:47:01,345
Apologize to them.

1687
02:47:02,012 --> 02:47:03,514
Go on!

1688
02:47:03,722 --> 02:47:06,558
Want me to make you?

1689
02:47:07,351 --> 02:47:09,019
Motherfucker!

1690
02:47:11,230 --> 02:47:13,065
Is that good enough?

1691
02:47:13,190 --> 02:47:15,734
Forget it. Let's go.

1692
02:47:15,901 --> 02:47:17,861
Not a chance!

1693
02:47:21,031 --> 02:47:23,367
Just watch your step
from now on.

1694
02:47:33,669 --> 02:47:36,046
What are you so pleased about?

1695
02:48:09,788 --> 02:48:12,207
Fix me up with Airplane!

1696
02:48:22,175 --> 02:48:23,802
Cat is cuter.

1697
02:48:23,927 --> 02:48:25,804
I want to meet Airplane!

1698
02:48:25,971 --> 02:48:27,472
I want one too!

1699
02:48:44,031 --> 02:48:46,950
<i>You need to be
more aggressive on defense.</i>

1700
02:48:47,075 --> 02:48:50,495
<i>Don't let him get by.
Next two.</i>

1701
02:48:50,829 --> 02:48:54,333
Keep your arms out on defense.
Go on.

1702
02:49:50,138 --> 02:49:52,891
What's your connection
to Wang Kuo-cheng?

1703
02:49:54,726 --> 02:49:56,561
Wang?

1704
02:49:58,063 --> 02:49:59,648
<i>He's...</i>

1705
02:50:02,234 --> 02:50:04,152
a classmate.

1706
02:50:04,277 --> 02:50:05,946
“Wang”?

1707
02:50:07,155 --> 02:50:09,533
You seem to know him well.

1708
02:50:12,202 --> 02:50:14,413
Well... not really.

1709
02:50:15,747 --> 02:50:19,292
I see him now and then
at class reunions.

1710
02:50:25,590 --> 02:50:27,092
Here.

1711
02:50:32,639 --> 02:50:34,641
Write more?

1712
02:50:47,320 --> 02:50:50,574
<i>I'll</i> be back for it before dawn.

1713
02:51:13,305 --> 02:51:15,640
I'm almost done.

1714
02:51:16,850 --> 02:51:19,060
Give me a little more time.

1715
02:51:20,896 --> 02:51:23,231
<i>That's enough.
You can go now.</i>

1716
02:51:23,648 --> 02:51:25,317
<i>Hurry UP-</i>

1717
02:52:27,087 --> 02:52:29,965
- Hurry up.
- My button fell off again.

1718
02:52:30,423 --> 02:52:33,218
- Didn't your sister just fix it for you?
- Yes.

1719
02:53:20,265 --> 02:53:22,100
Mrs. Zhang.

1720
02:53:30,483 --> 02:53:32,485
Do you have safety pins?

1721
02:53:36,114 --> 02:53:38,617
You better go or you'll be late.

1722
02:53:57,928 --> 02:53:59,930
Is my shirt ironed?

1723
02:54:07,896 --> 02:54:09,981
I have to go to work.

1724
02:54:32,671 --> 02:54:34,673
It's better this way.

1725
02:54:35,966 --> 02:54:39,177
They found someone at the office
to take over my work.

1726
02:54:39,719 --> 02:54:42,097
Less work means less trouble.

1727
02:54:44,182 --> 02:54:46,851
You think it's related
to your interrogation?

1728
02:54:51,356 --> 02:54:54,943
Don't say things with no proof.

1729
02:54:58,822 --> 02:55:00,782
How stupid can you be?

1730
02:55:00,991 --> 02:55:04,953
Weren't they waiting for a confession
about Wang before they'd release you?

1731
02:55:06,329 --> 02:55:09,207
I thought
he was trying to help us.

1732
02:55:10,792 --> 02:55:12,377
The way I see it...

1733
02:55:12,544 --> 02:55:15,213
he was trying
to dissociate himself from you.

1734
02:55:15,338 --> 02:55:18,049
You're too honest
to cover up his corruption.

1735
02:55:22,595 --> 02:55:24,889
What kind of crazy idea is that?

1736
02:55:26,182 --> 02:55:29,352
Didn't you go to him
while I was being held?

1737
02:55:30,228 --> 02:55:32,564
Didn't he do his best to help?

1738
02:55:33,356 --> 02:55:37,318
Maybe he was pretending.
Maybe he was behind the whole thing.

1739
02:55:37,861 --> 02:55:40,196
And that promotion he got you -

1740
02:55:40,321 --> 02:55:42,115
You women!

1741
02:55:42,866 --> 02:55:45,660
You know nothing
about friendship between men!

1742
02:55:46,036 --> 02:55:49,247
What are you good for
besides being suspicious?

1743
02:57:20,922 --> 02:57:23,341
It's been tough enough
for us already.

1744
02:57:27,679 --> 02:57:31,224
You and the kids
are all I have left.

1745
02:57:39,065 --> 02:57:41,317
Please don't frighten me anymore.

1746
02:57:56,749 --> 02:57:59,377
We only have each other now.

1747
02:58:02,422 --> 02:58:06,176
If you're not afraid,
then I won't be.

1748
02:59:14,452 --> 02:59:16,955
What's the matter, Tiger?

1749
02:59:23,544 --> 02:59:25,463
Come on, speak up.

1750
02:59:42,814 --> 02:59:45,233
<i>You should at least talk to him.</i>

1751
02:59:48,236 --> 02:59:51,155
You worried
he'll try to get back at you?

1752
02:59:51,322 --> 02:59:52,782
He won't.

1753
02:59:54,242 --> 02:59:56,160
It's over.

1754
02:59:56,494 --> 02:59:58,329
Let's drop him, okay?

1755
03:00:03,376 --> 03:00:05,837
How come you never
told me about him?

1756
03:00:07,338 --> 03:00:09,382
What's there to tell?

1757
03:00:10,174 --> 03:00:12,176
Lots of guys have ideas about me.

1758
03:00:12,343 --> 03:00:15,013
Haven't you heard enough?

1759
03:00:18,182 --> 03:00:21,311
Take the young doctor,
for example.

1760
03:00:22,520 --> 03:00:24,522
Couldn't you tell?

1761
03:00:27,233 --> 03:00:31,112
How do you feel
when I tell you these things?

1762
03:00:33,281 --> 03:00:36,159
Can't you just ignore them?

1763
03:00:37,744 --> 03:00:41,497
You can't ask others to do
what you think is right.

1764
03:01:02,477 --> 03:01:04,812
People will look down on you.

1765
03:01:07,273 --> 03:01:10,318
You mean
you'll look down on me.

1766
03:01:35,176 --> 03:01:37,345
Who's there?

1767
03:01:39,055 --> 03:01:41,349
Lao Er, Si'r, get up!

1768
03:01:41,474 --> 03:01:43,184
There's a thief!

1769
03:01:45,937 --> 03:01:48,064
Lao Er, get up, hurry!

1770
03:01:48,439 --> 03:01:50,149
Lao Er!

1771
03:01:50,441 --> 03:01:53,277
See if the front door's
been opened. Hurry!

1772
03:01:56,447 --> 03:01:58,116
The front door's fine.

1773
03:01:58,241 --> 03:01:59,450
You sure?

1774
03:01:59,617 --> 03:02:00,910
Yes.

1775
03:02:01,077 --> 03:02:02,620
Take this!

1776
03:02:04,789 --> 03:02:06,457
He's hiding.

1777
03:02:07,083 --> 03:02:08,376
He's hiding outside.

1778
03:02:08,501 --> 03:02:11,796
Impossible!
Check the roof!

1779
03:02:11,963 --> 03:02:14,173
- Get the flashlight.
- Where is it?

1780
03:02:14,298 --> 03:02:15,425
Hurry!

1781
03:02:15,550 --> 03:02:18,261
- Where is it?
- In the kitchen drawer. Hurry!

1782
03:02:18,386 --> 03:02:20,304
I can't find it.

1783
03:02:20,430 --> 03:02:23,015
Why don't you turn on some lights?

1784
03:02:23,474 --> 03:02:26,936
What's with all the noise?
I'm trying to sleep!

1785
03:02:33,609 --> 03:02:36,362
He's hiding under the bed.

1786
03:02:38,698 --> 03:02:42,493
He was standing right here
and then suddenly vanished!

1787
03:02:45,830 --> 03:02:48,332
It can't be!
I saw him right here!

1788
03:02:48,458 --> 03:02:50,501
How could he just vanish?

1789
03:02:50,835 --> 03:02:52,962
He couldn't have gotten away!

1790
03:03:15,193 --> 03:03:18,779
Let her rest for now.
Everything's under control.

1791
03:03:22,742 --> 03:03:25,203
Luckily you rushed her over
in time.

1792
03:03:26,245 --> 03:03:28,998
Didn't I warn her
about charcoal smoke?

1793
03:03:37,632 --> 03:03:41,093
Since ancient times
the Chinese have loved camellias

1794
03:03:41,219 --> 03:03:44,472
for their elegance
and refined beauty.

1795
03:03:48,267 --> 03:03:50,561
The kids used
to play around here

1796
03:03:50,728 --> 03:03:53,231
and pick the flowers
when they were little.

1797
03:03:55,233 --> 03:03:58,861
This reminds me
of your grandfather.

1798
03:03:59,111 --> 03:04:03,533
The blossoms bring back
happy memories of him.

1799
03:04:30,142 --> 03:04:32,270
Who's that lady?

1800
03:04:34,397 --> 03:04:36,274
You mean Hsiang-li?

1801
03:04:36,857 --> 03:04:39,235
We're getting married
in September.

1802
03:04:46,242 --> 03:04:48,077
I don't like her.

1803
03:04:48,286 --> 03:04:50,079
She's strange.

1804
03:04:51,455 --> 03:04:55,126
There's no love between you.
She's not for you.

1805
03:05:00,673 --> 03:05:03,301
You kids don't understand
such things.

1806
03:05:05,761 --> 03:05:09,181
You don't have to say anything
if you don't want to.

1807
03:05:12,935 --> 03:05:15,396
Why do you think
I don't understand?

1808
03:05:20,318 --> 03:05:23,070
Love isn't fun and games.

1809
03:05:26,282 --> 03:05:28,576
Lots of guys say they love me,

1810
03:05:28,951 --> 03:05:30,453
but...

1811
03:05:32,455 --> 03:05:35,833
the minute there's trouble,
they all run away.

1812
03:05:42,798 --> 03:05:44,675
If you're troubled about something,

1813
03:05:44,842 --> 03:05:47,345
you must tell me
before I can help you.

1814
03:05:57,355 --> 03:05:59,357
I won't tell you.

1815
03:05:59,732 --> 03:06:03,361
You wouldn't tell me, right?

1816
03:06:09,867 --> 03:06:13,454
Don't worry about
your mother's medical expenses.

1817
03:06:13,704 --> 03:06:17,083
We're too close
to worry about such things.

1818
03:06:29,553 --> 03:06:31,806
Still don't want to tell me?

1819
03:06:40,898 --> 03:06:42,400
<i>Zhang Zhen.</i>

1820
03:06:42,566 --> 03:06:44,568
<i>Come here a minute.</i>

1821
03:06:54,078 --> 03:06:56,539
<i>This is for your own good.</i>

1822
03:06:58,332 --> 03:07:00,376
<i>I don't mean to pry,</i>

1823
03:07:00,501 --> 03:07:04,088
<i>but for a love affair at your age,
you need good advice.</i>

1824
03:07:06,716 --> 03:07:09,051
Behaving like a hooligan, huh?

1825
03:07:09,176 --> 03:07:12,847
Stand up straight
when the doctor's talking!

1826
03:07:14,265 --> 03:07:16,267
Motherfucking bitch.

1827
03:07:16,392 --> 03:07:19,228
What are you?
The secret police?

1828
03:07:24,233 --> 03:07:25,901
What did you just say?

1829
03:07:26,026 --> 03:07:28,696
Say that again.
What did you say?

1830
03:07:28,821 --> 03:07:30,489
I said you're the secret police.

1831
03:07:30,614 --> 03:07:33,743
Before that.
About my mother.

1832
03:07:33,868 --> 03:07:36,287
Try saying it again!
- Fucking bitch!

1833
03:07:36,454 --> 03:07:39,123
<i>What's going on?</i>

1834
03:07:39,874 --> 03:07:41,292
What's this here?

1835
03:07:41,417 --> 03:07:44,628
Your students act
like a bunch of hooligans.

1836
03:07:44,754 --> 03:07:47,131
Foul-mouthed and violent!

1837
03:07:47,256 --> 03:07:50,301
Dating girls and messing around
with relationships!

1838
03:07:50,468 --> 03:07:52,303
- Mind your own fucking business!
- Zhang Zhen!

1839
03:07:52,428 --> 03:07:54,346
To the conduct office!

1840
03:07:54,472 --> 03:07:56,474
Big deal! Who cares?

1841
03:08:01,645 --> 03:08:04,273
You had some harsh words
about us last time.

1842
03:08:04,398 --> 03:08:06,150
What about
your parental guidance?

1843
03:08:06,275 --> 03:08:09,069
<i>Such foul language!
Even I was embarrassed.</i>

1844
03:08:11,030 --> 03:08:14,450
You parents don't do your job
and then blame it on us.

1845
03:08:14,575 --> 03:08:16,494
You have some nerve!

1846
03:08:20,289 --> 03:08:22,583
Please give him another chance.

1847
03:08:22,708 --> 03:08:24,335
Too late!

1848
03:08:25,294 --> 03:08:29,298
He's fallen this far already.
If we don't punish him properly,

1849
03:08:29,924 --> 03:08:32,885
you'll blame us again
for not doing our job.

1850
03:08:33,302 --> 03:08:36,347
I don't want to be
responsible for that.

1851
03:08:37,139 --> 03:08:38,808
It was my negligence.

1852
03:08:39,433 --> 03:08:41,519
Kids sometimes lose their heads.

1853
03:08:42,144 --> 03:08:44,522
Please excuse him just this once.

1854
03:08:46,565 --> 03:08:48,692
If he gets
another demerit for this,

1855
03:08:48,818 --> 03:08:51,570
he can't move on
to the next grade.

1856
03:08:53,197 --> 03:08:55,032
That would be...

1857
03:08:55,991 --> 03:08:58,077
too unfair to him.

1858
03:08:58,828 --> 03:09:02,248
Unfair? Didn't you think
we were unfair last time?

1859
03:09:02,373 --> 03:09:06,043
Didn't you say
you didn't care about demerits?

1860
03:09:07,086 --> 03:09:09,088
How come you care now?

1861
03:09:11,257 --> 03:09:14,093
We all work
for the same government.

1862
03:09:14,218 --> 03:09:16,303
What makes you
so high and mighty?

1863
03:09:45,583 --> 03:09:47,960
<i>Mr. Zhang, buy some buns!</i>

1864
03:09:50,421 --> 03:09:52,506
What's wrong?
In a bad mood?

1865
03:09:52,631 --> 03:09:54,258
Don't worry!

1866
03:09:55,467 --> 03:09:58,095
The sun will rise again tomorrow.

1867
03:09:58,220 --> 03:10:01,515
A lively soul is never
stifled by a fart, right?

1868
03:10:03,225 --> 03:10:05,144
Dumplings and buns!

1869
03:10:06,061 --> 03:10:09,815
Don't worry, Dad.
Getting expelled isn't that bad.

1870
03:10:10,524 --> 03:10:13,319
This way I can take
the transfer exam this summer.

1871
03:10:13,444 --> 03:10:15,779
<i>I'll</i> get into day school for you.

1872
03:10:19,074 --> 03:10:21,619
Don't worry about me, Dad.

1873
03:10:22,995 --> 03:10:25,289
I remember everything you said.

1874
03:10:25,831 --> 03:10:28,125
<i>I'll</i> always listen to you.

1875
03:10:31,128 --> 03:10:34,548
I remember you said
one's own future

1876
03:10:34,673 --> 03:10:37,301
can be determined
by one's own efforts.

1877
03:10:42,056 --> 03:10:46,060
I hit him with the bat
because he went too far,

1878
03:10:46,644 --> 03:10:48,687
just like last time when you -

1879
03:10:59,239 --> 03:11:01,241
If I quit smoking,

1880
03:11:01,659 --> 03:11:04,161
the money I save every month...

1881
03:11:05,746 --> 03:11:07,957
will be enough
to buy you glasses

1882
03:11:08,374 --> 03:11:10,250
on the installment plan.

1883
03:11:18,008 --> 03:11:20,844
So when will we see
each other again?

1884
03:11:23,514 --> 03:11:25,933
Not until I've taken
the transfer exams.

1885
03:11:26,809 --> 03:11:29,645
You can always come
to school to see me.

1886
03:11:30,688 --> 03:11:35,234
Next time I enter the school gate,
I'll be a day school student.

1887
03:11:36,735 --> 03:11:40,531
Sounds like Honey when he said
he was going back to Tainan.

1888
03:11:41,365 --> 03:11:43,242
You're not happy.

1889
03:11:47,037 --> 03:11:48,956
<i>I'll</i> be worried about you.

1890
03:11:49,832 --> 03:11:51,875
Don't be silly. Study hard.

1891
03:11:52,376 --> 03:11:54,378
I'm behind you all the way.

1892
03:11:55,004 --> 03:11:57,589
But let's not go today, okay?

1893
03:11:58,215 --> 03:12:00,134
Everything's all arranged.

1894
03:12:00,718 --> 03:12:03,554
Plus Cat and Airplane
are both invited.

1895
03:12:12,354 --> 03:12:15,691
Oh, dear!
Our servant has quit.

1896
03:12:15,983 --> 03:12:18,902
Sorry I didn't come out
earlier to say hello.

1897
03:12:19,445 --> 03:12:22,573
Don't worry.
We'll help ourselves.

1898
03:12:22,948 --> 03:12:24,742
Is this your classmate?

1899
03:12:24,867 --> 03:12:26,452
She's so pretty.

1900
03:12:26,994 --> 03:12:30,247
When I was carrying him,
I wanted a girl.

1901
03:12:30,414 --> 03:12:32,249
Look how big he is now.

1902
03:12:32,374 --> 03:12:34,126
There you go again!

1903
03:12:34,293 --> 03:12:37,004
Take your feet off the table.

1904
03:12:37,504 --> 03:12:39,882
Where are the others?

1905
03:12:40,340 --> 03:12:42,801
<i>- Range?
- 700 yards.</i>

1906
03:12:43,510 --> 03:12:45,637
<i>- How many?
- A platoon.</i>

1907
03:12:46,180 --> 03:12:48,057
<i>Too far. It won't reach.</i>

1908
03:12:48,182 --> 03:12:49,850
<i>Use mine.</i>

1909
03:12:52,186 --> 03:12:53,896
<i>Shit! They've got tanks!</i>

1910
03:12:54,021 --> 03:12:56,273
<i>It's okay.
We've got grenades.</i>

1911
03:12:58,233 --> 03:12:59,985
Who goes there? Password!

1912
03:13:00,110 --> 03:13:02,946
Commie woman.
Hands up.

1913
03:13:03,113 --> 03:13:05,783
- What are you doing?
- Girls aren't into this stuff.

1914
03:13:05,949 --> 03:13:08,243
Stay back!

1915
03:13:16,502 --> 03:13:19,463
Cheer up, will you?

1916
03:13:19,880 --> 03:13:22,257
Doesn't my thoughtfulness
mean anything?

1917
03:13:23,300 --> 03:13:25,636
Getting expelled from school
is no big deal.

1918
03:13:25,803 --> 03:13:28,472
You don't even look
after your own girlfriend.

1919
03:15:29,259 --> 03:15:31,929
Your father's government career

1920
03:15:32,054 --> 03:15:34,223
is doomed because of it

1921
03:15:34,514 --> 03:15:37,267
and because of his relations
with Professor Hsia.

1922
03:15:40,812 --> 03:15:43,774
I'm proud of all you kids
for pulling through.

1923
03:15:43,941 --> 03:15:46,985
Especially Si'r.

1924
03:15:47,486 --> 03:15:51,740
He's so determined to get back
on track after all that's happened.

1925
03:15:54,284 --> 03:15:58,747
Mom, after graduation,
<i>I'll</i> work a while before going abroad.

1926
03:15:58,997 --> 03:16:03,085
No, you go as soon as you get
your scholarship.

1927
03:16:03,210 --> 03:16:07,089
But Lao Er's going to college,
plus there's Si'r and the youngest one.

1928
03:16:07,214 --> 03:16:09,258
It's too much for you.

1929
03:16:09,383 --> 03:16:11,218
We've managed up to now.

1930
03:16:11,343 --> 03:16:14,304
Don't worry until
you've made it in America.

1931
03:16:14,471 --> 03:16:16,390
Four pounds of rice.

1932
03:16:16,515 --> 03:16:19,351
Can you put this on credit,
Uncle Fat?

1933
03:16:19,476 --> 03:16:21,061
No problem.

1934
03:16:21,561 --> 03:16:23,063
May I butt in?

1935
03:16:23,188 --> 03:16:25,190
Many people say I'm too nosy,

1936
03:16:25,565 --> 03:16:27,693
but I'm actually
a lot like your husband.

1937
03:16:27,818 --> 03:16:29,611
You have preserved eggs?

1938
03:16:29,987 --> 03:16:31,488
Over there.

1939
03:16:34,825 --> 03:16:37,286
<i>Your SH saved my “fie.</i>

1940
03:16:38,704 --> 03:16:42,499
I think it's my turn to help you.

1941
03:16:46,795 --> 03:16:49,548
Uncle Fat said Mr. Lin
is native Taiwanese.

1942
03:16:49,673 --> 03:16:51,425
A very honest man.

1943
03:16:51,800 --> 03:16:54,344
He's starting
a fruit export business.

1944
03:16:54,469 --> 03:16:57,639
He needs a partner
with formal education.

1945
03:17:03,186 --> 03:17:05,605
The starting salary
may not be much,

1946
03:17:06,273 --> 03:17:10,027
but if you work hard,
you'll be your own man.

1947
03:17:17,200 --> 03:17:19,995
What if he goes bankrupt
a month from now?

1948
03:17:21,079 --> 03:17:23,874
Talk to him first.
Feel each other out.

1949
03:17:24,249 --> 03:17:27,544
You can't doubt a guy
without knowing him.

1950
03:17:32,883 --> 03:17:35,719
I've worked
for the government all my life.

1951
03:17:36,303 --> 03:17:39,222
I'm used
to the stability and security.

1952
03:17:39,348 --> 03:17:42,392
You really think
this is stable and secure?

1953
03:17:48,231 --> 03:17:51,777
I was gonna mail it today
if you didn't show up.

1954
03:17:52,235 --> 03:17:55,864
<i>Did you bring your friend
some slippers, Cat?</i>

1955
03:18:14,299 --> 03:18:16,510
What did I go out there for?

1956
03:18:16,635 --> 03:18:18,428
Why'd you turn it off?

1957
03:18:18,553 --> 03:18:20,806
It sounds awful!
Who are you mailing it to?

1958
03:18:20,931 --> 03:18:23,058
You'll find out later.

1959
03:18:25,519 --> 03:18:27,687
How's school?
Everything okay?

1960
03:18:27,813 --> 03:18:30,899
Same as always.
Nothing ever changes.

1961
03:18:33,151 --> 03:18:35,028
You seen Ming lately?

1962
03:18:35,153 --> 03:18:37,614
She's fine!

1963
03:18:37,739 --> 03:18:39,449
Just concentrate
on your books.

1964
03:18:39,616 --> 03:18:41,868
Me and Airplane
will look after her.

1965
03:19:02,305 --> 03:19:04,975
Chiung, come give me a hand.

1966
03:19:05,225 --> 03:19:07,769
Uncle Fat's family
will be here at 7:00.

1967
03:19:12,023 --> 03:19:14,025
Clear the table, would you?

1968
03:19:17,320 --> 03:19:18,655
<i>Where's Sh'?</i>

1969
03:19:19,364 --> 03:19:21,408
I sent him to the movies.

1970
03:19:37,883 --> 03:19:42,012
“The score with Sly
will be settled by this day.”

1971
03:19:47,642 --> 03:19:49,102
Sly?

1972
03:19:49,769 --> 03:19:52,272
He hasn't come around in ages.

1973
03:19:52,981 --> 03:19:57,527
He disappeared
after he escaped the massacre.

1974
03:19:58,820 --> 03:20:01,490
They fired his old man
because of him.

1975
03:20:03,366 --> 03:20:06,703
They hold political meetings
in the auditorium,

1976
03:20:06,870 --> 03:20:09,206
but outsiders
can't rent it anymore.

1977
03:20:10,207 --> 03:20:12,459
I got the worst of it.

1978
03:20:12,584 --> 03:20:14,961
My business has gone to hell.

1979
03:20:15,170 --> 03:20:18,256
The damn cops
come round all the time.

1980
03:20:22,385 --> 03:20:24,221
<i>Closing up already?</i>

1981
03:20:24,387 --> 03:20:26,598
Shit! Look who's here!

1982
03:20:32,395 --> 03:20:33,897
<i>S? r.</i>

1983
03:20:46,701 --> 03:20:50,413
Jade said she's been
seeing you at the library.

1984
03:20:51,289 --> 03:20:54,084
You got kicked
out of school too?

1985
03:20:57,754 --> 03:20:59,589
You seem really different.

1986
03:20:59,756 --> 03:21:01,299
Move your feet.

1987
03:21:08,765 --> 03:21:10,934
I was really too much back then...

1988
03:21:12,102 --> 03:21:14,271
wound up so tight all the time.

1989
03:21:14,980 --> 03:21:17,107
It makes me laugh!

1990
03:21:21,069 --> 03:21:24,155
Don't let the past
get you down, okay?

1991
03:21:26,199 --> 03:21:28,285
I feel really bad about it.

1992
03:21:33,623 --> 03:21:36,418
Come on, man.
It was all my fault.

1993
03:21:36,751 --> 03:21:38,378
Let it go.

1994
03:21:40,630 --> 03:21:42,841
What school
are you trying to get into?

1995
03:21:43,341 --> 03:21:45,885
I'm trying to test
into day school.

1996
03:21:47,929 --> 03:21:49,764
You got some balls!

1997
03:21:51,975 --> 03:21:55,645
Even military academies
won't take punks like me.

1998
03:21:56,938 --> 03:21:59,190
You and I were such enemies.

1999
03:21:59,441 --> 03:22:01,359
Now we're in the same boat.

2000
03:22:01,568 --> 03:22:04,487
We even have the same
bad luck with girlfriends.

2001
03:22:06,323 --> 03:22:08,241
What do you mean?

2002
03:22:08,908 --> 03:22:10,493
That Ma!

2003
03:22:11,661 --> 03:22:13,663
He's really slick.

2004
03:22:15,540 --> 03:22:19,210
I figure you'll be like me
and not hold it against him.

2005
03:22:20,170 --> 03:22:22,172
He stole Jade from me.

2006
03:22:22,631 --> 03:22:24,799
Now he's messing around
with Ming.

2007
03:22:28,511 --> 03:22:30,805
When are you signing up
for the exams?

2008
03:22:30,930 --> 03:22:33,266
My math and English
are the pits -

2009
03:22:33,933 --> 03:22:35,477
<i>S? r.</i>

2010
03:22:38,146 --> 03:22:40,106
Let's keep in touch.

2011
03:22:41,858 --> 03:22:45,236
What was that for?
You want trouble, asshole?

2012
03:22:45,362 --> 03:22:47,781
Mess with me
and I'll call the cops!

2013
03:22:47,906 --> 03:22:51,284
Motherfucker!
- Come on, forget it.

2014
03:22:53,620 --> 03:22:56,665
<i>- Who are you here to see?
- Is Ma home?</i>

2015
03:22:56,790 --> 03:22:58,291
<i>Wait here.</i>

2016
03:23:02,545 --> 03:23:04,047
What's your name?

2017
03:23:04,214 --> 03:23:05,882
<i>Si'r.</i>

2018
03:23:32,283 --> 03:23:35,745
Shit, it's been a long time!
What have you been up to?

2019
03:23:36,037 --> 03:23:38,081
That's what I want to ask you.

2020
03:23:38,748 --> 03:23:40,959
I'm the same old me.
What else?

2021
03:23:41,918 --> 03:23:45,505
Hey, did you know
Ming's living here now?

2022
03:23:46,089 --> 03:23:48,174
Remember
when you guys came over

2023
03:23:48,299 --> 03:23:50,176
and our maid had quit?

2024
03:23:50,760 --> 03:23:54,639
Ming came to my morn to see
if her mother could fill the job.

2025
03:23:54,806 --> 03:23:58,226
My morn really likes her
and gave her mother the job.

2026
03:23:58,685 --> 03:24:00,437
Ming's not bad.

2027
03:24:01,563 --> 03:24:03,982
She's inside.
Want to come in?

2028
03:24:05,275 --> 03:24:07,527
What's this I hear
about you and her?

2029
03:24:08,361 --> 03:24:10,071
What do you mean?

2030
03:24:10,196 --> 03:24:12,490
Girls. it's the same old shit.

2031
03:24:12,615 --> 03:24:15,702
Dress 'em nice, feed 'em well,
fool around a bit.

2032
03:24:15,827 --> 03:24:17,620
What else is there?

2033
03:24:22,459 --> 03:24:24,919
You don't look too happy.

2034
03:24:26,296 --> 03:24:29,841
Don't let some stupid girl
come between us, buddy.

2035
03:24:31,301 --> 03:24:32,802
It's okay.

2036
03:24:34,596 --> 03:24:38,308
When you two were fooling around,
did she mention Honey a lot...

2037
03:24:38,725 --> 03:24:41,561
and say you weren't giving her
a sense of security?

2038
03:24:43,855 --> 03:24:47,984
What's wrong? Don't get
all worked up over some girl!

2039
03:24:48,234 --> 03:24:50,904
Come on in.
Let's shoot a few rounds.

2040
03:24:51,112 --> 03:24:53,406
That's okay.
I'm gonna catch a movie.

2041
03:25:13,343 --> 03:25:15,970
- Got any money on you?
- <i>A</i> little.

2042
03:25:16,679 --> 03:25:18,056
How much?

2043
03:25:18,181 --> 03:25:20,183
<i>How much you need?</i>

2044
03:25:21,684 --> 03:25:23,394
Never mind.

2045
03:26:00,682 --> 03:26:04,435
Look at it
as meeting friends for dinner.

2046
03:26:04,561 --> 03:26:06,396
Just be relaxed.

2047
03:26:08,439 --> 03:26:11,109
Chuan, I need my watch.

2048
03:26:11,234 --> 03:26:13,111
<i>I put it back.</i>

2049
03:26:13,403 --> 03:26:15,196
Well, it's not here.

2050
03:26:16,072 --> 03:26:17,991
<i>Uncle Fat's here.</i>

2051
03:26:31,462 --> 03:26:34,257
- I want to go.
- <i>I'll</i> bring you bubble gum.

2052
03:26:34,424 --> 03:26:36,175
Lousy bubble gum!

2053
03:26:46,311 --> 03:26:48,897
How many for dinner?

2054
03:26:49,272 --> 03:26:52,025
Si'r is studying at the library.

2055
03:26:53,776 --> 03:26:55,278
How about Lao Er?

2056
03:26:55,445 --> 03:26:57,280
I don't know.

2057
03:26:59,866 --> 03:27:02,535
He's had a good appetite lately.

2058
03:27:07,624 --> 03:27:09,334
What's wrong?

2059
03:27:14,589 --> 03:27:16,799
<i>You're always outside
whenever Mom's gone.</i>

2060
03:27:16,966 --> 03:27:18,551
<i>Come eat your dinner!</i>

2061
03:27:18,676 --> 03:27:20,637
I'm not hungry yet.

2062
03:27:23,014 --> 03:27:25,475
- You're asking for it!
- I'm coming.

2063
03:27:25,600 --> 03:27:29,145
- Is stealing Mom's watch a habit now?
- I didn't take it.

2064
03:27:29,270 --> 03:27:32,523
She noticed it was gone!
What will you do now?

2065
03:27:34,651 --> 03:27:36,110
What's this about?

2066
03:27:36,361 --> 03:27:38,988
It's for grown-ups.
Stay out of it.

2067
03:27:39,155 --> 03:27:40,990
You're so mean!

2068
03:27:41,783 --> 03:27:43,451
Where are you going?

2069
03:27:43,618 --> 03:27:47,163
- Are your folks home?
- They went out to dinner.

2070
03:27:47,288 --> 03:27:49,707
- What's with Lao Er?
- Oh, nothing.

2071
03:27:49,999 --> 03:27:52,418
It's been ages.
Are they doing all right?

2072
03:27:52,543 --> 03:27:54,796
<i>I'll</i> come in a while and wait.

2073
03:27:59,717 --> 03:28:02,804
Where are all the ashtrays?

2074
03:28:08,017 --> 03:28:09,852
Dad quit smoking.

2075
03:28:16,776 --> 03:28:19,112
You still using this thing?

2076
03:28:24,575 --> 03:28:26,536
It's useless!

2077
03:28:28,329 --> 03:28:32,625
You know, I took your dad
to buy this radio.

2078
03:28:33,876 --> 03:28:36,713
At the Wing On
department store in Shanghai.

2079
03:28:37,213 --> 03:28:40,925
Your morn wasn't even
as old as you are now.

2080
03:28:46,931 --> 03:28:49,559
You should throw
that useless junk away.

2081
03:28:49,892 --> 03:28:52,603
What were you doing
at the church library?

2082
03:28:52,729 --> 03:28:55,606
My sister told me about it.
How about you?

2083
03:28:55,732 --> 03:28:59,402
I play when it's time to play,
study when it's time to study.

2084
03:29:00,945 --> 03:29:03,322
So Chiung is your sister?

2085
03:29:05,616 --> 03:29:07,368
She's really religious.

2086
03:29:07,493 --> 03:29:10,705
We were both
in the church choir at one point.

2087
03:29:14,208 --> 03:29:17,378
What'll we do after the movie?
- Some rock and roll joint?

2088
03:29:17,503 --> 03:29:19,255
No, too expensive.

2089
03:29:19,380 --> 03:29:22,341
You want to be like Ma?
Don't be stupid.

2090
03:29:24,761 --> 03:29:27,096
Didn't you quit?

2091
03:29:35,188 --> 03:29:37,440
How about 300 a game?

2092
03:29:39,275 --> 03:29:41,861
Shit!
You need money that bad?

2093
03:29:51,287 --> 03:29:53,331
This is a real opportunity for you.

2094
03:29:53,456 --> 03:29:57,126
I was impressed with Mr. Lin.
He's honest and direct.

2095
03:29:57,668 --> 03:29:59,754
It's time to stop
dragging your feet.

2096
03:29:59,921 --> 03:30:02,215
<i>Dad, Mr. Wang was here.</i>

2097
03:30:07,720 --> 03:30:10,181
I forgot your bubble gum!

2098
03:30:10,640 --> 03:30:13,518
<i>I'll</i> make it up to you next time.

2099
03:30:14,977 --> 03:30:17,855
Why the sad face?
- Big sister bawled me out.

2100
03:30:17,980 --> 03:30:20,024
She did?
Were you naughty?

2101
03:30:20,149 --> 03:30:21,567
<i>No.</i>

2102
03:30:21,692 --> 03:30:23,528
Then why'd she do that?

2103
03:30:30,034 --> 03:30:32,703
- Where's Lao Er?
- He went out.

2104
03:30:32,829 --> 03:30:34,831
Where'd he go?

2105
03:30:36,791 --> 03:30:40,378
Little brat!
Just had to snitch, didn't you!

2106
03:30:45,508 --> 03:30:48,010
<i>I saw Sly last night.</i>

2107
03:30:48,761 --> 03:30:50,805
<i>He's totally changed.</i>

2108
03:30:52,473 --> 03:30:54,725
<i>I guess people really do change.</i>

2109
03:30:55,685 --> 03:30:58,688
<i>It was a comforting feeling.</i>

2110
03:30:59,730 --> 03:31:02,024
What are you going on about?

2111
03:31:04,068 --> 03:31:07,864
Jade, can we be close
to each other?

2112
03:31:09,615 --> 03:31:12,910
I could help you feel
that same way.

2113
03:31:14,203 --> 03:31:16,706
Don't you need that sometimes?

2114
03:31:18,166 --> 03:31:20,209
You're a serious one,
aren't you?

2115
03:31:20,376 --> 03:31:22,879
Didn't you look down
on me before?

2116
03:31:23,171 --> 03:31:24,213
Actually -

2117
03:31:24,338 --> 03:31:26,924
Now you seem eager
to change me.

2118
03:31:28,384 --> 03:31:31,095
Am I your little
biology experiment, or what?

2119
03:31:31,804 --> 03:31:34,807
You have a lot
of philosophical ideas.

2120
03:31:38,227 --> 03:31:41,939
I'm happy with the way I am,
but are you?

2121
03:31:43,941 --> 03:31:45,902
What if I don't change?

2122
03:31:47,570 --> 03:31:50,239
What if I don't change
to suit your ideas?

2123
03:31:50,406 --> 03:31:52,575
Will you just walk away?

2124
03:31:54,911 --> 03:31:58,331
You're so selfish!
Who do you think you are?

2125
03:32:11,010 --> 03:32:13,387
Jade, I didn't mean any harm.

2126
03:32:16,974 --> 03:32:20,937
By the way, thanks for the rumors
you started back then.

2127
03:32:21,687 --> 03:32:24,190
What rumors? Back when?

2128
03:32:24,690 --> 03:32:26,651
Playing dumb?

2129
03:32:26,776 --> 03:32:30,112
When the 217 boys
cornered Sly at the school.

2130
03:32:30,238 --> 03:32:34,033
Did you really not see
it was Ming he was with?

2131
03:32:34,450 --> 03:32:37,870
Sly was scared
Honey might find out.

2132
03:32:37,995 --> 03:32:40,623
He made me tell everyone
it was me.

2133
03:32:40,790 --> 03:32:43,000
I was such an idiot!

2134
03:32:44,168 --> 03:32:46,629
Why don't you give Ming
your philosophy lecture?

2135
03:32:46,796 --> 03:32:49,131
She's got me beat by a mile.

2136
03:33:13,155 --> 03:33:16,325
You're shameless!
Hopeless!

2137
03:33:17,660 --> 03:33:20,037
Tell your father you're sorry.

2138
03:33:21,956 --> 03:33:24,625
That's enough, Dad.

2139
03:33:26,460 --> 03:33:28,212
That's enough, Dad.

2140
03:33:30,715 --> 03:33:32,341
That's enough!

2141
03:33:34,051 --> 03:33:36,554
Dad, please stop!

2142
03:33:42,143 --> 03:33:44,061
Please stop!

2143
03:34:29,774 --> 03:34:32,360
You better come back later.

2144
03:34:32,777 --> 03:34:36,030
Mom and Dad think
you're studying at the library.

2145
03:34:36,614 --> 03:34:39,533
If they find out
you took the watch...

2146
03:34:40,368 --> 03:34:42,912
they'll be even more heartbroken.

2147
03:34:45,247 --> 03:34:47,917
Lao Er came up
with a load of cash.

2148
03:34:49,335 --> 03:34:52,296
He wanted to buy back
the watch for you...

2149
03:34:53,089 --> 03:34:56,175
but Mom found
the money on him first.

2150
03:35:01,972 --> 03:35:03,974
You mustn't feel alone.

2151
03:35:05,309 --> 03:35:07,561
I'm always with you.

2152
03:35:08,229 --> 03:35:10,523
Don't turn me away again.

2153
03:35:10,731 --> 03:35:14,610
Let God into your heart.
He'll give you his strength.

2154
03:35:16,445 --> 03:35:17,780
But...

2155
03:35:18,656 --> 03:35:20,741
there's too much suffering...

2156
03:35:21,200 --> 03:35:23,160
too much injustice.

2157
03:35:25,037 --> 03:35:27,665
Aren't you giving others
too little credit

2158
03:35:28,290 --> 03:35:31,377
and always thinking
only of yourself?

2159
03:35:32,169 --> 03:35:33,921
Christ gave his life

2160
03:35:34,380 --> 03:35:36,257
for our sins.

2161
03:35:37,633 --> 03:35:42,638
Even Lao Er took the blame
for your wrongs.

2162
03:35:44,140 --> 03:35:47,309
You should show gratitude
for what others have done for you.

2163
03:35:47,810 --> 03:35:50,813
Have you ever done
anything for anyone?

2164
03:35:52,189 --> 03:35:54,650
You should think it over carefully.

2165
03:35:58,988 --> 03:36:00,865
Honey told me the same thing.

2166
03:36:00,990 --> 03:36:02,074
Who?

2167
03:36:03,534 --> 03:36:05,202
Never mind.

2168
03:36:05,661 --> 03:36:07,580
A good friend.

2169
03:36:12,042 --> 03:36:16,005
Have you ever read
<i>War and</i> Peace <i>?</i>

2170
03:36:18,174 --> 03:36:21,343
Why don't you talk it over
with Reverend Chen tomorrow?

2171
03:36:34,523 --> 03:36:36,859
- What's up?
- We're not finished yet.

2172
03:36:36,984 --> 03:36:40,196
- What's this about?
- Don't play dumb, asshole.

2173
03:36:40,362 --> 03:36:43,908
Fuck you, going off on me
over some girl!

2174
03:36:44,033 --> 03:36:45,576
Aren't you my buddy?

2175
03:36:45,701 --> 03:36:47,745
You go on like an old lady.

2176
03:36:47,870 --> 03:36:50,331
You said you'd given up
girls for books.

2177
03:36:50,456 --> 03:36:53,334
Now you start bitching.
You got some nerve!

2178
03:36:53,459 --> 03:36:55,961
I've always been good to you.
- Shut your mouth!

2179
03:36:56,420 --> 03:36:58,380
Shut your mouth and listen good.

2180
03:36:58,506 --> 03:37:01,008
I've had enough
of your rich-kid theories.

2181
03:37:01,300 --> 03:37:02,927
Starting today...

2182
03:37:03,052 --> 03:37:05,763
if I hear you're still
hanging out with Ming,

2183
03:37:05,888 --> 03:37:08,891
I'm coming after you!

2184
03:37:14,313 --> 03:37:17,441
Motherfuckin' punk!
I let you be my best friend!

2185
03:37:17,566 --> 03:37:21,654
Fuck! Don't forget
who you're messing with!

2186
03:37:21,779 --> 03:37:24,740
<i>I'll</i> be waitin' for you, buddy!

2187
03:37:24,865 --> 03:37:27,076
<i>I'll</i> kick your ass!

2188
03:37:29,245 --> 03:37:32,748
I've been looking all over for you.
Cool it. We're all good friends.

2189
03:37:33,165 --> 03:37:35,459
Cool it for my sake, okay?

2190
03:37:36,335 --> 03:37:39,088
Let's talk it over.
<i>I'll</i> bring him to you.

2191
03:37:39,255 --> 03:37:42,341
Come on, man.
Don't act this way.

2192
03:37:44,218 --> 03:37:46,220
It makes us look bad.

2193
03:37:46,345 --> 03:37:48,055
Wait at the film studio.

2194
03:37:48,180 --> 03:37:50,933
<i>I'll</i> go talk to him.
<i>I'll</i> bring him to you.

2195
03:37:51,141 --> 03:37:53,310
Cool it for my sake.

2196
03:37:53,602 --> 03:37:55,604
Come on, man.

2197
03:38:07,157 --> 03:38:10,578
Let's drop it for today.
I need time to talk to him.

2198
03:38:10,703 --> 03:38:13,122
He brought
his samurai sword to class.

2199
03:38:13,289 --> 03:38:15,583
Let's do it tomorrow, okay?

2200
03:38:15,708 --> 03:38:18,002
Go home and cool down.

2201
03:38:18,294 --> 03:38:21,213
Do it for me, okay?

2202
03:38:21,463 --> 03:38:23,799
Let's make it tomorrow, okay?

2203
03:38:24,174 --> 03:38:26,427
Okay? For sure?

2204
03:38:26,760 --> 03:38:29,471
I gotta go.
I'm late for class.

2205
03:39:23,734 --> 03:39:25,486
Your brother's not here yet?

2206
03:39:25,611 --> 03:39:28,197
My family said he was on his way.

2207
03:39:28,697 --> 03:39:30,115
Well...

2208
03:39:30,658 --> 03:39:32,826
let's wait another half hour.

2209
03:39:32,951 --> 03:39:35,663
- I'm sorry, Reverend Chen.
- It's okay.

2210
03:39:36,038 --> 03:39:38,540
Well... excuse me.

2211
03:40:06,068 --> 03:40:07,653
Hey there!

2212
03:40:09,863 --> 03:40:13,742
Can you help me find
that young girl you were with before?

2213
03:40:13,951 --> 03:40:16,870
She moved after the screen test.

2214
03:40:16,995 --> 03:40:18,914
You know where to?

2215
03:40:19,081 --> 03:40:23,085
She cries and laughs,
and makes it all look natural!

2216
03:40:23,210 --> 03:40:24,586
Natural?

2217
03:40:25,003 --> 03:40:27,423
You can't even tell real from fake.

2218
03:40:27,548 --> 03:40:29,550
How can you make movies?

2219
03:40:31,468 --> 03:40:34,430
You even know
what the hell you're filming?

2220
03:40:41,603 --> 03:40:43,272
<i>Cat's at school.</i>

2221
03:40:43,439 --> 03:40:45,274
<i>I'm just borrowing a book.</i>

2222
03:40:45,441 --> 03:40:46,650
<i>What book?</i>

2223
03:40:46,775 --> 03:40:48,777
<i>I know where it is.</i>

2224
03:41:45,918 --> 03:41:48,378
How come his bike's still here?

2225
03:41:48,504 --> 03:41:52,382
Strange. He's usually
the first one out of here.

2226
03:41:57,387 --> 03:41:59,097
Si?!

2227
03:42:19,034 --> 03:42:20,869
What's the matter?

2228
03:42:22,037 --> 03:42:24,456
What brings you here to school?

2229
03:42:27,042 --> 03:42:28,752
What's that?

2230
03:42:31,088 --> 03:42:33,549
Stop acting like this.
What's that?

2231
03:42:44,101 --> 03:42:46,270
You're here for Ma.

2232
03:42:48,564 --> 03:42:50,440
Tell me! Are you?

2233
03:42:52,693 --> 03:42:55,070
How could you do
a thing like that?

2234
03:42:56,238 --> 03:42:58,448
I won't let anyone
look down on you.

2235
03:42:59,741 --> 03:43:01,743
What are you talking about?

2236
03:43:05,163 --> 03:43:07,833
Aren't you supposed
to be home studying?

2237
03:43:14,631 --> 03:43:17,759
Ming, I know all about you.

2238
03:43:18,343 --> 03:43:20,012
But I don't mind.

2239
03:43:20,429 --> 03:43:22,097
Because only I know.

2240
03:43:22,222 --> 03:43:24,516
I'm the only one
who can help you.

2241
03:43:25,017 --> 03:43:27,519
I'm the only hope you have left.

2242
03:43:27,978 --> 03:43:30,063
Just like Honey used to be.

2243
03:43:30,731 --> 03:43:33,442
That's why
you still can't forget Honey.

2244
03:43:35,027 --> 03:43:38,113
Because right now,
I'm another Honey.

2245
03:43:43,452 --> 03:43:47,122
You mean you're the only one
who can help change me, right?

2246
03:43:47,831 --> 03:43:50,125
Why are you like all the rest?

2247
03:43:51,043 --> 03:43:54,504
I was wrong about you.
You're just like the others.

2248
03:43:54,630 --> 03:43:58,050
You're nice to me
just so <i>I'll</i> be nice to you.

2249
03:43:59,426 --> 03:44:01,637
Then you'll feel secure, right?

2250
03:44:02,429 --> 03:44:04,097
You're so selfish.

2251
03:44:05,349 --> 03:44:07,142
You want to change me?

2252
03:44:07,267 --> 03:44:09,227
I'm like this world.

2253
03:44:09,353 --> 03:44:12,898
This world will never change!
Who do you think -

2254
03:44:16,526 --> 03:44:18,403
You're hopeless!

2255
03:44:19,029 --> 03:44:21,156
Shameless and hopeless!

2256
03:44:46,598 --> 03:44:47,975
Ming.

2257
03:44:49,017 --> 03:44:50,560
Get up.

2258
03:44:52,521 --> 03:44:54,189
Quick, get up.

2259
03:44:55,148 --> 03:44:56,858
Get on your feet.

2260
03:44:57,901 --> 03:45:00,278
You won't die. Believe me.

2261
03:45:03,490 --> 03:45:05,909
Hurry and get up.

2262
03:45:07,369 --> 03:45:09,287
You can do it.

2263
03:45:12,374 --> 03:45:14,501
Please get up.

2264
03:45:17,838 --> 03:45:19,381
Get up!

2265
03:45:23,427 --> 03:45:25,887
Why won't you get UP?

2266
03:45:31,393 --> 03:45:33,854
Where is he?

2267
03:45:33,979 --> 03:45:37,399
I'm looking for my brother.
You got the wrong person!

2268
03:45:37,566 --> 03:45:39,735
You've made a mistake!

2269
03:45:49,911 --> 03:45:51,997
You got the wrong person!

2270
03:45:54,249 --> 03:45:56,084
<i>Where's Sh'?</i>

2271
03:46:12,642 --> 03:46:14,936
So that's the guy.

2272
03:46:16,605 --> 03:46:18,648
Strange.
I don't know this one.

2273
03:46:19,316 --> 03:46:21,193
What gang is he with?

2274
03:46:22,444 --> 03:46:26,448
I know every one
of these assholes in town.

2275
03:46:35,457 --> 03:46:37,125
“Dear Sis...”

2276
03:46:37,292 --> 03:46:39,294
Found that in his pocket.

2277
03:46:41,213 --> 03:46:42,923
“I'm sorry.

2278
03:46:43,548 --> 03:46:46,384
I know you're the only one
who understands.

2279
03:46:46,510 --> 03:46:49,846
Please help explain
to Morn and Dad...

2280
03:46:50,972 --> 03:46:53,433
in case I never see you again.”

2281
03:46:55,477 --> 03:46:57,312
What's the little jerk's name?

2282
03:46:57,479 --> 03:47:00,273
Can't even write his name.
Drew a funny face!

2283
03:47:00,649 --> 03:47:02,651
What's his problem?

2284
03:47:03,485 --> 03:47:05,821
XIAO Sl'R

2285
03:47:14,913 --> 03:47:17,165
Get up.
Time to change.

2286
03:47:18,333 --> 03:47:19,876
Get up.

2287
03:47:20,001 --> 03:47:22,337
Get up and get changed!

2288
03:47:22,462 --> 03:47:24,548
You little punk!

2289
03:47:24,673 --> 03:47:26,716
She's mine!

2290
03:47:26,842 --> 03:47:29,761
You can't take her away!

2291
03:47:30,011 --> 03:47:32,597
You can't do this!

2292
03:47:46,403 --> 03:47:50,282
It belongs to my old man.
Ask him where he got it.

2293
03:47:50,407 --> 03:47:52,367
<i>I didn't ask him!</i>

2294
03:47:52,492 --> 03:47:53,869
Fm asking you!

2295
03:47:54,035 --> 03:47:56,204
Why'd you bring
this sword to class?

2296
03:47:57,998 --> 03:48:00,709
I know
you're mixed up in all this!

2297
03:48:01,793 --> 03:48:03,879
We know your father well.

2298
03:48:04,004 --> 03:48:06,047
Can't you just cooperate?

2299
03:48:06,214 --> 03:48:08,717
That's my son!
What are you doing to him?

2300
03:48:08,842 --> 03:48:11,761
This is outrageous!
We're a respectable family!

2301
03:48:12,137 --> 03:48:14,681
Treating an innocent child
like this!

2302
03:48:14,890 --> 03:48:16,558
The latest report:

2303
03:48:16,725 --> 03:48:18,643
The girl's mother
just committed suicide.

2304
03:48:18,768 --> 03:48:20,437
Who's in charge here?

2305
03:48:20,562 --> 03:48:22,564
I am! I'm the boss here!

2306
03:48:22,731 --> 03:48:24,399
Now you get out!

2307
03:48:24,524 --> 03:48:27,152
- How dare you speak to me like that!
- Out!

2308
03:48:27,277 --> 03:48:29,571
Who is that man?
I want his name!

2309
03:48:29,905 --> 03:48:31,656
What's his name?

2310
03:48:31,781 --> 03:48:33,575
Write down his name!

2311
03:48:44,294 --> 03:48:47,255
He was the only friend I had.

2312
03:48:48,924 --> 03:48:50,508
And now...

2313
03:49:18,119 --> 03:49:21,122
<i>We heard the girl's mother
tried to kill herself.</i>

2314
03:49:21,248 --> 03:49:23,250
<i>Tell us about it.</i>

2315
03:49:23,375 --> 03:49:25,252
<i>Let us talk to her.</i>

2316
03:49:25,377 --> 03:49:28,296
<i>Everyone wants to know
what really happened.</i>

2317
03:49:28,463 --> 03:49:31,424
<i>She tried to kill herself
by swallowing her gold ring.</i>

2318
03:49:31,549 --> 03:49:33,551
<i>I really don't know much else.</i>

2319
03:49:33,677 --> 03:49:35,428
<i>Please be considerate.</i>

2320
03:49:35,553 --> 03:49:37,681
<i>Do you know the boy?</i>

2321
03:49:37,806 --> 03:49:40,850
<i>Relax. The mother survived.
No big deal.</i>

2322
03:49:40,976 --> 03:49:43,645
I heard you had
an affair with the girl.

2323
03:49:43,770 --> 03:49:47,023
Any comment?
- We heard the same thing.

2324
03:49:47,148 --> 03:49:50,110
What?
Have you no decency?

2325
03:49:50,235 --> 03:49:53,196
Get out! All of you!

2326
03:49:54,322 --> 03:49:56,491
Who do you think you are?
Out!

2327
03:49:56,616 --> 03:49:58,743
He has a guilty conscience.

2328
03:49:58,868 --> 03:50:02,205
What's wrong
with asking a question?

2329
03:50:02,372 --> 03:50:05,834
Let's check out
the police department again.

2330
03:50:06,584 --> 03:50:13,842
<i>There is a place
of peace and calm</i>

2331
03:50:14,843 --> 03:50:19,973
<i>Safe in God's embrace</i>

2332
03:50:21,016 --> 03:50:24,185
<i>In that place</i>

2333
03:50:24,602 --> 03:50:28,523
<i>No evil dwells</i>

2334
03:50:29,149 --> 03:50:34,404
<i>Safe in God's embrace</i>

2335
03:50:35,530 --> 03:50:42,537
<i>Jesus, our benevolent savior</i>

2336
03:50:43,747 --> 03:50:48,877
<i>Comes from God's embrace</i>

2337
03:50:49,753 --> 03:50:57,010
<i>We earnestly await the time</i>

2338
03:50:57,969 --> 03:51:03,558
<i>When we'll rest in God's embrace</i>

2339
03:51:05,018 --> 03:51:07,020
In the summer of 1961,

2340
03:51:07,145 --> 03:51:09,647
Xiao Si'r received
the death sentence

2341
03:51:09,773 --> 03:51:12,650
from the District Court of Taipei.

2342
03:51:12,817 --> 03:51:15,403
Being the first juvenile
homicide case in Taiwan

2343
03:51:15,570 --> 03:51:17,572
under Nationalist
government rule,

2344
03:51:17,697 --> 03:51:19,741
the case and sentence
were widely debated.

2345
03:51:19,908 --> 03:51:22,035
The District High Court
later commuted the sentence

2346
03:51:22,160 --> 03:51:23,828
to 15 years in prison.

2347
03:51:23,953 --> 03:51:27,248
Xiao Si'r was released from prison
shortly before his 30th birthday.

2348
03:51:27,374 --> 03:51:29,834
Two months after the incident...

2349
03:51:30,085 --> 03:51:33,671
The other gentlemen said
you accept tapes.

2350
03:51:36,257 --> 03:51:38,093
Who said that?

2351
03:51:39,594 --> 03:51:41,513
You're making it up.

2352
03:51:41,971 --> 03:51:43,932
We never accept tapes.

2353
03:51:44,099 --> 03:51:45,975
I wanted to leave a letter.

2354
03:51:46,101 --> 03:51:49,270
He said letters get lost easily
in the mail room.

2355
03:51:49,396 --> 03:51:51,773
He suggested a tape instead.

2356
03:51:57,445 --> 03:52:00,156
- Are you a family member?
- No.

2357
03:52:01,324 --> 03:52:04,285
Mister, didn't you say
you accept tapes?

2358
03:52:08,498 --> 03:52:10,458
Do you or don't you?

2359
03:52:10,625 --> 03:52:12,877
- Who's it for?
- Zhang Zhen.

2360
03:52:13,211 --> 03:52:14,921
All right.

2361
03:52:20,760 --> 03:52:23,096
Just leave it and go!

2362
03:52:26,474 --> 03:52:29,477
<i>Sir, remember
this song I recorded?</i>

2363
03:52:29,978 --> 03:52:32,147
<i>Guess who I mailed it to.</i>

2364
03:52:32,439 --> 03:52:34,274
<i>Elvis!</i>

2365
03:52:34,441 --> 03:52:36,359
<i>He even wrote back.</i>

2366
03:52:36,484 --> 03:52:39,988
<i>He was surprised to learn
his music is so popular</i>

2367
03:52:40,155 --> 03:52:42,323
<i>on this unknown little island.</i>

2368
03:52:42,490 --> 03:52:46,661
<i>He was touched.
He even sent me a gift.</i>

2369
03:52:47,287 --> 03:52:49,414
<i>Too bad you can't see it.</i>

2370
03:52:49,539 --> 03:52:52,417
<i>I wear the ring
he sent me every day.</i>

2371
03:52:52,542 --> 03:52:54,627
<i>It's really cool!</i>

2372
03:52:55,336 --> 03:52:59,674
<i>I just don't know
when I'll get to show it to you.</i>

2373
03:53:02,010 --> 03:53:04,679
What's this thing?

2374
03:53:04,888 --> 03:53:06,639
Shit!

2375
03:53:52,519 --> 03:53:54,771
Hey, the radio's working!

2376
03:53:55,396 --> 03:53:58,566
Don't move it!
<i>It'll</i> out out again!

2377
03:53:58,900 --> 03:54:03,112
<i>Kang Fu-mei,
Wang Chao-jen, Yeh Hsin-ming...</i>

2378
03:54:03,238 --> 03:54:06,658
<i>Chao Hung,
Chen Chang-chem...</i>

2379
03:54:41,401 --> 03:54:45,238
<i>The preceding have qualified
for the Chinese Literature Department.</i>

2380
