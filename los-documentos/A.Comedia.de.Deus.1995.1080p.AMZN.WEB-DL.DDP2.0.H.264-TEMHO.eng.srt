1
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,199
<i>Joaquim Pinto presents</i>

2
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:29,034
<i>“God's Comedy",
by João César Monteiro.</i>

3
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,234
Here he comes.
- Right on time.

4
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:38,194
The slow movement
is essentially majestic.

5
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,477
In my opinion he's just slow.

6
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:46,353
- Good morning, girls.
- Good morning.

7
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,597
Don't forget the bleach.

8
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,874
Has there ever been a shortage
of bleach in this place?

9
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,195
As far as I know, no.

10
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,311
D'you think that just happens?

11
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,956
Infallibility is the watchword.

12
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,754
Get on with your work and behave.

13
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,392
Almost two hours
to get here from Benfica.

14
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,756
The traffic's murder.
You can't imagine.

15
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:07,318
I imagine it'll be the same
from here to Benfica.

16
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,638
Not up to much at all.

17
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:34,950
The night shift seems to have been
bitten by the tsetse fly.

18
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,677
It's this social strife.

19
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:41,555
- Nobody wants to lift a finger.
- It's all we've got.

20
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:44,838
We just have to make do.

21
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,599
What do you think
about these extremists?

22
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,030
- I don't think anything.
- Look at Russia...

23
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:52,793
Tell Judite to look
the new candidates over

24
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,752
and the Devil take the hindmost.

25
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:58,077
- She always has the last word.
- I'm off, it's getting late.

26
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,349
Tell Judite to give me a ring.

27
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,831
This has to be straightened out,
or it'll all boil over.

28
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,712
Don't worry.

29
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:09,673
Iron hand,
that's what's needed.

30
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,637
Come here, Alexandra.

31
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,551
You've got a spot
on your overall.

32
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,876
It's not my period,
it's strawberry.

33
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:30,680
Doesn't make any difference.
You'd better put a clean one on.

34
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,076
But I haven't got a clean one!

35
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:36,397
Improvise. Desperate ills
need soap and water.

36
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,318
I knew you were in a bad mood.

37
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,078
Yes, my little one.

38
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,596
- I've been to the agency.
-Planning a holiday?

39
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,439
I'd like to go to Thailand.
It's lovely, there's lots to do.

40
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,313
A friend of mine who's been,
says it has marvellous beaches.

41
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,319
For two, all in,
it's not a lot with a credit card.

42
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,359
Have a good trip.

43
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:05,518
Send me a postcard
of a buffalo grazing.

44
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,355
You're always teasing me...

45
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,595
Don't take any notice.

46
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:12,314
It means I'm not up
to doing much else.

47
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:18,197
That's done. My overall'll dry
in seconds in the sun.

48
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:21,756
- Spot's gone.
- There's a cloakroom

49
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:24,349
for you girls
to change your clothes in.

50
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:28,110
Undies here are sacrilegious.

51
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,836
Over my dead body.

52
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,598
Sorry, I wasn't thinking.
I was in a hurry.

53
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:38,429
Will you let me go
to the swimming pool?

54
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,191
I've never refused anyone
a bathe.

55
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:43,994
Not even my worst enemy.
Don't be long.

56
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:47,475
Do you find me attractive?

57
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:50,599
Don't push me, girl.
Leave me in peace.

58
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,672
You'll never know.

59
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:58,550
That Alexandra
isn't much of a worker.

60
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,398
Perhaps she's got problems
at home.

61
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:03,080
At home?
They live like cattle.

62
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:08,790
She seems willing
to go for a bathe, so...

63
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:13,434
Oh, yes? Go and have a look
at the ladies'.

64
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:22,989
Oh, my God!

65
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,398
Shop!

66
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:32,989
- Is anyone about?
-I'm about. What d'you want?

67
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,838
What do I have to do
to get a job here?

68
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,519
I don't know if there are vacancies.

69
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,995
But it says here:
"staff wanted."

70
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,350
You'll have to speak
to the manager.

71
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:49,549
Get a bucket of water at once,

72
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,557
and clean the wall in the ladies'.

73
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,194
I didn't make
that mess on the wall.

74
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:58,312
I'm not interested
in who it was or who it wasn't.

75
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:02,113
Health regulations
in this establishment

76
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:04,880
are to be strictly observed.

77
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,879
Don't take on staff who wipe
their arses with their fingers!

78
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:11,830
Watch your tongue, girl.
You should talk!

79
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,356
I can't stand tattle tales.

80
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,873
Place has a nice atmosphere.

81
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,752
- Name?
- Carmen.

82
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:42,473
- References?
It's my first job.

83
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,031
Better late than never.

84
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:48,357
My parents were against
exploitation of child labour.

85
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,992
Qualifications?

86
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,756
University student.

87
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:56,396
Which university?

88
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,916
The university of life.

89
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,478
Here you are, my dear.

90
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,114
Take this to pay your fees

91
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,834
and come back
when you've graduated.

92
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:21,634
It is a nice atmosphere here.

93
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,870
A 500 note
isn't to be refused.

94
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,273
What a mess!

95
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:06,792
I've cleaned that shit up.
Can I go and have a coffee?

96
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:14,200
Go on, but stop sulking.

97
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:18,830
In the world we live in,
somebody has to pay for the sinners.

98
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,030
Do you want anything?

99
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,910
A packet of filter cigarettes.

100
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,232
Do you want one?

101
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:38,120
- They're from Mr. Chips.
- No way.

102
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:42,671
Goodbye, Mr. Chips.

103
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,829
Judite?

104
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:00,999
Where are you?

105
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,670
At home or at the factory?

106
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,834
Tomé gets everything muddled.

107
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,391
No, no. Not at all.

108
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:12,269
Don't worry. It's all under control.

109
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,799
The usual.

110
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:18,160
Cleaner didn't turn up again.

111
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:22,398
She'll tell me a load of bullshit.

112
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:25,513
It's a bore, but what can you do?

113
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:30,756
Can't just let it go to the dogs.

114
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:35,511
When Romão gets back,
sort it out with him.

115
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:42,234
I'll go to the bank
and have a word with the manager.

116
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,952
Don't worry.

117
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:48,440
How many kilos on hand?

118
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,951
That's enough.

119
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:54,472
No, the idea's very simple.

120
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:59,598
Let the customers' mouths water,

121
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,990
say we've run out,

122
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:05,192
then relaunch Paradise.
Of course!

123
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,594
At a new price,
befitting the house speciality

124
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:14,589
and the originality of flavour.

125
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,596
It comes in Marx.

126
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,798
Can't make omelettes
without breaking eggs.

127
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:25,111
Increase salaries, get results.

128
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:31,634
It's elementary, and you know
by your own experience,

129
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,874
since you've had a lot...

130
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,438
Made a good impression
on me too.

131
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:43,398
Lives in a shack with her mother?

132
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:47,193
Seems all right.

133
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,312
Let's see.

134
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:54,638
One swallow
doesn't make a summer.

135
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:59,271
What part of Minho?

136
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,954
Yes, I know it well.

137
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:08,794
As I remember I had the best
chicken and rice in my life there.

138
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:11,836
They're nice people.

139
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:19,231
Very pretty. She hasn't lost
that dewy, provincial innocence.

140
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:25,234
I'll do her up to look like
one of those Venetian madonnas.

141
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:28,074
Keep a touch of rural charm.

142
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:31,514
Might be an attraction.

143
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:35,869
Mind it'll take a lot of know-how
to keep her.

144
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:39,239
Have I ever let you down?

145
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,709
You know I never mix
business with pleasure.

146
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,430
OK, I'll expect her.

147
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:50,520
Rosário. Rosário, what?

148
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,669
No, no.

149
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:56,517
That Francisca
never fooled me.

150
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,831
Saw straight away.

151
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:01,310
Complain to the police?

152
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,592
Don't even think about it.
It's not worth the aggro.

153
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:10,396
I'll keep an eye on her.
Let it lie.

154
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:15,034
I don't want to start anything.

155
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,911
Ciao, my dear!

156
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:23,237
Get well soon.

157
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,757
Show me those hands.

158
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,872
They're clean.

159
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:47,271
That's how it should be.

160
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,876
Do you want to know why?

161
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:54,831
The reason is simple,
I never get tired of repeating it.

162
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,795
A large number of our customers
are children.

163
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,798
So,

164
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,959
anyone who works for me

165
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:09,638
has to wash their hands after
using the sanitary installations,

166
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:13,996
after extracting nasal mucous,

167
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:16,789
picking your nose, for example.

168
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:19,514
Non-compliance
means immediate dismissal

169
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:22,519
and criminal proceedings.

170
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,912
Public health is at stake.

171
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:30,196
Do you understand?

172
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:36,631
When you serve an ice-cream,
never forget:

173
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,837
one day,
you too will be a mother.

174
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,394
My mask?

175
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,993
Good old Jim...

176
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,672
A pubic hair
belonging to Queen Victoria.

177
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:54,756
God shave the Queen.

178
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:13,430
"Love my umbrella."

179
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:32,153
Book of Thoughts

180
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:18,671
- How much a kilo?
- 580 for a regular like you.

181
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:21,516
Gut me four of those bream.

182
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,910
They seem to fresh
from the sea.

183
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:35,792
That they do.

184
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,436
I can see them fried
with runny tomato rice.

185
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:44,470
- Or with coriander <i>açorda</i>.
- That would go very nicely.

186
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,274
Get off, cat!

187
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,630
Go and lick your mother's cunt,
get away.

188
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,994
How much?
- 480.

189
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,913
How are you today?

190
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:58,838
Passed away
just before you came.

191
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,234
That's it.

192
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:10,759
Thus are the sins
of the world taken away.

193
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:17,389
Can't sell it, but if you like
I'll let you have the brains.

194
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,320
Good, strong, fortifying.

195
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:23,479
Perfect with scrambled eggs.

196
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:26,114
My daughters are going
to enjoy them no end.

197
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,436
They need them, poor things.

198
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:30,278
They're growing kids.

199
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,516
Do nothing but study.

200
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,916
I'll tell you something,
my three girls

201
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:39,199
have got more wits about them
than many a minister.

202
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:43,076
I can well believe it,

203
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:45,800
but decline the brains.

204
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:49,080
What's it going to be?

205
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,118
Calves liver, then?

206
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:56,430
Cut thin.

207
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:58,437
I won't say no.

208
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:00,194
Look,

209
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:03,358
look at this bootiful.

210
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:06,839
Fine slices.

211
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:16,110
Lovely.

212
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,879
Evaristo,

213
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:38,112
got any of these?

214
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:46,433
Prick!

215
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,956
Where did you say you lived?

216
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:11,118
- In "Cambodja".
- That must be rather dangerous.

217
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:13,271
Not as bad as you think.

218
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:16,677
It's worse after the rain.
There's mud all over the place.

219
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,352
Scrub that mark.

220
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,516
This? It's a mole.

221
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,355
I've got lots all over.

222
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,272
If God so wills...

223
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,234
Nails!

224
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:57,150
Scrub the half-moons.

225
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:02,510
They're worth polishing.

226
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:06,750
I take after my late father.

227
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:09,030
How long is it since he died?

228
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:11,831
Almost two years.

229
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:15,191
He was fumigating a vat
with sulphur.

230
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:17,551
Toxic fumes.

231
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:25,911
Are they all right now?

232
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:32,312
Perfect.

233
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:40,957
You can dry them.

234
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:44,110
You should've seen the funeral.

235
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:46,629
Nobody in the village had seen
a funeral like it.

236
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:50,469
He was reckoned to be
the best barrelmaker in those parts.

237
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,796
The daughter of a barrelmaker.

238
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:57,836
- You must enjoy a drop of wine.
- I like green wine.

239
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,789
But it has to be drunk
out of the barrel.

240
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:04,200
You'll have to try ours one day.

241
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,199
I'll have to.

242
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:19,432
We shan't use
the anti-dandruff shampoo.

243
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:26,070
You've got silky hair.

244
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:29,035
One can see it's clean.

245
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:31,676
You don't need it.

246
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,589
Let's just comb it...

247
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:40,636
and tie it behind.

248
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,038
That's it.

249
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,670
Pull it all back.

250
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,917
Like that.

251
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:58,394
My hair's a bit difficult to control.

252
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:02,198
Better that than anything else.

253
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:08,833
You've got a noble complection

254
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:12,109
and carry yourself well.

255
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:15,151
Good.

256
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:22,318
Let's tie this ribbon round
to keep it in place.

257
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,959
Perfect.

258
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:13,071
"A soft and pious glance,

259
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:17,516
"a gentle, honest smile,

260
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:22,318
"a sweet and humble gesture
of uncertain guile.

261
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:26,194
"A quiet, ashamed vivacity;

262
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:29,438
"such grave and modest repose;

263
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:31,677
"a pure tender-heartedness,

264
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:35,031
"sign of a clear, gracious soul,

265
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,797
"a timid audacity,

266
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:39,672
"meekness,

267
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:43,031
"fear without guilt,
air serene,

268
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:46,518
"long and obedient pain,

269
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:51,080
"this was the celestial beauty
of my Circe,

270
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:56,073
the magic venom
that transforms my thoughts."

271
00:31:57,160 --> 00:32:01,119
"The magic venom
that transforms my thoughts."

272
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:19,716
I don't make anyone
wear a cap

273
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:22,513
or snood,

274
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:27,273
but observing basic hygiene
is essential.

275
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:31,394
Now let's practice.

276
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:02,394
First fill the dish to the rim.

277
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:06,713
Don't forget,
rinse the spatula in water

278
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:09,400
when you change flavours.

279
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:14,399
Smooth the ice
as though combing it.

280
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:21,309
What have we got?
A poligonal base

281
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:25,155
equal to the volume
of the recipient.

282
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:28,151
Pat it gently,

283
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:30,510
I always pat it three times,

284
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:33,598
and we build the pyramid.

285
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:37,438
Cheops, Khafre and Menkaure.

286
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:42,153
You can savour the magical flavour
of Ancient Egypt.

287
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:58,276
Same technique,
but it requires more delicacy.

288
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:02,071
Everything depends
on the perfect astringency

289
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,709
of the scoop of ice-cream
and the cone,

290
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:07,150
so it doesn't get squashed.

291
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:11,714
Relax your hand muscles.

292
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:15,473
<i>Let your hand fall loosely...</i>

293
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:19,432
<i>Knock on that door...</i>

294
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:25,630
Are you following me?

295
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:41,671
A short, sharp tap

296
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:45,192
and there you are.

297
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:53,193
I'm out of practice
but that's the idea.

298
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:06,555
Then there were the "muscovites",

299
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:09,075
called <i>bavarois</i> then,

300
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:12,519
<i>mousses, parfaits,</i>

301
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:16,111
cold <i>soufflés</i>, bombes...

302
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:19,470
Until the Americans

303
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:22,873
came with sorbets
made of cream,

304
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:26,192
sometimes with corn flour
and gelatine added,

305
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:28,551
and invented ice-cream

306
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:31,877
and today it's popular everywhere.

307
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:34,276
I like ours best.

308
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:43,033
The ice-cream empire is vast.

309
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:48,716
The Americans have opened
huge factories everywhere,

310
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:52,196
from Arkansas to Vietnam,
even Korea.

311
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:56,229
Our manufacture is semi-artisanal.

312
00:35:56,360 --> 00:36:00,593
The factory badly needs
more sophisticated equipment.

313
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:05,756
I'll take you there one day.

314
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:10,999
If you learn,
you'll be more involved in your work.

315
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:14,638
I'm not afraid of work.
I never shirk.

316
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:17,917
I'm a good worker.

317
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:21,239
I know you're not like the others,

318
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:23,352
but you have to love this.

319
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:26,632
Our policy requires commitment
from everybody.

320
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:30,310
It isn't based on ordinary,
everyday tastes,

321
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:33,151
but on constant innovation,

322
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:35,715
on the ceaseless search
for the splendiferous,

323
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:39,231
perhaps unattainable
flavour of flavours.

324
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,389
Seek and ye shall find.

325
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:50,796
We are not seeking truth.

326
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:55,799
We are seeking our Ariadne.

327
00:36:57,640 --> 00:37:00,678
Good Lord,
under such trying conditions!

328
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:05,196
Just one small, human error,

329
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:09,634
sudden carelessness by our staff,
and we lose everything.

330
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:16,397
Not just anyone is chosen
to enter the gates of Paradise.

331
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:13,634
A Chinese?

332
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:21,638
Despite every care
we can't completely eliminate

333
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:25,194
the risk of pathogenic factors

334
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:29,195
turning us into a serious
health hazard.

335
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:34,269
There's never been any trouble...

336
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:36,272
Fortunately not,

337
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:38,591
but we must remain vigilant

338
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:42,315
and pray that there'll never be
any trouble in Paradise.

339
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:45,393
That's why I insist:

340
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:49,069
Wash yourselves, girls.

341
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:52,119
Every day
with soap and water.

342
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:56,029
Ward off pathogenic factors,
common microbes.

343
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:58,957
And Rosarinho, my dear,

344
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:01,390
never forget when
serving an ice-cream:

345
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:03,636
you too will be a mother.

346
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:06,718
You too.

347
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:57,193
And also,

348
00:46:57,640 --> 00:47:00,075
our taste for ice-creams

349
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:02,476
is one of the good things of life

350
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:06,392
we owe to our Roman ancestors,

351
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:09,990
to their sensual pleasure in life

352
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:12,192
which led them

353
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:14,516
to send for snow

354
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:17,792
from distant sierras,
in the Apenines

355
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:21,072
so that, on hot days,

356
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:24,670
lying relaxed on couches
in the triclinium,

357
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:29,030
they could sip fruits and juices

358
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:32,749
at cool temperatures.

359
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:36,638
Even if,

360
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:39,471
in 1295,

361
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:42,877
Marco Polo had brought
from Japan to Venice

362
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:47,395
a recipe for milk shakes,

363
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:51,157
undoubtedly,

364
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:56,790
the Italians are the real creators
of the sorbet.

365
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,718
From Italy,

366
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:05,351
after the Renaissance exodus,

367
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:08,029
ices arrived in France

368
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:10,231
in 1660

369
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:13,352
from Procopius himself,

370
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:16,316
a Florentine by birth.

371
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:20,113
With the ascension
of French cooking,

372
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:23,834
ice-creams proliferated.

373
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:27,911
There were muscovites, etc.

374
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:30,790
Until the Americans,

375
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:34,559
with their sorbets made of cream

376
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:38,237
sometimes with corn flour

377
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:41,472
and gelatine added,
invented ice-cream.

378
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:47,911
Today, it's popular everywhere.

379
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:55,674
How many flavours?

380
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:56,835
- One.
- Two.

381
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:58,109
Three.

382
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:08,996
An Aurora, a Snow-white
and a Charlot.

383
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:13,434
A Cosi fan Frutti,
a Penguin and a Billy the Kid.

384
00:49:24,680 --> 00:49:27,832
What a pity this isn't a sin.

385
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,593
According to Stendhal

386
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:34,236
an Italian princess made the same
complain in the 17th century.

387
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:37,030
It's all a question of education.

388
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:39,991
They should be licked

389
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:42,470
with the right degree of decorum.

390
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:48,679
Have you noted
that disgraceful scene?

391
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:53,038
They seem to be gulping...
I know not what.

392
00:49:53,480 --> 00:49:56,836
Ice-cream is a rich source
of calcium for the organism.

393
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:59,600
But the divine flavours?

394
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:04,432
Do you think those little minxes
can even guess them

395
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:08,478
with that frenetic licking?

396
00:50:09,320 --> 00:50:12,119
They came in all aglow,
D. Antónia.

397
00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:15,870
Look, it's made their little
tongues all pink.

398
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:18,270
Pearls before swine.

399
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:20,550
There you are
racking your brains

400
00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:23,115
to create the most sublime aromas

401
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:26,398
and for what?
Yes, for what?

402
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:29,637
I only wish

403
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:33,833
to serve the community
in the way I know best.

404
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:36,552
Humbly.

405
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:42,310
Ice-creams shouldn't be presented
in Parliament,

406
00:50:42,680 --> 00:50:45,399
if they're not endowed
with virtues,

407
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:48,717
if dissension
reigns amongst flavours.

408
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:51,275
If dissension
reigns amongst flavours.

409
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:53,914
Here there are no flavours,
only perfumes.

410
00:50:54,040 --> 00:50:55,394
Isn't that a gallicism?

411
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:58,399
If you want to take a language
course you'd better change jobs.

412
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:06,160
Perfume gives a different flavour.

413
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:07,918
It has another taste.

414
00:51:08,040 --> 00:51:10,793
If you shout at them
they'll get shaky.

415
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:13,992
I never shout. All I need
is to open my eyes wide.

416
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:20,318
Of course,
let's hope it doesn't rain.

417
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:22,119
It won't rain.

418
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:24,629
The weatherman announced
a fall in temperature.

419
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:40,393
Goodnight.

420
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:49,271
These man-mad girls.

421
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:52,637
All they want
is to ride motorbikes.

422
00:51:52,760 --> 00:51:54,990
There's no public transport
at this time of night.

423
00:51:55,120 --> 00:51:57,794
Don't give me that song
and dance routine.

424
00:51:57,920 --> 00:52:00,036
Do them good to walk.

425
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:02,231
Get the blood circulating.

426
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:04,476
It gives the place
a bad reputation.

427
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:07,160
I fancy nibbling
a langouste next door.

428
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:10,352
They're very dry.
I'd advise the lobster.

429
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:12,319
I saw them arrive today.

430
00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:14,317
Langouste is more
comme il faut.

431
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:16,875
It is, but if I were you
I'd book a table now.

432
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,389
Don't forget to use a napkin.

433
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:21,193
A napkin?

434
00:52:21,360 --> 00:52:24,955
Yes, a napkin.
My gorgeous linen suit!

435
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:34,237
You've got a way with you.

436
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:37,591
Join us when you close up.
We'll save you a claw.

437
00:52:43,640 --> 00:52:45,790
Sit beside the wise.

438
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:47,957
Some may rub off.

439
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:49,111
You looking for Rosarinho?

440
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:53,599
- Yes, I am.
- Rosarinho's moved

441
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:56,999
to the buildings.
- Good. I didn't know.

442
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:23,391
You gave me a fright.

443
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:29,471
That's not funny.

444
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:33,032
Not meant to be funny.

445
00:55:33,160 --> 00:55:36,152
It's to denounce police brutality.

446
00:55:36,320 --> 00:55:39,995
Doesn't seem like a good idea. When
it's serious nobody'll believe you.

447
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:42,790
You don't think it's serious?

448
00:55:45,840 --> 00:55:49,071
It doesn't seem to be
anything to do with you.

449
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:52,272
Do you think it's all right
that we're still awake?

450
00:55:52,840 --> 00:55:54,478
No, no I don't.

451
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:56,716
Then you'd better keep quiet.

452
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:11,313
Want to buy some photos
to send to the newspapers?

453
00:56:37,840 --> 00:56:40,354
I don't know anybody
who works on a newspaper.

454
00:56:44,680 --> 00:56:46,512
We've got some of Rosarinho,

455
00:56:47,360 --> 00:56:49,874
washing her fanny, naked.

456
00:56:50,360 --> 00:56:52,795
I took them through a crack
in the shack.

457
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:06,357
Can't see anything.
They're out of focus.

458
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:09,393
We've passed them around,
but they serve their purpose.

459
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:12,838
What purpose?

460
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:16,990
Getting your end away.
Look at those tits.

461
00:57:23,800 --> 00:57:26,599
I'll keep them
to stop them being passed around.

462
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:28,438
They're not for sale.

463
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:31,639
Got a smoke?

464
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:36,911
Yes, but I'm not giving you one.
I don't encourage vices.

465
00:57:39,360 --> 00:57:41,874
A thousand each
if you burn the photos.

466
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:43,399
It's a deal.

467
01:00:15,600 --> 01:00:18,160
The boss wants to speak to you.

468
01:00:50,840 --> 01:00:52,239
Come in.

469
01:01:09,080 --> 01:01:11,674
You know I've seen
a lot of pricks in my day.

470
01:01:11,880 --> 01:01:13,279
But one finger only.

471
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:15,437
Everything I've got,
I've had to pay for.

472
01:01:15,560 --> 01:01:18,393
I've been a whore,
but I've got my head screwed on.

473
01:01:19,160 --> 01:01:22,915
Honey, you want a blow job?
Pay. It's so much.

474
01:01:23,080 --> 01:01:26,357
Always doing my accounts.
No sentiment.

475
01:01:26,760 --> 01:01:30,913
I opened my legs many a time, but I
never lost my head. You know why?

476
01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:33,158
I never mixed:

477
01:01:33,280 --> 01:01:35,999
work's work,
pleasure's pleasure.

478
01:01:36,680 --> 01:01:39,877
I could've finished up like Mimi.
Remember her?

479
01:01:41,640 --> 01:01:43,517
Don't talk about Mimi.

480
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:47,709
It makes me feel
like turning you round

481
01:01:47,880 --> 01:01:50,269
and sticking my finger
up your ass.

482
01:01:51,800 --> 01:01:54,110
- Did I feed you?
- You did.

483
01:01:54,280 --> 01:01:56,430
- Drag you out of the gutter?
- You did.

484
01:01:56,560 --> 01:01:58,915
I dressed you
from head to toe.

485
01:01:59,360 --> 01:02:00,998
Can't be undone.

486
01:02:04,080 --> 01:02:06,515
You're an ungrateful bastard.

487
01:02:07,360 --> 01:02:09,112
I am, aren't I?

488
01:02:10,840 --> 01:02:13,719
I do my work
and I do it well.

489
01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:19,716
I'm the heart and soul
of the place

490
01:02:19,840 --> 01:02:22,992
and hearts and souls
don't owe anything.

491
01:02:23,120 --> 01:02:26,829
That's true. The ice-cream parlour
has done very well.

492
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:29,800
But don't push your luck.

493
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:33,834
- That's friendly advice.
- Let's get to the point.

494
01:02:34,800 --> 01:02:38,077
Rosarinho came here to see
how ices are made.

495
01:02:38,200 --> 01:02:41,113
Does she have to lick them?
Don't kid me.

496
01:02:41,440 --> 01:02:45,559
They're birds of passage,
wasting money on clothes and drugs.

497
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:50,591
Are you stopping me
from training the staff?

498
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:53,190
From making them more
capable and efficient?

499
01:02:53,320 --> 01:02:54,958
I don't care for smart-ass girls.

500
01:02:55,080 --> 01:02:57,799
I like them serving ices
and being pleasant.

501
01:02:59,040 --> 01:03:02,920
Rosarinho's a serious girl.
You recommended her to me.

502
01:03:03,040 --> 01:03:04,474
Exactly,

503
01:03:04,600 --> 01:03:07,274
but I've known you
many a long year,

504
01:03:07,400 --> 01:03:10,392
so for better or worse,
from today,

505
01:03:10,800 --> 01:03:13,553
there'll be no more guided tours.

506
01:03:13,680 --> 01:03:15,432
Is that all?

507
01:03:17,280 --> 01:03:21,274
Getting back to business,
I'm thinking of merging.

508
01:03:21,840 --> 01:03:23,558
Sexually?

509
01:03:23,840 --> 01:03:28,038
A famous French ice-cream maker
is interested in our production.

510
01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:30,119
Bertillon?

511
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:33,631
No, not Bertillon, but as good.
He's called Antoine Doinel.

512
01:03:33,840 --> 01:03:35,831
You can read the fax.

513
01:03:36,040 --> 01:03:39,078
Don't get swellheaded.
Your fame has reached Paris.

514
01:03:41,080 --> 01:03:43,037
"Dear Judite...

515
01:03:43,680 --> 01:03:47,196
further to our
phone conversation..."

516
01:03:50,480 --> 01:03:53,359
It doesn't mention me.
- It's quite implicit.

517
01:03:54,560 --> 01:03:57,473
It refers to a possible marriage...

518
01:03:57,640 --> 01:03:58,994
No more, no less.

519
01:03:59,120 --> 01:04:01,839
Antoine is about my age,
a gentleman,

520
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,753
one thing doesn't take
the place of another.

521
01:04:08,160 --> 01:04:12,313
Our ices haven't a hope
of penetrating the French market.

522
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:16,118
Obviously not
through lack of quality,

523
01:04:16,320 --> 01:04:20,075
but because the French consumer
won't accept their origin,

524
01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:23,520
their being Portuguese.

525
01:04:23,680 --> 01:04:26,115
Let Antoine
penetrate me first

526
01:04:26,240 --> 01:04:28,390
and then we'll talk.

527
01:04:29,360 --> 01:04:31,874
Carinhas & Doinel.

528
01:04:32,680 --> 01:04:35,320
They'll penetrate
on a grand scale.

529
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:39,354
We have to get everything ready
for when Antoine arrives.

530
01:04:40,160 --> 01:04:43,869
I am relying on you
to prepare one of your perfumes.

531
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:47,313
Go educate that little madam,
but don't bring her here.

532
01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:49,795
Romão is enough
at leading them astray.

533
01:04:50,160 --> 01:04:53,118
You couldn't be more wrong.

534
01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:04,234
Yes, love.

535
01:05:05,680 --> 01:05:09,833
Concentrate on the perfumes.
Leave the penetration to Judite.

536
01:06:58,440 --> 01:07:00,431
Hello doll, congratulations!

537
01:07:05,400 --> 01:07:06,913
Hello, my lovely!

538
01:07:11,920 --> 01:07:13,752
Hello, cuddly!

539
01:07:19,360 --> 01:07:21,271
Hello, my little dove!

540
01:07:26,640 --> 01:07:28,392
Oh, what an armful!

541
01:07:35,120 --> 01:07:37,031
My little chick!

542
01:07:41,920 --> 01:07:43,638
Hello, doll!

543
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,640
I hardly have time to breathe.

544
01:07:54,960 --> 01:07:57,076
It's a tough profession.

545
01:07:57,240 --> 01:07:59,880
But whenever I can
I go to my beautician.

546
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:03,914
She's got fairy hands and knows
my wrinkles like the back of her hand.

547
01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:07,679
Rain or shine,

548
01:08:08,120 --> 01:08:09,997
I have four baths a day.

549
01:08:10,120 --> 01:08:12,634
God forbid! Too much of anything
isn't good for you.

550
01:08:12,760 --> 01:08:15,070
It isn't too much. Just listen!

551
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:17,794
A few drops of essential oils
in the bath

552
01:08:17,920 --> 01:08:21,436
and the water is filled with
calming and stimulating properties,

553
01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:26,551
which we absorb as we inhale
the perfumed vapour of the hot water.

554
01:08:27,760 --> 01:08:30,036
"Star body" suggests

555
01:08:30,160 --> 01:08:32,993
"Perles d'Huile
de Bain Aromatique",

556
01:08:33,120 --> 01:08:36,238
with a base of sandalwood,
patchouli and incense,

557
01:08:36,760 --> 01:08:38,671
calming effect;

558
01:08:39,200 --> 01:08:40,838
green mint,

559
01:08:41,160 --> 01:08:44,516
juniper and rosemary,

560
01:08:45,280 --> 01:08:47,476
cooling effect;

561
01:08:48,640 --> 01:08:50,472
pepper,

562
01:08:50,600 --> 01:08:52,398
bergamot,

563
01:08:52,520 --> 01:08:54,033
and lemon,

564
01:08:54,160 --> 01:08:56,356
tonic effect...

565
01:08:57,240 --> 01:08:58,719
"Orchidée"

566
01:08:58,840 --> 01:09:01,753
mixes lemon,

567
01:09:02,600 --> 01:09:04,716
sage and juniper

568
01:09:04,840 --> 01:09:08,993
for their "Complexe d'Huiles
Essentielles Amincissantes",

569
01:09:10,200 --> 01:09:12,794
and orange leaf,

570
01:09:12,960 --> 01:09:17,477
camomile and verbena
for their Complexe Relaxant.

571
01:09:18,560 --> 01:09:21,473
Yes, indeed. Sacred oils.

572
01:09:21,760 --> 01:09:23,558
That's not all.

573
01:09:23,680 --> 01:09:28,277
Gilles de Rais has formulated
four special oils for the bath:

574
01:09:29,160 --> 01:09:30,878
Tonificant,

575
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:32,832
with pine essence;

576
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:36,954
"Décontractant Musculaire",
with essence of rosemary;

577
01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:39,079
Revigorant,

578
01:09:39,200 --> 01:09:41,316
with essence of lavender;

579
01:09:41,440 --> 01:09:44,796
Calmant,
with essence of eucalyptus.

580
01:09:45,560 --> 01:09:47,437
Ah, Judite!

581
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:48,874
In India,

582
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:52,436
oils are not only famed for
softening the coarseness of the skin,

583
01:09:52,560 --> 01:09:55,074
but also of the soul.

584
01:10:15,200 --> 01:10:18,033
Are you dog-fucking me, João?

585
01:11:13,640 --> 01:11:15,711
It is gold on blue.

586
01:11:17,600 --> 01:11:21,195
My mother only parted from it
on her death bed.

587
01:11:27,280 --> 01:11:29,590
What if it gets stolen?

588
01:11:38,960 --> 01:11:41,076
It won't drop off.

589
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:44,399
But nobody is safe from thieves.

590
01:12:45,160 --> 01:12:47,231
Does your anus still hurt?

591
01:12:49,040 --> 01:12:52,237
A little, but it's getting better.

592
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,230
It shouldn't be torn,

593
01:13:00,800 --> 01:13:04,430
but if it gets worse
put some ointment on it.

594
01:13:11,800 --> 01:13:14,918
Have a look
while I go and fry the fish.

595
01:14:36,280 --> 01:14:38,191
Do you need any help?

596
01:14:38,680 --> 01:14:41,399
Too many cooks spoil the broth.

597
01:14:42,240 --> 01:14:45,756
Sit at the table and nibble.

598
01:15:59,040 --> 01:16:00,360
Your plate.

599
01:16:03,880 --> 01:16:05,837
A little bit.
- More?

600
01:16:33,440 --> 01:16:34,839
<i>Bon appétit.</i>

601
01:16:35,800 --> 01:16:37,359
You too.

602
01:16:55,280 --> 01:16:56,554
It's hot!

603
01:16:56,880 --> 01:16:59,235
It's nice and runny.

604
01:17:15,440 --> 01:17:16,999
Cheap rubbish.

605
01:17:19,240 --> 01:17:22,039
One half of the world
trying to cheat the other.

606
01:17:25,400 --> 01:17:27,516
What a state we're in.

607
01:17:36,760 --> 01:17:39,957
The stars of the Great
and Little Bear are vagrants.

608
01:17:40,920 --> 01:17:44,038
My boyfriend
was also guided by the stars.

609
01:17:46,720 --> 01:17:50,156
If I can't see the North Star,
I'm quite lost.

610
01:17:52,520 --> 01:17:54,830
Is it behind a cloud?

611
01:17:58,160 --> 01:17:59,833
Might be.

612
01:18:00,640 --> 01:18:04,235
Or it's travelled
to another firmament.

613
01:18:05,160 --> 01:18:07,834
If this isn't heaven...

614
01:18:22,560 --> 01:18:25,916
Do you feel in your vagina,
Celestina,

615
01:18:28,080 --> 01:18:30,640
the dampness that precedes love?

616
01:18:30,880 --> 01:18:32,791
Stop it.

617
01:18:33,520 --> 01:18:36,638
How can you read my heart?

618
01:18:41,880 --> 01:18:44,474
There you are!
What about the ice?

619
01:18:47,320 --> 01:18:49,311
It's maturing!

620
01:18:58,760 --> 01:19:00,797
What about the decorations?

621
01:19:01,720 --> 01:19:03,552
Doesn't need any.

622
01:19:04,080 --> 01:19:06,959
Let the Frenchman put them on.

623
01:19:11,240 --> 01:19:14,278
Now it goes
on a chased silver tray,

624
01:19:15,040 --> 01:19:18,670
a superb example
of Judaic-Portuguese workmanship,

625
01:19:20,960 --> 01:19:23,713
a silver spoon

626
01:19:29,520 --> 01:19:32,273
and an embroidered linen napkin.

627
01:19:39,160 --> 01:19:40,719
That's all.

628
01:19:42,920 --> 01:19:45,719
Art has its own rough simplicity.

629
01:19:45,840 --> 01:19:47,592
Is it almost ready?

630
01:19:48,480 --> 01:19:51,154
- It is ready.
- I'll make the introductions.

631
01:19:51,280 --> 01:19:54,796
Address Antoine as "mon cher
Maäitre" and say a few words...

632
01:19:55,640 --> 01:19:57,358
- I'd rather not.
- You have to.

633
01:19:57,480 --> 01:19:58,754
What about us?

634
01:19:58,880 --> 01:20:01,599
Celestina will carry the tray.
You keep the M.P. company.

635
01:20:01,720 --> 01:20:03,677
- What shall I say?
Better not say anything.

636
01:20:03,800 --> 01:20:05,871
Show him your teeth,
they're your best feature.

637
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:07,479
And call him Sir.

638
01:20:07,600 --> 01:20:11,309
Celestina will feed the Canon.
He has Parkinson's disease.

639
01:20:13,040 --> 01:20:16,078
Don't forget to return my dresses
and be careful about spots.

640
01:20:16,200 --> 01:20:18,191
Go on. I'm all uptight.

641
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:21,798
Is this the ice?

642
01:20:24,160 --> 01:20:25,912
Would you like to try it?

643
01:20:26,280 --> 01:20:29,352
You have my confidence.
You're the artist.

644
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:53,799
Look, our guardian angels.

645
01:20:55,880 --> 01:20:58,713
I am sorry that our
Prime Minister could not be here

646
01:20:58,840 --> 01:21:02,071
but he is inaugurating
the most modern morgue in Europe,

647
01:21:02,480 --> 01:21:06,269
with 20,000 cold chambers,

648
01:21:06,840 --> 01:21:08,956
instant freezing.

649
01:21:09,560 --> 01:21:11,597
To modernize life,

650
01:21:11,720 --> 01:21:15,793
one must, first of all,
modernize death.

651
01:21:16,520 --> 01:21:19,831
It is all part
of the same cold network.

652
01:21:21,400 --> 01:21:24,472
Canon Saraiva,
an old friend,

653
01:21:24,760 --> 01:21:27,878
who was kind enough
to come from Braga,

654
01:21:28,040 --> 01:21:30,475
in a precarious state of health,

655
01:21:30,600 --> 01:21:33,160
to bless our ceremony.

656
01:21:33,320 --> 01:21:36,039
One who has blessed bombs,
my dear,

657
01:21:36,160 --> 01:21:39,994
is making no sacrifice in blessing
a delicious ice-cream.

658
01:21:40,200 --> 01:21:41,759
Dr. Cruel,

659
01:21:41,880 --> 01:21:46,351
perhaps the most promising
politician of his generation,

660
01:21:46,680 --> 01:21:49,115
probably
our future Prime Minister.

661
01:21:49,240 --> 01:21:52,676
It's much too early to give credence
to rumours, my dear.

662
01:21:52,800 --> 01:21:55,394
The governing of the country is,

663
01:21:55,520 --> 01:21:57,875
for the time being,
in good hands.

664
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:01,038
<i>- Shut up, pig!</i>
He's bound to be a minister.

665
01:22:01,160 --> 01:22:02,912
The people are right.

666
01:22:04,680 --> 01:22:06,114
<i>Mon cher Maäitre,</i>

667
01:22:06,240 --> 01:22:09,073
here is our our ice man:

668
01:22:09,800 --> 01:22:13,111
Mr. João de Deus
- John of God -

669
01:22:13,280 --> 01:22:16,875
who is going
to say a few words.

670
01:22:19,320 --> 01:22:22,836
Delighted.
I was expecting someone else.

671
01:22:39,360 --> 01:22:41,158
Ladies

672
01:22:43,120 --> 01:22:45,589
and gentlemen.
My esteemed colleague.

673
01:22:47,120 --> 01:22:48,713
I'll be brief

674
01:22:51,400 --> 01:22:55,189
and spare you the story
of tribulations I underwent

675
01:22:55,320 --> 01:22:59,200
and the unexpected
circumstances by which

676
01:23:00,640 --> 01:23:03,393
I became a maker of ices

677
01:23:03,560 --> 01:23:07,190
and, little by little, came to devote
myself to my profession.

678
01:23:09,680 --> 01:23:11,796
I am a man of peace.

679
01:23:13,240 --> 01:23:15,277
Who knows?

680
01:23:15,920 --> 01:23:18,196
I might have been a criminal,

681
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:20,357
a social outcast,

682
01:23:20,600 --> 01:23:25,151
permanently rebelling against
a blind and arbitrary social order.

683
01:23:26,520 --> 01:23:28,158
I don't know.

684
01:23:30,440 --> 01:23:33,353
I know that I could never
be a politician,

685
01:23:33,800 --> 01:23:38,397
and add to the procession of bastards
who use and abuse humanity,

686
01:23:39,480 --> 01:23:44,554
bringing them to their knees,
a state more suited to reptiles.

687
01:23:46,520 --> 01:23:50,434
"You are a reptile,
you'll turn into a reptile"

688
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:57,029
is the logic that ceaselessly leads
to our sad degradation,

689
01:23:58,080 --> 01:24:01,550
as individuals, as a species.

690
01:24:04,880 --> 01:24:07,554
Against the universal fraud,

691
01:24:08,520 --> 01:24:11,319
deep, frozen ices,

692
01:24:11,800 --> 01:24:13,871
my ice,

693
01:24:14,480 --> 01:24:18,553
which contains all the energy
value in the world,

694
01:24:19,120 --> 01:24:22,795
a friendly word, a token of love.

695
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:27,514
Perfection and fantasy.

696
01:24:28,920 --> 01:24:32,629
The final sovereign luxury
of a free man,

697
01:24:33,280 --> 01:24:36,352
who has the supreme courage,

698
01:24:37,080 --> 01:24:41,074
in a country of mediocrities
to exalt life.

699
01:24:43,920 --> 01:24:47,754
I have no recipes,
no magic formulas.

700
01:24:49,520 --> 01:24:53,479
Each ice has its perfume.

701
01:24:54,920 --> 01:24:57,116
Its own perfume.

702
01:24:58,600 --> 01:25:01,433
It is never the same
as the one before,

703
01:25:02,360 --> 01:25:05,671
nor as the one
that comes after.

704
01:25:07,280 --> 01:25:11,638
Though each one
has something to remember:

705
01:25:12,760 --> 01:25:14,717
a journey,

706
01:25:16,480 --> 01:25:18,437
an outing,

707
01:25:19,080 --> 01:25:20,912
a meeting,

708
01:25:22,560 --> 01:25:24,597
a loved one,

709
01:25:26,960 --> 01:25:29,190
the beloved.

710
01:25:30,880 --> 01:25:32,757
My dream,

711
01:25:34,040 --> 01:25:37,271
perhaps unattainable,
is to create a perfume

712
01:25:37,400 --> 01:25:40,995
that will concentrate
all perfumes in one.

713
01:25:42,680 --> 01:25:45,877
Harmoniously
reaching out God,

714
01:25:46,600 --> 01:25:49,513
the quintessencial perfume.

715
01:25:52,520 --> 01:25:56,036
Never betray
the dreams of childhood.

716
01:25:59,400 --> 01:26:02,119
If you open your hearts,

717
01:26:03,960 --> 01:26:06,349
we may try

718
01:26:07,840 --> 01:26:10,593
the final glorious ice.

719
01:26:23,640 --> 01:26:25,677
I wasn't born to hate,

720
01:26:26,160 --> 01:26:29,516
was born to love,
to love you.

721
01:26:31,920 --> 01:26:33,638
I enjoyed that.

722
01:26:33,760 --> 01:26:36,400
Irreverent and opportune.

723
01:26:36,520 --> 01:26:38,875
We must meet again.

724
01:26:39,840 --> 01:26:41,319
Must we?

725
01:26:52,160 --> 01:26:54,356
Romão, the <i>Marseillaise!</i>

726
01:27:58,920 --> 01:28:02,879
Monsieur, your ice, it's shit!

727
01:28:06,280 --> 01:28:08,510
Take away that shit!

728
01:28:15,640 --> 01:28:18,109
I've dug your own grave!

729
01:28:42,560 --> 01:28:44,437
- Any shit?
- Don't worry.

730
01:28:44,560 --> 01:28:47,279
The ice didn't go very well,
but the Frenchman's settled.

731
01:28:48,400 --> 01:28:51,153
He's a bit nervous about the ice.

732
01:28:51,520 --> 01:28:53,158
My brother John.

733
01:28:53,480 --> 01:28:56,996
<i>Morning bells are ringing,
Morning bells are ringing...</i>

734
01:30:09,600 --> 01:30:12,353
I'm coming.

735
01:30:28,880 --> 01:30:30,234
Only to me.

736
01:30:31,760 --> 01:30:33,876
I was having
a wonderful dream.

737
01:30:36,640 --> 01:30:38,597
I've got good news, João.

738
01:30:39,040 --> 01:30:41,111
I'm still half asleep.

739
01:30:42,840 --> 01:30:45,150
| I was worried about you...

740
01:30:46,480 --> 01:30:48,676
There's nothing here to steal.

741
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:51,355
Not even three pubic hairs...?

742
01:30:58,360 --> 01:31:00,397
I'm dying of thirst.

743
01:31:00,600 --> 01:31:03,353
Do you want tea or anything?

744
01:31:03,640 --> 01:31:05,597
I'd love some tea.

745
01:31:25,120 --> 01:31:27,396
An honourable man
has no ears...

746
01:31:48,800 --> 01:31:50,552
It's already sugared.

747
01:31:55,440 --> 01:31:58,034
It tastes peculiar.
- It's ginger.

748
01:32:01,160 --> 01:32:03,720
You've got into
Deputy Cruel's good books.

749
01:32:04,160 --> 01:32:06,754
He wants to invite you
to a cat shoot.

750
01:32:07,800 --> 01:32:10,110
I'd rather not go.
I don't know how to hunt cats.

751
01:32:10,240 --> 01:32:11,753
You don't have to.

752
01:32:11,880 --> 01:32:14,520
Just keep the guns company.

753
01:32:15,200 --> 01:32:17,794
I'm not good company.
I'd rather be on my own.

754
01:32:17,920 --> 01:32:22,039
Dr. Cruel has an estate where stray
cats get up to disgusting things.

755
01:32:22,840 --> 01:32:24,831
Instead of having them poisoned,

756
01:32:24,960 --> 01:32:28,794
he organizes shoots
for his friends.

757
01:32:30,840 --> 01:32:34,117
Last time they shot a cat
that was giving birth.

758
01:32:34,320 --> 01:32:38,109
Giving birth is risky,
specially on Deputy Cruel's estate.

759
01:32:38,680 --> 01:32:40,990
I don't like eating cat
dressed up as rabbit.

760
01:32:41,120 --> 01:32:43,680
The cats may be diseased.
They're not for eating.

761
01:32:43,840 --> 01:32:46,593
Do you think Cruel
needs to eat cats?

762
01:32:47,560 --> 01:32:50,074
That mob's got the stomach
for anything.

763
01:32:50,200 --> 01:32:53,716
Stop pretending you're a Communist.
We've been over that before.

764
01:32:54,320 --> 01:32:55,879
Me?

765
01:32:56,120 --> 01:32:58,509
My policy is ice-cream.

766
01:32:58,640 --> 01:33:01,154
Everybody loved your ice-cream.

767
01:33:01,280 --> 01:33:03,476
They were crying for more.

768
01:33:03,680 --> 01:33:06,911
Which means
I'm not going to be fired.

769
01:33:07,600 --> 01:33:09,511
This is how history is made.

770
01:33:09,640 --> 01:33:12,712
Everybody realized that Frenchman
was up to something.

771
01:33:13,040 --> 01:33:15,475
He's been sent packing.

772
01:33:15,840 --> 01:33:19,037
If envy were a fever,
mankind would be ill.

773
01:33:19,160 --> 01:33:21,595
You should've heard the Deputy,

774
01:33:21,720 --> 01:33:23,870
he even went back
to the French invasions.

775
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:25,479
Antoine said nothing.

776
01:33:25,600 --> 01:33:28,718
He ran off
with his tail between his legs.

777
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:31,037
How lucky I was.

778
01:33:32,400 --> 01:33:35,552
- All's well that ends well.
- The best is yet to come.

779
01:33:36,840 --> 01:33:40,799
The Canon remembered that,
among his properties,

780
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:45,197
is an old tavern,
near the cathedral in Braga.

781
01:33:45,320 --> 01:33:47,277
Are you following me?
-I am.

782
01:33:48,560 --> 01:33:52,997
With the blessing of the prelate,
Hell will be turned into Paradise.

783
01:33:53,120 --> 01:33:55,157
It's in the centre

784
01:33:55,480 --> 01:33:58,472
and is always busy,
thanks to the pilgrims.

785
01:33:59,080 --> 01:34:02,835
You'll be the heart and soul
of this new branch.

786
01:34:33,520 --> 01:34:35,397
I am a man of peace.

787
01:34:38,320 --> 01:34:40,994
A toast
to my return to Paradise.

788
01:34:48,040 --> 01:34:49,838
Don't forget, Virgínia,

789
01:34:50,360 --> 01:34:52,874
one day you too
will be a mother.

790
01:34:55,240 --> 01:34:57,470
Tomorrow we start the lessons.

791
01:34:57,600 --> 01:35:00,672
If you go on like this,
I shall have to leave.

792
01:35:00,920 --> 01:35:02,672
Go on like what?

793
01:35:02,800 --> 01:35:04,632
I can't reciprocate.

794
01:35:04,760 --> 01:35:07,434
Don't reciprocate!
What's the fuss about?

795
01:35:07,560 --> 01:35:09,358
I don't care.

796
01:35:11,080 --> 01:35:14,198
You're old
and I'm still young.

797
01:35:16,480 --> 01:35:18,357
I never learn.

798
01:35:19,960 --> 01:35:22,839
Finally someone
has told me the truth.

799
01:35:23,680 --> 01:35:25,637
I swear on my mother's grave

800
01:35:25,760 --> 01:35:29,469
I shall live the rest of my days
according to my age.

801
01:35:31,920 --> 01:35:33,718
Thank you, Virgínia.

802
01:35:33,880 --> 01:35:38,113
I didn't mean to hurt you.
Age doesn't matter at all.

803
01:35:39,160 --> 01:35:42,312
Yes, it does Virgínia,
it matters a lot.

804
01:35:42,440 --> 01:35:45,637
- I've never been with a man.
- Oh, no?

805
01:35:47,920 --> 01:35:51,072
Well, there are things
which are more complicated:

806
01:35:51,640 --> 01:35:55,554
a square root,
splitting the atom,

807
01:35:56,880 --> 01:35:59,349
ascending Mount Everest...

808
01:36:00,440 --> 01:36:02,397
I've given kisses before

809
01:36:02,600 --> 01:36:05,991
and between the legs too.
But inside never.

810
01:36:07,400 --> 01:36:10,438
When a young woman presents
genital parts

811
01:36:10,560 --> 01:36:14,713
that are hard, firm, brilliant
and scarlet in colour,

812
01:36:15,680 --> 01:36:18,274
the vulva labia
close together,

813
01:36:18,400 --> 01:36:20,835
the nympha
small and covered,

814
01:36:20,960 --> 01:36:23,554
the clitoris
with a short prepuce,

815
01:36:23,680 --> 01:36:27,071
the folds of the vagina
prominent and close together,

816
01:36:27,280 --> 01:36:29,669
mucuous membrane deep,

817
01:36:29,800 --> 01:36:33,680
the vaginal orifice and the
vulva-uterine passage very narrow,

818
01:36:34,080 --> 01:36:36,594
and the hymen intact,

819
01:36:36,960 --> 01:36:41,431
it must be said that the signs of
physical virginity are unmistakeable.

820
01:36:43,160 --> 01:36:47,154
Oh God! Why don't you hurl
tongues of fire down upon me?

821
01:37:43,520 --> 01:37:45,272
I want three flavours:

822
01:37:45,400 --> 01:37:49,314
Besame Mucho, Cuore Ingrato
and Paradise.

823
01:37:51,280 --> 01:37:53,396
We're out of Paradise,

824
01:37:54,560 --> 01:37:57,871
but Vaya con Dios
is almost as good.

825
01:38:14,440 --> 01:38:16,954
If you don't like it
you don't have to pay.

826
01:38:22,920 --> 01:38:25,799
Don't I have to pay
at the cash desk first?

827
01:38:30,880 --> 01:38:32,951
Only on rush hours

828
01:38:38,080 --> 01:38:41,118
and this isn't exactly rush hour.

829
01:38:50,680 --> 01:38:52,751
This is my favourite.

830
01:38:53,560 --> 01:38:56,598
It depends on personal taste,
but I agree.

831
01:38:57,080 --> 01:38:59,390
Nobody leaves dissatisfied.

832
01:39:05,080 --> 01:39:08,038
I once saw you in your pyjamas.

833
01:39:16,760 --> 01:39:19,912
In my pyjamas? I don't think...

834
01:39:21,320 --> 01:39:22,879
In the street.

835
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:26,675
I was at the butcher's
and I saw you in your pyjamas.

836
01:39:27,640 --> 01:39:30,280
Yes, I vaguely remember.

837
01:39:30,640 --> 01:39:34,235
When they turned off
the electricity by mistake.

838
01:39:34,560 --> 01:39:37,757
I don't know about that.
It was still daytime.

839
01:39:38,640 --> 01:39:40,597
Don't tell me you're...

840
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:44,914
I'm Joaninha, the youngest
daughter of Evaristo, the butcher.

841
01:39:54,160 --> 01:39:55,912
I'd never have guessed!

842
01:39:56,720 --> 01:39:59,109
Joaninha with the green eyes.

843
01:39:59,800 --> 01:40:02,519
They're not green, they're brown.

844
01:40:02,880 --> 01:40:05,235
They're green in this light.

845
01:40:05,480 --> 01:40:07,676
Little emeralds.

846
01:40:08,160 --> 01:40:10,595
Your eyes are blue...

847
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:13,310
They were, they were...

848
01:40:13,480 --> 01:40:17,872
It's the grace of God that gives
them their last celestial glow...

849
01:40:20,480 --> 01:40:24,394
- How old are you Joaninha?
- I'm nearly fifteen. How old are you?

850
01:40:24,840 --> 01:40:26,956
I'm past fifty.

851
01:40:27,560 --> 01:40:31,076
-You're older than my father.
- I am, am I?

852
01:40:32,480 --> 01:40:36,075
I don't worry about age.
One day I'll be old too.

853
01:40:36,240 --> 01:40:38,516
I shouldn't worry about that yet.

854
01:40:39,360 --> 01:40:41,556
I've got to be going now.

855
01:40:42,280 --> 01:40:44,635
How much was that?
- It's on the house.

856
01:40:44,840 --> 01:40:47,878
No way. I've got the money.

857
01:40:48,320 --> 01:40:50,550
If my father found out
he'd kill me.

858
01:40:50,680 --> 01:40:53,718
He wouldn't give his customers
a drop of water.

859
01:41:05,080 --> 01:41:07,469
Every country has its customs.

860
01:41:08,440 --> 01:41:11,956
Drop by any time.
I'm always here.

861
01:41:12,680 --> 01:41:14,751
It's a long way,

862
01:41:15,440 --> 01:41:17,590
but I'd like to.

863
01:41:17,760 --> 01:41:21,037
Drop in at my house then.
That's only a couple of minutes...

864
01:41:21,440 --> 01:41:24,876
I can't now.
I'm going to the cinema.

865
01:41:26,120 --> 01:41:28,430
Later tonight perhaps.

866
01:41:29,640 --> 01:41:31,551
Tonight?

867
01:41:33,720 --> 01:41:36,189
Won't your father mind?

868
01:41:36,320 --> 01:41:38,789
Tonight he's going
to slaughter some animals.

869
01:41:38,920 --> 01:41:40,399
He'll be back in the morning.

870
01:41:40,520 --> 01:41:45,037
Me and my sisters have to help him
put brands on the animals.

871
01:41:46,840 --> 01:41:48,751
But, isn't that illegal?

872
01:41:48,880 --> 01:41:51,235
Yes, but the meat's just as good

873
01:41:51,360 --> 01:41:53,158
and cheaper.

874
01:41:53,360 --> 01:41:57,115
My father says, "What doesn't kill you
makes you fat."

875
01:41:59,480 --> 01:42:01,437
He should know.

876
01:42:02,840 --> 01:42:04,513
Really...

877
01:42:05,160 --> 01:42:07,231
One microbe more...

878
01:42:07,480 --> 01:42:09,790
one microbe less...

879
01:42:10,160 --> 01:42:13,232
won't save us
from our final rest.

880
01:42:15,280 --> 01:42:17,078
Ten o'clock?

881
01:42:17,400 --> 01:42:19,835
That's all right by me.

882
01:42:22,160 --> 01:42:25,835
Right then, ten o'clock sharp.

883
01:42:27,120 --> 01:42:31,193
<i>I'll be waiting for you at ten...</i>

884
01:42:32,320 --> 01:42:34,550
It's an old song...

885
01:42:34,680 --> 01:42:36,990
I like the old ways.

886
01:42:37,520 --> 01:42:39,511
All the better.

887
01:42:40,320 --> 01:42:43,517
I saw you like sweets

888
01:42:43,640 --> 01:42:45,631
when you smiled.

889
01:42:45,760 --> 01:42:48,070
I've got the sweetest tooth
of the three of us.

890
01:42:48,200 --> 01:42:50,669
They're always telling me off.

891
01:42:51,120 --> 01:42:53,714
It's for your own good.

892
01:42:55,360 --> 01:42:57,033
For your own good.

893
01:42:57,160 --> 01:43:00,152
I know, but if you don't overdo...

894
01:43:06,480 --> 01:43:09,552
Take this Vaya con Dios
for the road.

895
01:43:14,560 --> 01:43:17,951
I'll close my eyes
so no one will see.

896
01:43:25,480 --> 01:43:27,915
Pity I didn't get to try Paradise.

897
01:43:28,040 --> 01:43:30,236
There'll be other occasions.

898
01:43:31,440 --> 01:43:33,716
Perhaps... who knows?

899
01:44:09,080 --> 01:44:10,912
Sixty packets.

900
01:44:14,200 --> 01:44:15,952
That's 8,400.

901
01:44:33,200 --> 01:44:36,716
Is it to help starving children
in Mozambique?

902
01:44:37,520 --> 01:44:39,477
We've got to help one another.

903
01:44:39,640 --> 01:44:42,951
People are selfish nowadays.

904
01:44:44,280 --> 01:44:46,476
Being here all day

905
01:44:46,600 --> 01:44:49,433
can't do your varicose veins
any good.

906
01:44:49,560 --> 01:44:52,552
That's a fact,
but what's to be done?

907
01:49:32,440 --> 01:49:36,115
I've brought you some pork.
Roasted with butter,

908
01:49:36,440 --> 01:49:38,954
it's nice for breakfast.

909
01:49:51,880 --> 01:49:53,917
Thank you, Joaninha.

910
01:49:54,120 --> 01:49:55,918
You spoil me.

911
01:49:57,640 --> 01:50:00,439
You'd probably rather
have had a leg.

912
01:50:00,640 --> 01:50:02,551
The leg?

913
01:50:02,840 --> 01:50:04,558
No.

914
01:50:08,040 --> 01:50:10,919
The crackling
has more taste.

915
01:50:11,320 --> 01:50:14,119
I've salted it just right.

916
01:50:20,120 --> 01:50:22,999
Tomorrow I'll tell you
how it rated.

917
01:50:55,200 --> 01:50:56,838
I'll be back

918
01:50:57,080 --> 01:50:59,071
before you know it.

919
01:53:18,640 --> 01:53:20,790
You've got
a lovely place here.

920
01:53:20,920 --> 01:53:23,116
The conquests of April.

921
01:53:25,200 --> 01:53:26,918
It's lovely.

922
01:53:27,280 --> 01:53:29,078
Is it for me?

923
01:53:29,280 --> 01:53:32,238
It came specially
from the land of the rising sun

924
01:53:32,440 --> 01:53:35,353
to the land of the setting sun.

925
01:53:36,120 --> 01:53:39,431
Put it on
for the champagne ceremony.

926
01:53:41,320 --> 01:53:43,516
What ceremony is that?

927
01:53:43,680 --> 01:53:47,674
So you'll feel comfortable,
no standing on ceremony here.

928
01:53:51,920 --> 01:53:53,479
All right.

929
01:54:28,160 --> 01:54:31,391
Their delicate curves
point up to heaven.

930
01:54:33,440 --> 01:54:35,113
Is that good?

931
01:54:35,560 --> 01:54:37,676
Shouldn't it be so?

932
01:54:38,040 --> 01:54:40,236
They're seeking sanctity.

933
01:59:16,440 --> 01:59:18,033
<i>Abonbon?</i>

934
01:59:23,560 --> 01:59:25,153
With filling?

935
01:59:27,560 --> 01:59:29,471
How do I know?

936
01:59:51,360 --> 01:59:52,953
It's good.

937
01:59:53,920 --> 01:59:55,593
No,

938
01:59:57,160 --> 01:59:59,071
it's <i>bon-bon.</i>

939
02:00:24,880 --> 02:00:27,156
Good for the drops.

940
02:00:30,400 --> 02:00:32,676
I feel very relaxed.

941
02:00:35,840 --> 02:00:39,834
You'd feel even better
if you softened your skin with a bath.

942
02:00:41,640 --> 02:00:44,109
I've already had a bath.

943
02:00:45,680 --> 02:00:48,559
But not a milk bath, Joaninha,

944
02:00:49,120 --> 02:00:51,157
not a milk bath.

945
02:00:58,720 --> 02:01:00,597
The bath is ready.

946
02:01:04,120 --> 02:01:06,031
Go, my child,

947
02:01:07,680 --> 02:01:10,798
while I seek you
on the Milky Way.

948
02:04:10,040 --> 02:04:11,314
Who is it?

949
02:04:11,640 --> 02:04:13,358
It's Esther.

950
02:04:14,120 --> 02:04:16,270
Sorry to bother you
at this time of night,

951
02:04:16,400 --> 02:04:18,960
but have you got some parsley?

952
02:04:19,080 --> 02:04:22,835
I'm making fishcakes
and they're not nice without parsley.

953
02:04:25,240 --> 02:04:27,390
I went to the corner shop

954
02:04:27,520 --> 02:04:30,672
but somebody had taken the last.

955
02:04:37,320 --> 02:04:39,118
I don't know
what things are coming to.

956
02:04:39,240 --> 02:04:40,992
The place was cleaned out.

957
02:05:03,080 --> 02:05:04,912
But this is a turnip!

958
02:05:05,600 --> 02:05:07,273
It's all I have.

959
02:05:10,320 --> 02:05:12,994
The top chopped up
has many uses.

960
02:05:13,120 --> 02:05:14,713
In fishcakes?

961
02:05:38,200 --> 02:05:39,520
May I?

962
02:05:40,840 --> 02:05:42,478
As it's you.

963
02:06:08,280 --> 02:06:09,953
I came to see you.

964
02:06:11,800 --> 02:06:14,553
I was afraid
you'd drowned.

965
02:06:17,320 --> 02:06:18,833
It's great.

966
02:06:20,960 --> 02:06:23,713
I could stay here
the rest of my life.

967
02:06:28,440 --> 02:06:30,477
You can't.

968
02:06:35,120 --> 02:06:37,919
Don't forget milk turns sour.

969
02:06:40,520 --> 02:06:42,750
Then make cheese out of it...

970
02:06:43,760 --> 02:06:46,320
An answer for everything.

971
02:06:52,720 --> 02:06:56,475
<i>Joaninha - ladybird - fly, fly!</i>

972
02:06:57,800 --> 02:07:00,474
<i>Fly away home...</i>

973
02:07:03,960 --> 02:07:07,351
This milk isn't going
to be thrown away.

974
02:07:07,760 --> 02:07:09,398
No?

975
02:07:10,920 --> 02:07:16,279
I'm going to make an ice-cream
of it with your marvellous perfume.

976
02:07:17,840 --> 02:07:20,150
Joaninha ice-cream.

977
02:07:21,560 --> 02:07:24,518
<i>Ladybird, fly away home!</i>

978
02:07:26,600 --> 02:07:28,671
Milk and honey!

979
02:07:29,200 --> 02:07:31,111
Milk and honey!

980
02:07:55,000 --> 02:07:56,718
Oh! Not there.

981
02:07:57,400 --> 02:07:59,914
You're making me want to pee.

982
02:08:00,560 --> 02:08:02,471
Do it in the bath.

983
02:08:03,680 --> 02:08:05,956
Let it flow.

984
02:08:06,840 --> 02:08:08,877
Isn't that dirty?

985
02:08:13,640 --> 02:08:15,358
Dirty?

986
02:08:19,480 --> 02:08:21,391
The right amount

987
02:08:21,880 --> 02:08:26,556
of bitterness and patriotism
needed that to attain perfection.

988
02:08:28,680 --> 02:08:32,469
Shed the stellar rain

989
02:08:32,760 --> 02:08:36,390
of your lustral urine
upon my head.

990
02:08:38,960 --> 02:08:40,951
You frightened me!

991
02:08:41,920 --> 02:08:44,389
I only did a few drops.

992
02:08:50,920 --> 02:08:52,718
I slipped.

993
02:10:59,280 --> 02:11:01,669
It must be good.
What is it?

994
02:11:02,720 --> 02:11:04,518
Is it Paradise?

995
02:12:26,400 --> 02:12:28,550
I've never tasted
anything so good.

996
02:12:30,200 --> 02:12:32,237
Want a spoonful?

997
02:12:33,800 --> 02:12:35,757
It's all for you.

998
02:13:32,880 --> 02:13:34,712
I'm all sticky.

999
02:14:35,200 --> 02:14:38,158
I stole a piece of Paradise.

1000
02:14:56,440 --> 02:14:58,351
What's the matter?

1001
02:14:59,400 --> 02:15:01,596
I've eaten too much.

1002
02:15:02,000 --> 02:15:04,071
I don't feel well.

1003
02:15:05,600 --> 02:15:07,989
Would you like some tea?

1004
02:15:09,080 --> 02:15:11,833
What an awful tummyache!

1005
02:15:17,800 --> 02:15:21,953
You're going to fart a lot,
but it'll go away.

1006
02:15:41,440 --> 02:15:43,431
Come and sit here.

1007
02:15:49,320 --> 02:15:51,357
On top of those eggs?

1008
02:15:51,760 --> 02:15:53,273
Won't they break?

1009
02:15:53,400 --> 02:15:56,597
They'll break
but it's a sovereign remedy.

1010
02:15:57,960 --> 02:15:59,792
I didn't know.

1011
02:16:29,600 --> 02:16:32,592
The virtues of ancient
medical arts.

1012
02:16:33,480 --> 02:16:35,676
Are you feeling better?

1013
02:16:40,840 --> 02:16:43,753
I feel as if I'm hatching chicks.

1014
02:16:48,920 --> 02:16:51,594
It's your maternal instinct.

1015
02:16:59,280 --> 02:17:01,510
I'm laying so many eggs.

1016
02:17:27,800 --> 02:17:29,916
You're the mother hen

1017
02:17:32,280 --> 02:17:34,590
and I'm the cock

1018
02:17:35,480 --> 02:17:38,598
who's going to mate with you,
little chick.

1019
02:18:05,920 --> 02:18:08,560
The only one that didn't break.

1020
02:18:09,280 --> 02:18:11,396
What does that mean?

1021
02:18:12,160 --> 02:18:13,992
Nothing.

1022
02:18:16,000 --> 02:18:18,355
Fry it if you like.

1023
02:18:19,840 --> 02:18:21,877
The pain's back.

1024
02:18:24,880 --> 02:18:26,632
I'm all sticky.

1025
02:18:27,760 --> 02:18:30,400
Can I go to the bathroom?

1026
02:19:24,800 --> 02:19:26,996
Shall I save the caca?

1027
02:19:30,320 --> 02:19:33,517
No. Too much of anything smells.

1028
02:19:40,680 --> 02:19:44,116
"A soft and pious glance;

1029
02:19:45,320 --> 02:19:48,199
"a gentle, honest smile;

1030
02:19:49,120 --> 02:19:52,875
"a sweet and humble gesture
of uncertain guile;

1031
02:19:53,680 --> 02:19:56,593
"a quiet, ashamed vivacity;

1032
02:19:56,920 --> 02:19:59,912
"such grave and modest repose;

1033
02:20:00,120 --> 02:20:04,318
"a pure, tender-heartedness,
sign of a clear, gracious soul;

1034
02:20:05,640 --> 02:20:07,756
"a timid audacity,

1035
02:20:07,880 --> 02:20:09,518
"meekness,

1036
02:20:09,640 --> 02:20:11,790
"fear without guilt,

1037
02:20:11,920 --> 02:20:13,513
"air serene,

1038
02:20:13,640 --> 02:20:16,439
"long and obedient pain;

1039
02:20:17,440 --> 02:20:20,751
"this was the celestial beauty
of my Circe,

1040
02:20:20,920 --> 02:20:24,595
"the magic venom
that transforms my thoughts."

1041
02:20:30,800 --> 02:20:33,314
the magic venom

1042
02:20:34,480 --> 02:20:37,438
that transforms my thoughts."

1043
02:27:24,560 --> 02:27:26,631
Take your trousers down.

1044
02:27:44,160 --> 02:27:46,754
Take your trousers down.

1045
02:27:47,520 --> 02:27:49,511
I'd prefer not to.

1046
02:27:51,640 --> 02:27:54,473
Take them down,
for your own good...

1047
02:27:55,160 --> 02:27:58,710
You talk tough,
with that shit in your hand.

1048
02:28:03,200 --> 02:28:07,239
I don't want to dirty my hands
on a load of shit like you.

1049
02:29:48,400 --> 02:29:50,118
Not even a puff?

1050
02:31:04,080 --> 02:31:06,196
He won't last the night.

1051
02:31:10,920 --> 02:31:13,309
That's what you think.

1052
02:33:06,040 --> 02:33:08,600
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

1053
02:33:12,440 --> 02:33:14,397
What's your name?

1054
02:33:14,560 --> 02:33:16,278
My name's Mimi.

1055
02:33:26,840 --> 02:33:28,956
Don't you have
Paradise any more?

1056
02:33:29,440 --> 02:33:31,590
Never heard of it.

1057
02:33:31,920 --> 02:33:33,479
I'm new here.

1058
02:33:38,080 --> 02:33:40,799
Does Judite
still own the place?

1059
02:33:41,160 --> 02:33:43,993
As far as I know.
Judite and Mr. Scardanelli.

1060
02:33:44,120 --> 02:33:45,918
How many flavours?

1061
02:33:46,200 --> 02:33:47,918
What do you suggest?

1062
02:33:48,040 --> 02:33:50,395
I never tell customers
their tastes.

1063
02:33:50,520 --> 02:33:53,831
The speciality is Scardanelli,
with egg strings.

1064
02:33:54,920 --> 02:33:56,957
Just vanilla then.

1065
02:33:57,560 --> 02:33:59,836
That's 230 escudos.

1066
02:34:10,040 --> 02:34:11,519
Thank you.

1067
02:34:18,160 --> 02:34:20,197
Do you want a dish or a cone?

1068
02:34:20,520 --> 02:34:22,079
A cone.

1069
02:34:31,400 --> 02:34:32,799
Thank you.

1070
02:34:38,600 --> 02:34:41,114
I'll try the salmonella next time.

1071
02:34:41,720 --> 02:34:44,314
I don't want to go back
to hospital yet.

1072
02:34:45,040 --> 02:34:47,919
Our ices are reputed
to be the best in the country.

1073
02:34:48,040 --> 02:34:52,113
They come direct from Italy and
conform to safety EEC's regulations.

1074
02:34:54,720 --> 02:34:57,838
Does that mean they've closed
the factory in Benfica?

1075
02:34:59,320 --> 02:35:00,913
A solemn warning,

1076
02:35:01,040 --> 02:35:04,032
this person is never
to darken this doorstep again.

1077
02:35:04,360 --> 02:35:08,558
Leave immediately. I never want
to see you around here again.

1078
02:35:11,640 --> 02:35:13,551
Without even giving me notice?

1079
02:35:13,680 --> 02:35:16,115
Your notice was sent
to you in good time

1080
02:35:16,240 --> 02:35:18,675
and for good reason.
- I never got it.

1081
02:35:18,960 --> 02:35:20,758
Leaving the job without a word,

1082
02:35:20,880 --> 02:35:23,474
immoral behaviour
with both staff and customers,

1083
02:35:23,680 --> 02:35:25,717
abuse of trust,

1084
02:35:26,080 --> 02:35:29,596
practices of singularly
unwholesome falsification,

1085
02:35:29,800 --> 02:35:32,918
harmful both to public health
and our good reputation.

1086
02:35:33,040 --> 02:35:34,997
Shall I go on?

1087
02:35:35,120 --> 02:35:36,315
My good man,

1088
02:35:36,440 --> 02:35:39,159
you're lucky
I'm not taking it further.

1089
02:35:40,280 --> 02:35:43,159
I fed and clothed this creature.

1090
02:35:43,960 --> 02:35:46,952
I did the best for him.

1091
02:35:47,160 --> 02:35:50,915
When he first came here in rags
it was enough to break your heart.

1092
02:35:51,080 --> 02:35:53,913
I felt sorry for him
but I was too soft.

1093
02:35:54,040 --> 02:35:55,633
This is how he paid me back.

1094
02:35:55,760 --> 02:35:58,513
Tore the arse
of my best employee,

1095
02:35:58,640 --> 02:36:00,199
a poor orphan,

1096
02:36:00,320 --> 02:36:02,834
just up from the boondocks,

1097
02:36:03,160 --> 02:36:05,595
who cried her heart out
in my arms.

1098
02:36:05,720 --> 02:36:08,712
Fortunately she's in Finland,
with a friend of mine

1099
02:36:08,840 --> 02:36:11,275
who left his wife
and daughters for her.

1100
02:36:12,120 --> 02:36:13,793
A good girl, Rosarinho.

1101
02:36:13,920 --> 02:36:16,309
Then he got involved
with a child,

1102
02:36:17,160 --> 02:36:18,992
caused a lot of talk,

1103
02:36:19,120 --> 02:36:20,713
a scandal.

1104
02:36:20,840 --> 02:36:23,150
Girl's father heard about it,

1105
02:36:23,280 --> 02:36:26,398
he took the law
into his own hands,

1106
02:36:26,800 --> 02:36:28,711
and beat this fellow up.

1107
02:36:28,840 --> 02:36:30,399
Bless him!

1108
02:36:30,520 --> 02:36:32,875
A pity you're still alive!

1109
02:36:33,000 --> 02:36:36,152
Had it been me,
I'd have strangled you.

1110
02:36:36,280 --> 02:36:39,079
Killed you like a mad dog.

1111
02:36:40,360 --> 02:36:42,078
He's sick,

1112
02:36:42,720 --> 02:36:45,314
a sexual pervert.

1113
02:36:45,920 --> 02:36:49,356
He even drools
when he eats ice-cream.

1114
02:36:55,560 --> 02:36:57,915
You're not getting rid of me,

1115
02:36:58,160 --> 02:37:00,515
I am condemning you to stay.

1116
02:40:07,520 --> 02:40:10,080
