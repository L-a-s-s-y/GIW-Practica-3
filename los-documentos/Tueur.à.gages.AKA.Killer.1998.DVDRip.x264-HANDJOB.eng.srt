KILLER

Directed by:
Deredzhan Omirbaev

"God doesn't exist
in an age of change"

4
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,430
Ancient Chinese wisdom

5
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,740
We can begin.

6
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,764
Dear listeners,
Your Own Time

7
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:21,412
brings you now
our regular feature

8
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,169
"Guest of Honor".

9
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:28,719
Our guest today is a member of
the Academy of Sciences,

10
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:32,463
research director at the
Institute of Mathematics,

11
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:36,719
doctor of mathematics,
Professor Kassymov.

12
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,200
Here's my first question,
Mr. Kassymov.

13
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,226
Is it difficult to be
a scientist nowadays?

14
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,491
Are you waiting for someone?

15
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:45,253
For my boss. I'm a chauffeur.

16
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,857
He's here for an interview.

17
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,504
Thank you, that's fine.

18
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:57,599
Indeed, haute couture is unbelievable.

19
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,648
So you prefer haute couture...

20
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:04,974
It's much prettier

21
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,376
and of course, it requires a lot of work.

22
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:12,740
Hours of work go into a dress

23
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:15,957
before it can be put on show.

24
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:24,883
- Is that the way out?
- Thank you.

25
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,606
- Which is the way out?
- That way. - Thank you.

26
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:47,419
- Where's the way out?
- Over there. - Thank you.

27
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,120
That way.

28
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,371
Thank you.

29
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,118
- Where's the way out?
- That way. - Thanks.

30
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:26,082
The troubles of our day reside
less in material problems,

31
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:30,017
my colleagues, for example
haven't been paid for 6 months,

32
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:33,136
than in psychological problems.

33
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:37,726
In fact, all our moral
guidelines have disappeared.

34
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:42,677
Hence this feeling of inconstancy
and instability in our lives.

35
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:47,283
No one knows any more what
tomorrow will bring,

36
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:51,068
as the pace of change is so rapid.

37
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,975
Nothing around us stable any more.

38
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:58,670
Working hours, weekends, vacations,
wages, futureplans for one's profession,

39
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:02,446
nothing makes sense,
and it seems to me,

40
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:06,475
it can't carry on
like this much longer.

41
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:11,401
We can't all become
speculators or shopkeepers.

42
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:15,451
Someone has to produce things.

43
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:19,746
It's hard to work properly when
everything is collapsing around you.

44
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:24,333
The great ideals are abandoned
and they can be stolen without risk.

45
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:27,261
If I don't steal,
someone else will.

46
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:31,812
This is called the primitive
accumulation of the capital.

47
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:35,556
Berik Karakoulovitch,
let's tackle a more concrete subject.

48
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,001
Science, a domain
in which you excel.

49
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:44,159
We know that many scientific
centers today are closing

50
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,321
or are in danger of closing.

51
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:51,349
So my question may seem brutal
but it has to be asked.

52
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,023
What's the point of science

53
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:59,825
in a country where almost all adults,
as you said, live of commerce?

54
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,049
You're free, Marat.

55
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:12,076
Go to the maternity.

56
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,741
Is it a boy or a girl?

57
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,722
A son. Good.

58
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:18,098
Be here at five, as usual.

59
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,742
Thank you, Berik Karakoulovitch.

60
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:36,259
- Hello.
- Hello, Tasmira Moukatovna.

61
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,362
- After you...
- Thank you.

62
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,283
You'll see him at home.

63
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,963
You'll see him at home.

64
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:59,030
Have you thought of a name?

65
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:03,447
I tried, but I couldn't find one.

66
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,156
They say he takes after me

67
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,088
I think he's more like you.

68
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:12,544
Let me see him again.

69
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,680
Don't say you're
not in the wrong.

70
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:58,058
Do I call the cops?

71
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,642
I couldn't brake in time.

72
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,961
Give me your ID.

73
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:04,853
Marat, what if we sold the apartment?

74
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:08,817
It would pay for the
repair of the two cars.

75
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:13,477
Know what it's like changing
apartments all the time here.

76
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:34,264
We have to go see the
family and ask their advice.

77
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,769
Go see Aunt Saoule

78
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:41,013
she's your sister after all.

79
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,655
Hi Aibek,
is your mom home?

80
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,815
What's up?

81
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:07,873
Aibek?

82
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:28,811
What're you doing?

83
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,916
Get back to your room.

84
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,632
Serik, what happened?

85
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:42,211
Ask your sister! She'll tell you.

86
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:53,090
We were ripped off. A month ago

87
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:57,599
I put our money in a trust and
now we learned they were crooks.

88
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:01,536
We? You gave them
the money, you moron.

89
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:05,530
You knew what I was doing
and you didn't stop me.

90
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:08,120
Don't you think at your age?

91
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:12,045
Why do I have to tell you
what to do?

92
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,640
I'm sick of looking
after you. Idiot.

93
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,726
- That's enough now.
- Marat...

94
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:09,766
Listen Marat.

95
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:12,604
I know people who lend
money with interest.

96
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:18,225
- But at what rate?
- I think it's 1% per day.

97
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:23,517
That's 30% per month.

98
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,603
That are the rates.

99
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:31,494
But it will help you
to come through.

100
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,138
Think so?

101
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,959
Don't care about tomorrow.

102
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,436
You've got a visitor. Who?

103
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:18,952
What do we do, Marat?

104
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:21,778
The garage called me today.

105
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,197
The car's ready
but they want their money.

106
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:27,937
You time's up, you know

107
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,002
I don't have it yet.

108
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,661
That's what I thought.

109
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:37,606
Unfortunately,
I can't wait any longer.

110
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:42,737
I need my car, to go to work,
everyday.

111
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:44,738
Hi Marat.

112
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:47,601
Hi Oleg.

113
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:52,072
- Am I late?
- No. What's with your eye?

114
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:57,371
- I banged it. - That's what I thought.
Let me introduce you.

115
00:30:57,400 --> 00:31:00,312
Marat.
Erjan Chakenovitch.

116
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:03,060
He can help with the money.

117
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:10,147
Oleg explained things.
If you're serious, let's go.

118
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:58,679
Marat! Where did you and Oleg serve?

119
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:03,166
Karelia, in Petrozavodsk.

120
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:05,471
That's far away.

121
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:07,556
In which division?

122
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:09,307
Inland.

123
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:14,740
I served in East Germany
a long time ago.

124
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,813
Those were the days.

125
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:29,518
Heard the one about the new Kazakhs?

126
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:31,559
No.

127
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:35,249
Nazarbaiev tells the new Kazakhs.

128
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:38,483
Our invaluable brains
and arms have gone.

129
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:40,545
Only your gold teeth remain.

130
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:41,988
Bravo.

131
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:55,915
Hello.

132
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:58,361
What?

133
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,257
Hello.

134
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:01,845
Oh hello.

135
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:24,805
Here's the money you asked for.

136
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:27,538
Oleg said you know
the conditions.

137
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:29,148
There you are.

138
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:45,979
- Thanks. You're doing me a big favor.
- Don't mention it.

139
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:50,674
If I need you, I'll call.

140
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:09,468
Sorry, I had no choice.

141
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:15,038
These days, it's the only thing
people understand.

142
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:18,673
Let's shake hands.

143
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:46,084
What happened?

144
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:49,590
Berik Karakoulovitch
killed himself in his office.

145
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:50,745
What?

146
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:52,924
Didn't you know?

147
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:57,416
They closed down the laboratory
and gave the building to a bank.

148
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:00,785
Put the car away
and look for a new job.

149
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:09,657
- Look.
- Ok, give it to the captain.

150
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:15,515
This should be noted
in the report.

151
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:42,000
In the Gospel according to St. Matthew

152
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,025
Jesus said ironically:

153
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:47,985
If the flesh is born of the spirit,
it is a miracle.

154
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:51,840
If the spirit is born of the body
it is the miracle of miracles.

155
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:57,214
The history of mathematics shows that
the miracle of miracles is impossible.

156
00:39:57,240 --> 00:40:02,746
Take the key moment in mathematics
when it made its first steps,

157
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:06,935
the most important for mankind's
emerging logical demonstration.

158
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:11,597
This very basis excludes any
possibility of practical applications.

159
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:13,109
Thale's thesis

160
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:19,135
established clear truths
for all men of reason,

161
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:26,688
such as that one saying the diameter
divides the circle in 2 equal parts.

162
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:31,715
It wasn't to check the truth of these
theses that required a genius,

163
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:38,034
but to understand that they
required a demonstration.

164
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:46,687
In other words, the practical value of
these discoveries is non-existing.

165
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:52,319
Mathematics became a Science
in the 6th century B.C.

166
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:58,498
In the religious circle
of the Pythagoreans.

167
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:01,801
Their goal was simply,

168
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:04,731
to permit the fusion
with the divine,

169
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:07,977
by grasping the world's harmony,

170
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:10,247
by expressing it in numbers.

171
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:46,040
So you're sure you want to leave?

172
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:49,351
The road may be dangerous.
Aren't you afraid?

173
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:52,974
Have you got a better idea?

174
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:55,998
I don't want to become
a street seller.

175
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:59,300
Where will you find the money'?
Borrow it again?

176
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:07,500
I have no choice.
I'll be okay if I sell the car.

177
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:19,608
Does Aijan agree?

178
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:23,813
Aijan? I don't care if
she agrees or not.

179
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:34,725
I have to run or
I'll get trouble.

180
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:40,040
Finish eating and wait at the back.
I'll come with some food.

181
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:41,683
Are you calling from Germany'?

182
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:45,429
What? You're already in Russia.

183
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:47,421
Which one?

184
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:50,759
Why a Nissan? You want a BMW.

185
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:53,843
What year'?

186
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:58,416
No, he's not sick.

187
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:00,221
Look be careful!

188
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:02,618
There's a lot of theft.

189
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:04,973
All right.

190
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:09,678
In how long'?

191
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:14,583
We'll see. Ok, bye. See you soon.

192
00:49:45,080 --> 00:49:47,219
Catch him up.

193
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:52,592
The Bastards.
That's the third they've stolen.

194
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:36,866
If we look at our lives
in simple terms,

195
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:38,956
we're like passengers,

196
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:42,288
lost in a long tunnel.

197
00:51:42,360 --> 00:51:47,239
We can no longer see
the light at the entrance

198
00:51:47,240 --> 00:51:52,155
and the light at the
other end is so weak

199
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:55,237
that we look for it all the time

200
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:57,214
and keep losing sight of it.

201
00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:00,124
We're not even sure

202
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:04,642
that there is an entrance and an exit.

203
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:08,300
All around us,
due to confusion,

204
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:11,869
or the exacerbation of our feelings,

205
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:14,855
all we see are monsters,

206
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:20,439
depending on our moods
and our wounds,

207
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:25,082
like in an exciting,
exhausting game of kaleidoscopes

208
00:52:25,120 --> 00:52:29,599
What to do?
Or even what is the point?

209
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:32,148
You don't ask questions
like that here.

210
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:48,975
Well, to return to
the subject in hand.

211
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:57,271
The first time you
borrowed 4,000 dollars.

212
00:53:59,560 --> 00:54:01,278
Today that makes with 42 days'

213
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:05,466
interest 1,680 dollars.

214
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:09,315
A total of 5,680 dollars.

215
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:16,299
Then, you borrowed 5,000
to go to Germany to buy a car.

216
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:18,664
Plus 28 days' interest,

217
00:54:20,320 --> 00:54:22,823
1,400 dollars.

218
00:54:26,360 --> 00:54:29,375
In all, you owe 12,080.

219
00:54:29,720 --> 00:54:30,812
Is that right?

220
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:32,782
Yes, that's right.

221
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:35,168
You have a 2 room apartment.

222
00:54:35,240 --> 00:54:39,415
A prefab building in a good situation.

223
00:54:41,640 --> 00:54:44,700
At best, we could get 7,000 for it.

224
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:52,168
How will you find the rest?

225
00:55:23,840 --> 00:55:25,979
Erjan! Dana's calling.

226
00:56:12,120 --> 00:56:14,509
Listen to your father, my girl.

227
00:56:16,680 --> 00:56:19,240
You must finish your studies

228
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:21,783
and find a job over there,
you hear'?

229
00:56:25,320 --> 00:56:28,630
Whoever comes back
from the States these days?

230
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:33,053
Why did I spend all that
money on your studies?

231
00:56:33,120 --> 00:56:35,862
Don't be silly. Listen to me.

232
00:56:39,880 --> 00:56:41,586
You're bored.

233
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:44,035
How can anyone be bored
over there?

234
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,821
Excuse me.
Where is Erjan Chakenovitch?

235
00:58:04,760 --> 00:58:06,239
He's asleep.

236
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:08,160
Asleep?

237
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:11,952
He's from the South,
he always sleeps after lunch.

238
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:17,358
He said Oleg will be in touch.

239
00:58:36,600 --> 00:58:41,401
I think it may be far more
serious than you thought.

240
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:46,175
Your child is suffering from
intracranial hypertension.

241
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:48,760
That's why he cries a lot.

242
00:58:49,080 --> 00:58:53,688
He needs an ultrasonic scan
and urgent treatment.

243
00:58:54,520 --> 00:58:58,809
The sooner the better.

244
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:22,877
I'll give you the address
of a good masseur.

245
00:59:25,120 --> 00:59:28,760
He's rather expensive,
but he's good.

246
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:34,959
I think that 20 sessions
should be enough.

247
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:38,839
Last month, he charged
10 dollars per session.

248
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:03,368
Aijan, here's the address.

249
01:00:06,120 --> 01:00:09,715
What for'? We can't afford it.

250
01:00:29,320 --> 01:00:30,776
On, hi Oleg.

251
01:00:32,440 --> 01:00:35,159
You know how things are.

252
01:00:37,120 --> 01:00:38,451
Why did I leave?

253
01:00:38,600 --> 01:00:40,761
Because he'd fallen asleep.

254
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:48,302
Ok, I'm coming.

255
01:02:13,080 --> 01:02:15,162
What if I can't manage it?

256
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:21,434
Look. You don't know Erjan
Chakenovitch. He's though.

257
01:02:22,440 --> 01:02:25,785
Listen to my advice.
Don't mess with him.

258
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:32,895
If you're successful,

259
01:02:33,960 --> 01:02:36,849
he'll not only forgive
all your debts,

260
01:02:37,040 --> 01:02:41,454
but you'll also get
10,000 from me.

261
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:56,170
What has this journalist
done to you?

262
01:02:56,240 --> 01:02:57,548
To me, nothing.

263
01:02:57,720 --> 01:03:01,474
But to Chakenovitch's friends, a lot.
I'm not involved.

264
01:03:02,160 --> 01:03:04,230
I'm just carrying out orders.

265
01:03:05,840 --> 01:03:08,741
It seems that he ran them down
in an article.

266
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:12,322
About a factory they
want to privatize.

267
01:03:13,360 --> 01:03:14,896
Something like that.

268
01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:17,442
What difference does it make?

269
01:03:22,520 --> 01:03:25,535
- Who is it?
- Oleg, the beer's here.

270
01:03:25,600 --> 01:03:28,387
So unload!
I'll be right out.

271
01:03:34,520 --> 01:03:35,726
Anyway-

272
01:03:46,640 --> 01:03:48,551
Here's the guy's photo.

273
01:03:49,720 --> 01:03:50,971
He's a journalist.

274
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:54,308
He writes for a famous newspaper.

275
01:03:54,360 --> 01:03:57,011
Here's his address.

276
01:03:57,200 --> 01:04:00,636
He goes walking by the river
near his house in the evening.

277
01:04:03,280 --> 01:04:06,579
I'm sure you know
you have to leave this there,

278
01:04:10,320 --> 01:04:12,527
so there's nothing
to connect you.

279
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:18,106
I'll be right back.

280
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:12,148
Got the time?

281
01:08:17,760 --> 01:08:18,875
5:45

282
01:08:22,560 --> 01:08:23,515
Thanks.

283
01:08:43,480 --> 01:08:45,937
Autumn started early this year.

284
01:08:47,320 --> 01:08:50,812
It's only October
and the trees are bare.

285
01:08:57,160 --> 01:09:01,859
On the one hand it must be nice
to live in a warm country.

286
01:09:02,200 --> 01:09:04,998
No winter, so
no need to spend money,

287
01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:08,305
on heating, warm clothes,
and so on.

288
01:09:08,920 --> 01:09:10,467
On the other hand,

289
01:09:10,520 --> 01:09:12,670
no winter means no spring.

290
01:09:13,200 --> 01:09:15,452
How can they live
without spring?

291
01:09:16,160 --> 01:09:19,641
No way. I wouldn't swap spring
for anything in the world.

292
01:09:20,680 --> 01:09:25,902
It's better to endure the harsh winter,
and then see the spring arrive.

293
01:09:36,040 --> 01:09:37,075
Dad.

294
01:10:39,160 --> 01:10:41,367
We've been waiting
for a while.

295
01:10:41,920 --> 01:10:44,218
Maybe he already
took out the trash.

296
01:10:44,280 --> 01:10:45,918
Do we wait all night?

297
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:47,649
We'll wait a while.

298
01:10:47,720 --> 01:10:50,291
He usually takes it out
around this time.

299
01:10:50,360 --> 01:10:53,124
- Is it midnight already'?
- Not yet.

300
01:10:53,440 --> 01:10:57,763
There's still some light.
They turn it off at midnight here.
