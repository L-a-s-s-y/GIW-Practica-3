This stomach belongs
to the protagonist of our story.

24
00:02:36,657 --> 00:02:39,493
Signs of cancer
are already present,

25
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:42,454
but he doesn't know that yet.

26
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:47,959
Public affairs section chief

27
00:03:11,817 --> 00:03:13,860

and city hall meet

29
00:03:16,363 --> 00:03:19,366
please don't hesitate to submit
and it breeds mosquitoes.

30
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:21,702
Your complaints
and reouests here

31
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:23,495
can't you do something?

32
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:27,416
It would make a great playground
if you filled it in.

33
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:30,419
Just a moment, please.

34
00:03:37,843 --> 00:03:41,388
Sir, they've come to complain
about open sewage.

35
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:43,724
Send them to public works.

36
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:52,107
Here's our protagonist.

37
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:57,028
But what a bore it would be
to describe his life now.

38
00:03:57,446 --> 00:03:59,072
Why?

39
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:02,325
Because he's only killing time.

40
00:04:02,743 --> 00:04:05,245
He's never actually lived

41
00:04:05,412 --> 00:04:08,373
you can't call this living.

42
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:19,843
Miss odagiri...

43
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:22,429
How dare you,
during business hours?

44
00:04:22,554 --> 00:04:24,097
It's just so funny!

45
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:25,932
What is?

46
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:29,019
The “liar's club.”
someone sent it around.

47
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:31,897
Read it to us.

48
00:04:37,444 --> 00:04:40,489
“So you've never taken
a vacation?”

49
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:41,865
“That's right.”

50
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:44,576
“Because city hall
can't run without you?”

51
00:04:44,743 --> 00:04:47,120
“No, because everyone
would realize

52
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:50,624
city hall doesn't
need me at all.”

53
00:05:03,595 --> 00:05:06,723
This isn't even worth watching.

54
00:05:07,057 --> 00:05:09,643
He might as well be a corpse.

55
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:14,856
In fact, he's been dead
for some 20 years now

56
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:18,819
before that,
he had some life in him.

57
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:22,364
He even tried
to do a little real work.

58
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:30,622
Proposal for increasing
departmental efficiency

59
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:33,834
submitted 11/7/1930
by kanji watanabe

60
00:05:36,545 --> 00:05:40,757
but there's nothing left
of that will or passion.

61
00:05:41,299 --> 00:05:44,553
They've been completely
worn down

62
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:48,181
by the minutia
of the bureaucratic machine

63
00:05:48,306 --> 00:05:51,226
and the meaningless
bus yness it breeds.

64
00:05:56,898 --> 00:05:59,401
Busy... so terribly busy.

65
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:04,155
But in reality,
he does nothing at all

66
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:07,576
besides protecting
his own position.

67
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:11,371
The best way to protect
your place in this world

68
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:13,707
is to do nothing at all.

69
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:18,587
But is this enough?

70
00:06:24,551 --> 00:06:26,761
Is this really enough 7

71
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:31,391
for him to Stan'
thinking seriously about this,

72
00:06:31,558 --> 00:06:34,728
his stomach
will have to get a lot worse,

73
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:40,025
and he'll have to rack up
a lot more wasted time.

74
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:44,362
But any proposal
for creating a park

75
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:46,740
must go to the parks department.

76
00:06:47,324 --> 00:06:50,785
This seems to be more
a matter of sanitation.

77
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:53,496
Talk to your
district health center.

78
00:06:53,997 --> 00:06:55,957
See the sanitation department.

79
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:57,918
See environmental sanitation.

80
00:06:59,002 --> 00:07:00,754
Preventive sanitation.

81
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:02,756
Disease control.

82
00:07:03,298 --> 00:07:05,258
Lots of mosquitoes?

83
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:08,261
That's a job for pest control.

84
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:16,061
The problem is seeping waste,
which means...

85
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:20,607
It's a problem for
the sewage department at city hall.

86
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:24,444
That was originally a culvert.

87
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:27,447
That is, it had a road over it.

88
00:07:27,614 --> 00:07:29,616
You'll need the okay
of the roads department.

89
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:34,204
City planning doesn't have
a policy for such cases.

90
00:07:34,746 --> 00:07:36,122
Go to zoning.

91
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:42,045
The fire department objected
to filling that cesspool.

92
00:07:42,963 --> 00:07:45,632
They need it because
water pressure is bad there.

93
00:07:46,091 --> 00:07:47,634
Are you kidding?

94
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:50,053
What we need is water,

95
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:54,265
not sewage that breeds mosquitoes
and causes rashes.

96
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:58,645
Imagine cleaning that sewage
out of our hoses!

97
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:03,942
If there were a kiddie pool there,
that'd be great for us too.

98
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:07,320
What about
your local school district?

99
00:08:07,529 --> 00:08:10,991
They should have
a child welfare section.

100
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:16,121
But this problem
doesn't only affect children.

101
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:20,709
Rebuilding all the schools
has exhausted our resources.

102
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:23,253
A problem this big
should be handled

103
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:26,506
by your city councilman.

104
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:30,885
Sure, I'll write an introduction
to the deputy mayor.

105
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:34,723
Take my business card.
He'll see you right away.

106
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:39,060
Please have a seat.

107
00:08:39,227 --> 00:08:42,188
Thank you for all your efforts.

108
00:08:43,106 --> 00:08:46,067
There's really nothing
we welcome more

109
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:50,280
than folks like you
who bring grievances like this

110
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:53,533
directly to our attention.

111
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:56,870
It's precisely
for people like you

112
00:08:56,995 --> 00:09:00,040
that we established
our new public affairs section.

113
00:09:00,498 --> 00:09:02,959
Don't hesitate
to tell them all about it!

114
00:09:03,126 --> 00:09:06,129
Show these nice folks
to the public affairs desk.

115
00:09:07,464 --> 00:09:11,426
You'll need to talk
to public works. Desk 8.

116
00:09:22,145 --> 00:09:25,648
How dare you!
Stop giving us the runaround!

117
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:28,068
Why did you even put up
that sign?

118
00:09:28,193 --> 00:09:30,070
So we'd waste our time?

119
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:33,114
We're not idlers
like all of you!

120
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:37,660
We just want something done
about that stinking cesspool!

121
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:40,580
We don't care
if it's public works, sanitation,

122
00:09:40,747 --> 00:09:43,124
public health, or whoever!

123
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:45,376
That's for public affairs
to sort out!

124
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:48,129
Fine! We're done with you jerks!

125
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:50,340
All you do is laugh at us!

126
00:09:50,465 --> 00:09:52,258
You call this democracy?

127
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:53,927
Let's go.

128
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:10,443
Please wait a moment.

129
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:14,781
I'm afraid our section chief
is out today.

130
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:18,576
It would be best
if you could put it in writing.

131
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:31,798
Public affairs section chief

132
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:37,470
what do you think?

133
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:40,557
The section chief
never takes time off.

134
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:44,936
Yeah. And he's been
listless recently.

135
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:49,983
But what'll we do
if he's out for a long time?

136
00:10:50,275 --> 00:10:51,860
Exactly.

137
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:55,738
He wouldn't take a day off
just for a cold.

138
00:10:56,281 --> 00:10:58,616
And nothing moves here
without his seal.

139
00:10:58,741 --> 00:10:59,951
That's right.

140
00:11:01,452 --> 00:11:05,498
I must say,
it's a terrible shame.

141
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:08,001
One more month

142
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:10,253
and he'd have set a record

143
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:12,964
of 30 years
without a single absence.

144
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:16,467
Some people are glad
he isn't here.

145
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:19,971
Bureaucrats always wonder
who'll take the boss's place

146
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:22,182
if he steps out.

147
00:11:25,268 --> 00:11:27,937
He's been taking a lot of medicine.
What for?

148
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:29,606
His stomach.

149
00:11:29,731 --> 00:11:32,692
He used to slurp
his noodles to the bottom,

150
00:11:32,859 --> 00:11:35,862
but lately
he barely touches them.

151
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:39,115
Plain udon noodles in soup.
Yet another record.

152
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:42,076
I've never seen him eat
anything else.

153
00:11:43,161 --> 00:11:46,623
Assuming the worst,
who'll replace him?

154
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:50,877
What's your rush?

155
00:11:51,002 --> 00:11:55,423
A lot of guys have to die
before it's your turn!

156
00:12:03,014 --> 00:12:05,433
X-ray room

157
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:22,992
- Ll/lr. Hiraoka/ - yes.

158
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:01,698
Your stomach?

159
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,911
My stomach's bad too.

160
00:13:07,412 --> 00:13:09,414
They say it's chronic.

161
00:13:10,957 --> 00:13:15,128
These days I hardly feel alive
unless my stomach hurts.

162
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:20,091
Mr. Ko suzuki.

163
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:26,222
That man who just went in...

164
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:33,479
His doctor told him
he has an ulcer,

165
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:37,859
but I'm sure
it's stomach cancer.

166
00:13:38,443 --> 00:13:40,361
Has to be.

167
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:46,326
And stomach cancer
is practically a death sentence.

168
00:13:46,993 --> 00:13:50,455
The doc usually says
it's just a mild ulcer

169
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:53,833
and that there's
no need to operate.

170
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:58,671
That you can eat
whatever you want

171
00:13:58,796 --> 00:14:01,090
as long as it's easy to digest.

172
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:05,470
If that's what he tells you,
you've got a year at most.

173
00:14:06,012 --> 00:14:11,142
But with some symptoms,
you won't even last a year:

174
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:13,978
First...

175
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,690
A dull, heavy pain.

176
00:14:18,608 --> 00:14:21,736
Frequent unpleasant burping.

177
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:25,698
A dry tongue.

178
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:29,077
You can't seem to get
enough water and tea.

179
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:32,455
And then there's the diarrhea.

180
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:37,043
And if it isn't diarrhea,
it's constipation.

181
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:40,755
Your bowel movements turn black.

182
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,302
And then...

183
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:51,265
The meat you used to love
seems totally inedible.

184
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:56,437
Whatever you eat
you throw up half an hour later.

185
00:14:56,604 --> 00:15:00,233
And then you start
throwing up food

186
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,693
you ate a week before.

187
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:06,114
At that point, you've got
three months at most...

188
00:15:17,792 --> 00:15:21,337
Mr. Kan/I watanabe.

189
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:26,092
Mr. Kan/I watanabe.

190
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:30,430
Yes.

191
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:09,635
Have a seat.

192
00:16:12,555 --> 00:16:16,476
Now, then... it looks like
you have a mild ulcer.

193
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:33,451
Please...

194
00:16:33,701 --> 00:16:35,161
Tell me...

195
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:38,289
The honest truth.

196
00:16:38,456 --> 00:16:41,000
- Tell me it's stomach cancer.
- No.

197
00:16:41,501 --> 00:16:44,587
As I just said,
it's a mild ulcer.

198
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:07,902
What about surgery?

199
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:10,196
Can't you operate?

200
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:14,033
No need for surgery.
It can be treated medically.

201
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:17,286
What about my diet?

202
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:19,872
Well, let's see.

203
00:17:20,206 --> 00:17:22,041
Use common sense.

204
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:25,545
If it's easy to digest,
you can eat whatever you like.

205
00:17:39,267 --> 00:17:41,227
Has he got a year?

206
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:43,896
No, no more than six months.

207
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:46,023
- Six months?
- Yeah.

208
00:17:47,275 --> 00:17:49,277
What would you do

209
00:17:49,402 --> 00:17:52,780
if you only had
six months left to live?

210
00:17:58,369 --> 00:18:01,289
Miss aihara, what about you?

211
00:18:02,957 --> 00:18:05,126
See the veronal in the cabinet?

212
00:19:15,446 --> 00:19:16,947
Is there a blackout?

213
00:19:17,073 --> 00:19:19,825
The street lights are on,
and the neighbors' lights.

214
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:22,662
Strange.
I wonder if father is out.

215
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:25,790
- Where's the key?
- In your handbag.

216
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:30,544
Did Mrs. Hayashi
leave it unlocked?

217
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:32,380
She's so irresponsible.

218
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:35,174
That's the problem
with a part-time maid.

219
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:38,344
Having her live in
wouldn't cost much,

220
00:19:38,511 --> 00:19:40,638
but a burglary sure would.

221
00:19:40,763 --> 00:19:43,974
That's dad's mentality.
Typical petty bureaucrat.

222
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:49,855
It's freezing.
Just as bad inside as out.

223
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:52,191
That's why I hate
Japanese houses.

224
00:19:52,358 --> 00:19:54,777
It's such a drag
coming home to this.

225
00:19:54,944 --> 00:19:57,405
I'd like a modern house.

226
00:19:57,571 --> 00:19:59,156
Honey...

227
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:03,327
A house of our own would cost
around 500,000 yen, right?

228
00:20:04,078 --> 00:20:06,997
Could we use your dad's
retirement bonus as collateral?

229
00:20:07,123 --> 00:20:10,167
It must be worth 700,000 by now,

230
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:13,504
plus a monthly pension
of 13,000 yen...

231
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:16,173
And another 100,000 in savings.

232
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:18,134
But you think he'd agree?

233
00:20:18,259 --> 00:20:20,928
If he doesn't,
we'll say we're moving out.

234
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:22,805
That'll clinch it.

235
00:20:22,972 --> 00:20:27,226
Even dad doesn't want to take
that much money to the grave.

236
00:20:36,986 --> 00:20:38,904
Dad, what's the matter?

237
00:20:42,742 --> 00:20:44,827
Nothing.

238
00:20:45,703 --> 00:20:47,413
Nothing at all.

239
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:56,005
Something's not right.

240
00:20:57,798 --> 00:20:58,966
Listen...

241
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:02,386
- This is awful.
- What is?

242
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:05,264
He heard everything.

243
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:08,642
He's awful.

244
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:11,645
It may be his house,
but this is our room.

245
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:15,399
I can't believe he snuck in here
while we were out.

246
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:20,154
If he needed to talk to us,
he should have said so.

247
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:23,240
He's too old
to be sulking around.

248
00:22:08,369 --> 00:22:10,913
Stop making that face.

249
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:15,251
Enough about your dad.

250
00:22:15,417 --> 00:22:18,796
He has his life. We have ours.

251
00:22:26,095 --> 00:22:27,680
Hold me.

252
00:22:48,659 --> 00:22:49,743
How sad

253
00:22:50,953 --> 00:22:52,997
she was so young.

254
00:22:53,747 --> 00:22:57,543
And to leave
such a sweet little boy behind.

255
00:22:58,085 --> 00:23:00,713
She must have died
filled with regret.

256
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:04,508
Would you stop?
You're like a broken record.

257
00:23:20,316 --> 00:23:23,235
Hurry! Mommy's getting away!

258
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:46,508
Whenever remarriage comes up,

259
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:49,219
you always
use the boy as an excuse.

260
00:23:49,386 --> 00:23:51,931
When mitsuo grows up,

261
00:23:52,222 --> 00:23:55,059
he won't care about you
as much as you think.

262
00:23:55,225 --> 00:23:58,646
And when he gets married,
they'll push you aside.

263
00:23:58,854 --> 00:24:01,941
You have to think
about your own future.

264
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:05,611
I'm telling you:
Find a good wife now.

265
00:24:05,778 --> 00:24:07,738
Even my old lady says so.

266
00:24:07,905 --> 00:24:11,075
She imagines
how filthy it must be

267
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:15,037
with an oily-skinned man like you
living as a widower.

268
00:24:17,581 --> 00:24:19,583
Dad.

269
00:24:29,593 --> 00:24:31,178
Mitsuo.

270
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:36,600
Good night.
Please lock the front door.

271
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,541
Mitsuo!

272
00:25:48,005 --> 00:25:50,632
How about that? Great hit, huh?

273
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:54,344
That batter is my...

274
00:26:01,143 --> 00:26:04,188
Mitsuo...

275
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:10,819
Stupid idiot!

276
00:26:10,986 --> 00:26:12,905
What was he thinking?

277
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:24,458
Mitsuo.

278
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:32,966
Mitsuo, be brave.

279
00:26:33,092 --> 00:26:35,094
It's just your appendix.

280
00:26:35,344 --> 00:26:37,763
It's no worse
than pulling a tooth.

281
00:26:52,111 --> 00:26:54,571
Can't you stay
for the operation, dad?

282
00:26:54,696 --> 00:26:58,158
I've got...
Some other things to do.

283
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:21,390
Banzai! Banzai!

284
00:27:26,478 --> 00:27:30,524
Banzai! Banzai!

285
00:27:37,406 --> 00:27:38,824
Dad!

286
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:41,994
Mitsuo...

287
00:30:18,525 --> 00:30:21,445
Certificate of commendation

288
00:30:21,570 --> 00:30:26,658
for 25 years
of distinguished civil service

289
00:30:31,288 --> 00:30:34,333
Mr. Watanabe left for work
at his usual time.

290
00:30:34,499 --> 00:30:35,917
What?

291
00:30:38,211 --> 00:30:41,340
But nobody has seen him.

292
00:30:41,923 --> 00:30:45,761
It's been five days now.
And he hasn't called in sick.

293
00:30:45,927 --> 00:30:49,723
The subsection chief asked me
to check in on him.

294
00:30:55,062 --> 00:30:57,689
Ma'am.

295
00:31:04,196 --> 00:31:05,989
What? Impossible!

296
00:31:06,114 --> 00:31:09,743
But it's true.
The man from his office said so.

297
00:31:09,910 --> 00:31:12,037
What could he be up to?

298
00:31:13,038 --> 00:31:16,124
It seems unbelievable,
but it's true.

299
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:19,795
The people at his house
looked baffled.

300
00:31:20,837 --> 00:31:22,881
That puts me in a fix.

301
00:31:23,507 --> 00:31:27,969
Why? I can stamp
any paperwork while he's out.

302
00:31:28,261 --> 00:31:31,431
But he has to approve
any resignations, right?

303
00:31:31,598 --> 00:31:34,518
Why? Are you looking to quit?

304
00:31:34,684 --> 00:31:36,186
I don't belong here.

305
00:31:47,447 --> 00:31:51,076
Uncle, he even withdrew
50,000 yen.

306
00:31:51,243 --> 00:31:53,286
That miser?

307
00:31:53,995 --> 00:31:55,956
I wonder if he's got a woman.

308
00:31:56,123 --> 00:31:58,250
That would really be something.

309
00:31:58,417 --> 00:32:00,710
- Now, dear.
- I'm sure it's not that.

310
00:32:00,836 --> 00:32:03,713
There's no telling
when it comes to love.

311
00:32:04,089 --> 00:32:07,342
The ones you least expect
are the most susceptible.

312
00:32:08,301 --> 00:32:10,137
If you ask me,

313
00:32:10,303 --> 00:32:13,390
he's actually a real lecher.

314
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:15,851
A lecher with a solemn veneer.

315
00:32:16,017 --> 00:32:19,396
But he's stayed widowed
these 20 years for you.

316
00:32:19,604 --> 00:32:22,649
It makes sense that
he'd eventually snap, right?

317
00:32:22,816 --> 00:32:26,778
Nonsense. He's lost
a lot of weight recently,

318
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:29,739
and his oily skin
has gotten rough and dry.

319
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:31,908
There must be
another explanation.

320
00:32:32,075 --> 00:32:33,618
You saw him recently?

321
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:37,497
Four days ago.
He showed up in the morning.

322
00:32:37,747 --> 00:32:41,668
I thought there was definitely
something wrong.

323
00:32:41,835 --> 00:32:44,463
But your uncle here blurted out,

324
00:32:44,588 --> 00:32:48,800
“why so glum? If you've come
for a loan, forget it.”

325
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:51,511
How could I suspect
a love affair

326
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:53,680
when he looked like that?

327
00:32:53,805 --> 00:32:55,640
Hush! You see...

328
00:32:55,807 --> 00:33:00,520
My husband thinks all men
are as debauched as he is.

329
00:33:04,774 --> 00:33:09,112
Mitsuo, did anything
happen at home?

330
00:33:10,238 --> 00:33:12,407
Nothing in particular.

331
00:33:36,973 --> 00:33:38,433
Hey.

332
00:33:39,059 --> 00:33:41,102
Deliver this to my place.

333
00:33:44,231 --> 00:33:46,775
A guy from the magazine
is waiting there.

334
00:33:50,445 --> 00:33:53,782
And get some cyclobarbital
at the pharmacy.

335
00:33:53,949 --> 00:33:55,992
Just give them my name.

336
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:58,870
But sir, the pharmacy's
already closed.

337
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:00,705
Is it that late?

338
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:03,792
In this neighborhood
folks go to bed after dinner.

339
00:34:04,167 --> 00:34:06,002
That stinks.

340
00:34:06,836 --> 00:34:10,799
I can't sleep unless
I chase it down with whisky.

341
00:34:10,966 --> 00:34:14,553
Pardon me for butting in...

342
00:34:16,555 --> 00:34:20,267
But I happen to have some.

343
00:34:37,993 --> 00:34:39,869
Much obliged.

344
00:34:40,579 --> 00:34:43,123
May I pay you
the official price?

345
00:34:43,290 --> 00:34:44,874
No, no.

346
00:34:46,209 --> 00:34:48,920
I was planning to throw it away.

347
00:34:51,548 --> 00:34:53,925
- But — - no, really.

348
00:34:54,551 --> 00:34:56,219
Really?

349
00:34:56,845 --> 00:34:59,639
Then let me pick up your tab.

350
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:01,558
Oh, no.

351
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:03,768
You can hold your liquor, right?

352
00:35:04,436 --> 00:35:07,188
Drink up. You hardly seem tipsy.

353
00:35:07,814 --> 00:35:09,232
Thank you.

354
00:35:14,487 --> 00:35:17,991
Even if I drink,
I'll just throw it up.

355
00:35:19,367 --> 00:35:21,786
You see...

356
00:35:21,911 --> 00:35:24,497
I have stomach cancer.

357
00:35:25,332 --> 00:35:27,083
- Stomach cancer?
- Yes.

358
00:35:29,919 --> 00:35:31,796
I don't know what to say.

359
00:35:33,465 --> 00:35:37,260
In that case,
what you're doing is crazy.

360
00:35:37,427 --> 00:35:41,473
Yes, I'm ashamed to admit.

361
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:43,850
I mean...

362
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:48,772
Drinking when you have
stomach cancer is suicide.

363
00:35:52,484 --> 00:35:55,403
The thing is...
I can't go through with it.

364
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:03,244
“Go ahead and kill yourself,”
I think.

365
00:36:04,204 --> 00:36:06,122
And yet...

366
00:36:06,581 --> 00:36:08,833
I just can't do it.

367
00:36:11,878 --> 00:36:13,505
I mean...

368
00:36:14,798 --> 00:36:17,050
I can't bring myself
to make it final.

369
00:36:18,343 --> 00:36:23,264
But what have I been...
Living for all these years?

370
00:36:26,685 --> 00:36:28,353
You don't have children?

371
00:36:33,358 --> 00:36:35,026
Does your stomach hurt?

372
00:36:36,903 --> 00:36:40,824
No, it's not my stomach.

373
00:36:49,249 --> 00:36:53,878
There seems to be
a deeper issue here.

374
00:36:58,758 --> 00:37:00,510
It's just...

375
00:37:01,636 --> 00:37:05,223
That I've been such a fool.

376
00:37:07,684 --> 00:37:09,686
I'm just...

377
00:37:16,276 --> 00:37:18,945
So mad at myself.

378
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:26,953
Until just a few days ago...

379
00:37:28,288 --> 00:37:32,667
I had never even
bought myself a drink.

380
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:36,921
It's only now that I don't know

381
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:40,341
how much longer
I have to live...

382
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,927
That I've finally begun...

383
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:44,804
I understand.

384
00:37:45,388 --> 00:37:47,182
I understand.

385
00:37:47,849 --> 00:37:50,894
But drinking now is plain crazy.

386
00:37:51,936 --> 00:37:54,355
Besides,
does it even taste good?

387
00:37:54,522 --> 00:37:57,192
No, it doesn't.

388
00:37:58,151 --> 00:38:01,237
But for a little while

389
00:38:01,362 --> 00:38:03,990
I can forget my cancer

390
00:38:04,866 --> 00:38:08,453
and all the other
painful things.

391
00:38:09,913 --> 00:38:11,539
This...

392
00:38:15,335 --> 00:38:17,796
This expensive sake...

393
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:23,176
Is like drinking poison...

394
00:38:24,219 --> 00:38:27,388
To get back at myself.

395
00:38:28,223 --> 00:38:29,808
I mean...

396
00:38:31,184 --> 00:38:34,979
That is... it's kind of...

397
00:38:36,731 --> 00:38:39,984
A painful feeling...

398
00:38:45,573 --> 00:38:47,450
I understand.

399
00:38:49,577 --> 00:38:52,163
Sorry to be
telling you all this.

400
00:39:22,986 --> 00:39:25,363
Listen...

401
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:29,033
I have 50,000 yen on me

402
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:33,371
that I'd like to spend
all at once.

403
00:39:34,539 --> 00:39:37,876
But I'm ashamed to admit

404
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:41,629
that I'm not even sure
how to go about it.

405
00:39:42,338 --> 00:39:45,133
What I'm trying to say is...

406
00:39:45,842 --> 00:39:48,720
You want me to show you
how to spend it?

407
00:39:49,262 --> 00:39:50,638
Yes.

408
00:39:50,763 --> 00:39:53,600
I realize
it's terribly forward of me.

409
00:39:57,812 --> 00:39:59,439
But...

410
00:40:02,609 --> 00:40:04,527
This money...

411
00:40:13,745 --> 00:40:17,874
It took me decades
to save up this money.

412
00:40:19,834 --> 00:40:24,547
All the more reason now to...

413
00:40:24,714 --> 00:40:26,382
I understand.

414
00:40:27,008 --> 00:40:29,969
But please put your money away.

415
00:40:30,136 --> 00:40:31,930
Tonight's on me.

416
00:40:32,055 --> 00:40:33,932
But that's not...

417
00:40:34,223 --> 00:40:36,184
Just leave things to me.

418
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:54,160
It's fascinating.

419
00:40:54,869 --> 00:40:57,914
I realize it's rude
to call you fascinating,

420
00:40:58,373 --> 00:41:01,793
but you're
an extremely rare individual.

421
00:41:02,669 --> 00:41:05,004
I'm just a slacker

422
00:41:05,171 --> 00:41:07,465
who writes second-rate fiction.

423
00:41:08,007 --> 00:41:10,551
You've really
started me thinking.

424
00:41:24,023 --> 00:41:27,485
They say there's
something noble about suffering,

425
00:41:27,652 --> 00:41:29,320
and it's true.

426
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:32,407
Misfortune teaches us the truth.

427
00:41:32,532 --> 00:41:36,369
Your cancer has opened
your eyes to your own life.

428
00:41:44,168 --> 00:41:47,046
People are fickle and shallow.

429
00:41:47,922 --> 00:41:50,925
We only realize
how beautiful life is

430
00:41:51,092 --> 00:41:53,219
when we face death.

431
00:41:53,553 --> 00:41:56,723
And even then,
few of us realize it.

432
00:41:56,889 --> 00:42:00,268
The worst among us know
nothing of life until they die.

433
00:42:00,476 --> 00:42:04,605
You're amazing! Rebelling
against your past self at this age!

434
00:42:04,731 --> 00:42:07,191
That rebellious spirit moves me.

435
00:42:07,442 --> 00:42:10,028
You were a slave
to your own life.

436
00:42:10,153 --> 00:42:12,530
Now you'll become its master.

437
00:42:12,697 --> 00:42:16,117
It's our human duty
to enjoy life.

438
00:42:16,284 --> 00:42:19,495
Wasting it is desecrating
god's great gift.

439
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:22,707
We have to be greedy for life.

440
00:42:22,874 --> 00:42:26,169
They say greed is a vice,
but that's outdated.

441
00:42:26,335 --> 00:42:30,381
Greed is a virtue,
especially greed for enjoying life.

442
00:42:31,382 --> 00:42:33,051
Come on.

443
00:42:36,846 --> 00:42:40,308
Let's go reclaim
the life you've wasted.

444
00:42:40,516 --> 00:42:42,852
Tonight it will be my pleasure

445
00:42:42,977 --> 00:42:45,313
to act as your mephistopheles,

446
00:42:45,438 --> 00:42:48,816
but a beneficent one
who won't ask for your soul.

447
00:42:51,652 --> 00:42:54,238
How perfect!
There's even a black dog.

448
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:56,199
Lead the way!

449
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:01,746
Listen.

450
00:43:01,871 --> 00:43:04,457
These silver balls are you.

451
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:06,959
They're your life itself.

452
00:43:07,085 --> 00:43:11,047
People strangle themselves
in their daily lives.

453
00:43:11,214 --> 00:43:13,299
This machine sets them free.

454
00:43:13,466 --> 00:43:16,302
It's a vending machine
for dreams and aspirations.

455
00:44:26,497 --> 00:44:28,332
No, don't!

456
00:44:28,499 --> 00:44:30,209
You wouldn't know it,

457
00:44:30,376 --> 00:44:32,962
but these women are
the greediest of all mammals.

458
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:40,011
It'll cost you a dozen hats
to get that old one back.

459
00:44:46,309 --> 00:44:48,936
Besides, you're a new man now.

460
00:44:49,103 --> 00:44:51,105
Time to buy a new hat!

461
00:45:13,377 --> 00:45:14,921
Welcome.

462
00:45:17,215 --> 00:45:20,468
Welcome. It's been a long time!

463
00:45:28,226 --> 00:45:30,353
The same for your friend?

464
00:45:43,074 --> 00:45:45,076
What are you laughing at?

465
00:45:45,243 --> 00:45:48,371
It's the honest truth.
He really does have cancer.

466
00:45:48,746 --> 00:45:51,290
- Then why's he drinking?
- Idiot!

467
00:45:51,457 --> 00:45:54,126
That's why
you'll never understand.

468
00:45:54,335 --> 00:45:57,797
Ecce homo. “Behold the man.”

469
00:45:58,547 --> 00:46:01,133
This man bears
a cross called cancer.

470
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:02,927
He's Christ.

471
00:46:03,094 --> 00:46:06,931
If you were diagnosed with cancer,
you'd start dying right away.

472
00:46:07,431 --> 00:46:09,767
But not this fellow.

473
00:46:10,434 --> 00:46:12,853
That's when he started living.

474
00:46:13,104 --> 00:46:14,939
Isn't that right?

475
00:47:06,657 --> 00:47:09,160
Hey, don't stare like that.

476
00:47:09,327 --> 00:47:11,329
It's rude.

477
00:47:11,454 --> 00:47:13,372
This way.

478
00:48:36,872 --> 00:48:40,209
Anyone want
to request a favorite?

479
00:48:41,252 --> 00:48:43,254
“Life is brief.”

480
00:48:43,379 --> 00:48:44,755
What?

481
00:48:45,923 --> 00:48:47,925
“Life is brief.”

482
00:48:48,092 --> 00:48:52,388
Fall in love, maidens

483
00:48:52,555 --> 00:48:55,975
that love song
from the nineteen teens? Okay!

484
00:49:24,670 --> 00:49:32,219
Life is brief

485
00:49:33,345 --> 00:49:39,226
fall in love, maidens

486
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:50,279
before the crimson bloom

487
00:49:51,489 --> 00:49:57,036
fades from your lips

488
00:50:01,290 --> 00:50:09,290
before the tides of passion

489
00:50:09,798 --> 00:50:15,679
cool within you

490
00:50:18,682 --> 00:50:25,814
for those of you

491
00:50:27,066 --> 00:50:33,197
who know no tomorrow

492
00:50:36,367 --> 00:50:44,041
life is brief

493
00:50:45,376 --> 00:50:51,423
fall in love, maidens

494
00:50:53,384 --> 00:51:01,384
before the raven tresses

495
00:51:02,434 --> 00:51:08,274
begin to fade

496
00:51:10,651 --> 00:51:18,409
before the flames in your hearts

497
00:51:19,577 --> 00:51:25,499
flicker and die

498
00:51:27,418 --> 00:51:35,418
for those to whom

499
00:51:36,594 --> 00:51:42,766
today will never return

500
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:52,192
That's it! That's the spirit!

501
00:51:54,570 --> 00:52:00,367
Life is brief

502
00:52:46,038 --> 00:52:47,790
Striptease.

503
00:52:47,915 --> 00:52:50,834
It isn't... an art.

504
00:52:51,168 --> 00:52:53,170
It's more than art.

505
00:52:53,337 --> 00:52:55,422
It's more direct.

506
00:52:55,839 --> 00:52:59,009
That female body

507
00:52:59,176 --> 00:53:02,846
gently undulating
up there is a juicy steak,

508
00:53:03,222 --> 00:53:05,849
a glass of liquor,
an injection of camphor,

509
00:53:06,016 --> 00:53:08,560
testosterone,
streptomycin, uranium...

510
00:55:42,589 --> 00:55:44,007
Stop, please.

511
00:55:45,342 --> 00:55:47,344
Hey, stop the car.

512
00:56:01,024 --> 00:56:02,860
Wha... do we have a flat?

513
00:56:02,985 --> 00:56:04,862
I think he's throwing up.

514
00:57:10,636 --> 00:57:14,389
Let's sing something.
I hate feeling blue.

515
00:58:22,833 --> 00:58:24,668
Section chief!

516
00:58:35,595 --> 00:58:37,305
I thought it was you!

517
00:58:45,731 --> 00:58:48,191
I hardly recognized you
in that new hat.

518
00:58:56,950 --> 00:59:00,078
I'm glad I ran into you.
I was looking for your place.

519
00:59:00,203 --> 00:59:02,122
Are you off to work?

520
00:59:02,330 --> 00:59:04,124
No, I'm...

521
00:59:04,291 --> 00:59:06,334
Do you have your seal?

522
00:59:07,002 --> 00:59:09,796
No, it's back at home.

523
00:59:10,088 --> 00:59:12,507
I want to quit city hall.

524
00:59:13,216 --> 00:59:16,219
I'm in a rush.
I've found a new job.

525
00:59:17,387 --> 00:59:19,639
Then... come to my house.

526
00:59:32,819 --> 00:59:35,614
- Why are you quitting?
- I'm bored.

527
00:59:35,739 --> 00:59:39,242
It's killing me.
Every day is like the one before.

528
00:59:39,367 --> 00:59:41,787
Nothing new ever happens.

529
00:59:42,579 --> 00:59:46,083
I've put up with it
for a year and half,

530
00:59:46,249 --> 00:59:48,585
but the only novel thing
that's happened

531
00:59:48,752 --> 00:59:51,338
was that you took
five days off...

532
00:59:51,505 --> 00:59:54,341
And now this new hat of yours.

533
00:59:54,508 --> 00:59:56,051
That's it.

534
01:00:00,806 --> 01:00:04,226
Listen, don't say anything
when dad gets back.

535
01:00:04,392 --> 01:00:05,894
I have nothing to say.

536
01:00:06,061 --> 01:00:09,439
I'm saying don't take
that carping attitude.

537
01:00:09,689 --> 01:00:12,567
If you hadn't brought up
his retirement bonus...

538
01:00:13,276 --> 01:00:16,780
How self-serving,
blaming it all on me!

539
01:00:17,030 --> 01:00:19,282
You're the one
who brought up his savings

540
01:00:19,491 --> 01:00:22,619
and how even he wouldn't
take it all to the grave.

541
01:00:22,786 --> 01:00:25,330
But I still can't figure out

542
01:00:25,497 --> 01:00:28,291
why that was enough
to make him act like this.

543
01:00:28,458 --> 01:00:30,877
He's never once
stayed out all night.

544
01:00:31,044 --> 01:00:32,754
Let's drop it.

545
01:00:32,921 --> 01:00:35,382
We have no idea what he's doing,

546
01:00:35,507 --> 01:00:38,718
much less
whether it's our fault.

547
01:00:45,684 --> 01:00:47,644
I'll wait here.

548
01:00:48,353 --> 01:00:50,397
Please come in for a bit.

549
01:00:51,648 --> 01:00:53,108
Honey!

550
01:01:58,465 --> 01:02:00,342
Thirty years.

551
01:02:00,884 --> 01:02:04,763
It kills me to think
of 30 years in that place.

552
01:02:06,348 --> 01:02:08,016
I'm sorry.

553
01:02:08,183 --> 01:02:10,060
No, it's just that...

554
01:02:11,311 --> 01:02:13,772
Recenfly...

555
01:02:15,106 --> 01:02:17,317
Every time I see that award,

556
01:02:17,692 --> 01:02:21,738
it reminds me
of that joke you read to us.

557
01:02:23,406 --> 01:02:26,743
I mean, it really rang true.

558
01:02:31,414 --> 01:02:34,626
All these 30 years...

559
01:02:38,255 --> 01:02:42,050
What have I been doing there?

560
01:02:44,135 --> 01:02:47,055
I can't remember
no matter how I try.

561
01:02:49,224 --> 01:02:51,226
All I remember...

562
01:02:51,893 --> 01:02:56,273
Is just being busy...

563
01:02:57,274 --> 01:03:01,111
And even then I was bored.

564
01:03:01,736 --> 01:03:03,738
I had you all wrong, sir.

565
01:03:03,905 --> 01:03:05,949
You really do understand!

566
01:03:06,074 --> 01:03:07,784
What a surprise!

567
01:03:16,626 --> 01:03:18,295
That's crazy.

568
01:03:18,461 --> 01:03:21,131
Whatever uncle says,
I know dad best.

569
01:03:21,256 --> 01:03:22,382
But...

570
01:03:22,549 --> 01:03:27,095
It's unimaginable,
dad with such a young girl.

571
01:03:36,396 --> 01:03:39,482
It's not in the right format.

572
01:04:11,639 --> 01:04:14,517
Are you going to the office?

573
01:04:14,642 --> 01:04:16,686
Yes, I have to submit this.

574
01:04:16,895 --> 01:04:20,106
Could you turn in
my sick-leave form?

575
01:04:21,358 --> 01:04:23,985
Why are you taking
so much time off?

576
01:04:25,236 --> 01:04:28,907
Everyone's talking about it.
They're calling it your “mutation.”

577
01:04:29,699 --> 01:04:31,242
I just...

578
01:04:34,245 --> 01:04:36,247
Are you really sick?

579
01:04:38,124 --> 01:04:40,377
You do look kind of pale.

580
01:04:41,378 --> 01:04:44,547
I just meant...

581
01:04:45,715 --> 01:04:47,884
I didn't think so.

582
01:04:48,843 --> 01:04:50,762
So where do you go

583
01:04:50,887 --> 01:04:53,598
when you pretend
you're going to work?

584
01:04:55,600 --> 01:04:57,560
Don't try to hide it.

585
01:04:59,813 --> 01:05:02,565
But don't you know

586
01:05:02,732 --> 01:05:06,277
that Mr. Sakai came here yesterday
and told them everything?

587
01:05:08,905 --> 01:05:10,198
Who cares, right?

588
01:05:10,365 --> 01:05:12,700
After 30 years
without an absence,

589
01:05:12,826 --> 01:05:15,412
you deserve
at least six months off.

590
01:05:19,499 --> 01:05:22,252
Besides, I'll cover for you.

591
01:05:22,419 --> 01:05:25,296
- I'm not like carp windsock.
- Carp windsock?

592
01:05:25,463 --> 01:05:29,551
Yes, Mr. Sakai
is a human carp windsock.

593
01:05:30,051 --> 01:05:34,264
His lips are always flapping,
but he's just hot air inside.

594
01:05:36,224 --> 01:05:39,310
Plus he always acts
like such a big shot.

595
01:05:39,477 --> 01:05:43,022
He makes 200 yen more
a month than I do,

596
01:05:43,148 --> 01:05:45,942
so he looks down on me.

597
01:06:06,004 --> 01:06:07,589
Bye, then.

598
01:06:18,266 --> 01:06:20,852
Listen, I'll go with you.

599
01:07:14,531 --> 01:07:16,199
Ma'am?

600
01:07:18,535 --> 01:07:20,328
Ma'am!

601
01:07:21,454 --> 01:07:23,373
You're so lucky.

602
01:07:23,498 --> 01:07:26,376
I wish I could live
in a house like yours.

603
01:07:27,043 --> 01:07:29,420
At our place,
three families share two rooms.

604
01:07:29,587 --> 01:07:31,548
It's like
the warring states period.

605
01:07:33,216 --> 01:07:35,885
And you have
a wonderful son, right?

606
01:07:36,386 --> 01:07:39,806
Tell me, where do they sell
women's stockings?

607
01:07:39,973 --> 01:07:41,891
You want to buy some?

608
01:07:42,016 --> 01:07:44,727
Western clothing stores
carry them.

609
01:07:46,771 --> 01:07:49,816
For your daughter-in-law, right?

610
01:07:49,941 --> 01:07:52,026
I've heard she's very pretty.

611
01:07:52,652 --> 01:07:55,405
That's according
to carp windsock's report.

612
01:08:07,417 --> 01:08:10,712
- Are you all right?
- I'm just so excited!

613
01:08:11,045 --> 01:08:14,007
- They make you that —
- I'm so happy!

614
01:08:14,173 --> 01:08:15,925
To buy them myself,

615
01:08:16,092 --> 01:08:19,721
I'd have to have sardines
for lunch for three months.

616
01:08:20,138 --> 01:08:22,765
But why did you buy them for me?

617
01:08:22,932 --> 01:08:26,144
Well, yours had holes in them.

618
01:08:27,145 --> 01:08:32,442
Do the holes in my stockings
make your feet cold?

619
01:08:32,609 --> 01:08:34,861
Don't get me wrong...

620
01:08:35,028 --> 01:08:37,405
I was just kidding.

621
01:08:37,989 --> 01:08:40,742
I know you did it
out of kindness,

622
01:08:41,075 --> 01:08:43,703
but I feel awkward
at times like this.

623
01:08:43,870 --> 01:08:46,789
That's why I made a bad joke.
Forgive me.

624
01:09:07,268 --> 01:09:09,312
Want to hear something good?

625
01:09:09,562 --> 01:09:10,730
Something good?

626
01:09:10,855 --> 01:09:14,859
I got so bored that I gave
everyone at work nicknames.

627
01:09:14,984 --> 01:09:16,611
Wanna hear them?

628
01:09:16,778 --> 01:09:18,821
- Sea slug.
- Sea slug?

629
01:09:19,030 --> 01:09:20,657
Can you guess?

630
01:09:20,782 --> 01:09:22,992
Someone who's slippery
and evasive.

631
01:09:24,994 --> 01:09:27,121
Mr. Ono, the subsection chief.

632
01:09:27,413 --> 01:09:28,998
Sea slug...

633
01:09:31,668 --> 01:09:35,713
Gutter cover. Someone who's
damp and gloomy all year round.

634
01:09:37,423 --> 01:09:40,093
- Would that be obara?
- Bingo!

635
01:09:42,011 --> 01:09:44,138
Next: Flypaper.

636
01:09:44,305 --> 01:09:47,600
- Flypaper?
- You know — sticks to everything.

637
01:09:48,226 --> 01:09:50,895
You guessed, right? Mr. Noguchi!

638
01:09:53,731 --> 01:09:56,192
Next is the floor supervisor,
Mr. Saito.

639
01:09:56,359 --> 01:09:59,028
Can you guess his nickname?

640
01:09:59,779 --> 01:10:01,656
Mr. Saito.

641
01:10:02,281 --> 01:10:04,033
Let's see...

642
01:10:04,617 --> 01:10:08,496
His distinguishing feature
is that he has none.

643
01:10:09,330 --> 01:10:12,375
I don't really know...

644
01:10:13,209 --> 01:10:14,877
Set menu.

645
01:10:15,002 --> 01:10:17,714
- Set menu?
- At the cafeteria.

646
01:10:22,677 --> 01:10:24,762
And what about kimura?

647
01:10:24,929 --> 01:10:28,224
Jelly noodles.
Timid and quivering.

648
01:10:31,310 --> 01:10:34,230
I had a nickname for you too.

649
01:10:36,065 --> 01:10:39,694
But I'm not going to tell,
'cause I had you all wrong.

650
01:10:39,861 --> 01:10:43,406
No, I don't mind. Tell me.

651
01:10:44,198 --> 01:10:46,242
Now I've put my foot in it.

652
01:10:46,367 --> 01:10:49,537
No, it would be worse
if you didn't tell me.

653
01:10:50,079 --> 01:10:52,707
Okay, then: The mummy.

654
01:10:56,085 --> 01:10:57,879
Forgive me.

655
01:10:58,838 --> 01:11:01,591
It's all right.

656
01:11:03,092 --> 01:11:06,012
So you mean I'm...

657
01:11:20,693 --> 01:11:23,362
I'll say good-bye here.
Thank you so much.

658
01:11:23,488 --> 01:11:27,909
Do you really have to submit
your resignation today?

659
01:11:29,619 --> 01:11:32,205
If you could make it tomorrow,

660
01:11:32,371 --> 01:11:34,457
we could spend today...

661
01:13:04,589 --> 01:13:06,549
You're not eating anything.

662
01:13:06,757 --> 01:13:08,593
It's just...

663
01:13:09,719 --> 01:13:11,804
You look so tired.

664
01:13:11,971 --> 01:13:16,267
No, today
was really a lot of fun.

665
01:13:17,393 --> 01:13:20,897
But you snored through
the best part of the movie.

666
01:13:23,357 --> 01:13:25,192
It's just that...

667
01:13:26,277 --> 01:13:28,529
I overdid it a bit last night.

668
01:13:33,743 --> 01:13:35,536
Mr. Kimura...

669
01:13:50,259 --> 01:13:53,888
This is something...

670
01:13:54,931 --> 01:13:57,224
I can't tell anyone.

671
01:13:57,642 --> 01:13:59,936
It's too embarrassing.

672
01:14:00,561 --> 01:14:03,898
You see, the reason...

673
01:14:04,857 --> 01:14:06,817
I've worked...

674
01:14:08,611 --> 01:14:11,948
Like a mummy
these last 30 years...

675
01:14:14,325 --> 01:14:15,576
Oh, no!

676
01:14:15,743 --> 01:14:19,288
It's not that I mind you

677
01:14:19,664 --> 01:14:21,791
calling me a mummy...

678
01:14:22,667 --> 01:14:25,920
Because that's exactly right.

679
01:14:27,838 --> 01:14:30,925
I don't blame you at all.

680
01:14:33,302 --> 01:14:36,973
It's just that the reason

681
01:14:37,556 --> 01:14:40,726
I turned myself into a mummy...

682
01:14:41,978 --> 01:14:45,564
What I mean is
that I did it all...

683
01:14:46,440 --> 01:14:49,026
For my son's sake.

684
01:14:50,569 --> 01:14:54,031
But as it turns out,

685
01:14:54,490 --> 01:14:56,659
my son...

686
01:14:57,785 --> 01:15:00,204
Couldn't care in the least.

687
01:15:03,582 --> 01:15:06,877
But you can't blame it all
on your son.

688
01:15:07,670 --> 01:15:09,296
Isn't that right?

689
01:15:09,463 --> 01:15:13,134
Not unless he asked you
to become a mummy.

690
01:15:26,856 --> 01:15:29,191
Parents are all the same.

691
01:15:29,316 --> 01:15:32,445
My mom gives me
the same line sometimes.

692
01:15:32,611 --> 01:15:35,197
“All the trouble
you've put me through!”

693
01:15:35,364 --> 01:15:37,616
I'm grateful she had me,

694
01:15:37,783 --> 01:15:40,077
but babies don't ask to be born.

695
01:15:45,041 --> 01:15:48,878
But what happened to make you
bad-mouth your son to me?

696
01:15:52,757 --> 01:15:54,550
It's just...

697
01:15:58,721 --> 01:16:01,098
I knew it! You still adore him!

698
01:16:41,472 --> 01:16:44,809
No end in sight
for the electricity shortage.

699
01:16:45,017 --> 01:16:47,019
Is that right?

700
01:17:28,686 --> 01:17:32,982
This heat is due to the warmest
ocean currents in 30 years.

701
01:17:36,819 --> 01:17:38,696
Is that a fact?

702
01:17:58,632 --> 01:18:02,011
Actually, there's something...

703
01:18:03,512 --> 01:18:05,556
I'd like to tell you.

704
01:18:09,310 --> 01:18:12,521
I know I should have
told you sooner,

705
01:18:13,022 --> 01:18:17,234
but it's not
very pleasant business.

706
01:18:17,526 --> 01:18:19,862
Father, I already know.

707
01:18:20,571 --> 01:18:24,200
You see, I discussed it
with uncle today.

708
01:18:24,575 --> 01:18:28,162
We must address practical matters
to avoid complications later.

709
01:18:28,329 --> 01:18:31,540
For instance, although
we have rights as your heirs,

710
01:18:31,665 --> 01:18:34,543
you need to make those clear
to avoid disputes.

711
01:18:34,710 --> 01:18:37,880
She's taken you for 50,000 yen
in just a few days.

712
01:18:38,005 --> 01:18:40,174
Young girls these days —
- what are you...?

713
01:18:40,299 --> 01:18:42,551
Father! We respect

714
01:18:42,676 --> 01:18:44,428
your free will, all right?

715
01:18:44,553 --> 01:18:46,889
We even accept your debauchery!

716
01:18:47,056 --> 01:18:49,725
But it's common sense
to set some conditions.

717
01:18:49,892 --> 01:18:52,144
Think of kazue,

718
01:18:52,269 --> 01:18:54,396
or at least
of her family back home.

719
01:18:54,563 --> 01:18:57,775
How dare you bring home
a woman like that!

720
01:18:57,983 --> 01:19:00,778
And holding hands
with her in your room!

721
01:19:00,903 --> 01:19:04,114
I could hardly face Mrs. Hayashi
when she told me!

722
01:19:41,193 --> 01:19:43,404
Two weeks have passed

723
01:19:43,529 --> 01:19:47,199
since our protagonist
abandoned his post.

724
01:19:57,126 --> 01:19:58,627
During that time,

725
01:19:58,794 --> 01:20:01,922
various rumors
and endless speculation

726
01:20:02,047 --> 01:20:04,883
about Mr. Watanabe
have made the rounds.

727
01:20:19,773 --> 01:20:23,694
The rumors and speculation
all agree on one thing:

728
01:20:23,861 --> 01:20:26,322
Whatever ll/lr. Watanabe
is doing,

729
01:20:26,488 --> 01:20:28,782
it is very frivolous indeed.

730
01:20:30,659 --> 01:20:32,661
But in point of fact,

731
01:20:32,786 --> 01:20:35,622
watanabe
had never been this earnest

732
01:20:35,789 --> 01:20:38,125
about anything
in his entire life.

733
01:20:39,835 --> 01:20:41,670
This isn't city hall,

734
01:20:41,837 --> 01:20:46,508
where you can waste
a whole day on an hour's work!

735
01:20:46,675 --> 01:20:48,177
I just...

736
01:20:48,344 --> 01:20:51,013
Every second I waste here
costs me money.

737
01:20:51,180 --> 01:20:53,515
Then what about tonight?

738
01:20:53,682 --> 01:20:57,019
I'm pooped at night.
I'd rather sleep than go out.

739
01:20:59,730 --> 01:21:02,816
Besides, why are you
always taking me out?

740
01:21:02,983 --> 01:21:04,234
It's just...

741
01:21:05,027 --> 01:21:08,614
Let's stop doing this.
It doesn't feel right.

742
01:21:08,989 --> 01:21:12,868
Just one last time tonight.

743
01:21:13,035 --> 01:21:15,412
No, or it'll never end!

744
01:21:16,663 --> 01:21:18,290
Now, excuse me.

745
01:21:46,402 --> 01:21:48,529
Tonight's the last time, okay?

746
01:22:51,258 --> 01:22:53,635
Shall we go for a stroll?

747
01:22:53,802 --> 01:22:55,345
I've had enough.

748
01:22:55,471 --> 01:22:59,433
Next it'll be a sweets shop,
then a Sushi or noodle joint.

749
01:23:00,392 --> 01:23:03,228
What's the point
of these endless rounds?

750
01:23:04,188 --> 01:23:07,357
I feel bad saying this
when you pay for everything,

751
01:23:07,483 --> 01:23:09,485
but I've had enough.

752
01:23:09,776 --> 01:23:13,155
We've run out of things
to talk about.

753
01:23:17,034 --> 01:23:19,244
There's that face again.

754
01:23:20,787 --> 01:23:24,041
The truth is
you give me the creeps.

755
01:23:34,343 --> 01:23:37,971
What's going on? Why do you
chase me around like this?

756
01:23:38,305 --> 01:23:41,183
- It's just — - it's just what?

757
01:23:41,517 --> 01:23:43,185
It's just...

758
01:23:43,352 --> 01:23:47,481
I enjoy spending time
with you this way.

759
01:23:47,648 --> 01:23:49,650
A may-December romance?
Forget it.

760
01:23:49,816 --> 01:23:51,276
No, no!

761
01:23:51,860 --> 01:23:53,654
It's just that I...

762
01:23:53,820 --> 01:23:57,950
Just spit it out
instead of sputtering like that.

763
01:24:02,913 --> 01:24:04,998
- Are you mad?
- No.

764
01:24:13,048 --> 01:24:17,553
I don't even know myself...

765
01:24:18,470 --> 01:24:22,349
Why I keep following you around.

766
01:24:23,809 --> 01:24:27,187
All I know is...

767
01:24:50,586 --> 01:24:52,004
Listen:

768
01:24:52,546 --> 01:24:54,590
I'm going to die soon.

769
01:24:55,424 --> 01:24:58,510
I've got stomach cancer.
It's right here.

770
01:25:02,681 --> 01:25:05,767
Do you see?

771
01:25:06,768 --> 01:25:08,770
No matter how I struggle,

772
01:25:08,937 --> 01:25:11,857
I've only got six months
to a year left.

773
01:25:12,691 --> 01:25:15,277
When I found out,

774
01:25:15,444 --> 01:25:17,988
I suddenly... in here...

775
01:25:18,614 --> 01:25:20,115
Now I remember:

776
01:25:20,282 --> 01:25:24,786
I nearly drowned in a pond once
when I was a child.

777
01:25:24,995 --> 01:25:27,331
I felt exactly
the same way then.

778
01:25:27,497 --> 01:25:29,750
Everything's going black.

779
01:25:30,042 --> 01:25:32,294
I writhe and thrash around,

780
01:25:32,794 --> 01:25:35,464
but there's nothing
to hold on to...

781
01:25:35,631 --> 01:25:38,175
- Except you.
- What about your son?

782
01:25:38,342 --> 01:25:40,469
Don't talk to me about him!

783
01:25:41,637 --> 01:25:43,639
I have no son.

784
01:25:45,307 --> 01:25:47,726
- I'm all alone.
- But...

785
01:25:47,934 --> 01:25:50,479
No, you don't understand.

786
01:25:51,938 --> 01:25:55,192
My son is somewhere far away.

787
01:25:56,943 --> 01:25:58,987
Just as my mom and pop were

788
01:25:59,154 --> 01:26:02,991
when I was drowning
in that pond.

789
01:26:03,700 --> 01:26:05,494
Remembering it now,

790
01:26:05,952 --> 01:26:08,997
it's even more painful
than it was then.

791
01:26:09,748 --> 01:26:12,751
But why someone like me?

792
01:26:12,959 --> 01:26:15,045
It's just that...

793
01:26:15,671 --> 01:26:19,257
When I look at you,
I get a warm feeling...

794
01:26:19,424 --> 01:26:22,135
Right here.

795
01:26:22,678 --> 01:26:26,223
Even an old mummy like me.

796
01:26:33,188 --> 01:26:36,775
What I mean is,
you've been really kind to me.

797
01:26:37,567 --> 01:26:39,736
No, that's not it.

798
01:26:39,903 --> 01:26:43,448
You're young and healthy,
and that's why...

799
01:26:48,995 --> 01:26:50,747
I mean...

800
01:26:52,082 --> 01:26:55,877
What makes you so lively?

801
01:26:56,044 --> 01:26:58,046
You're just so full of life.

802
01:26:58,213 --> 01:27:00,632
That's why I...

803
01:27:00,799 --> 01:27:03,719
That's why this mummy
envies you!

804
01:27:04,886 --> 01:27:08,598
Before I die,
even if only for one day,

805
01:27:08,765 --> 01:27:11,810
I want to be like that.

806
01:27:12,018 --> 01:27:15,897
Until I've done that,
I can't let myself die.

807
01:27:16,064 --> 01:27:18,066
You see, I just...

808
01:27:18,233 --> 01:27:21,069
I just want something to...

809
01:27:21,236 --> 01:27:23,238
I want to do something.

810
01:27:23,447 --> 01:27:27,075
I just don't know what.

811
01:27:27,242 --> 01:27:29,244
But you know.

812
01:27:29,411 --> 01:27:31,747
No, maybe you don't, but...

813
01:27:31,913 --> 01:27:33,290
But I don't!

814
01:27:33,457 --> 01:27:35,917
Tell me, how can I be like you?

815
01:27:36,084 --> 01:27:39,880
- But all I do is work and eat!
- What else?

816
01:27:40,005 --> 01:27:41,840
That's all!

817
01:27:48,430 --> 01:27:49,973
It's true.

818
01:27:50,098 --> 01:27:52,851
All I do is make
these little things.

819
01:28:02,277 --> 01:28:04,863
Just making these
is so much fun.

820
01:28:05,030 --> 01:28:09,034
I feel like I'm making friends
with every baby in Japan.

821
01:28:11,244 --> 01:28:14,039
Why don't you try
making something too?

822
01:28:15,248 --> 01:28:18,210
What could I possibly make
at that office?

823
01:28:19,586 --> 01:28:22,380
Yeah, it's hopeless there.

824
01:28:22,547 --> 01:28:25,467
You should quit
and go somewhere...

825
01:28:33,725 --> 01:28:35,977
It's too late.

826
01:29:10,011 --> 01:29:13,014
No... it's not too late.

827
01:29:15,559 --> 01:29:17,227
It's not hopeless.

828
01:29:17,394 --> 01:29:19,896
Even there,
there's something I can do.

829
01:29:20,063 --> 01:29:22,190
I just have to find the will.

830
01:29:30,407 --> 01:29:34,160
There's something I can do.

831
01:30:11,072 --> 01:30:14,200
It's only a matter of time
before he resigns.

832
01:30:14,367 --> 01:30:17,245
His son came by yesterday
about his retirement bonus.

833
01:30:17,579 --> 01:30:20,582
Which means
you'll finally be section chief.

834
01:30:20,707 --> 01:30:22,918
Well, you never know.

835
01:31:05,919 --> 01:31:07,587
Good morning.

836
01:31:18,264 --> 01:31:19,474
Section chief.

837
01:31:23,269 --> 01:31:26,523
Ono, take care of this.

838
01:31:28,608 --> 01:31:30,694
Petition to repair
and fill in culvert

839
01:31:30,860 --> 01:31:33,363
kuroe women's association

840
01:31:33,530 --> 01:31:37,283
to be assigned to public works

841
01:31:37,492 --> 01:31:39,661
is this really a job
for public works?

842
01:31:39,828 --> 01:31:43,331
Actually, this is
precisely the kind of job

843
01:31:43,915 --> 01:31:48,378
that public affairs
should oversee.

844
01:31:48,628 --> 01:31:51,339
Public works can't do it alone.

845
01:31:51,506 --> 01:31:54,926
Parks and sewage
must also take action.

846
01:31:57,512 --> 01:32:00,056
Get me a car, will you?

847
01:32:00,473 --> 01:32:03,101
I'm going out
to survey the site.

848
01:32:04,185 --> 01:32:06,688
Put together a report today.

849
01:32:06,855 --> 01:32:09,315
Sir, I'm not sure
that's possible.

850
01:32:09,482 --> 01:32:12,193
It is if you set your mind to it.

851
01:32:36,217 --> 01:32:38,636
Five months later.

852
01:32:38,887 --> 01:32:42,223
The protagonist
of our story has died

853
01:33:27,644 --> 01:33:30,772
Let us see the deputy mayor.
He must be here.

854
01:33:31,064 --> 01:33:33,608
Just five minutes, please.

855
01:33:45,370 --> 01:33:48,081
Reporters.
What should I tell them?

856
01:34:14,065 --> 01:34:18,153
- Your suspicions are groundless.
- Are they?

857
01:34:18,319 --> 01:34:21,156
Our claim is based
on thorough research.

858
01:34:21,322 --> 01:34:23,032
Sir, the official story

859
01:34:23,158 --> 01:34:25,994
is that the parks department
and local councilman

860
01:34:26,244 --> 01:34:28,997
built that park
with your backing,

861
01:34:29,164 --> 01:34:32,000
but wasn't it really
Mr. Watanabe?

862
01:34:32,167 --> 01:34:33,626
That's the word.

863
01:34:33,751 --> 01:34:36,963
Mr. Watanabe
was chief of public affairs.

864
01:34:37,130 --> 01:34:40,300
Building parks is
the park department's job.

865
01:34:40,466 --> 01:34:42,135
We understand that.

866
01:34:42,302 --> 01:34:45,388
But the plan almost
fizzled out several times.

867
01:34:45,555 --> 01:34:48,683
We're talking about the man
who saw it to completion.

868
01:34:48,850 --> 01:34:52,478
Local residents believe that
that was Mr. Watanabe.

869
01:34:52,645 --> 01:34:54,856
They're deeply concerned
about the fact

870
01:34:55,023 --> 01:34:57,358
that he died
in the park he built.

871
01:34:57,525 --> 01:34:59,527
What's that supposed to mean?

872
01:34:59,652 --> 01:35:03,364
Well, they were suspicious
even before that happened.

873
01:35:03,531 --> 01:35:07,660
For example, in your speech
at the park's opening ceremony,

874
01:35:07,827 --> 01:35:10,705
you never mentioned
Mr. Watanabe once.

875
01:35:10,872 --> 01:35:13,166
They say it wasn't
a congratulatory address.

876
01:35:13,333 --> 01:35:14,751
Then what was it?

877
01:35:14,918 --> 01:35:16,920
A campaign speech.

878
01:35:19,589 --> 01:35:21,341
Furthermore...

879
01:35:21,507 --> 01:35:24,135
He was completely ignored
during the ceremony

880
01:35:24,302 --> 01:35:26,387
and seated in the back corner.

881
01:35:26,554 --> 01:35:30,683
In short, people feel
a lot of sympathy for the guy.

882
01:35:31,059 --> 01:35:33,353
So the fact that
he died in the park

883
01:35:33,519 --> 01:35:35,605
has led to some
interesting speculation.

884
01:35:36,648 --> 01:35:40,485
It's seen
as an act of silent protest

885
01:35:40,652 --> 01:35:42,695
against top city officials.

886
01:35:42,820 --> 01:35:47,200
So you're saying
watanabe committed suicide

887
01:35:47,325 --> 01:35:51,704
or at least let himself
freeze to death?

888
01:35:52,872 --> 01:35:54,499
More or less.

889
01:35:55,458 --> 01:35:56,918
I see.

890
01:35:57,085 --> 01:35:59,754
Don't forget it was also
snowing last night.

891
01:35:59,921 --> 01:36:02,882
Sounds like a scene
right out of a play.

892
01:36:03,007 --> 01:36:04,050
However...

893
01:36:05,134 --> 01:36:08,388
An autopsy
has clearly established

894
01:36:08,513 --> 01:36:11,140
the cause of watanabe's death.

895
01:36:11,391 --> 01:36:15,395
He certainly didn't commit suicide.
Nor did he freeze to death.

896
01:36:15,895 --> 01:36:18,731
- He died of stomach cancer.
- Stomach cancer?

897
01:36:19,065 --> 01:36:21,943
That's right.
Internal hemorrhaging.

898
01:36:22,443 --> 01:36:26,614
Watanabe died suddenly,
without warning.

899
01:36:27,198 --> 01:36:28,992
If you have any doubts...

900
01:36:29,158 --> 01:36:32,912
Ono, give them
the name of the hospital.

901
01:37:47,362 --> 01:37:49,280
It's just not right.

902
01:37:50,990 --> 01:37:54,369
The way these reporters think,
and their tactlessness...

903
01:37:54,869 --> 01:37:56,329
Actually...

904
01:37:56,496 --> 01:37:59,415
It applies
to the general public too.

905
01:38:00,333 --> 01:38:05,630
They just don't understand
how government works.

906
01:38:09,717 --> 01:38:12,887
They're woefully ignorant
of how we function.

907
01:38:13,221 --> 01:38:16,641
Take that little park in kuroe.

908
01:38:17,141 --> 01:38:19,936
Some seem to believe

909
01:38:20,103 --> 01:38:22,105
that watanabe built it,

910
01:38:22,230 --> 01:38:24,399
but that's ridiculous.

911
01:38:24,899 --> 01:38:27,193
Maybe I shouldn't say this

912
01:38:28,653 --> 01:38:31,072
here at his wake,

913
01:38:31,239 --> 01:38:34,909
in front of his son
and relatives...

914
01:38:35,910 --> 01:38:37,995
But I'll go ahead,

915
01:38:38,121 --> 01:38:41,207
because I think watanabe
would agree with me.

916
01:38:42,291 --> 01:38:46,546
Certainly, watanabe
went to great pains

917
01:38:47,004 --> 01:38:50,007
to get that park built.

918
01:38:50,425 --> 01:38:53,970
I take my hat off
to his enthusiasm.

919
01:38:54,762 --> 01:38:59,058
But his efforts were part
of his official duties.

920
01:39:02,937 --> 01:39:06,441
The idea he went beyond
the scope of his office

921
01:39:06,607 --> 01:39:08,818
to facilitate citizens' desires

922
01:39:09,026 --> 01:39:12,071
and actually built
the park himself

923
01:39:12,238 --> 01:39:15,491
is nonsense to those
who understand our bureaucracy.

924
01:39:18,494 --> 01:39:22,081
Watanabe himself
would grimace at the idea.

925
01:39:27,795 --> 01:39:29,464
However...

926
01:39:30,631 --> 01:39:33,384
We may be partly to blame

927
01:39:33,634 --> 01:39:36,929
for the fact
people are saying such things.

928
01:39:37,221 --> 01:39:39,682
All eyes were on
that epoch-making project

929
01:39:39,849 --> 01:39:42,143
as it was rushed to completion.

930
01:39:42,310 --> 01:39:45,813
Maybe we should have
singled out someone's service.

931
01:39:46,230 --> 01:39:47,773
For instance...

932
01:39:48,274 --> 01:39:50,568
The chief
of the parks department.

933
01:39:51,319 --> 01:39:53,654
Or his superior...

934
01:39:54,822 --> 01:39:57,033
The chief of public works.

935
01:39:58,784 --> 01:40:02,246
If you say so, Mr. Deputy mayor,

936
01:40:02,371 --> 01:40:04,499
but here's what I think.

937
01:40:04,665 --> 01:40:07,919
The head
of the parks department and I

938
01:40:08,085 --> 01:40:10,588
only fulfilled the duties
of our offices.

939
01:40:10,796 --> 01:40:14,342
But when I think
how difficult it was

940
01:40:14,634 --> 01:40:19,222
to navigate the intricate politics
of the city council

941
01:40:19,388 --> 01:40:22,183
and realize
the park's construction,

942
01:40:22,350 --> 01:40:26,145
it is you, deputy mayor,
who should be singled out.

943
01:40:27,271 --> 01:40:29,148
Now, now...

944
01:40:30,358 --> 01:40:33,027
Some people have even criticized

945
01:40:33,152 --> 01:40:35,363
my speech
at the opening ceremony.

946
01:40:35,571 --> 01:40:37,240
Isn't that right, ono?

947
01:40:37,406 --> 01:40:40,451
They called it
a campaign speech!

948
01:40:43,371 --> 01:40:47,291
Excuse me.
The residents of kuroe

949
01:40:47,500 --> 01:40:51,212
are here asking to burn incense
for the deceased.

950
01:42:56,879 --> 01:42:59,840
Kiichi, come. You too, mitsuo.

951
01:45:04,256 --> 01:45:06,217
It sure is cold.

952
01:45:06,967 --> 01:45:08,844
May I pour one for you?

953
01:45:10,679 --> 01:45:12,890
I'll get some warm sake.

954
01:45:13,307 --> 01:45:15,142
What do you say?

955
01:45:15,267 --> 01:45:18,813
Why don't you all move
closer down here?

956
01:45:18,938 --> 01:45:20,397
Why not?

957
01:45:22,149 --> 01:45:24,068
- Over here, please.
- Thanks.

958
01:45:24,735 --> 01:45:26,987
Mr. Hayashi.

959
01:45:42,670 --> 01:45:44,088
Mr. Ono.

960
01:45:46,674 --> 01:45:49,552
Did all the big shots
go off to a meeting?

961
01:45:49,802 --> 01:45:51,220
Yes.

962
01:45:52,221 --> 01:45:55,182
No, they just couldn't stand
to stay here.

963
01:45:57,268 --> 01:45:59,311
I don't care what anyone says.

964
01:45:59,436 --> 01:46:02,731
It was Mr. Watanabe
who built that park.

965
01:46:03,315 --> 01:46:06,902
The deputy mayor
and his people know it.

966
01:46:07,319 --> 01:46:11,073
That's going too far.
As the deputy mayor said...

967
01:46:11,198 --> 01:46:12,700
That's right.

968
01:46:12,825 --> 01:46:15,828
I'm not saying this because
I'm in the parks department,

969
01:46:15,953 --> 01:46:19,415
but we drew up the plans
and oversaw construction.

970
01:46:19,874 --> 01:46:24,003
- That's not what I meant.
- Now, now...

971
01:46:24,587 --> 01:46:27,047
I understand how you feel, but...

972
01:46:27,214 --> 01:46:30,092
The point is
he was in public affairs.

973
01:46:30,259 --> 01:46:34,054
Did he think
he could just build a park?

974
01:46:34,221 --> 01:46:36,432
We have to respect
each other's turf or...

975
01:46:36,599 --> 01:46:39,852
If I had to say
how that park got built,

976
01:46:40,019 --> 01:46:42,730
I'd say it was coincidence.

977
01:46:42,897 --> 01:46:44,565
Hear me out.

978
01:46:44,732 --> 01:46:49,236
If a looming election hadn't put
pressure on the local councilman,

979
01:46:50,029 --> 01:46:52,323
and if profiteers hadn't lobbied

980
01:46:52,448 --> 01:46:54,992
to build
a red-light district there,

981
01:46:55,117 --> 01:46:58,954
that reclamation work
wouldn't have proceeded so quickly.

982
01:46:59,079 --> 01:47:00,456
That's right.

983
01:47:00,623 --> 01:47:02,666
Exactly right.

984
01:47:03,751 --> 01:47:06,420
There's one thing
I can't figure out.

985
01:47:07,755 --> 01:47:12,217
Why would someone like him

986
01:47:12,384 --> 01:47:15,262
suddenly change like that?

987
01:47:16,931 --> 01:47:19,058
What could it have been?

988
01:47:22,937 --> 01:47:25,147
I agree.
It's a complete mystery.

989
01:47:25,314 --> 01:47:27,066
It really is.

990
01:47:27,358 --> 01:47:29,777
I mean...

991
01:47:29,944 --> 01:47:32,529
With the benefit of hindsight,

992
01:47:32,905 --> 01:47:35,866
it would seem he knew

993
01:47:35,991 --> 01:47:38,661
he had stomach cancer,
and that's why...

994
01:47:39,703 --> 01:47:41,997
We were just discussing

995
01:47:42,122 --> 01:47:45,334
whether your father knew
he had stomach cancer.

996
01:47:45,501 --> 01:47:48,879
Well, I think he would have
told me if he did.

997
01:47:49,046 --> 01:47:50,172
Indeed.

998
01:47:50,339 --> 01:47:53,258
I believe my father
was fortunate to die

999
01:47:53,384 --> 01:47:55,886
without realizing he had cancer.

1000
01:47:56,053 --> 01:47:58,764
A diagnosis like that
is a death sentence.

1001
01:47:58,931 --> 01:48:00,265
I see.

1002
01:48:00,391 --> 01:48:02,977
Well, that rules out
saito's theory.

1003
01:48:03,227 --> 01:48:05,104
What theory is that?

1004
01:48:05,437 --> 01:48:09,483
Well, five months ago he went
through a sudden transformation.

1005
01:48:09,650 --> 01:48:11,318
That's for sure.

1006
01:48:11,443 --> 01:48:15,447
And none of us has
any clue what caused it.

1007
01:48:15,823 --> 01:48:18,409
Well, that was a woman's doing.

1008
01:48:18,826 --> 01:48:21,328
With a young mistress,

1009
01:48:21,495 --> 01:48:25,332
the hormonal effect can temporarily
rejuvenate an old man.

1010
01:48:25,499 --> 01:48:27,501
Happens all the time.

1011
01:48:27,668 --> 01:48:30,170
It suddenly put a sheen
back on his cheeks.

1012
01:48:30,337 --> 01:48:32,715
Actually...

1013
01:48:32,881 --> 01:48:36,135
We heard rumors
at that time of a romance.

1014
01:48:36,552 --> 01:48:39,054
That explains the rakish hat.

1015
01:48:39,221 --> 01:48:40,597
Sure does.

1016
01:48:40,764 --> 01:48:43,684
That surprised
the hell out of me.

1017
01:48:47,062 --> 01:48:50,065
Sir, I'm not sure
that's possible.

1018
01:48:50,232 --> 01:48:52,985
It is if you set your mind to it.

1019
01:49:03,704 --> 01:49:05,289
But wait.

1020
01:49:40,324 --> 01:49:42,284
In any case,

1021
01:49:42,451 --> 01:49:46,705
his enthusiasm
was a bit over the top.

1022
01:49:46,872 --> 01:49:49,249
Yes. That's very true.

1023
01:49:50,250 --> 01:49:52,169
I don't mean to argue,

1024
01:49:52,294 --> 01:49:56,131
but a woman alone
can't account for...

1025
01:49:56,256 --> 01:49:57,925
- But — - dear.

1026
01:49:58,092 --> 01:50:00,427
The thing is...

1027
01:50:03,097 --> 01:50:05,265
It just doesn't make sense.

1028
01:50:09,269 --> 01:50:12,439
Not to change the subject,

1029
01:50:12,773 --> 01:50:16,110
but there were times
when his extraordinary zeal

1030
01:50:16,235 --> 01:50:18,403
threatened to derail it all.

1031
01:50:18,779 --> 01:50:22,282
That's city hall for you.
Gotta guard your turf.

1032
01:50:22,449 --> 01:50:26,036
That's right.
The biggest mystery to me

1033
01:50:26,203 --> 01:50:29,706
is how a 30-year veteran
could suddenly forget the rules.

1034
01:50:29,873 --> 01:50:31,834
It's because he...

1035
01:50:38,048 --> 01:50:39,591
In any event...

1036
01:50:39,758 --> 01:50:43,303
Pushing his plan
on all the other departments

1037
01:50:43,637 --> 01:50:47,307
ensured that everyone
would dig in their heels.

1038
01:50:47,474 --> 01:50:50,060
My boss was
none too happy about it.

1039
01:50:50,185 --> 01:50:53,355
Building parks is
the parks department's job.

1040
01:50:54,815 --> 01:50:57,985
We have our own proposals
for new parks.

1041
01:50:58,485 --> 01:51:01,155
Couldn't you reconsider?

1042
01:51:01,321 --> 01:51:03,824
This site is really terrible.

1043
01:51:03,991 --> 01:51:07,077
But building a park
isn't as simple

1044
01:51:07,286 --> 01:51:10,164
as you outline in your proposal.

1045
01:51:10,330 --> 01:51:12,875
No, this proposal is just...

1046
01:51:13,041 --> 01:51:14,626
I understand.

1047
01:51:15,002 --> 01:51:16,670
Tell you what:

1048
01:51:17,087 --> 01:51:19,631
I'll study
your proposal thoroughly.

1049
01:51:23,886 --> 01:51:27,347
But you know, in the end

1050
01:51:27,514 --> 01:51:30,851
even the parks chief caved in
to watanabe's tenacity...

1051
01:51:31,018 --> 01:51:32,686
You've got a point there.

1052
01:51:32,853 --> 01:51:35,147
He really didn't know
what to do.

1053
01:52:40,587 --> 01:52:42,381
He really was something.

1054
01:52:42,547 --> 01:52:45,634
He would wait days
for the answer he wanted.

1055
01:52:45,801 --> 01:52:48,053
Our section chief
would sneak away

1056
01:52:48,178 --> 01:52:50,389
the second
he saw watanabe's face.

1057
01:52:50,514 --> 01:52:51,682
That's right.

1058
01:53:03,068 --> 01:53:06,989
Section chief!

1059
01:53:09,449 --> 01:53:12,786
He even pleaded
with underlings like me.

1060
01:53:12,953 --> 01:53:15,497
It was unbelievable!

1061
01:53:15,789 --> 01:53:18,083
Won't you please...?

1062
01:53:20,794 --> 01:53:22,796
Isn't there some way...?

1063
01:53:46,320 --> 01:53:48,238
Finally we couldn't
stand by any longer.

1064
01:53:49,740 --> 01:53:53,577
That's right.
We took pity on him too.

1065
01:53:53,744 --> 01:53:57,414
But you guys in general affairs

1066
01:53:57,998 --> 01:54:00,167
were the worst of all.

1067
01:54:00,292 --> 01:54:02,002
Wait a minute!

1068
01:54:02,127 --> 01:54:05,422
I went around with him,
so I know.

1069
01:54:05,589 --> 01:54:09,092
You made us beg for two weeks.
I won't forget that.

1070
01:54:09,301 --> 01:54:11,345
Sorry about that.

1071
01:54:12,095 --> 01:54:13,847
However...

1072
01:54:14,014 --> 01:54:16,558
Remember
the most surprising thing?

1073
01:54:19,436 --> 01:54:22,272
- Oh, right.
- That was a shocker.

1074
01:54:56,681 --> 01:54:59,267
Deputy mayor's office

1075
01:55:07,567 --> 01:55:10,570
But you know
what was even more surprising?

1076
01:55:10,737 --> 01:55:12,906
The incident
in the deputy mayor's office?

1077
01:55:13,240 --> 01:55:16,701
- I heard about that!
- That was something!

1078
01:55:19,371 --> 01:55:23,166
A section chief openly
defying the deputy mayor...

1079
01:55:23,333 --> 01:55:25,460
Unprecedented at city hall!

1080
01:55:34,761 --> 01:55:38,056
Listen, about that new park...

1081
01:55:38,849 --> 01:55:41,268
It's one thing
to show initiative,

1082
01:55:41,435 --> 01:55:45,939
but you don't want people
thinking you're a publicity hound.

1083
01:55:46,648 --> 01:55:50,277
And the city council's
got problems of its own.

1084
01:55:50,944 --> 01:55:55,240
I think it's best
just to let the proposal die.

1085
01:55:56,450 --> 01:56:00,036
Last night there was
a banquet at nakagawa.

1086
01:56:00,287 --> 01:56:03,623
I tell you, geisha
these days are appalling.

1087
01:56:03,790 --> 01:56:06,376
One of them
spent the evening sulking

1088
01:56:06,543 --> 01:56:08,295
and didn't say a word.

1089
01:56:08,462 --> 01:56:12,466
The proprietress said she was
a student working part-time!

1090
01:56:14,009 --> 01:56:15,677
That's a good one!

1091
01:56:21,433 --> 01:56:24,478
Couldn't you please...

1092
01:56:26,563 --> 01:56:28,482
Reconsider the proposal?

1093
01:56:33,987 --> 01:56:37,324
What did you just say?

1094
01:56:43,830 --> 01:56:45,332
I mean...

1095
01:56:46,625 --> 01:56:50,170
About that park...

1096
01:56:52,297 --> 01:56:55,258
Won't you reconsider
your decision?

1097
01:57:39,052 --> 01:57:41,179
But the thing is,

1098
01:57:41,346 --> 01:57:43,765
when you look at the results,

1099
01:57:43,932 --> 01:57:45,976
was it worth taking it that far?

1100
01:57:46,142 --> 01:57:48,353
No, it was crazy!

1101
01:57:48,478 --> 01:57:52,857
Everyone at city hall
is guarding his own turf.

1102
01:57:53,358 --> 01:57:57,904
But didn't the deputy mayor
end up reconsidering?

1103
01:57:58,029 --> 01:58:00,323
That's because
the councilman needled him.

1104
01:58:00,490 --> 01:58:02,242
It was just coincidence.

1105
01:58:02,409 --> 01:58:05,662
You're attributing everything
to watanabe's “zeal.”

1106
01:58:05,829 --> 01:58:08,081
Don't be so sentimental!

1107
01:58:08,456 --> 01:58:09,791
Sentimental!

1108
01:58:10,250 --> 01:58:13,420
Is that so?
I don't see it that way.

1109
01:58:14,421 --> 01:58:17,716
If all of you can't
understand his dedication,

1110
01:58:17,882 --> 01:58:19,634
the world's a dark place indeed.

1111
01:58:19,801 --> 01:58:21,595
It is a dark place.

1112
01:58:24,556 --> 01:58:28,518
From just looking
at Mr. Watanabe you could tell

1113
01:58:28,810 --> 01:58:32,772
that only his work
was keeping him alive.

1114
01:58:33,648 --> 01:58:36,109
Didn't it look that way to you?

1115
01:58:36,943 --> 01:58:40,447
Sometimes it even
gave me chills.

1116
01:58:42,407 --> 01:58:44,409
When was it?

1117
01:58:44,868 --> 01:58:46,328
I was...

1118
01:59:31,164 --> 01:59:34,417
That reminds me
of when I'd see him

1119
01:59:34,584 --> 01:59:36,461
at the construction site.

1120
02:01:12,932 --> 02:01:14,934
That look in his eyes!

1121
02:01:15,101 --> 02:01:19,481
As if he were watching
his child or grandchild,

1122
02:01:19,731 --> 02:01:22,317
the apple of his eye.

1123
02:01:22,525 --> 02:01:24,277
Of course.

1124
02:01:24,569 --> 02:01:27,489
He nurtured that park
like you would a child.

1125
02:01:27,989 --> 02:01:29,699
So what are you saying?

1126
02:01:30,950 --> 02:01:34,621
Like I said before:

1127
02:01:35,288 --> 02:01:38,958
Whatever anyone says,
Mr. Watanabe built that park...

1128
02:01:39,125 --> 02:01:42,337
But if the councilman
and deputy mayor

1129
02:01:42,504 --> 02:01:44,589
hadn't been facing reelection,

1130
02:01:44,756 --> 02:01:47,091
the plan wouldn't
have become a reality.

1131
02:01:47,258 --> 02:01:51,471
Watanabe had no role
in what was going on higher up.

1132
02:01:51,638 --> 02:01:54,140
That's not actually true.

1133
02:01:54,307 --> 02:01:55,725
Really?

1134
02:01:55,850 --> 02:01:59,020
The folks who wanted
that red-light district

1135
02:01:59,187 --> 02:02:03,483
definitely thought watanabe was
blocking their way. Listen to this:

1136
02:02:20,416 --> 02:02:22,001
Section chief.

1137
02:02:23,211 --> 02:02:26,506
Are you section chief
of public affairs?

1138
02:02:26,631 --> 02:02:28,174
Yes.

1139
02:02:32,387 --> 02:02:34,472
Just the man I wanted to see.

1140
02:02:36,891 --> 02:02:40,395
Old man, you'd better
mind your own business.

1141
02:02:40,895 --> 02:02:44,065
Just what are you trying to...

1142
02:02:44,232 --> 02:02:45,984
Don't play dumb!

1143
02:02:50,488 --> 02:02:52,323
No hard feelings.

1144
02:02:52,490 --> 02:02:55,076
Just shut up and back off.

1145
02:02:58,079 --> 02:02:59,664
Say something!

1146
02:02:59,914 --> 02:03:01,749
You value your life?

1147
02:03:21,811 --> 02:03:24,105
This is watanabe.

1148
02:04:42,183 --> 02:04:44,268
I just don't get it.

1149
02:04:45,061 --> 02:04:48,856
Why would someone like him...

1150
02:04:49,023 --> 02:04:51,192
I just don't...

1151
02:04:53,319 --> 02:04:55,029
Get it.

1152
02:05:03,121 --> 02:05:07,542
No, I'm sure Mr. Watanabe knew
he had stomach cancer.

1153
02:05:07,709 --> 02:05:09,127
But...

1154
02:05:10,211 --> 02:05:14,549
I just suddenly
remembered something.

1155
02:05:28,771 --> 02:05:31,065
This is too much!

1156
02:05:31,232 --> 02:05:33,401
We've been at this
for two weeks.

1157
02:05:33,568 --> 02:05:35,570
We've explained it
to them 20 times.

1158
02:05:35,695 --> 02:05:38,489
They could at least tell us
if there are funds.

1159
02:05:38,614 --> 02:05:42,660
General affairs is just being sadistic.
It's not like it's their personal money.

1160
02:05:42,827 --> 02:05:44,912
Why can't they be
more agreeable?

1161
02:05:45,079 --> 02:05:46,789
Well, you know...

1162
02:05:46,956 --> 02:05:49,333
Doesn't it make you furious

1163
02:05:49,584 --> 02:05:52,086
to be treated
with such contempt?

1164
02:05:55,757 --> 02:05:58,426
I can't afford to hate people.

1165
02:06:01,095 --> 02:06:04,182
I haven't got that kind of time.

1166
02:06:20,865 --> 02:06:21,865
You mean...

1167
02:06:21,949 --> 02:06:25,328
Wait! Now that you mention it...

1168
02:06:26,037 --> 02:06:28,164
That reminds me...

1169
02:06:29,373 --> 02:06:31,793
Of something.

1170
02:06:47,100 --> 02:06:49,811
How beautiful!

1171
02:06:58,069 --> 02:07:00,029
Truly beautiful.

1172
02:07:02,990 --> 02:07:05,243
A sunset.

1173
02:07:05,409 --> 02:07:08,579
I don't think I've really
looked at one in 30 years.

1174
02:07:16,170 --> 02:07:19,382
But I haven't got time
for this now.

1175
02:07:25,179 --> 02:07:27,181
He knew!

1176
02:07:27,348 --> 02:07:30,184
He knew he didn't have
long left to live...

1177
02:07:30,351 --> 02:07:33,521
It makes everything
clear as day.

1178
02:07:33,688 --> 02:07:35,398
There's no other explanation.

1179
02:07:35,565 --> 02:07:38,693
That explains
his extraordinary passion

1180
02:07:38,860 --> 02:07:41,237
and his strange behavior.

1181
02:07:41,696 --> 02:07:43,781
Now what he did
makes perfect sense!

1182
02:07:43,948 --> 02:07:46,534
Absolutely.
We'd have done the same.

1183
02:07:51,038 --> 02:07:54,458
But any of us
could die at any moment.

1184
02:08:07,555 --> 02:08:09,223
Listen...

1185
02:08:10,224 --> 02:08:13,895
Subsection chief.

1186
02:08:17,231 --> 02:08:19,442
I mean you...

1187
02:08:19,609 --> 02:08:23,321
The new section chief
of public affairs.

1188
02:08:27,575 --> 02:08:30,786
Section chief!
Are you listening?

1189
02:08:31,746 --> 02:08:35,082
I haven't been promoted yet.

1190
02:08:43,257 --> 02:08:44,759
See here!

1191
02:08:45,468 --> 02:08:48,054
- Ono!
- Cut it out.

1192
02:08:48,179 --> 02:08:51,641
What did you say a minute ago?

1193
02:08:52,433 --> 02:08:56,604
“We'd have done the same.”

1194
02:08:58,439 --> 02:09:00,358
Don't make me laugh.

1195
02:09:00,483 --> 02:09:02,276
Hey, that's enough now.

1196
02:09:02,443 --> 02:09:06,989
You think you could have done
what Mr. Watanabe did?

1197
02:09:08,449 --> 02:09:10,952
Don't make me laugh.

1198
02:09:11,619 --> 02:09:14,497
Listen, ohara...

1199
02:09:15,706 --> 02:09:19,794
The thing is...

1200
02:09:20,461 --> 02:09:23,130
I may look dumb, but...

1201
02:09:23,297 --> 02:09:25,299
Don't you think...

1202
02:09:25,466 --> 02:09:29,679
Okay, I only went
to night school...

1203
02:09:29,887 --> 02:09:35,226
- So I'll never make section chief!
- Watanabe was a great man!

1204
02:09:35,518 --> 02:09:38,396
No, great's not the right word.

1205
02:09:38,854 --> 02:09:41,232
- But you, ono?
- What's the right word?

1206
02:09:41,399 --> 02:09:45,236
- Don't make me laugh.
- Compared to him...

1207
02:09:45,903 --> 02:09:49,907
Compared to Mr. Watanabe,
the rest of us...

1208
02:09:51,701 --> 02:09:54,370
We're worthless scum!

1209
02:09:56,372 --> 02:09:59,250
Including you!

1210
02:09:59,417 --> 02:10:01,502
That's going too far.

1211
02:10:04,672 --> 02:10:07,008
We may be scum...

1212
02:10:08,175 --> 02:10:12,930
But some of us start out
at city hall as good people.

1213
02:10:13,264 --> 02:10:16,183
But the longer you stay...

1214
02:10:16,392 --> 02:10:18,185
I didn't used to be...

1215
02:10:20,855 --> 02:10:24,608
You're not supposed to do
anything at city hall.

1216
02:10:24,775 --> 02:10:28,195
Doing anything
is considered radical!

1217
02:10:28,362 --> 02:10:31,907
We have to act like we're doing
something while doing nothing.

1218
02:10:32,074 --> 02:10:35,036
- That's right.
- In our department too!

1219
02:10:35,202 --> 02:10:37,204
The thing is,

1220
02:10:37,371 --> 02:10:41,417
just to get a garbage can
somewhere emptied out,

1221
02:10:41,751 --> 02:10:46,047
you need enough paperwork
to fill another garbage can.

1222
02:10:46,213 --> 02:10:48,215
That's exactly right!

1223
02:10:48,382 --> 02:10:50,217
Seal after seal after seal!

1224
02:10:50,343 --> 02:10:52,053
That's just an excuse.

1225
02:10:52,219 --> 02:10:54,597
We waste people's valuable time.

1226
02:10:54,764 --> 02:10:58,726
The public is upset by bribes
and 40,000 cars and so on,

1227
02:10:58,893 --> 02:11:01,062
but those are just farts

1228
02:11:01,228 --> 02:11:04,231
next to this invisible,
colossal waste of time!

1229
02:11:07,735 --> 02:11:09,653
Listen here.

1230
02:11:09,779 --> 02:11:12,406
I often have the same concerns.

1231
02:11:12,573 --> 02:11:16,911
But in that labyrinthine machine,
you can't do a thing!

1232
02:11:17,078 --> 02:11:20,247
All that meaningless busywork
and not a moment to think!

1233
02:11:20,414 --> 02:11:21,582
Idiots!

1234
02:11:30,925 --> 02:11:34,136
But the thing is,

1235
02:11:34,303 --> 02:11:35,763
Mr. Ohara,

1236
02:11:35,971 --> 02:11:38,099
even within a system

1237
02:11:38,265 --> 02:11:41,394
where you can't get
a thing done,

1238
02:11:41,811 --> 02:11:44,814
and battling
stomach cancer at that,

1239
02:11:44,980 --> 02:11:49,068
Mr. Watanabe managed
to accomplish so much.

1240
02:11:50,319 --> 02:11:53,614
That's it!
That's what I wanted to say!

1241
02:11:53,781 --> 02:11:56,283
That's why I get so angry!

1242
02:11:56,450 --> 02:11:58,536
That's what I'm saying!

1243
02:11:58,702 --> 02:12:01,455
Mr. Watanabe expected no reward!

1244
02:12:01,580 --> 02:12:03,874
That's right!

1245
02:12:04,041 --> 02:12:07,711
When you imagine how he must
have felt, his life on the line...

1246
02:12:07,878 --> 02:12:10,297
Anyone who tries to take
the credit isn't human!

1247
02:12:10,464 --> 02:12:12,716
The deputy mayor. Just say it!

1248
02:12:17,263 --> 02:12:19,682
That's going too far...

1249
02:12:27,898 --> 02:12:29,483
Listen.

1250
02:12:29,817 --> 02:12:35,030
How do you think he felt...

1251
02:12:36,490 --> 02:12:39,493
Dying all alone in that park?

1252
02:12:40,035 --> 02:12:42,830
Just thinking about it...

1253
02:13:04,852 --> 02:13:09,940
A policeman brought this by.
He found it in the park.

1254
02:13:17,031 --> 02:13:20,618
And he'd like to light incense
for the deceased.

1255
02:13:39,094 --> 02:13:42,556
Thank you for taking the trouble.
Come in.

1256
02:14:41,448 --> 02:14:43,951
Won't you stay a bit
and have a drink?

1257
02:14:44,118 --> 02:14:46,453
We appreciate
your coming out of your way.

1258
02:14:48,122 --> 02:14:51,542
Please sit down.

1259
02:15:16,984 --> 02:15:18,819
To tell you the truth...

1260
02:15:24,241 --> 02:15:27,244
Last night I was...

1261
02:15:28,037 --> 02:15:30,497
On patrol...

1262
02:15:32,166 --> 02:15:34,001
In the new park...

1263
02:15:37,838 --> 02:15:39,715
When I came across him.

1264
02:15:40,674 --> 02:15:43,344
It was 10:00 — no.

1265
02:15:45,846 --> 02:15:47,681
Nearly 11:00.

1266
02:15:48,349 --> 02:15:50,225
He was on the swing...

1267
02:15:50,684 --> 02:15:55,522
Even though it was snowing.

1268
02:15:56,190 --> 02:15:58,859
I just assumed
he was some drunk.

1269
02:16:02,279 --> 02:16:05,032
I was derelict in my duty.

1270
02:16:10,454 --> 02:16:15,459
If I'd followed my first inclination
and taken him in,

1271
02:16:16,210 --> 02:16:18,462
this wouldn't have happened.

1272
02:16:20,381 --> 02:16:23,384
What I did was unforgivable.

1273
02:16:26,428 --> 02:16:29,723
But he seemed to be...

1274
02:16:31,392 --> 02:16:34,812
So perfectly happy.
I can't explain it.

1275
02:16:36,146 --> 02:16:40,484
He poured his whole heart
into that song of his...

1276
02:16:45,489 --> 02:16:47,908
With a haunting voice...

1277
02:16:50,411 --> 02:16:51,912
That filled...

1278
02:16:53,789 --> 02:16:58,168
The depths of my soul.

1279
02:17:02,423 --> 02:17:10,423
Life is brief

1280
02:17:13,809 --> 02:17:20,691
fall in love, maidens

1281
02:17:24,278 --> 02:17:32,278
before the crimson bloom

1282
02:17:35,539 --> 02:17:42,129
fades from your lips

1283
02:17:46,216 --> 02:17:54,216
before the tides of passion

1284
02:17:57,478 --> 02:18:03,984
cool within you

1285
02:18:07,821 --> 02:18:15,821
for those of you

1286
02:18:19,082 --> 02:18:25,672
who know no tomorrow

1287
02:18:48,028 --> 02:18:50,697
Listen, last night...

1288
02:18:51,824 --> 02:18:53,534
Under the stairs,

1289
02:18:53,700 --> 02:18:56,245
I found a pouch
with my name on it.

1290
02:18:56,620 --> 02:18:59,498
Inside were
dad's bankbook and seal,

1291
02:18:59,623 --> 02:19:04,127
along with forms for claiming
his retirement bonus.

1292
02:19:04,586 --> 02:19:07,381
So he left it
before he went to the park?

1293
02:19:07,548 --> 02:19:10,884
It was so cruel of him...

1294
02:19:11,552 --> 02:19:14,930
Not to tell us he had cancer.
If I'd known sooner...

1295
02:19:15,973 --> 02:19:19,643
Hey, why didn't
his girlfriend show up?

1296
02:19:20,561 --> 02:19:23,522
I wonder if she really was
his girlfriend after all.

1297
02:19:28,068 --> 02:19:29,570
I'i/ do my best!

1298
02:19:29,736 --> 02:19:32,072
- I swear it!
- We must carry on his work!

1299
02:19:32,239 --> 02:19:35,742
We can't let
his death be in vain!

1300
02:19:36,910 --> 02:19:40,289
I'll be like a man reborn!

1301
02:19:47,796 --> 02:19:50,841
We'll sacrifice ourselves
in the service of the people!

1302
02:19:54,595 --> 02:19:57,014
Never forget this feeling!

1303
02:19:57,180 --> 02:19:59,600
I'm going to do my best!

1304
02:20:04,771 --> 02:20:07,774
Public affairs section chief

1305
02:20:16,283 --> 02:20:17,701
Sir...

1306
02:20:17,868 --> 02:20:21,955
The sewage main break in kisaki
is overflowing into takao.

1307
02:20:22,122 --> 02:20:23,874
Public works.

1308
02:20:29,129 --> 02:20:31,798
Please go to public works.

1309
02:20:31,965 --> 02:20:33,675
Desk 8.

1310
02:21:49,209 --> 02:21:51,712
Kenbo! Yoko!

1311
02:21:54,715 --> 02:21:56,383
Come in for dinner!

1312
02:22:51,772 --> 02:22:54,816
The end
