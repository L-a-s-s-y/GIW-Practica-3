Okayama, Bizen

15
00:01:52,211 --> 00:01:54,805
It's very cold.

16
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:57,378
Yes, I'm chilled to the bone.

17
00:01:59,185 --> 00:02:02,177
It's past winter solstice.

18
00:02:03,255 --> 00:02:08,750
I wonder how long
this cold will go on...

19
00:02:12,264 --> 00:02:15,028
A moment, please.

20
00:02:16,702 --> 00:02:20,138
Iemon Tamiya again begs...

21
00:02:20,606 --> 00:02:24,633
...the hand of your daughter Iwa
in marriage.

22
00:02:25,211 --> 00:02:26,872
You again?

23
00:02:27,646 --> 00:02:33,744
I've told you: I will not give Iwa
to a libertine like you.

24
00:02:34,286 --> 00:02:37,687
What proof do you have
that I'm a libertine?

25
00:02:39,291 --> 00:02:43,990
That you would demand proof
of such a thing is very amusing.

26
00:02:45,397 --> 00:02:49,128
I guess that's how a man
of no status would think.

27
00:02:50,069 --> 00:02:53,971
But you don't deceive Samon
so easily.

28
00:02:55,274 --> 00:02:58,937
I may have no position,
but I am a samurai!

29
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:00,872
You believe lies!

30
00:03:00,913 --> 00:03:03,939
A samurai speaks but once:

31
00:03:04,383 --> 00:03:06,078
...you will not have her!

32
00:03:06,252 --> 00:03:12,418
You say that your disrepute
is all due to lies, Tamiya...

33
00:03:12,725 --> 00:03:16,126
...yet you lie in wait
in a place like this...

34
00:03:16,795 --> 00:03:20,697
...conduct unworthy of
even the lowest samurai.

35
00:03:20,966 --> 00:03:25,096
Samon, you dishonor yourself
by even speaking with him.

36
00:03:25,337 --> 00:03:27,271
Let's be on our way.

37
00:03:27,806 --> 00:03:28,830
Hear me...

38
00:03:29,241 --> 00:03:35,237
...I want no more of you haunting
my grounds like some stray cat!

39
00:03:39,451 --> 00:03:40,440
Wait!

40
00:03:40,953 --> 00:03:44,855
Why do you go back
on your promise...

41
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:47,058
...and treat me like some thief?

42
00:03:48,928 --> 00:03:52,329
I've said no. There's no sense
in you arguing.

43
00:03:52,364 --> 00:03:54,457
Enough! It is you
who makes no sense!

44
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:56,600
Who are you to silence me?

45
00:03:57,403 --> 00:04:01,134
A man of no status does not
silence an elder!

46
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:03,170
No man talks down to me!

47
00:04:03,208 --> 00:04:04,232
Silence!

48
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:05,704
Hold your tongue!

49
00:04:06,979 --> 00:04:12,679
I would never give my daughter
to a prattling fool!

50
00:04:12,918 --> 00:04:15,682
Do you call me a fool?!

51
00:04:17,289 --> 00:04:18,278
Wait!

52
00:05:08,273 --> 00:05:09,297
Well, chief...

53
00:05:11,043 --> 00:05:12,943
...I'd say you're in trouble.

54
00:05:13,178 --> 00:05:14,167
Bastard!

55
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,045
Hey! Take it easy!

56
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:19,083
I've got an idea.

57
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:23,081
Leave this to me.

58
00:05:23,889 --> 00:05:28,019
I know exactly what to do.

59
00:05:39,938 --> 00:05:43,669
Miss Iwa, Yomoshichi is here.

60
00:06:13,204 --> 00:06:18,471
What a terrible thing
to happen to your father!

61
00:06:19,911 --> 00:06:23,369
It is a tragedy for you, as well.

62
00:06:25,183 --> 00:06:31,144
Ozawa Usaburo has a slash
right across his face.

63
00:06:31,589 --> 00:06:36,891
It must have been him! He tried
to rob your father once before.

64
00:06:37,695 --> 00:06:43,895
I suppose he was angry because
Father filed a complaint.

65
00:06:47,138 --> 00:06:48,662
Yomoshichi...

66
00:06:49,707 --> 00:06:53,074
...may I ask that you delay...

67
00:06:54,112 --> 00:06:57,707
...your marriage to
my sister Sode...

68
00:06:59,584 --> 00:07:01,552
...until we've taken vengeance?

69
00:07:01,886 --> 00:07:06,016
The sooner I avenge this wrong,
the better.

70
00:07:09,527 --> 00:07:13,759
Iemon, would you be so kind
as to accompany us...

71
00:07:14,265 --> 00:07:17,826
...and render assistance?

72
00:07:18,069 --> 00:07:19,127
Gladly.

73
00:07:20,371 --> 00:07:24,034
For you, Miss Iwa, anything.

74
00:07:51,702 --> 00:07:55,138
Well, well, well!
I wonder who's the lucky man...

75
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:01,475
What a pretty bride!

76
00:08:01,512 --> 00:08:02,308
Yes.

77
00:08:03,514 --> 00:08:04,640
Chief...

78
00:08:05,049 --> 00:08:07,517
...when do we get rid of that guy?

79
00:08:07,852 --> 00:08:11,652
It irritates me just seeing him
walking with Sode.

80
00:08:13,658 --> 00:08:15,785
Iwa, aren't you getting tired?

81
00:08:16,027 --> 00:08:18,325
Yes, I am.

82
00:08:18,596 --> 00:08:21,793
It's been six months
since we left home.

83
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:26,028
You're not stringing me along,
are you?

84
00:08:26,404 --> 00:08:30,568
I'm the one being strung along,
stuck with a man like you!

85
00:08:31,742 --> 00:08:34,472
I'm a samurai!

86
00:08:35,613 --> 00:08:37,547
If you won't help me...

87
00:08:38,683 --> 00:08:41,618
...I'll just have to tell them
what happened.

88
00:08:41,853 --> 00:08:44,287
Watch your tongue, Naosuke!

89
00:08:47,525 --> 00:08:50,722
So you will get rid of
Yomoshichi for me...

90
00:08:51,696 --> 00:08:54,494
As soon as I have the chance.

91
00:08:56,167 --> 00:08:59,159
Shiraito Falls/Soga Shrine;
1 Mile

92
00:09:00,805 --> 00:09:06,368
I want to pray where
the Soga brothers took revenge...

93
00:09:06,677 --> 00:09:09,237
...in the old story.

94
00:09:10,414 --> 00:09:12,211
But I feel so weak...

95
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:16,784
I'll pray to them for you,
Miss Iwa. You wait here.

96
00:09:16,821 --> 00:09:19,949
Would you, please?

97
00:09:25,496 --> 00:09:27,896
Yomoshichi...

98
00:09:29,467 --> 00:09:33,665
...would you pray to them
for me as well?

99
00:09:34,038 --> 00:09:35,232
Of course.

100
00:09:36,941 --> 00:09:41,503
Chief...now's our chance.
Don't waste it.

101
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:45,872
Try and push him over the cliff.
I'll stab him if you miss.

102
00:10:07,605 --> 00:10:09,800
A magnificent sight!

103
00:10:10,041 --> 00:10:11,008
Indeed.

104
00:10:11,742 --> 00:10:17,112
It's amazing that when the Sogas
planned their revenge...

105
00:10:17,648 --> 00:10:21,550
...these falls fell silent
to let them hear each other.

106
00:10:24,188 --> 00:10:26,156
I wish the ladies could see it.

107
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:27,516
Yes.

108
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:45,197
Villain!

109
00:10:53,484 --> 00:10:56,544
I guess this makes us
both murderers.

110
00:10:57,154 --> 00:10:58,178
Quiet!

111
00:11:00,758 --> 00:11:04,922
Who's going to back up
your story if you kill me?

112
00:11:10,101 --> 00:11:13,593
Iwa! Just a little longer!

113
00:11:14,071 --> 00:11:16,471
They'll be back any minute.

114
00:11:16,841 --> 00:11:18,001
There's trouble!

115
00:11:20,177 --> 00:11:23,908
Usaburo attacked us!
Yomoshichi fell over the falls!

116
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:27,674
Yomoshichi?!

117
00:11:28,152 --> 00:11:31,315
They were too strong for us.
They're a bad bunch.

118
00:11:32,456 --> 00:11:36,187
They almost got the chief, too,
but he was too quick.

119
00:11:36,427 --> 00:11:37,758
He got away.

120
00:11:37,795 --> 00:11:39,786
I'm ashamed of myself!

121
00:11:40,031 --> 00:11:42,329
Let's follow them!

122
00:11:42,566 --> 00:11:44,659
But my sister...

123
00:11:44,902 --> 00:11:49,362
But if we don't, who knows
when we'll see them again?

124
00:11:49,607 --> 00:11:50,539
Naosuke...

125
00:11:50,775 --> 00:11:54,734
I'll take care of Iwa.
You and Sode follow them.

126
00:11:54,779 --> 00:11:56,144
Right!

127
00:11:56,814 --> 00:12:00,511
Come on, Sode. They won't
get away from us!

128
00:12:00,785 --> 00:12:02,412
Take care, Iwa.

129
00:12:05,189 --> 00:12:06,213
Miss Iwa!

130
00:12:07,925 --> 00:12:09,324
I'm sorry.

131
00:12:10,194 --> 00:12:12,355
I'm nothing but trouble.

132
00:12:12,396 --> 00:12:15,854
What are you talking about?
You're my wife!

133
00:12:18,869 --> 00:12:19,858
A snake!

134
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:23,868
Don't kill it!

135
00:12:24,575 --> 00:12:29,274
They're servants of the gods!
And I was born in their year!

136
00:12:29,313 --> 00:12:31,543
Don't be stupid...damn this thing!

137
00:12:36,521 --> 00:12:44,326
Edo

138
00:13:21,666 --> 00:13:27,298
You must be tired.
Why not rest a while?

139
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:51,896
Last night I dreamed of
my sister.

140
00:13:52,664 --> 00:13:57,192
Father was taking us
to a festival.

141
00:13:59,671 --> 00:14:05,803
In Okayama, they'll be having
the Hachiman Festival now.

142
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:13,840
I wonder what's happened
to Sode...

143
00:14:15,186 --> 00:14:18,781
Is she here in Edo...

144
00:14:19,724 --> 00:14:22,090
...or did she and Naosuke
go off somewhere?

145
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:29,862
It's not fair that we're so poor!
If there were any justice...

146
00:14:30,635 --> 00:14:32,330
...you'd have a position...

147
00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:33,628
Iwa!

148
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,429
Stop that!

149
00:14:38,343 --> 00:14:40,072
I don't want to hear it.

150
00:14:47,285 --> 00:14:51,779
When are you going to
avenge my father?

151
00:14:53,091 --> 00:14:54,786
I'll take revenge!

152
00:14:55,694 --> 00:14:58,356
As soon as I get the chance!

153
00:14:58,797 --> 00:15:00,890
We haven't found my sister...

154
00:15:02,033 --> 00:15:05,127
...we have no idea of how
we'll revenge ourselves...

155
00:15:06,871 --> 00:15:10,466
...and you're reduced
to doing piecework...

156
00:15:10,508 --> 00:15:11,566
Enough!

157
00:15:12,544 --> 00:15:17,106
So you want to leave
and go back home?

158
00:15:17,882 --> 00:15:19,645
And you're tired of living
in poverty?

159
00:15:20,352 --> 00:15:22,616
Maybe you're tired of me.

160
00:15:22,854 --> 00:15:25,049
Do what you want, then. So will I!

161
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:27,058
I didn't mean that!

162
00:15:27,659 --> 00:15:28,751
Iemon!

163
00:15:30,295 --> 00:15:31,091
Iemon!

164
00:15:40,839 --> 00:15:43,433
Elixir!

165
00:15:43,675 --> 00:15:44,972
Five pennies!

166
00:15:45,643 --> 00:15:47,406
The miracle potion!

167
00:15:48,747 --> 00:15:51,375
Elixir!

168
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:52,808
Five pennies!

169
00:15:53,051 --> 00:15:54,916
The miracle potion!

170
00:16:04,963 --> 00:16:06,692
Back early again?

171
00:16:06,731 --> 00:16:10,497
He's been telling me
all about you, Missus.

172
00:16:10,735 --> 00:16:13,329
How you two
spend your afternoons...

173
00:16:14,506 --> 00:16:17,771
'Elixir! Five pennies!
The miracle potion!

174
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:20,537
'Fits, convulsions, dizziness...

175
00:16:20,779 --> 00:16:26,411
'Elixir of Holland! Good for what
ails you! Five pennies a grain! '

176
00:16:26,451 --> 00:16:29,249
You've been drinking again!

177
00:16:29,487 --> 00:16:31,785
We got bored.

178
00:16:32,424 --> 00:16:35,587
We stopped in at the tavern
on the corner.

179
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:40,556
But all the time I was thinking
of you here alone...

180
00:16:41,499 --> 00:16:46,095
I'm so sick of shouting
'Elixir! Five pennies! '

181
00:16:46,604 --> 00:16:49,573
Well, there's a reason
why you're doing it.

182
00:16:50,041 --> 00:16:54,000
We have to find my sister,
and take revenge!

183
00:16:54,446 --> 00:16:57,711
'Revenge'...let's not talk
about that now.

184
00:16:57,949 --> 00:17:00,747
Come on, Sode...

185
00:17:01,085 --> 00:17:02,143
Let go!

186
00:17:04,022 --> 00:17:08,049
I wasn't born to be the wife...

187
00:17:08,426 --> 00:17:11,122
...of a man of low birth!

188
00:17:11,396 --> 00:17:13,387
What do you mean, 'wife'?

189
00:17:13,865 --> 00:17:17,631
We're just pretending
we're married.

190
00:17:18,269 --> 00:17:19,759
I can't wait much longer...

191
00:17:20,004 --> 00:17:25,567
You promised you wouldn't
touch me till we took revenge!

192
00:17:25,610 --> 00:17:27,510
Oh, come on!

193
00:17:27,745 --> 00:17:30,145
No! Let go of me!

194
00:17:30,415 --> 00:17:31,439
Sode!

195
00:17:32,317 --> 00:17:33,249
Sode!

196
00:17:39,557 --> 00:17:42,321
The girl can come
pour our drinks for us...

197
00:17:43,094 --> 00:17:45,153
...or you don't get by us.

198
00:17:45,697 --> 00:17:48,757
It was you who bumped me
with your scabbard!

199
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,026
So you aren't going to
give her to us?

200
00:17:52,403 --> 00:17:54,337
We'll just have to take her.

201
00:17:54,739 --> 00:17:55,728
Hey!

202
00:17:58,343 --> 00:17:59,241
Who are you?!

203
00:17:59,477 --> 00:18:01,707
Show your face!

204
00:18:11,289 --> 00:18:17,091
Thank you. You got us
out of a tight spot.

205
00:18:18,496 --> 00:18:21,659
You're very good
with a sword.

206
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:24,164
You're too kind.

207
00:18:24,669 --> 00:18:28,036
I hope we will come
to know you better.

208
00:18:32,377 --> 00:18:34,607
If you'll permit me...

209
00:18:35,346 --> 00:18:38,509
I can't accept that.

210
00:18:38,983 --> 00:18:42,350
Take it as a token
of my gratitude.

211
00:18:43,621 --> 00:18:45,816
I may have no situation...

212
00:18:46,524 --> 00:18:47,923
...but I am a samurai.

213
00:18:48,159 --> 00:18:55,895
One rarely meets
a gentleman these days.

214
00:18:57,035 --> 00:19:00,527
Ume, you should thank him.

215
00:19:00,805 --> 00:19:01,863
Yes.

216
00:19:03,575 --> 00:19:07,306
I am most truly grateful.

217
00:19:10,081 --> 00:19:11,173
It's so hot!

218
00:19:11,416 --> 00:19:12,508
Welcome back!

219
00:19:12,684 --> 00:19:14,242
It's the bosa!

220
00:19:14,485 --> 00:19:16,214
Welcome!

221
00:19:16,454 --> 00:19:19,912
Hot, ain't it. I wish it'd rain!

222
00:19:20,158 --> 00:19:20,988
Hello!

223
00:19:21,025 --> 00:19:22,356
It's hot!

224
00:19:22,594 --> 00:19:24,926
Will I see you later?

225
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:30,592
Two dice, two dots! Evens!

226
00:19:33,871 --> 00:19:36,203
How can you gamble
in this heat?

227
00:19:46,751 --> 00:19:49,276
Takuetsu...lend me
some money.

228
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:50,851
Again?

229
00:19:51,756 --> 00:19:54,919
You have a pretty wife
waiting at home.

230
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,725
She'll be my collateral.

231
00:19:56,961 --> 00:19:57,893
What?

232
00:19:58,296 --> 00:20:02,562
Sure! For her I'll lend you
as much as you like.

233
00:20:03,701 --> 00:20:06,295
But I'll hold you to your word.

234
00:20:07,271 --> 00:20:10,798
I don't care. I'll get it
from Naosuke later.

235
00:20:11,542 --> 00:20:12,804
Hey, chief...

236
00:20:13,611 --> 00:20:15,442
Oh, it's you...

237
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:19,480
I don't have a tree
that grows money, you know.

238
00:20:20,618 --> 00:20:22,711
Oh, I forgot...

239
00:20:23,054 --> 00:20:26,421
...I've got to go out
to another customer.

240
00:20:28,926 --> 00:20:31,622
We've been in Edo
for two years now.

241
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:37,199
I'm getting tired of
being broke all the time.

242
00:20:39,370 --> 00:20:45,104
Even if we have to kill someone,
let's do something big.

243
00:20:46,778 --> 00:20:49,941
Just like that night
in Okayama.

244
00:20:50,181 --> 00:20:50,647
Naosuke!

245
00:21:10,001 --> 00:21:14,199
Welcome home. Would you
like to change your clothes...

246
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:16,964
...or will you eat first?

247
00:21:17,208 --> 00:21:18,197
No.

248
00:21:22,947 --> 00:21:26,007
It's so humid tonight...

249
00:21:28,519 --> 00:21:34,219
Oh, yes...Takuetsu came
to give me a massage.

250
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:38,589
He was talking about
a Naosuke from Okayama...

251
00:21:39,263 --> 00:21:40,252
Naosuke?

252
00:21:40,598 --> 00:21:43,192
Have you seen him?

253
00:21:43,434 --> 00:21:44,901
Of course not!

254
00:21:44,936 --> 00:21:47,871
But Takuetsu said...

255
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:52,141
I haven't seen him, I said!

256
00:21:53,010 --> 00:21:56,844
Takuetsu said you still
owe him money...

257
00:21:56,881 --> 00:21:57,870
Shut up!

258
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:04,418
All right! I'll pawn something.

259
00:22:05,189 --> 00:22:07,054
What have we got?

260
00:22:07,391 --> 00:22:10,451
Nothing.

261
00:22:12,096 --> 00:22:13,529
Nothing, eh?

262
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:20,396
Wait!

263
00:22:20,638 --> 00:22:23,801
Without that the mosquitoes
will eat him alive!

264
00:22:24,041 --> 00:22:26,669
This place is thick with them!

265
00:22:26,711 --> 00:22:28,611
Then chase them away!

266
00:22:28,846 --> 00:22:30,746
Let go!

267
00:22:39,023 --> 00:22:41,856
A tortoise-shell comb!

268
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:46,187
I didn't think we had
anything like this left.

269
00:22:47,231 --> 00:22:49,222
This is worth money!

270
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,795
Lend me this.

271
00:22:52,570 --> 00:22:56,506
Anything but that!
It was my mother's!

272
00:22:56,874 --> 00:22:59,035
Please! Not that!

273
00:22:59,277 --> 00:22:59,971
Let go!

274
00:23:00,011 --> 00:23:01,672
I won't!

275
00:23:01,913 --> 00:23:03,608
Give it back!

276
00:23:03,881 --> 00:23:04,973
Instead...

277
00:23:14,458 --> 00:23:15,755
...take this sash.

278
00:23:18,496 --> 00:23:21,158
Have your damn comb, then!

279
00:23:24,302 --> 00:23:25,394
Iemon!

280
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:49,683
You'd better pay me
pretty well for this one, Ma.

281
00:23:50,995 --> 00:23:55,227
It's been hard work
prying lemon loose from Iwa.

282
00:23:55,466 --> 00:23:56,797
I know that.

283
00:23:57,401 --> 00:24:01,963
But it was your mother who
opened this door, don't forget.

284
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:04,635
You're a tough old bird!

285
00:24:04,875 --> 00:24:09,209
I have to be, with a no-good
like you for a son!

286
00:24:11,549 --> 00:24:13,380
It's not much, but it's yours.

287
00:24:13,417 --> 00:24:16,284
Thank you very much!

288
00:24:17,989 --> 00:24:19,081
Sir...

289
00:24:19,624 --> 00:24:25,529
...I hope this will be the start
of a long association.

290
00:24:27,031 --> 00:24:28,862
Your daughter seems pleased.

291
00:24:30,034 --> 00:24:33,595
If those two marry,
you'll be the matchmaker.

292
00:24:33,838 --> 00:24:38,275
You couldn't turn against
my son then, sir!

293
00:25:20,685 --> 00:25:25,315
You've gotten so thin lately...

294
00:25:26,424 --> 00:25:29,621
Your husband
makes you worry, I'll bet.

295
00:25:31,762 --> 00:25:35,027
I heard something
from someone...

296
00:25:35,599 --> 00:25:39,592
...about your husband and
Old Man Ito's daughter, Ume.

297
00:25:40,905 --> 00:25:41,963
Ume?!

298
00:25:43,507 --> 00:25:46,408
I'd watch out if I were you.

299
00:25:47,945 --> 00:25:49,242
Takuetsu...

300
00:25:50,114 --> 00:25:55,313
...you aren't married,
so you might not understand.

301
00:25:56,954 --> 00:26:00,014
That doesn't happen
once two people are married.

302
00:26:00,424 --> 00:26:02,051
You may be right.

303
00:26:02,593 --> 00:26:06,154
I just thought in this case
I should say something.

304
00:26:06,597 --> 00:26:07,621
No.

305
00:26:08,566 --> 00:26:14,129
My husband, at least,
would never do such a thing!

306
00:26:15,206 --> 00:26:16,230
Chief...

307
00:26:17,274 --> 00:26:19,242
Oh, Naosuke...

308
00:26:21,846 --> 00:26:24,508
Did you have fun?

309
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:28,184
How was the young lady?

310
00:26:31,288 --> 00:26:33,449
Here's some pocket money.

311
00:26:36,494 --> 00:26:42,057
Why don't we stop fooling around
with all this small stuff...

312
00:26:42,466 --> 00:26:45,993
...and make up our minds
and do something?

313
00:26:48,606 --> 00:26:53,737
Old Man Ito won't keep giving us
money for nothing.

314
00:26:53,978 --> 00:26:55,741
I know that.

315
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:57,641
Then you get my drift.

316
00:26:58,549 --> 00:27:02,485
Why not make Ume
the happiest woman in the world?

317
00:27:03,053 --> 00:27:07,547
If it was only as easy
as all that...

318
00:27:08,192 --> 00:27:12,754
Chief! Don't tell me
you're afraid of Iwa.

319
00:27:14,398 --> 00:27:18,232
If that's the problem,
just kill her.

320
00:27:18,702 --> 00:27:19,726
What?!

321
00:27:20,371 --> 00:27:23,431
You've done it before.
What's one more?

322
00:27:24,575 --> 00:27:30,207
Be tough now, or you won't
spend your old age in comfort.

323
00:27:32,049 --> 00:27:36,315
How would you like a position
in some lord's household?

324
00:27:38,489 --> 00:27:40,389
Chief...wait!

325
00:27:41,091 --> 00:27:46,859
What if Iwa was to find out
the truth?

326
00:27:49,066 --> 00:27:50,761
Then what, Chief?

327
00:27:55,339 --> 00:27:59,002
Is this another one
of your schemes?

328
00:27:59,043 --> 00:28:00,510
I'm glad you asked.

329
00:28:01,579 --> 00:28:04,946
Why not use Takuetsu?

330
00:28:05,749 --> 00:28:06,738
Takuetsu?

331
00:28:07,651 --> 00:28:10,381
He抯 in love with Iwa.

332
00:28:10,621 --> 00:28:14,182
We can set him up
so people think he's her lover.

333
00:28:16,861 --> 00:28:20,353
And there's nothing illegal
in killing...

334
00:28:20,731 --> 00:28:24,827
...a woman who's taken a lover
behind her husband's back.

335
00:28:25,603 --> 00:28:29,767
But I couldn't kill Iwa!

336
00:28:30,341 --> 00:28:32,332
There you go again!

337
00:28:32,576 --> 00:28:38,014
All right...I can get some
foreign poison.

338
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:40,308
Poison?!

339
00:29:04,842 --> 00:29:07,936
How are you feeling now?

340
00:29:08,312 --> 00:29:12,715
I just get worse and worse.

341
00:29:14,351 --> 00:29:19,015
I'm not afraid to get sick
and die myself...

342
00:29:19,924 --> 00:29:23,052
...but our poor child!

343
00:29:24,361 --> 00:29:26,886
If I die...

344
00:29:28,432 --> 00:29:29,990
If you die...

345
00:29:31,168 --> 00:29:36,037
You wouldn't take a new wife
right away, would you?

346
00:29:38,375 --> 00:29:39,569
Sure I would.

347
00:29:41,345 --> 00:29:43,404
Right away.

348
00:29:44,315 --> 00:29:47,614
A nice, rich one.

349
00:29:48,919 --> 00:29:53,356
What's wrong with that?
It happens all the time.

350
00:29:53,624 --> 00:29:59,859
So it's true about you and
Old Man Ito抯 daughter?

351
00:30:01,498 --> 00:30:06,162
And what about taking revenge
for my father?

352
00:30:07,071 --> 00:30:08,902
'Revenge'...

353
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:12,402
I'm sick of hearing about it.

354
00:30:12,643 --> 00:30:15,578
How can you say that?!

355
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:19,211
I'm fed up to the teeth with it!

356
00:30:20,618 --> 00:30:21,846
What of it?

357
00:30:22,753 --> 00:30:24,778
If you don't like it, leave!

358
00:30:25,255 --> 00:30:27,485
Find another man to help you!

359
00:30:29,093 --> 00:30:32,324
Are you going to leave me
for her?

360
00:30:32,563 --> 00:30:33,552
Shut up!

361
00:30:40,504 --> 00:30:44,133
Stop crying. It was just
a bad joke.

362
00:30:45,209 --> 00:30:46,301
Forgive me.

363
00:30:47,444 --> 00:30:48,604
You'll get sick.

364
00:30:52,950 --> 00:30:59,981
I know...tomorrow I'll get you
some medicine that works.

365
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:19,537
Chief, you're late!

366
00:31:22,046 --> 00:31:24,947
I'll go on ahead.

367
00:31:25,883 --> 00:31:30,286
We don't want to keep Ume
waiting on her wedding day.

368
00:31:30,721 --> 00:31:31,779
Wait!

369
00:31:34,225 --> 00:31:37,820
What are we going to do
about Iwa?

370
00:31:38,062 --> 00:31:40,189
Not her again!

371
00:31:41,866 --> 00:31:44,699
Here's the potion.

372
00:31:45,236 --> 00:31:49,900
First her face will break out,
and then she'll die.

373
00:31:50,141 --> 00:31:52,041
Here you go.

374
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:55,573
Take it! Stop being
so much damn trouble!

375
00:31:58,082 --> 00:32:02,348
And this position you speak of
is assured?

376
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:05,646
Come now! Don't be
so formal!

377
00:32:05,923 --> 00:32:09,654
Once the ceremony is over,
you'll be one of the family.

378
00:32:09,894 --> 00:32:13,921
You won't have to worry.
I'll take care of everything.

379
00:32:15,399 --> 00:32:16,696
Won't I, Ume?

380
00:32:17,835 --> 00:32:21,327
You and Naosuke
have been a great help to me.

381
00:32:26,811 --> 00:32:29,405
Me? Iwa's lover?

382
00:32:30,114 --> 00:32:32,674
Don't make fun of me!

383
00:32:32,917 --> 00:32:34,851
I'm serious.

384
00:32:37,855 --> 00:32:39,152
Out!

385
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:45,194
This must be a joke.

386
00:32:45,763 --> 00:32:48,027
You doubt the word of
a samurai?

387
00:32:48,265 --> 00:32:51,757
But Iwa's your wife!

388
00:32:51,802 --> 00:32:54,771
And it's her husband
who asks.

389
00:32:57,675 --> 00:32:59,370
I understand!

390
00:32:59,710 --> 00:33:04,909
So the story about you and
the Ito girl is true...

391
00:33:06,450 --> 00:33:07,781
You're slow.

392
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:13,312
So you'll do it? I'll give you
whatever you want.

393
00:33:16,727 --> 00:33:19,457
This is too good to be true!

394
00:33:21,365 --> 00:33:23,424
This is so beautiful!

395
00:33:24,835 --> 00:33:31,138
And you bought it for me!
I'm so happy!

396
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:46,786
What are you doing in there?

397
00:33:47,024 --> 00:33:50,687
I bought some medicine
for your circulation.

398
00:33:51,028 --> 00:33:53,656
I'm boiling some up for you.

399
00:33:53,964 --> 00:33:56,330
Thank you!

400
00:33:56,567 --> 00:34:01,334
It's been so long
since you were so nice to me.

401
00:34:01,572 --> 00:34:05,941
I spoke to you so harshly
last night...

402
00:34:06,877 --> 00:34:08,174
I'm sorry.

403
00:34:08,212 --> 00:34:13,206
And I always answer back...
I'm sorry, too.

404
00:34:13,551 --> 00:34:16,918
Let's both forget
what's in the past.

405
00:34:17,154 --> 00:34:17,916
Yes.

406
00:34:30,968 --> 00:34:34,199
There's fireworks
at Ryogoku tonight.

407
00:34:35,139 --> 00:34:39,007
Next year I'll take you
to see them.

408
00:35:06,036 --> 00:35:09,995
They say this medicine
works wonders.

409
00:35:11,709 --> 00:35:15,736
Here. Drink it, quickly.

410
00:35:17,581 --> 00:35:23,645
You're so nice to me tonight...
I'm so happy...

411
00:35:24,255 --> 00:35:26,485
...I'm crying!

412
00:36:15,372 --> 00:36:16,498
Good evening.

413
00:36:17,741 --> 00:36:19,038
Good evening!

414
00:36:20,945 --> 00:36:21,639
Good evening.

415
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:24,739
Takuetsu...you've come
at a perfect time.

416
00:36:26,784 --> 00:36:28,308
You know what to do?

417
00:36:30,554 --> 00:36:32,112
Come in.

418
00:36:41,165 --> 00:36:44,896
Good evening. Your husband
asked me to come.

419
00:36:45,135 --> 00:36:46,864
Thank you.

420
00:36:47,805 --> 00:36:51,366
Iemon...you've thought
of everything...

421
00:36:51,609 --> 00:36:54,077
It's nothing.

422
00:36:54,945 --> 00:36:57,209
I'll go see about that position.

423
00:36:57,448 --> 00:37:01,714
Why not go and see
the fireworks as well?

424
00:37:02,786 --> 00:37:05,346
Perhaps I will.

425
00:37:16,634 --> 00:37:20,229
It's very humid tonight...

426
00:37:25,643 --> 00:37:29,170
Usaburo! I've been waiting...

427
00:37:32,449 --> 00:37:33,438
Naosuke!

428
00:37:45,996 --> 00:37:47,588
Sode!

429
00:37:49,767 --> 00:37:52,201
Take a good look!

430
00:37:52,503 --> 00:37:54,300
That's Usaburo!

431
00:37:55,205 --> 00:37:56,638
Vengeance!

432
00:37:59,543 --> 00:38:02,808
I'm covered in sweat!

433
00:38:04,848 --> 00:38:06,611
Thank you, Naosuke!

434
00:38:08,652 --> 00:38:10,711
Don't thank me.

435
00:38:11,355 --> 00:38:15,291
As of tonight,
we're husband and wife!

436
00:38:18,495 --> 00:38:23,330
I've got something else to do.
You go home...

437
00:38:23,734 --> 00:38:25,065
...and get ready!

438
00:38:33,610 --> 00:38:34,770
Right here...

439
00:38:35,779 --> 00:38:43,117
The grief a husband brings
cramps this muscle here.

440
00:38:44,988 --> 00:38:52,087
The best way to uncramp
this muscle is to cut the ties...

441
00:38:53,396 --> 00:38:58,231
...that bind you to a husband
like that.

442
00:38:58,468 --> 00:38:59,662
Stop that!

443
00:39:01,004 --> 00:39:05,941
He may have no position,
but I am wife to a samurai!

444
00:39:06,676 --> 00:39:12,012
Lay a hand on me again
and I'll have your head!

445
00:39:12,248 --> 00:39:14,239
Please! Spare me!

446
00:39:14,484 --> 00:39:17,044
This wasn't my idea!

447
00:39:17,687 --> 00:39:20,349
Your husband knows
all about it.

448
00:39:20,390 --> 00:39:22,950
He does?!

449
00:39:23,693 --> 00:39:26,423
He knows everything.

450
00:39:26,463 --> 00:39:29,057
Is this true?!

451
00:39:33,703 --> 00:39:34,931
What's wrong?!

452
00:39:35,939 --> 00:39:37,497
My face! My head hurts!

453
00:39:39,342 --> 00:39:44,678
I can't breathe! I'm dizzy!
Get me some water!

454
00:39:44,781 --> 00:39:45,839
Water...

455
00:40:12,976 --> 00:40:14,967
More water!

456
00:40:43,606 --> 00:40:45,699
Missus...here's your water.

457
00:40:52,949 --> 00:40:54,678
Is something wrong?

458
00:40:55,452 --> 00:40:56,476
No!

459
00:41:33,456 --> 00:41:34,423
Is this...

460
00:41:35,692 --> 00:41:37,159
...is this me?!

461
00:42:46,496 --> 00:42:47,986
Takuetsu!

462
00:42:49,766 --> 00:42:51,063
You did this!

463
00:42:52,936 --> 00:42:55,871
No! It wasn't me!

464
00:42:56,239 --> 00:43:02,735
Iemon planned all this so
he could marry Ito抯 daughter!

465
00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:06,146
He said he'd reward me...

466
00:43:06,516 --> 00:43:09,041
...if I seduced you!

467
00:43:10,019 --> 00:43:11,714
Iemon?!

468
00:43:35,945 --> 00:43:37,435
Takuetsu!

469
00:43:45,355 --> 00:43:48,415
Missus, wait! I didn't do anything!

470
00:44:04,641 --> 00:44:05,665
Missus!

471
00:44:06,276 --> 00:44:07,470
Takuetsu!

472
00:44:40,710 --> 00:44:43,873
My little boy!

473
00:44:54,924 --> 00:45:02,194
Oh, hateful lemon!
How could you be so cruel...

474
00:45:04,100 --> 00:45:08,127
...to one who never
sinned against you!

475
00:45:11,474 --> 00:45:17,879
You poor child! How could I
leave you to a man like that?

476
00:45:18,848 --> 00:45:22,841
Die with your mother!

477
00:45:24,554 --> 00:45:31,289
I could never enter paradise
if I left you behind.

478
00:45:35,331 --> 00:45:40,394
Iemon, you heartless
and cold-blooded brute...

479
00:45:42,905 --> 00:45:46,864
...do you think I will leave you
with this debt unpaid?!

480
00:45:53,383 --> 00:45:55,044
Iemon!

481
00:45:56,553 --> 00:45:58,077
Why are you rushing away?

482
00:46:01,458 --> 00:46:02,550
Did you do it?

483
00:46:02,859 --> 00:46:03,951
No!

484
00:46:04,194 --> 00:46:05,889
I didn't do anything.

485
00:46:05,929 --> 00:46:07,260
Don't hide it.

486
00:46:08,465 --> 00:46:10,399
She's still a samurai wife.

487
00:46:11,068 --> 00:46:14,526
For someone of your caste,
the thrill of a lifetime.

488
00:46:14,771 --> 00:46:17,706
A monster like that?

489
00:46:29,686 --> 00:46:30,675
Takuetsu!

490
00:46:31,788 --> 00:46:33,619
Did you stab her?

491
00:46:33,957 --> 00:46:35,151
Of course not!

492
00:46:36,927 --> 00:46:39,589
She did that with a razor!

493
00:46:41,298 --> 00:46:42,663
Whatever.

494
00:46:44,134 --> 00:46:45,396
But Takuetsu...

495
00:46:46,403 --> 00:46:51,340
...you know what samurai
do to adulterers, don't you?

496
00:46:51,641 --> 00:46:54,474
Sir! I didn't do anything!

497
00:47:22,806 --> 00:47:23,864
Naosuke!

498
00:47:37,954 --> 00:47:39,649
You finally did it!

499
00:47:43,493 --> 00:47:44,517
Naosuke...

500
00:47:45,295 --> 00:47:49,061
...pull off one of the shutters.
We'll nail them onto it.

501
00:48:34,211 --> 00:48:38,272
The law says I can lay them
together and cut them in half.

502
00:48:38,748 --> 00:48:41,273
No one will say anything.

503
00:48:43,687 --> 00:48:46,554
We'd better hurry.
Tonight's your wedding.

504
00:49:43,613 --> 00:49:46,275
All right, let's go!

505
00:49:47,617 --> 00:49:49,881
Chief! What's wrong?

506
00:49:51,788 --> 00:49:57,420
We're not poor any more.
Tonight's a great night!

507
00:49:58,328 --> 00:50:00,694
There's nothing to worry about.

508
00:50:01,264 --> 00:50:06,099
I wouldn't expect you
to know how I feel.

509
00:50:09,172 --> 00:50:15,042
'On Takasago Beach...

510
00:50:15,945 --> 00:50:20,575
'...raise the sail...

511
00:50:20,950 --> 00:50:24,613
'...of your ship...

512
00:50:25,322 --> 00:50:33,821
'...and with the ebbing tide
run with the moon...'

513
00:50:51,046 --> 00:50:54,573
You must be tired.
Will you have some tea?

514
00:50:54,617 --> 00:50:55,641
Thank you.

515
00:51:00,356 --> 00:51:02,290
Come and change.

516
00:51:30,853 --> 00:51:33,583
Iemon...

517
00:51:35,124 --> 00:51:39,026
How could you give me...

518
00:51:39,595 --> 00:51:43,793
...poison to drink?

519
00:52:07,056 --> 00:52:15,862
I will visit my hatred on you.
Be sure of that.

520
00:52:35,117 --> 00:52:36,550
What's wrong?

521
00:52:37,152 --> 00:52:39,620
Why did you shout?

522
00:52:49,765 --> 00:52:51,460
I'll sleep alone tonight.

523
00:52:58,741 --> 00:52:59,765
What is it?

524
00:53:00,042 --> 00:53:01,976
A snake!

525
00:53:20,029 --> 00:53:23,362
There's nothing to be
afraid of now, Ume.

526
00:53:29,204 --> 00:53:30,432
Oh, lemon!

527
00:53:47,523 --> 00:53:51,721
Ume, do you still have to
act so shy with me?

528
00:53:56,999 --> 00:53:58,864
Iemon...

529
00:54:00,636 --> 00:54:06,472
...what did I ever do
to wrong you?

530
00:54:08,644 --> 00:54:10,271
You! You're dead!

531
00:54:21,590 --> 00:54:22,614
Ume!

532
00:54:23,792 --> 00:54:25,783
Ume!

533
00:54:30,899 --> 00:54:34,232
Iemon? Sir?

534
00:54:34,570 --> 00:54:36,197
Is anything wrong?

535
00:54:36,805 --> 00:54:38,670
May I come in?

536
00:54:43,946 --> 00:54:46,244
Iemon!

537
00:54:47,316 --> 00:54:49,181
Damn you, Iwa!

538
00:55:01,730 --> 00:55:02,992
Iemon?

539
00:55:03,966 --> 00:55:05,228
Iemon?

540
00:55:11,006 --> 00:55:12,200
Takuetsu!

541
00:55:22,618 --> 00:55:24,108
Sir!

542
00:56:03,559 --> 00:56:08,622
There's hair caught in this...
that's disgusting!

543
00:56:12,534 --> 00:56:16,436
A comb! This looks like
tortoise-shell!

544
00:56:18,774 --> 00:56:20,969
What's this around my feet?

545
00:56:27,015 --> 00:56:29,415
Someone could still wear this...

546
00:56:38,327 --> 00:56:41,660
Catching any eels, Naosuke?

547
00:56:42,064 --> 00:56:44,658
Hello, Chief. Going fishing?

548
00:56:46,235 --> 00:56:47,202
I need a change.

549
00:56:48,370 --> 00:56:54,002
Do you think it's safe for you
to leave the temple?

550
00:56:55,210 --> 00:56:59,078
I feel like I'm suffocating
in there.

551
00:57:10,993 --> 00:57:13,120
Going already?

552
00:57:13,362 --> 00:57:17,458
If I stir up the mud chasing eels
I'll scare off the other fish.

553
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:21,292
I thought I'd go home
and have some fun with Sode.

554
00:57:21,937 --> 00:57:23,461
If you'll excuse me...

555
00:58:36,278 --> 00:58:39,270
Iwa! Do you haunt me still?!

556
00:58:40,515 --> 00:58:43,006
Iemon...

557
00:58:45,220 --> 00:58:50,180
...I will make an end
to the blood...

558
00:58:51,927 --> 00:58:54,487
...of the Tamiya name!

559
00:58:59,601 --> 00:59:00,863
Go to hell!

560
00:59:12,981 --> 00:59:14,039
Takuetsu!

561
00:59:19,354 --> 00:59:21,652
Pay what you owe me.

562
00:59:22,791 --> 00:59:25,157
Takuetsu! You, too?!

563
00:59:25,694 --> 00:59:27,559
Do you never stop?!

564
01:00:39,167 --> 01:00:41,431
That's awful!

565
01:00:43,171 --> 01:00:45,696
You scared me! What's wrong?

566
01:00:46,441 --> 01:00:50,707
Two corpses turned up
in the river at Mannen Bridge!

567
01:00:50,945 --> 01:00:51,969
Corpses?

568
01:00:52,680 --> 01:00:55,171
A man and a woman.

569
01:00:55,750 --> 01:00:58,344
They were nailed to a shutter.

570
01:01:03,458 --> 01:01:04,823
What's wrong?!

571
01:01:05,159 --> 01:01:07,957
The bucket's full of snakes!

572
01:01:11,799 --> 01:01:13,824
There's no snakes here...

573
01:01:20,308 --> 01:01:21,366
This comb...

574
01:01:23,077 --> 01:01:24,442
Where did you get it?

575
01:01:26,481 --> 01:01:31,214
At the Potter's Field
in Kamimura. Why?

576
01:01:35,256 --> 01:01:37,156
This is my sister's!

577
01:01:38,860 --> 01:01:40,589
It was Mother抯...

578
01:01:41,763 --> 01:01:43,492
Don't be stupid!

579
01:01:43,731 --> 01:01:46,529
There's lots of combs like that.

580
01:01:46,768 --> 01:01:49,703
No. This comb is my sister's.

581
01:01:59,480 --> 01:02:03,507
And this kimono is hers, too.
I'm sure of it!

582
01:02:14,395 --> 01:02:17,592
What if something's
happened to her?

583
01:02:31,612 --> 01:02:33,842
Iwa!

584
01:02:39,554 --> 01:02:43,320
How did you find us so late,
and in this back street?

585
01:02:44,359 --> 01:02:46,520
Come in!

586
01:02:48,096 --> 01:02:49,961
We were talking about you!

587
01:02:50,765 --> 01:02:57,102
I'm so glad you're here!
And so relieved you're safe!

588
01:03:01,142 --> 01:03:04,202
This is your comb, isn't it?

589
01:03:06,614 --> 01:03:07,706
I knew it!

590
01:03:12,420 --> 01:03:13,478
Forgive me!

591
01:03:13,888 --> 01:03:15,150
Forgive me!

592
01:03:16,724 --> 01:03:21,388
It was lemon Tamiya
who killed your father...

593
01:03:21,929 --> 01:03:23,487
...and Yomoshichi's!

594
01:03:24,232 --> 01:03:27,861
He's at Zuishoji Temple
at Snake Mountain!

595
01:03:28,936 --> 01:03:31,336
Forgive me! Forgive me!

596
01:04:07,342 --> 01:04:11,142
The Bizen Inn

597
01:04:22,023 --> 01:04:22,819
Miss Iwa!

598
01:04:25,493 --> 01:04:26,983
I was dreaming...

599
01:04:28,763 --> 01:04:30,993
Or was I?

600
01:04:39,007 --> 01:04:40,065
Miss Sode!

601
01:04:41,042 --> 01:04:42,202
It's you!

602
01:04:43,711 --> 01:04:45,804
It's me! Yomoshichi!

603
01:04:56,858 --> 01:04:58,291
Yomoshichi!

604
01:05:00,194 --> 01:05:03,027
You're alive!

605
01:05:03,965 --> 01:05:09,426
A woodcutter pulled me
out of the waterfall.

606
01:05:10,371 --> 01:05:13,670
When my wounds healed
I came to Edo.

607
01:05:14,776 --> 01:05:18,303
It's amazing
you found me here.

608
01:05:18,746 --> 01:05:19,770
Yes...

609
01:05:21,316 --> 01:05:24,410
It's very strange...

610
01:05:25,286 --> 01:05:26,253
My sister...

611
01:05:26,287 --> 01:05:28,187
Miss Iwa?

612
01:05:28,423 --> 01:05:29,447
Yes.

613
01:05:35,697 --> 01:05:37,221
This is her comb.

614
01:05:40,201 --> 01:05:42,567
It was a revelation!

615
01:05:44,772 --> 01:05:45,796
Miss Sode...

616
01:05:46,574 --> 01:05:51,238
...Miss Iwa came to me
in a dream and told me...

617
01:05:51,980 --> 01:05:55,746
...it was a lie that Ozawa Usaburo
killed our fathers.

618
01:05:56,250 --> 01:05:58,377
She said it was lemon Tamiya.

619
01:05:58,920 --> 01:06:02,287
So it was him!

620
01:06:03,091 --> 01:06:04,319
You knew that?

621
01:06:04,692 --> 01:06:05,716
Yes.

622
01:06:06,427 --> 01:06:10,864
When my sister appeared
Naosuke started raving...

623
01:06:11,599 --> 01:06:13,863
...that lemon was our enemy.

624
01:06:15,069 --> 01:06:17,037
That was all in my dream!

625
01:06:17,472 --> 01:06:22,341
Iemon and Naosuke stabbed me
and pushed me over the falls!

626
01:06:23,978 --> 01:06:26,139
Could they have killed my sister?

627
01:06:26,414 --> 01:06:27,540
They must have.

628
01:06:27,915 --> 01:06:31,874
She told me where lemon was,
and that I should avenge her.

629
01:06:33,121 --> 01:06:35,112
Naosuke said so, too.

630
01:06:36,257 --> 01:06:42,389
Iemon's at the Zuishoji Temple
at Hebiyama, in Honjo.

631
01:06:54,709 --> 01:06:58,543
Chief, how can I help
if you won't say anything?

632
01:06:59,313 --> 01:07:02,510
Open your mouth
and talk to me!

633
01:07:03,751 --> 01:07:07,243
Where did Old Man Ito
keep his damn money?!

634
01:07:09,023 --> 01:07:13,392
It's got to be either under
the floorboards or in the ceiling.

635
01:07:17,365 --> 01:07:20,027
Let's get the hell out of Edo...

636
01:07:20,268 --> 01:07:24,295
...and start over
somewhere brand new!

637
01:07:25,239 --> 01:07:31,235
Hiding out in this snake-infested
temple won't do us any good!

638
01:07:32,713 --> 01:07:37,116
You poison your pretty wife,
set a masseur up as her lover...

639
01:07:37,351 --> 01:07:41,082
...kill him and dump them
in a ditch at Potter's Field.

640
01:07:41,489 --> 01:07:47,155
I'm impressed! The samurai
is as much a villain as I am.

641
01:07:47,395 --> 01:07:51,331
This is no time to go
weepy and womanish!

642
01:07:52,700 --> 01:07:58,639
We're both vermin out of the
same hole. So where's the money?

643
01:07:59,140 --> 01:08:00,164
Naosuke...

644
01:08:02,110 --> 01:08:06,547
...I told you, I didn't take
a penny out of that house.

645
01:08:08,683 --> 01:08:09,775
Go away.

646
01:08:10,818 --> 01:08:12,046
Leave me.

647
01:08:13,488 --> 01:08:15,456
Go away, I tell you!

648
01:08:16,958 --> 01:08:19,984
This is interesting...
you're going to kill me?

649
01:08:20,661 --> 01:08:22,891
Go on, then. Do it.

650
01:08:24,031 --> 01:08:27,933
You don't know your place,
Naosuke.

651
01:08:29,303 --> 01:08:31,066
All of this was your...

652
01:08:31,105 --> 01:08:33,403
Stop this whining! Kill me
if you're going to.

653
01:08:34,142 --> 01:08:39,045
You can't, can you.
You haven't got the spine.

654
01:08:39,280 --> 01:08:40,406
Cut me down!

655
01:09:41,075 --> 01:09:46,240
Iemon!

656
01:09:54,422 --> 01:09:59,450

Iemon Tamiya...
I avenge my father!

I avenge my father...
and my sister!

661

Damn you!

662

Die!

Iwa!

667
01:15:16,744 --> 01:15:18,075
I was wrong!

668
01:15:19,447 --> 01:15:21,039
Forgive me!

669

The End
