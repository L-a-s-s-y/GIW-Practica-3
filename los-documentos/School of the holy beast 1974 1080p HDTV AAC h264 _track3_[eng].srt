1
00:00:15,132 --> 00:04:40,395
A Cult Epics Release

2
00:04:40,395 --> 00:04:44,488
You're strange.
That's your charm.

3
00:04:45,997 --> 00:04:48,782
I'm Kenta.
Come see me tomorrow.

4
00:04:48,847 --> 00:04:50,438
Sorry.

5
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:54,571
I've enjoyed myself as much as I can
for the last time.

6
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,202
Now I have to say goodbye.

7
00:04:56,273 --> 00:04:57,932
Where are you off to?

8
00:05:02,164 --> 00:05:04,915
To where women
aren't women.

9
00:05:30,462 --> 00:05:37,307
SCHOOL OF THE HOLY BEAST

10
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:11,787
An abbey
is a mansion for women

11
00:06:11,854 --> 00:06:15,499
who long for eternal virginity.

12
00:06:17,007 --> 00:06:19,081
They try to live
with strict principles

13
00:06:19,151 --> 00:06:22,415
to become brides
acceptable for God.

14
00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:27,239
Sisters, we've just received
another stray sheep.

15
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:32,498
When a stray sheep
kneels down

16
00:06:32,566 --> 00:06:35,021
in the light before God,

17
00:06:35,094 --> 00:06:38,030
he will cause her
to suffer.

18
00:06:38,102 --> 00:06:41,366
We haven't been forced
to choose our way as nuns.

19
00:06:41,433 --> 00:06:44,019
Our own burning desire
for belief guided us here

20
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:45,616
through the gate of the abbey.

21
00:06:45,689 --> 00:06:48,560
Now let me introduce
our new friend,

22
00:06:48,634 --> 00:06:51,864
Miss Maya Takigawa.

23
00:06:53,053 --> 00:06:56,152
Greet them.

24
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:03,392
How do you do?
I'm Maya Takigawa.

25
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:14,352
We make it the primary rule
to practice discipline.

26
00:08:14,426 --> 00:08:18,552
The discipline comprises

27
00:08:18,621 --> 00:08:22,550
73 chapters.

28
00:08:22,621 --> 00:08:24,183
We are strict about...

29
00:08:24,255 --> 00:08:26,142
adultery,

30
00:08:26,207 --> 00:08:27,964
murder

31
00:08:28,032 --> 00:08:29,308
and theft.

32
00:08:29,376 --> 00:08:33,271
Can you promise you'll
follow these principles?

33
00:08:33,345 --> 00:08:34,906
Yes.

34
00:08:34,977 --> 00:08:38,940
If you break the rules,
you'll be punished.

35
00:08:39,941 --> 00:08:43,007
I'll explain
about our garments.

36
00:08:43,078 --> 00:08:45,217
The white means innocence,

37
00:08:45,286 --> 00:08:48,998
the black, asceticism.

38
00:08:49,064 --> 00:08:51,682
The asceticism
to follow the principles

39
00:08:51,751 --> 00:08:54,273
is the only way

40
00:08:54,345 --> 00:08:58,024
for us to attain the privilege
of the brides.

41
00:09:03,116 --> 00:09:05,986
CHOIR NUNS

42
00:09:06,062 --> 00:09:09,511
This room is for the choir nuns.

43
00:09:09,584 --> 00:09:13,960
They're of a higher rank
than assistant nuns.

44
00:09:14,032 --> 00:09:16,782
Don't forget to be polite.

45
00:09:16,849 --> 00:09:18,956
How do you do?

46
00:09:21,939 --> 00:09:24,111
ASSISTANT NUNS

47
00:09:51,166 --> 00:09:55,292
Lord! Oh Lord!

48
00:09:57,698 --> 00:09:59,520
Give me your strength.

49
00:10:03,971 --> 00:10:07,649
Lord, beat me
with a whip.

50
00:10:07,717 --> 00:10:09,756
Forgive me.

51
00:10:16,905 --> 00:10:18,498
Lord...

52
00:10:24,298 --> 00:10:25,794
Maya.

53
00:10:25,868 --> 00:10:27,755
Surprised?

54
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:30,438
You'll get used to it.

55
00:10:30,508 --> 00:10:33,029
Whenever we feel
we're tempted by sin,

56
00:10:33,101 --> 00:10:35,972
we whip ourselves like that.

57
00:10:36,047 --> 00:10:38,503
That's why we have whips.

58
00:10:45,747 --> 00:10:49,545
Jesus Christ was born.

59
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:54,706
His mother, Mary...

60
00:10:54,773 --> 00:10:57,621
was engaged to Joseph.

61
00:10:57,686 --> 00:11:00,109
Jesus was immaculately conceived.

62
00:11:00,183 --> 00:11:03,414
That's how He was brought
into this world.

63
00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:07,833
Mary's husband, Joseph
was a good man.

64
00:11:07,899 --> 00:11:11,130
Though he didn't want
to speak of it in public,

65
00:11:11,196 --> 00:11:14,362
he was secretly planning
to get a divorce.

66
00:11:15,454 --> 00:11:19,710
While he was considering this,

67
00:11:19,775 --> 00:11:24,566
God appeared in his dreams.

68
00:11:25,985 --> 00:11:28,189
"Joseph, son of David,

69
00:11:28,258 --> 00:11:31,423
do not be afraid to accept
Mary as your wife. "

70
00:11:31,492 --> 00:11:35,290
The baby was
immaculately conceived.

71
00:11:35,364 --> 00:11:38,268
God said...

72
00:11:38,342 --> 00:11:41,638
that His name
was to be Jesus.

73
00:11:41,703 --> 00:11:45,981
"You need to accept Him
with His mother," God said.

74
00:11:47,273 --> 00:11:51,235
Prophets had known
of this for a long time,

75
00:11:51,306 --> 00:11:55,105
as God had told them of it.

76
00:11:55,179 --> 00:11:57,221
And God said...

77
00:11:57,292 --> 00:12:00,676
"Let the woman
deliver the baby peacefully. "

78
00:12:00,751 --> 00:12:04,461
His name was
to be Emmanuel...

79
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:10,672
which means
"God is with us. "

80
00:12:10,737 --> 00:12:14,513
Joseph woke up
from his dream

81
00:12:14,578 --> 00:12:18,475
and accepted his wife
as God had willed.

82
00:12:19,478 --> 00:12:22,513
But until the baby was born,

83
00:12:22,583 --> 00:12:25,070
he would not know love.

84
00:12:26,359 --> 00:12:29,262
"Do not commit adultery. "

85
00:12:29,336 --> 00:12:32,655
"If you look at a woman
with desire,

86
00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:37,620
you've already committed
adultery in your mind. "

87
00:12:38,621 --> 00:12:41,437
The sin of adultery

88
00:12:41,501 --> 00:12:43,836
is the heaviest
among the principles.

89
00:12:43,901 --> 00:12:46,269
If you harbor the thought

90
00:12:46,335 --> 00:12:50,975
you'll be stigmatized
as a dirty renegade.

91
00:12:51,042 --> 00:12:53,113
We nuns should keep

92
00:12:53,185 --> 00:12:57,213
our bodies and souls pure.

93
00:12:57,284 --> 00:12:59,357
I have a question.

94
00:12:59,428 --> 00:13:01,021
Go ahead.

95
00:13:01,092 --> 00:13:03,581
What did Jesus say

96
00:13:03,654 --> 00:13:06,787
to those who committed adultery?

97
00:13:06,854 --> 00:13:08,710
They're no better than animals.

98
00:13:08,776 --> 00:13:13,414
They live to be arrested
and killed.

99
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:15,785
They'll be punished

100
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:19,079
and ruined for their injustice.

101
00:13:19,146 --> 00:13:21,569
Vice Abbess.

102
00:13:21,644 --> 00:13:23,073
Sister Takigawa.

103
00:13:24,077 --> 00:13:27,145
If our parents hadn't sinned,

104
00:13:27,214 --> 00:13:29,964
we wouldn't have been born.

105
00:13:30,032 --> 00:13:33,513
A surprising question.

106
00:13:33,584 --> 00:13:37,067
Think of the Immaculate Conception.

107
00:13:37,138 --> 00:13:39,595
Is it really possible?

108
00:13:41,843 --> 00:13:44,659
Stop insulting Mother Mary.

109
00:13:44,725 --> 00:13:48,468
She got pregnant
because she had a lover.

110
00:13:50,326 --> 00:13:52,270
How dare you!

111
00:13:52,343 --> 00:13:54,319
No use shouting.

112
00:13:54,393 --> 00:13:58,290
If you don't have sex,
no baby will come out.

113
00:13:58,362 --> 00:14:00,948
Mother Mary was a virgin.

114
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:02,513
You're insulting her.

115
00:14:02,588 --> 00:14:05,403
What she said
was unforgivable.

116
00:14:05,469 --> 00:14:08,023
Get rid of Sister Ishida.

117
00:14:08,093 --> 00:14:10,908
We won't study
with assistant nuns.

118
00:14:10,974 --> 00:14:14,074
- Expel them!
- Wait.

119
00:14:14,143 --> 00:14:18,653
You can't judge all of us
by Sister Ishida alone.

120
00:14:18,721 --> 00:14:21,885
We came here

121
00:14:21,954 --> 00:14:23,929
because of our strong
religious faith.

122
00:14:24,003 --> 00:14:27,039
What on earth brought
a person like her here?

123
00:14:27,108 --> 00:14:28,604
We aren't any different.

124
00:14:28,678 --> 00:14:31,579
An abbey

125
00:14:31,654 --> 00:14:35,911
is a place for dropouts
from society.

126
00:14:36,904 --> 00:14:39,043
You're probably
not even a virgin yourself.

127
00:14:39,112 --> 00:14:41,054
How rude!

128
00:14:42,667 --> 00:14:45,187
That's all for today.

129
00:14:49,293 --> 00:14:53,517
We'll expel those
who make disgraceful remarks.

130
00:14:53,582 --> 00:14:55,689
Good day.

131
00:15:07,476 --> 00:15:08,937
You can't fall asleep, huh?

132
00:15:14,326 --> 00:15:16,498
Let's have a drink.

133
00:15:16,568 --> 00:15:18,639
I'm glad to have you here.

134
00:15:18,711 --> 00:15:21,363
It's nice to have a girl
with a backbone.

135
00:15:24,441 --> 00:15:27,606
It's funny to find someone
like you here in the abbey.

136
00:15:27,674 --> 00:15:30,261
Pretentious women
irritate me.

137
00:15:30,332 --> 00:15:32,951
I've always wanted to ridicule
the Vice Abbess in class.

138
00:15:36,478 --> 00:15:38,302
Miss Ishida.

139
00:15:38,367 --> 00:15:41,565
Even as a joke,

140
00:15:41,632 --> 00:15:45,889
drinking whiskey at night
is just too much.

141
00:15:46,881 --> 00:15:50,396
The abbey is more like a prison.

142
00:15:50,467 --> 00:15:54,779
Your parents are
pious and respectable.

143
00:15:54,853 --> 00:15:57,701
How can their daughter
be so vulgar?

144
00:15:58,758 --> 00:16:02,021
My father owns bars
and night clubs.

145
00:16:02,087 --> 00:16:05,024
My stepmother was either gonna
send me here or to a loony bin.

146
00:16:05,098 --> 00:16:08,992
So I chose to come here.

147
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:13,481
You need
to learn perseverance.

148
00:16:13,548 --> 00:16:18,568
Your parents want us
to reform you

149
00:16:18,637 --> 00:16:20,614
here at St. Clore Abbey.

150
00:16:20,686 --> 00:16:23,076
My parents must've
given you money or something.

151
00:16:23,152 --> 00:16:26,317
By the way,
who told on me?

152
00:16:26,385 --> 00:16:29,931
Don't talk that way,
Sister Ishida.

153
00:16:31,378 --> 00:16:33,801
God knows everything.

154
00:16:34,802 --> 00:16:36,746
Don't push alcohol
on somebody

155
00:16:36,819 --> 00:16:40,204
who's training
to be a good nun.

156
00:16:43,542 --> 00:16:47,635
I see. That new bitch.

157
00:16:49,849 --> 00:16:52,086
Do we always
have to work so hard?

158
00:16:52,155 --> 00:16:56,049
Not always. But it's usually
more or less like this.

159
00:16:56,123 --> 00:16:57,879
They discriminate
against us

160
00:16:57,947 --> 00:17:02,260
because we didn't make
any donations. It's unfair.

161
00:17:02,333 --> 00:17:06,229
They give us such small meals.
My body can't go on like this.

162
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:29,382
They're so delicious
I feel like I could die.

163
00:17:29,447 --> 00:17:32,449
It's been so long
since I enjoyed eating this much.

164
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:43,626
PERSECUTION ROOM

165
00:17:45,101 --> 00:17:48,518
Now God is going
to punish you.

166
00:17:49,711 --> 00:17:53,007
God gave us the whips.

167
00:17:54,417 --> 00:17:56,906
Beat each other twenty times.

168
00:17:58,514 --> 00:18:00,338
Go on!

169
00:18:00,404 --> 00:18:04,016
Beat each other
until you bleed.

170
00:18:12,246 --> 00:18:13,840
Kaoru.

171
00:18:19,322 --> 00:18:21,395
What are you waiting for?

172
00:18:21,467 --> 00:18:22,841
Beat the woman!

173
00:18:27,005 --> 00:18:30,356
Okay, go ahead
and beat her.

174
00:19:32,404 --> 00:19:34,545
The punishment was too harsh
for just stealing food.

175
00:19:34,614 --> 00:19:36,022
How did they find out?

176
00:19:36,087 --> 00:19:41,391
We were alone
in the storage room.

177
00:19:41,464 --> 00:19:42,675
Strange...

178
00:19:42,746 --> 00:19:45,878
Is there an informer?

179
00:19:47,322 --> 00:19:51,284
That's right.
One of us is a spy.

180
00:19:53,852 --> 00:19:56,854
You mean me?

181
00:19:56,926 --> 00:19:58,781
No.

182
00:19:58,846 --> 00:20:02,460
But since you came here,

183
00:20:02,528 --> 00:20:05,278
they've been well-informed.

184
00:20:18,982 --> 00:20:20,324
Janet...

185
00:20:21,639 --> 00:20:25,253
You gave me
valuable information.

186
00:20:26,634 --> 00:20:30,432
I'll recommend you
for membership in the choir.

187
00:20:31,436 --> 00:20:33,061
Sister...

188
00:21:57,930 --> 00:21:59,906
Somebody's there.

189
00:22:03,214 --> 00:22:06,181
Sorry to interrupt you.

190
00:22:06,254 --> 00:22:08,110
What are you doing here?

191
00:22:08,176 --> 00:22:11,438
You'll be punished for this.

192
00:22:11,504 --> 00:22:14,985
You two will be punished.

193
00:22:15,057 --> 00:22:20,110
Or do they allow homosexual acts
between nuns here?

194
00:22:21,427 --> 00:22:23,566
Don't be scared.

195
00:22:23,637 --> 00:22:26,954
Nobody's shocked
by lesbians.

196
00:22:27,031 --> 00:22:31,025
Why don't you forget
about spying and enjoy yourselves.

197
00:22:31,095 --> 00:22:34,740
Don't tell anybody about us.

198
00:22:34,808 --> 00:22:38,422
Who told you to act as a spy?

199
00:22:41,628 --> 00:22:43,537
The Vice Abbess.

200
00:22:43,610 --> 00:22:46,295
Well, well!

201
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:50,589
She wants us to be honest
and true while she spies.

202
00:22:51,583 --> 00:22:54,334
I'll keep this to myself.

203
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:58,362
You must obey my orders
from now on.

204
00:23:01,057 --> 00:23:03,447
Hurry!

205
00:23:03,524 --> 00:23:07,583
It'd be terrible
if they saw us now.

206
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:19,752
"Michiko Shinohara"

207
00:23:19,818 --> 00:23:21,987
"Christian name: Mary"

208
00:23:22,057 --> 00:23:23,782
"Died of a heart attack. "

209
00:23:24,778 --> 00:23:27,878
"Witnessed by Aya Ogasawara"

210
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:03,348
How are you?
Any better today?

211
00:24:03,418 --> 00:24:06,419
Sorry for burdening you.

212
00:24:06,491 --> 00:24:09,361
Not at all. It's my job.

213
00:24:09,437 --> 00:24:11,475
You assistant nuns
have been busy

214
00:24:11,548 --> 00:24:14,364
since I fell ill.

215
00:24:14,429 --> 00:24:18,904
Don't worry. We can handle
the food. We're glad to do it.

216
00:24:45,801 --> 00:24:48,584
Maya, who gave you this?

217
00:24:49,577 --> 00:24:51,488
My mother.

218
00:24:53,388 --> 00:24:56,073
You mean you're...

219
00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:59,369
Michiko Shinohara's daughter.

220
00:25:03,503 --> 00:25:07,050
Don't tell the abbess.

221
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:12,141
I came here
of my own free will.

222
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:17,294
Will you tell me
about my mother?

223
00:25:17,364 --> 00:25:19,701
How did she die?

224
00:25:19,766 --> 00:25:21,938
Where was my father?

225
00:25:22,006 --> 00:25:23,796
I don't know.

226
00:25:23,862 --> 00:25:28,206
She was a nice, kind woman.

227
00:26:14,985 --> 00:26:18,183
You're spying again.

228
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:20,074
You get another
gold star.

229
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:22,508
Don't call me a spy again.

230
00:26:22,573 --> 00:26:23,717
What?

231
00:26:24,748 --> 00:26:27,532
Go back to the reformatory.

232
00:26:27,598 --> 00:26:30,054
I can run away any time.

233
00:26:30,127 --> 00:26:33,163
But not before I expose you.

234
00:26:38,738 --> 00:26:41,424
Don't mess with me, kid!

235
00:27:26,468 --> 00:27:28,890
Stop fighting.

236
00:27:30,982 --> 00:27:33,087
You shameless girls!

237
00:27:33,158 --> 00:27:37,416
What if people saw you now?
Mind our honor.

238
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:41,257
You can't hide the filth forever.

239
00:27:41,322 --> 00:27:43,689
Shut up!

240
00:27:43,755 --> 00:27:46,243
You'll be confined for three days.

241
00:27:52,493 --> 00:27:54,152
Sister!

242
00:27:55,182 --> 00:27:56,492
How are you?

243
00:27:57,775 --> 00:28:02,054
This is for you,
from the field in the back.

244
00:28:05,555 --> 00:28:07,214
Thank you.

245
00:28:07,284 --> 00:28:09,773
How's father?

246
00:28:10,805 --> 00:28:15,758
The doctor said he wouldn't
be able to work again.

247
00:28:19,128 --> 00:28:22,358
I can't do anything for you,

248
00:28:22,424 --> 00:28:25,459
for I'm already serving God.

249
00:28:25,530 --> 00:28:30,136
But I'm always praying
for my family.

250
00:28:31,483 --> 00:28:34,485
Each time I see you,
you've changed.

251
00:28:34,557 --> 00:28:36,118
Have I?

252
00:28:36,190 --> 00:28:39,453
It's as if you were talking
to a stranger.

253
00:28:40,670 --> 00:28:43,967
I'll work as soon
as I leave school.

254
00:28:44,033 --> 00:28:47,547
Mother wants you
to come back.

255
00:28:51,427 --> 00:28:55,651
Father will die
if he isn't hospitalized.

256
00:28:55,718 --> 00:29:00,934
She needs 100,000 yen
to cover everything.

257
00:29:00,998 --> 00:29:04,775
All your praying
won't bring us money, will it?

258
00:29:05,769 --> 00:29:08,639
Keiko, don't be unreasonable.

259
00:29:14,412 --> 00:29:16,835
This is terrible!

260
00:29:17,838 --> 00:29:19,298
What's wrong?

261
00:29:19,374 --> 00:29:23,020
50,000 yen disappeared
from my drawer.

262
00:29:23,088 --> 00:29:24,549
Are you sure?

263
00:29:24,623 --> 00:29:26,512
One of the nuns stole it.

264
00:29:26,576 --> 00:29:29,676
One of the assistant nuns
who cleaned the room.

265
00:29:29,744 --> 00:29:32,648
Don't assume the worst.

266
00:29:32,722 --> 00:29:35,374
Gather all the assistant nuns.

267
00:29:46,617 --> 00:29:49,072
The money?

268
00:30:01,181 --> 00:30:03,418
What's this?

269
00:30:06,688 --> 00:30:09,820
How awful!
They're like beasts!

270
00:30:18,788 --> 00:30:23,230
The criminal might be keeping it
under her garment.

271
00:30:23,301 --> 00:30:26,782
"Criminal?"
Don't talk like a cop.

272
00:30:27,912 --> 00:30:31,329
Let's strip to help
clear the suspicion.

273
00:30:37,546 --> 00:30:40,515
Now investigate us thoroughly.

274
00:30:40,588 --> 00:30:42,498
Strip, everybody!

275
00:30:52,017 --> 00:30:54,407
Oh, no! How shameful!

276
00:30:54,482 --> 00:30:57,296
Shall I take them off?

277
00:30:59,635 --> 00:31:02,156
No. Keep them on.

278
00:31:02,227 --> 00:31:03,985
Come on!

279
00:31:04,053 --> 00:31:05,678
No thank you.

280
00:31:05,748 --> 00:31:09,066
No use stripping.
The money won't be found.

281
00:31:09,142 --> 00:31:11,053
What?

282
00:31:11,128 --> 00:31:12,917
Whoever stole the money

283
00:31:12,984 --> 00:31:15,766
wouldn't keep it in a place
that's so easy to find.

284
00:31:16,761 --> 00:31:19,283
If she has a guilty conscience,
she'll confess.

285
00:31:20,410 --> 00:31:22,201
Right?

286
00:31:22,268 --> 00:31:24,308
Yes.

287
00:31:25,307 --> 00:31:27,610
Vice Abbess.

288
00:31:28,605 --> 00:31:33,047
We'd better stop investigating.

289
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,581
All right.

290
00:31:34,656 --> 00:31:37,373
I'll take these pictures away.

291
00:31:37,441 --> 00:31:40,639
I'll burn them, for sure.

292
00:32:13,806 --> 00:32:16,874
Welcome, Father Kakinuma.

293
00:32:18,672 --> 00:32:21,323
St. Clore Abbey
is well-disciplined.

294
00:32:21,392 --> 00:32:24,295
Everything is managed smoothly.

295
00:32:24,370 --> 00:32:30,418
This is an ideal abbey.

296
00:32:32,213 --> 00:32:37,451
It's due entirely to your burning
religious faith.

297
00:32:37,527 --> 00:32:40,146
Thank you.

298
00:32:40,215 --> 00:32:45,039
I'll report to the headquarters
in Rome.

299
00:33:12,963 --> 00:33:15,485
What's wrong?

300
00:33:19,014 --> 00:33:20,957
Father.

301
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:26,886
You seem to be upset.

302
00:33:26,953 --> 00:33:30,215
Tell me. I'll listen.

303
00:33:32,491 --> 00:33:33,898
Father...

304
00:33:36,749 --> 00:33:38,725
Father...

305
00:33:40,173 --> 00:33:41,931
I stole the money

306
00:33:41,999 --> 00:33:46,190
from the abbey.

307
00:33:48,210 --> 00:33:50,544
I violated the disciplines.

308
00:33:52,723 --> 00:33:55,342
My parents were against

309
00:33:55,411 --> 00:33:58,990
my coming to this abbey.

310
00:33:59,061 --> 00:34:01,549
My family is large.

311
00:34:02,742 --> 00:34:05,941
We were living
from hand to mouth.

312
00:34:06,936 --> 00:34:10,898
But I wanted to serve Jesus.

313
00:34:11,898 --> 00:34:14,451
My father understood,

314
00:34:14,522 --> 00:34:17,906
but he fell ill.

315
00:34:20,637 --> 00:34:23,737
When I cleaned
the Vice Abbess' room,

316
00:34:23,807 --> 00:34:26,743
I found the money.

317
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:32,187
I'd been thinking
of my father.

318
00:34:32,257 --> 00:34:36,056
Before I knew it,
I had taken it.

319
00:34:38,467 --> 00:34:42,725
Father, punish me.

320
00:34:44,998 --> 00:34:47,485
I'm suffering.

321
00:34:47,559 --> 00:34:50,178
I betrayed God

322
00:34:50,247 --> 00:34:53,510
and I'm still
here in the abbey...

323
00:34:56,522 --> 00:34:58,530
Only the innocent

324
00:34:58,602 --> 00:35:03,209
can beat a sinful woman
with a rock.

325
00:35:03,276 --> 00:35:06,660
Do you know these words
of Jesus?

326
00:35:08,846 --> 00:35:13,670
He won't punish you.

327
00:35:22,803 --> 00:35:25,587
Father... this money...

328
00:35:25,652 --> 00:35:28,305
Pay fifty back.

329
00:35:29,334 --> 00:35:33,264
Keep the rest
for your poor family.

330
00:35:35,383 --> 00:35:37,970
Thank you.

331
00:35:39,323 --> 00:35:42,041
Is your worry gone?

332
00:35:42,107 --> 00:35:44,212
Yes.

333
00:35:44,284 --> 00:35:46,674
Has your suffering disappeared

334
00:35:46,749 --> 00:35:50,612
without any trace?

335
00:35:50,686 --> 00:35:52,378
Yes.

336
00:35:52,448 --> 00:35:56,189
Because God came to me,
to forgive me.

337
00:36:02,595 --> 00:36:04,122
God never comes to you.

338
00:36:06,532 --> 00:36:08,125
Never to you.

339
00:36:11,398 --> 00:36:14,016
You make a confession,

340
00:36:15,142 --> 00:36:19,455
and your guilty conscience
melts like snow.

341
00:36:20,714 --> 00:36:24,063
God will never
come to you.

342
00:36:30,445 --> 00:36:33,675
Did God ever come
to save men?

343
00:36:35,663 --> 00:36:39,111
In the history of mankind?

344
00:36:43,890 --> 00:36:45,515
Why not wait?

345
00:36:48,243 --> 00:36:50,928
Why not wait for God,

346
00:36:50,997 --> 00:36:53,037
who'll come to punish you?

347
00:36:53,110 --> 00:36:55,380
Father!

348
00:37:22,944 --> 00:37:25,815
Maybe God got you
ready for me

349
00:37:25,890 --> 00:37:28,640
as a sacrifice!

350
00:37:38,086 --> 00:37:40,770
Mother!

351
00:38:47,968 --> 00:38:49,943
How filthy!

352
00:39:00,741 --> 00:39:02,749
Oh, Jesus!

353
00:39:02,822 --> 00:39:04,829
Why do men

354
00:39:04,901 --> 00:39:08,580
do such filthy things?

355
00:39:12,617 --> 00:39:14,985
Like dogs!

356
00:40:17,152 --> 00:40:19,739
Tell me, buddy.

357
00:40:19,808 --> 00:40:22,428
Will your girl really come?

358
00:40:22,498 --> 00:40:26,526
Of course.
She wanted to see me.

359
00:40:26,596 --> 00:40:30,176
Why did she have to go
to the abbey?

360
00:40:30,246 --> 00:40:31,937
She was Influenced
by a movie.

361
00:40:32,007 --> 00:40:33,436
Maybe.

362
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:37,343
Hi!

363
00:40:37,417 --> 00:40:40,035
Is she your girl, Maya?

364
00:40:40,105 --> 00:40:42,343
Yes. She's a nun.

365
00:40:44,362 --> 00:40:47,081
- I'm surprised you got out.
- I have a fun idea.

366
00:40:47,147 --> 00:40:48,554
Interested?

367
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:53,193
I'll do anything for you.
I'll disguise myself.

368
00:41:06,546 --> 00:41:07,475
Hello.

369
00:41:07,539 --> 00:41:09,034
Hello.

370
00:41:25,370 --> 00:41:28,786
The sex-hungry nun
is sleeping in here.

371
00:41:28,859 --> 00:41:32,689
Give her pleasure.
I'll stand watch here.

372
00:41:32,763 --> 00:41:33,942
All right.

373
00:41:34,013 --> 00:41:35,190
Good.

374
00:42:24,047 --> 00:42:28,075
Poor woman!
Wasting her womanhood!

375
00:42:28,145 --> 00:42:31,080
I'll give her what she wants.

376
00:42:31,154 --> 00:42:32,813
Me first.

377
00:42:32,882 --> 00:42:34,378
No, me.

378
00:42:34,451 --> 00:42:36,786
You're not hung.

379
00:42:36,852 --> 00:42:39,537
How convenient!

380
00:42:46,583 --> 00:42:48,144
Oh, God!

381
00:42:59,293 --> 00:43:01,268
I'll take you.

382
00:43:01,340 --> 00:43:05,619
This way you can
go to heaven quickly.

383
00:43:05,695 --> 00:43:08,860
Who are you?
I'm a pure virgin for God.

384
00:43:08,928 --> 00:43:10,816
Stop it!

385
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:12,539
Jesus!

386
00:43:12,609 --> 00:43:13,952
Jesus.

387
00:43:14,018 --> 00:43:15,742
Jesus Christ!

388
00:43:15,810 --> 00:43:19,357
Let's switch!
I'm nearly exploding!

389
00:43:21,124 --> 00:43:23,100
Forgive me!

390
00:43:23,174 --> 00:43:25,477
Stop it!

391
00:43:28,039 --> 00:43:30,210
More! More!

392
00:43:31,208 --> 00:43:33,215
Mother Mary!

393
00:44:00,915 --> 00:44:02,322
Amen.

394
00:44:03,893 --> 00:44:09,394
My turn.
Where's the pussy cat?

395
00:44:11,031 --> 00:44:13,367
Time's up. Get out
before they find you.

396
00:44:13,432 --> 00:44:15,538
Come on! Hurry up!

397
00:44:16,857 --> 00:44:18,579
Oh, no! How cruel!

398
00:44:27,517 --> 00:44:29,274
Let's go.

399
00:44:42,018 --> 00:44:44,288
Who are you? Wait!

400
00:44:52,166 --> 00:44:53,990
This way.

401
00:44:54,056 --> 00:44:55,266
Wait!

402
00:45:12,783 --> 00:45:16,808
Maya, you've got guts.
I admire you.

403
00:45:16,879 --> 00:45:19,563
You got men into an abbey
for women only.

404
00:45:19,632 --> 00:45:20,974
She's my type!

405
00:45:21,042 --> 00:45:23,247
You're flattering me.

406
00:45:23,314 --> 00:45:25,202
Hurry!

407
00:45:29,204 --> 00:45:31,309
Bye-bye! Hurry!

408
00:45:35,061 --> 00:45:36,720
What are you doing?

409
00:45:36,791 --> 00:45:37,903
Taking a walk.

410
00:45:37,975 --> 00:45:40,311
Did you see the strangers?

411
00:45:40,376 --> 00:45:41,904
No.

412
00:45:41,976 --> 00:45:44,660
Let's go to the chapel
for prayer.

413
00:45:45,659 --> 00:45:47,317
Excuse us.

414
00:46:04,288 --> 00:46:08,316
Vice Abbess, what happened?

415
00:46:08,386 --> 00:46:12,447
Did somebody
break into this room?

416
00:46:17,703 --> 00:46:21,348
Control yourself!
Tell me what happened.

417
00:46:29,641 --> 00:46:32,260
I resisted desperately.

418
00:46:32,330 --> 00:46:35,648
But they forcibly...

419
00:46:35,724 --> 00:46:36,871
"They?"

420
00:46:37,870 --> 00:46:42,605
I kept my virginity for 32 years
and 4 months.

421
00:46:42,670 --> 00:46:46,218
But the men...

422
00:46:46,289 --> 00:46:47,979
they took me by force.

423
00:46:48,049 --> 00:46:49,610
"Men?"

424
00:46:49,682 --> 00:46:51,242
Men?!

425
00:46:53,041 --> 00:46:55,018
Those suspicious nuns
were men.

426
00:46:56,147 --> 00:46:58,124
Abbess.

427
00:46:58,197 --> 00:47:00,172
Ryoko passed Maya
in the corridor.

428
00:47:00,246 --> 00:47:03,149
She was with the strangers.

429
00:47:04,152 --> 00:47:06,291
- Is that true?
- Yes.

430
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:08,433
It was dark,
but I saw their faces.

431
00:47:11,833 --> 00:47:14,998
Bring Maya
to the Persecution Room.

432
00:47:15,995 --> 00:47:19,772
We have to weed out
the Judas.

433
00:48:02,604 --> 00:48:05,672
The 13th punishment!

434
00:48:14,002 --> 00:48:15,179
Punishment!

435
00:48:18,003 --> 00:48:19,409
Punishment!

436
00:48:20,467 --> 00:48:21,874
Punishment!

437
00:50:01,175 --> 00:50:02,770
Is she...

438
00:50:10,300 --> 00:50:12,123
Sister Ishida!

439
00:50:16,734 --> 00:50:19,551
You filthy hypocrites!

440
00:50:19,616 --> 00:50:21,111
This is worse than prison.

441
00:50:21,183 --> 00:50:22,939
Ishida.

442
00:50:23,008 --> 00:50:25,758
She's a rebel
against the church.

443
00:50:25,825 --> 00:50:30,300
She brought men
into the Garden of Angels.

444
00:50:30,372 --> 00:50:33,669
"Angels?"
You're just a dyke.

445
00:50:33,733 --> 00:50:37,563
Oh, no!
How could you call me that?

446
00:50:38,630 --> 00:50:43,682
Abbess, it was me who
brought those men in here.

447
00:50:49,034 --> 00:50:51,401
Is that true?

448
00:50:51,467 --> 00:50:55,691
Yes. It's my confession.
You can count on it.

449
00:50:55,755 --> 00:51:00,646
Punishment on Ishida!
Give her punishment!

450
00:51:00,719 --> 00:51:02,410
Punishment!

451
00:51:02,479 --> 00:51:04,486
Punishment!

452
00:51:12,498 --> 00:51:14,124
Don't mess with me.

453
00:51:15,123 --> 00:51:17,228
Hysterical bitches!

454
00:51:17,300 --> 00:51:20,946
I'll handle this.

455
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:26,808
Why is sex wrong?

456
00:51:26,873 --> 00:51:30,802
You look decent,
but you want to get laid.

457
00:51:30,875 --> 00:51:35,217
Abbess, this is blasphemy.

458
00:51:35,290 --> 00:51:37,147
Expel her.

459
00:51:37,212 --> 00:51:40,694
Expel her.
She's like a gangster.

460
00:51:45,951 --> 00:51:49,214
Maya, it's getting interesting.

461
00:51:49,281 --> 00:51:53,308
Sister Ishida,
get out of this abbey.

462
00:51:53,377 --> 00:51:56,825
All right. I don't care.

463
00:52:03,718 --> 00:52:06,588
I'll go away, but...

464
00:52:06,663 --> 00:52:08,769
don't bully Maya.

465
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:13,893
If you do, I'll have
your scandals publicized.

466
00:52:14,890 --> 00:52:16,647
Remember that.

467
00:52:22,989 --> 00:52:25,129
Dismissed!

468
00:52:25,197 --> 00:52:26,921
Abbess!

469
00:52:27,950 --> 00:52:29,891
Not enough evidence.

470
00:52:31,120 --> 00:52:35,431
Sister Takigawa,
go back to your room.

471
00:52:54,039 --> 00:52:55,895
Maya.

472
00:52:58,394 --> 00:53:00,019
I'm going...

473
00:53:00,090 --> 00:53:05,331
to the house of God.

474
00:53:08,287 --> 00:53:12,564
I'll tell you the truth.

475
00:53:14,464 --> 00:53:17,977
You must go to another abbey

476
00:53:18,048 --> 00:53:21,213
as soon as possible.

477
00:53:32,198 --> 00:53:37,534
I still remember that day.

478
00:53:39,560 --> 00:53:43,457
I can't forget it,
even if I try to.

479
00:53:43,530 --> 00:53:47,787
I was watching
from the shadows.

480
00:53:49,644 --> 00:53:52,613
I watched a pure woman
who served God

481
00:53:52,686 --> 00:53:55,622
change into a devil.

482
00:53:56,719 --> 00:54:00,331
Michiko was going to be abbess,

483
00:54:00,399 --> 00:54:03,303
but she violated the discipline.

484
00:54:04,883 --> 00:54:07,054
The present abbess tortured her

485
00:54:07,122 --> 00:54:11,117
when she was pregnant.

486
00:54:11,189 --> 00:54:12,880
She looked like a demon.

487
00:54:31,036 --> 00:54:36,700
It was December 25th,
Christmas Day.

488
00:54:42,209 --> 00:54:46,518
When she hanged herself,
a baby was born.

489
00:54:53,701 --> 00:54:59,366
I tied her rosary to the baby
as the mother's keepsake.

490
00:54:59,431 --> 00:55:02,913
I took the baby to town.

491
00:55:02,984 --> 00:55:05,636
It was you, Maya.

492
00:55:06,633 --> 00:55:12,200
I don't know
who your father was.

493
00:55:13,580 --> 00:55:18,536
That is all I know.

494
00:55:48,985 --> 00:55:50,808
Maya, dear.

495
00:56:05,374 --> 00:56:07,034
So it's you.

496
00:56:07,104 --> 00:56:09,439
I won't forgive you.

497
00:56:10,433 --> 00:56:14,526
But your mother
was to blame.

498
00:56:14,593 --> 00:56:18,240
She violated the discipline
and had you.

499
00:56:19,428 --> 00:56:23,105
I had to do it to protect the honor
of the abbey.

500
00:56:23,172 --> 00:56:24,734
I don't want to hear
your excuses!

501
00:56:24,805 --> 00:56:28,069
You must leave here today.

502
00:56:28,136 --> 00:56:31,432
Go back to the time

503
00:56:31,495 --> 00:56:34,247
when you only had
good thoughts of your parents.

504
00:56:34,313 --> 00:56:36,933
You should return.

505
00:56:37,003 --> 00:56:38,891
No kidding.

506
00:56:38,956 --> 00:56:41,673
Who was my father?

507
00:56:42,669 --> 00:56:45,223
- Tell me!
- I don't know.

508
00:56:45,293 --> 00:56:49,321
Why not? You must know
everything that happened.

509
00:56:49,391 --> 00:56:52,621
Maya, dear,
don't go any farther.

510
00:56:52,688 --> 00:56:55,406
This is the realm of God.

511
00:56:55,474 --> 00:56:57,449
"Realm of God?"

512
00:56:57,522 --> 00:57:00,011
You should return now.

513
00:57:00,084 --> 00:57:02,091
To where?

514
00:57:02,163 --> 00:57:06,224
I came back to where
I was born.

515
00:57:06,294 --> 00:57:09,612
I'll watch this rotten abbey fall.

516
00:57:09,688 --> 00:57:12,371
I'll make it happen.

517
00:57:25,758 --> 00:57:30,996
Why not expel
Maya Takigawa at once?

518
00:57:31,070 --> 00:57:33,722
She knows too much.

519
00:57:33,793 --> 00:57:37,688
Then arrange a ceremony
to offer her to God.

520
00:57:37,761 --> 00:57:40,544
There should be
no "ceremony" for her.

521
00:57:40,610 --> 00:57:44,157
Her mother
was Michiko Shinohara.

522
00:57:44,226 --> 00:57:47,806
She's your daughter.
I'm scared.

523
00:57:49,733 --> 00:57:54,176
Our sins of 18 years past
are standing before us

524
00:57:55,176 --> 00:58:01,287
wearing a cloak
of hatred.

525
00:58:12,686 --> 00:58:14,094
Past...

526
00:58:19,088 --> 00:58:21,959
In the past,

527
00:58:22,033 --> 00:58:25,995
you were extremely jealous
of Michiko.

528
00:58:26,995 --> 00:58:28,784
You even hated her.

529
00:58:30,003 --> 00:58:32,045
That's right.

530
00:58:32,117 --> 00:58:37,137
We went to school together.

531
00:58:37,207 --> 00:58:38,930
We were baptized

532
00:58:38,999 --> 00:58:41,522
and came here together.

533
00:58:42,905 --> 00:58:46,136
We were always
on the same path,

534
00:58:46,203 --> 00:58:50,131
but she was always...

535
00:58:50,204 --> 00:58:54,067
outshining me.

536
00:58:54,141 --> 00:58:56,728
We were always compared...

537
00:58:56,797 --> 00:59:00,181
I was always inferior to her.

538
00:59:00,255 --> 00:59:02,428
I was miserable.

539
00:59:06,593 --> 00:59:08,962
When I left
pregnant Michiko...

540
00:59:11,141 --> 00:59:14,436
I fled to Rome, to school.

541
00:59:17,958 --> 00:59:23,011
You dealt with her
after I went away.

542
00:59:23,080 --> 00:59:26,179
That's how you earned

543
00:59:26,249 --> 00:59:29,863
your present position.

544
00:59:31,019 --> 00:59:32,743
It's true.

545
00:59:32,812 --> 00:59:37,286
At last I defeated my rival.

546
00:59:38,926 --> 00:59:43,237
With these
blood-soaked fingers...

547
00:59:45,232 --> 00:59:46,956
Father...

548
00:59:48,049 --> 00:59:53,168
I hated Michiko
because you loved her.

549
00:59:54,260 --> 00:59:58,866
She was trying to live
out of love for you.

550
00:59:59,893 --> 01:00:02,545
I was mad. Jealousy
made me cold and cruel.

551
01:00:03,863 --> 01:00:07,573
I made love to you, too.

552
01:00:12,058 --> 01:00:13,651
You did.

553
01:00:15,483 --> 01:00:18,453
But I wonder

554
01:00:18,524 --> 01:00:20,892
if you really loved me.

555
01:00:23,486 --> 01:00:24,947
Love?

556
01:00:27,711 --> 01:00:29,949
It's an illusion.

557
01:00:35,106 --> 01:00:37,725
Then what have you
been living for?

558
01:00:41,317 --> 01:00:42,780
God.

559
01:00:46,727 --> 01:00:48,900
I'm waiting for God.

560
01:00:51,753 --> 01:00:54,623
Even in the hell I lived through,

561
01:00:56,842 --> 01:01:00,554
I waited for Him,
though he never came.

562
01:01:24,565 --> 01:01:26,256
Father...

563
01:01:27,254 --> 01:01:29,808
You still remember Nagasaki.

564
01:01:31,895 --> 01:01:37,200
Even in Auschwitz,
He didn't come to save us.

565
01:01:39,547 --> 01:01:42,963
Has He ever
shown Himself to men

566
01:01:43,035 --> 01:01:47,444
who are begging for help?

567
01:01:47,517 --> 01:01:52,277
Maya will never stop fighting
against you.

568
01:01:53,855 --> 01:01:56,223
Hell has come.

569
01:01:58,466 --> 01:02:00,953
For you betrayed God!

570
01:02:02,369 --> 01:02:03,997
Hell.

571
01:02:09,254 --> 01:02:14,558
Give a ceremony
to offer Maya to God.

572
01:02:23,594 --> 01:02:26,661
What do you want?

573
01:02:26,732 --> 01:02:29,731
I want to apologize to you.

574
01:02:33,550 --> 01:02:38,505
I've been needlessly suffering

575
01:02:39,952 --> 01:02:43,249
for 18 years.

576
01:02:43,315 --> 01:02:46,764
I'll tell you about your father...
to atone for my sin.

577
01:02:46,836 --> 01:02:52,620
But when you learn
the truth,

578
01:02:52,693 --> 01:02:57,714
you'll fall in the hell of hatred.

579
01:02:58,839 --> 01:03:02,190
- Hatred for my father?
- Yes.

580
01:03:02,264 --> 01:03:06,260
Your father
is Father Kakinuma.

581
01:03:12,637 --> 01:03:14,165
The priest?

582
01:03:14,237 --> 01:03:17,815
Is that true?

583
01:03:17,885 --> 01:03:20,157
Yes, it is true.

584
01:03:20,224 --> 01:03:24,568
He also asked me
to dispose of your mother.

585
01:03:25,762 --> 01:03:28,632
That's a lie!

586
01:03:29,634 --> 01:03:31,064
It's true.

587
01:03:33,413 --> 01:03:36,284
Look at the sea.
It hasn't changed.

588
01:03:39,366 --> 01:03:41,058
This is where your mother...

589
01:03:42,055 --> 01:03:44,260
met her lover.

590
01:03:45,256 --> 01:03:47,623
She was desperately in love.

591
01:03:56,654 --> 01:03:58,060
She forgot herself

592
01:03:58,125 --> 01:04:02,186
in the transient gleam of love.

593
01:04:21,622 --> 01:04:25,452
There's no going back for me.

594
01:05:09,448 --> 01:05:14,118
I came to assist the abbess
of St. Clore Abbey.

595
01:05:14,184 --> 01:05:16,771
My name is Nataly Green.

596
01:05:17,770 --> 01:05:22,661
Any act of violation
of the discipline won't be missed.

597
01:05:30,704 --> 01:05:34,316
I can smell the foul odor
of witches,

598
01:05:34,384 --> 01:05:36,720
servants of the devil.

599
01:05:36,786 --> 01:05:41,097
I'll catch the witches.

600
01:05:41,171 --> 01:05:44,434
I'll expose them.

601
01:05:45,812 --> 01:05:48,813
Don't give orders
on your own.

602
01:05:48,887 --> 01:05:50,262
What can you do?

603
01:05:50,327 --> 01:05:53,197
I know this abbey
like the back of my hand.

604
01:05:54,393 --> 01:05:55,855
I'm in charge here.

605
01:05:55,929 --> 01:05:58,832
Father Kakinuma
would disagree.

606
01:05:58,906 --> 01:06:01,078
He sent me here.

607
01:06:04,539 --> 01:06:07,738
Follow my instructions
from now on.

608
01:06:21,379 --> 01:06:22,491
Hisako!

609
01:06:26,499 --> 01:06:28,061
You're pregnant!

610
01:06:36,456 --> 01:06:38,726
Who's your man?

611
01:06:41,129 --> 01:06:43,236
Tell us who.

612
01:07:15,158 --> 01:07:18,193
It's not an immaculate
conception.

613
01:07:18,264 --> 01:07:20,630
Who were you with?

614
01:07:20,695 --> 01:07:22,638
Confess!

615
01:07:22,712 --> 01:07:25,300
Stop it!

616
01:07:25,371 --> 01:07:27,575
Father Kakinuma.

617
01:07:27,643 --> 01:07:30,295
It's his child.

618
01:07:31,580 --> 01:07:33,108
What a horrible thing!

619
01:07:33,181 --> 01:07:34,130
Frightful!

620
01:07:34,206 --> 01:07:35,864
Unbelievable!

621
01:07:39,070 --> 01:07:42,684
You're accusing him
to hide your disgrace.

622
01:07:42,753 --> 01:07:45,306
What do you think, nuns?

623
01:07:45,378 --> 01:07:47,003
Unforgivable!

624
01:07:47,074 --> 01:07:50,751
How can she blame that strict, benevolent
priest?

625
01:07:50,819 --> 01:07:51,835
It's true. It's true!

626
01:07:51,908 --> 01:07:54,943
Liar! Witch!

627
01:07:56,998 --> 01:08:02,018
I'll test your Christian faith.

628
01:08:03,816 --> 01:08:05,791
Get salt water.

629
01:08:10,218 --> 01:08:12,226
Drink all of it.

630
01:08:23,823 --> 01:08:26,246
If you're true to God,

631
01:08:26,321 --> 01:08:30,664
you'll never be able
to stain Jesus.

632
01:08:30,737 --> 01:08:35,181
It's a method used in the Edo Era

633
01:08:35,252 --> 01:08:37,227
to find secret Christians.

634
01:08:37,301 --> 01:08:38,643
That's right.

635
01:08:38,708 --> 01:08:43,218
If she wets the image,
she's a real witch.

636
01:08:49,274 --> 01:08:52,308
How long
will we be confined?

637
01:08:53,403 --> 01:08:56,021
Hisako hasn't returned.

638
01:08:56,091 --> 01:08:58,460
They're still punishing her.

639
01:09:51,728 --> 01:09:54,478
Attend the witch trial

640
01:09:54,544 --> 01:09:57,327
or you'll be considered rebels.

641
01:09:58,323 --> 01:10:02,318
It's the best way
to persecute the witch.

642
01:10:02,389 --> 01:10:05,170
Janet. Onozuka.

643
01:10:05,236 --> 01:10:07,026
Watanabe. Nakagami.

644
01:10:07,093 --> 01:10:09,844
What are you waiting for?
Get moving!

645
01:10:15,640 --> 01:10:17,234
Takigawa.

646
01:10:18,234 --> 01:10:20,275
I will not go.

647
01:10:20,348 --> 01:10:22,258
What?

648
01:10:23,548 --> 01:10:26,037
You admit to being a heretic?

649
01:10:30,782 --> 01:10:33,498
How long can you
have your way?

650
01:10:38,850 --> 01:10:42,047
All right.
Come to the Persecution Room.

651
01:12:46,578 --> 01:12:49,197
This woman is a witch.

652
01:13:07,832 --> 01:13:09,426
Where's the priest?

653
01:13:09,497 --> 01:13:11,090
He's coming.

654
01:13:16,252 --> 01:13:18,969
Will you expel Hisako?

655
01:13:19,964 --> 01:13:22,387
You care about her?

656
01:13:22,462 --> 01:13:24,951
No wonder.

657
01:13:25,952 --> 01:13:29,662
Her fate is the same
as your mother's.

658
01:13:33,826 --> 01:13:37,307
Your father
made Hisako pregnant.

659
01:13:38,307 --> 01:13:41,985
You're the fatal child
with cursed blood...

660
01:13:42,982 --> 01:13:47,009
the doomed offspring
of the priest,

661
01:13:48,006 --> 01:13:50,462
your mother and myself.

662
01:15:13,734 --> 01:15:15,426
Hisako!

663
01:16:05,402 --> 01:16:08,851
The rebel
has exposed herself.

664
01:16:46,441 --> 01:16:50,468
Bless those who hate you.

665
01:16:51,468 --> 01:16:54,884
Bless those who hate you.

666
01:16:55,884 --> 01:17:00,163
Pray for those
who speak ill of you.

667
01:17:02,190 --> 01:17:05,226
If any one strikes you
on the right cheek,

668
01:17:05,296 --> 01:17:08,395
turn to him the other also.

669
01:17:09,394 --> 01:17:14,611
From anyone
who takes away your coat,

670
01:17:14,676 --> 01:17:18,506
do not withhold
even your shirt.

671
01:17:19,508 --> 01:17:22,805
Do unto to others

672
01:17:22,870 --> 01:17:27,216
as you would have them
do unto you.

673
01:17:29,337 --> 01:17:32,273
Do not judge others.

674
01:17:34,587 --> 01:17:38,133
Do not punish them.

675
01:17:39,133 --> 01:17:40,824
Forgive them.

676
01:17:41,822 --> 01:17:43,677
Bless them.

677
01:19:12,191 --> 01:19:15,541
The witch will die tonight.

678
01:19:15,616 --> 01:19:19,840
Thank me for picking
the night of Christmas.

679
01:19:32,807 --> 01:19:35,906
This poison
will take you to hell.

680
01:19:36,905 --> 01:19:39,010
It's your last supper.

681
01:19:40,074 --> 01:19:42,147
When you reach hell,

682
01:19:42,219 --> 01:19:46,148
I'll be in the arms
of Father Kakinuma.

683
01:22:59,955 --> 01:23:01,330
Who are you?

684
01:23:02,484 --> 01:23:05,203
Michiko Shinohara's daughter.

685
01:23:06,837 --> 01:23:08,910
Your daughter.

686
01:23:22,843 --> 01:23:25,430
You don't know me,

687
01:23:25,500 --> 01:23:31,351
but I've been cherishing you
in my heart for 18 years...

688
01:23:32,383 --> 01:23:35,132
not knowing
you were a beast.

689
01:23:36,641 --> 01:23:39,195
You slept with your daughter.

690
01:23:43,492 --> 01:23:48,249
You violated the discipline
in the most dreadful way.

691
01:23:50,212 --> 01:23:53,061
Have a nice Christmas night.

692
01:23:56,295 --> 01:23:58,239
Oh, God!

693
01:24:01,450 --> 01:24:03,556
My God!

694
01:24:09,709 --> 01:24:12,044
God is you!

695
01:24:14,285 --> 01:24:16,174
You're God!

696
01:24:17,999 --> 01:24:20,106
I don't know...

697
01:24:21,330 --> 01:24:24,396
but on this night
18 years ago,

698
01:24:24,466 --> 01:24:28,430
my mother died in agony
in this abbey.

699
01:24:28,501 --> 01:24:32,048
You should suffer
for the rest of your life.

700
01:24:34,901 --> 01:24:38,580
This is my
Christmas present for you.

701
01:24:56,830 --> 01:25:01,468
God! I can see you now.

702
01:25:02,464 --> 01:25:04,701
Your horrible figure...

703
01:25:12,099 --> 01:25:17,154
God! You at last...

704
01:27:13,841 --> 01:27:20,106
The End

705
01:27:29,701 --> 01:27:32,387
