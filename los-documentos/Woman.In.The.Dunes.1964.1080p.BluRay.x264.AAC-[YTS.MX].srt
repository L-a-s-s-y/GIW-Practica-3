00:00:22,524 --> 00:00:26,111
A TOHO FILM

4
00:01:28,256 --> 00:01:33,052
WOMAN IN THE DUNES

5
00:01:33,178 --> 00:01:38,224
WOMAN IN THE DUNES

6
00:05:47,724 --> 00:05:49,892
This is terrible.

7
00:06:16,627 --> 00:06:18,629
<i>Is this an inspection?</i>

8
00:06:20,214 --> 00:06:21,883
Inspection?

9
00:06:24,135 --> 00:06:26,012
Not really.

10
00:06:26,179 --> 00:06:28,431
Were you expecting one?

11
00:06:28,723 --> 00:06:32,351
You can stay as long as
it's not an inspection.

12
00:06:34,896 --> 00:06:37,398
I'm collecting insects.

13
00:06:37,732 --> 00:06:39,067
Huh?

14
00:06:39,233 --> 00:06:41,944
Bugs. I collect bugs.

15
00:06:42,111 --> 00:06:45,448
I specialize
in these sand bugs.

16
00:06:47,158 --> 00:06:50,161
So you're not
from the prefectural office?

17
00:06:50,328 --> 00:06:51,913
Prefectural office?

18
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:55,666
Don't be absurd.
I'm a schoolteacher.

19
00:06:56,667 --> 00:06:59,212
A teacher?

20
00:07:00,421 --> 00:07:02,090
I see.

21
00:08:21,752 --> 00:08:26,174
<i>The certificates we use
to make certain of one another:</i>

22
00:08:26,841 --> 00:08:30,303
<i>contracts, licenses,
ID cards, permits,</i>

23
00:08:30,469 --> 00:08:34,223
<i>deeds, certifications,
registrations, carry permits,</i>

24
00:08:34,974 --> 00:08:38,686
<i>union cards,
testimonials, bills, IOUs,</i>

25
00:08:38,853 --> 00:08:40,938
<i>temporary permits, letters
of consent, income statements,</i>

26
00:08:41,272 --> 00:08:44,192
<i>certificates of custody,
even proof of pedigree.</i>

27
00:08:49,864 --> 00:08:53,451
<i>Is that all of them?</i>

28
00:08:55,328 --> 00:08:58,456
<i>Have I forgotten any?</i>

29
00:09:01,876 --> 00:09:03,961
<i>Men and women</i>

30
00:09:04,962 --> 00:09:09,717
<i>are slaves to their fear
of being cheated.</i>

31
00:09:10,218 --> 00:09:14,305
<i>In turn they dream up new certificates
to prove their innocence.</i>

32
00:09:15,348 --> 00:09:19,060
<i>No one can say
where it will end.</i>

33
00:09:19,602 --> 00:09:22,730
<i>They seem endless.</i>

34
00:09:23,898 --> 00:09:27,068
<i>You criticized me
for arguing too much.</i>

35
00:09:27,235 --> 00:09:29,946
<i>But the facts
speak for themselves.</i>

36
00:09:33,532 --> 00:09:35,284
<i>Teacher man!</i>

37
00:09:37,828 --> 00:09:39,747
What'll you do now?

38
00:09:40,581 --> 00:09:44,252
Do?
I'll  be back tomorrow.

39
00:09:46,545 --> 00:09:49,048
But the last bus has left.

40
00:09:51,717 --> 00:09:53,261
You're right.

41
00:09:54,011 --> 00:09:56,764
There must be
some place to stay.

42
00:09:57,139 --> 00:09:59,058
In this village?

43
00:10:01,852 --> 00:10:05,523
If not here, then maybe
near the highway?

44
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:08,067
You gonna walk?

45
00:10:08,401 --> 00:10:10,611
I'm in no hurry.

46
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:13,739
No need to go so far.

47
00:10:13,864 --> 00:10:17,576
If you want,
I can ask around for you.

48
00:10:18,369 --> 00:10:22,456
You can see it's a poor village,
but if you don't mind -

49
00:10:22,832 --> 00:10:24,500
You'd do that?

50
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:27,628
I'm very grateful.

51
00:10:28,045 --> 00:10:30,506
I won't be rushed
in the morning,

52
00:10:30,631 --> 00:10:33,509
and I'd love to stay
in a real home.

53
00:10:33,676 --> 00:10:34,760
Thank you.

54
00:11:15,509 --> 00:11:19,221
Careful. There are deep pits
on both sides.

55
00:11:34,111 --> 00:11:36,280
Hey, you old hag!

56
00:11:36,864 --> 00:11:39,075
Whatchya doin'?
You've got a guest!

57
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:43,788
<i>The ladder's beside the bales.</i>

58
00:11:45,373 --> 00:11:46,999
You sure it's okay?

59
00:11:47,166 --> 00:11:49,710
Don't worry.
It's very informal here.

60
00:11:50,211 --> 00:11:51,879
In that case...

61
00:11:55,299 --> 00:11:57,218
A rope ladder?

62
00:11:58,344 --> 00:12:02,264
That's what we use
out here in the boonies.

63
00:12:04,266 --> 00:12:06,560
This is quite an adventure.

64
00:12:06,811 --> 00:12:09,438
Don't lean away from the rope.

65
00:12:09,563 --> 00:12:11,649
Hold on tight.

66
00:12:11,941 --> 00:12:14,944
Don't look up.
You'll get sand in your face.

67
00:13:06,787 --> 00:13:08,956
<i>This way, please.</i>

68
00:13:27,808 --> 00:13:29,310
Please.

69
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:31,562
Thanks for your hospitality.

70
00:13:54,543 --> 00:13:56,837
Dinner will be ready soon.

71
00:13:57,171 --> 00:13:58,672
Great.

72
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:02,384
Could I take a bath first?

73
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:04,595
Yes, but -

74
00:14:05,262 --> 00:14:06,972
Never mind then.

75
00:14:07,139 --> 00:14:09,683
Please wait
until the day after tomorrow.

76
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:11,936
The day after tomorrow?

77
00:14:12,228 --> 00:14:14,021
I'm afraid not.

78
00:14:14,188 --> 00:14:16,398
I only have three days off.

79
00:14:16,565 --> 00:14:18,108
I beg your pardon.

80
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:08,534
You only have one lamp?

81
00:15:08,659 --> 00:15:11,579
It's all right.
<i>I'll</i> be finished soon.

82
00:15:12,454 --> 00:15:15,082
It's a pain
not having electricity, huh?

83
00:15:26,927 --> 00:15:28,095
Help yourself.

84
00:15:28,262 --> 00:15:29,930
Thanks.

85
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:36,186
Clams and bream -
looks good.

86
00:15:36,437 --> 00:15:39,607
Nothing beats
local delicacies.

87
00:15:43,152 --> 00:15:46,697
What's that for?
- The sand seeps in.

88
00:15:47,031 --> 00:15:48,991
Why?

89
00:15:51,619 --> 00:15:53,454
Is the roof damaged?

90
00:15:53,621 --> 00:15:57,833
No, it's the same
with newly thatched roofs.

91
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,377
How can that be?

92
00:16:00,836 --> 00:16:04,298
Bugs, even worse
than woodborers.

93
00:16:06,258 --> 00:16:08,093
Woodborers?

94
00:16:08,844 --> 00:16:12,765
Yes. They make holes
in the wood.

95
00:16:14,433 --> 00:16:16,602
You must mean termites.

96
00:16:16,769 --> 00:16:20,689
No. They're this big,
with hard shells.

97
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:24,818
Could it be a saw beetle?

98
00:16:24,985 --> 00:16:26,695
Saw beetle?

99
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:36,622
The reddish one
with long antennae.

100
00:16:36,747 --> 00:16:41,752
No, these are bronze-colored,
like a grain of rice.

101
00:16:42,711 --> 00:16:45,881
Then I guess
it must be a woodborer.

102
00:16:48,217 --> 00:16:50,302
If you're not careful,

103
00:16:50,427 --> 00:16:54,473
even a beam this big
will get spongy and rot.

104
00:16:55,724 --> 00:16:57,393
From the woodborers?

105
00:16:57,559 --> 00:17:00,104
No, the sand.

106
00:17:03,273 --> 00:17:05,192
How so?

107
00:17:05,526 --> 00:17:08,195
I guess it draws moisture.

108
00:17:09,697 --> 00:17:11,448
Nonsense.

109
00:17:12,157 --> 00:17:15,202
Sand is naturally dry.

110
00:17:15,369 --> 00:17:18,330
But it really makes things rot.

111
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:23,544
You must be kidding!
Use your common sense.

112
00:17:28,549 --> 00:17:33,220
A desert is dry
because it's all sand.

113
00:17:35,389 --> 00:17:39,518
Have you ever heard
of a damp desert?

114
00:17:39,685 --> 00:17:42,062
Sorry, but could I have
some tea?

115
00:18:06,754 --> 00:18:09,423
But it does rot.

116
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:19,266
They say
if you leave sand on clogs,

117
00:18:19,391 --> 00:18:21,810
they'll rot in two weeks.

118
00:18:29,276 --> 00:18:31,945
That's ridiculous.

119
00:18:32,571 --> 00:18:36,116
The wood rots,
and so does the sand.

120
00:18:36,742 --> 00:18:40,579
We found soil in the ceiling
of a buried house

121
00:18:40,746 --> 00:18:43,540
rich enough
to grow cucumbers in.

122
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:48,962
Okay, whatever you say.

123
00:19:04,019 --> 00:19:06,355
- More?
- No, thanks.

124
00:19:10,317 --> 00:19:12,361
Thank you.
That was delicious.

125
00:19:22,955 --> 00:19:25,207
This is terrible!

126
00:19:27,167 --> 00:19:29,211
When it's windy...

127
00:19:30,295 --> 00:19:34,341
two feet of sand
can pile up in one night.

128
00:20:08,792 --> 00:20:12,170
See?
Even the futon is damp.

129
00:20:13,463 --> 00:20:15,841
Where is everyone?

130
00:20:17,634 --> 00:20:19,428
Your family.

131
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:22,389
I live alone.

132
00:20:30,147 --> 00:20:35,444
Last year a storm swallowed up
my husband and daughter.

133
00:20:36,278 --> 00:20:38,071
Swallowed up?

134
00:20:38,655 --> 00:20:44,411
The sand roared down
like a waterfall.

135
00:20:45,871 --> 00:20:49,583
He went out
to save the chicken coop.

136
00:20:51,084 --> 00:20:52,961
And got buried?

137
00:20:54,922 --> 00:20:57,132
It was a horrible gale.

138
00:21:01,803 --> 00:21:03,764
That's awful.

139
00:21:04,932 --> 00:21:07,267
That's really awful.

140
00:21:17,194 --> 00:21:19,112
It's the sand.

141
00:21:35,545 --> 00:21:38,131
Are you here for research?

142
00:21:38,298 --> 00:21:39,841
Yes.

143
00:21:40,425 --> 00:21:42,177
That reminds me:

144
00:21:42,344 --> 00:21:45,639
Are there any insects
like this around here?

145
00:21:47,265 --> 00:21:49,768
It's called a tiger beetle.

146
00:21:51,436 --> 00:21:53,105
Here it is.

147
00:21:55,899 --> 00:21:59,277
I want to find others
like that one.

148
00:21:59,569 --> 00:22:02,447
This species has many variants.

149
00:22:02,614 --> 00:22:07,160
If I find a new variant,
I'll get my name in a field guide.

150
00:22:08,078 --> 00:22:12,499
All I'm good for is
catching bugs by the tail.

151
00:22:17,879 --> 00:22:22,134
<i>Hey, we brought
the helper's tools!</i>

152
00:22:26,346 --> 00:22:29,641
So there's someone else
here with you after all.

153
00:22:29,766 --> 00:22:31,852
That's a good one.

154
00:22:32,019 --> 00:22:35,856
But he just said something
about a helper.

155
00:22:36,356 --> 00:22:38,316
He meant you.

156
00:22:38,483 --> 00:22:40,360
Me? Why?

157
00:22:40,485 --> 00:22:42,904
Don't worry about it.

158
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:45,532
There must be
some misunderstanding.

159
00:22:46,366 --> 00:22:49,411
Do you still need the lamp?

160
00:22:49,536 --> 00:22:51,955
Yes, if you don't mind.

161
00:22:53,248 --> 00:22:56,585
That's all right.
I'm used to the work.

162
00:23:13,727 --> 00:23:15,937
Man, this is foul.

163
00:25:29,029 --> 00:25:30,822
No, don't.

164
00:25:58,975 --> 00:26:03,188
- Want help?
- No, not on the first day.

165
00:26:03,355 --> 00:26:06,566
The first day?
That again?

166
00:26:06,733 --> 00:26:09,069
I'm only staying the night.

167
00:26:12,906 --> 00:26:15,158
You always shovel at night?

168
00:26:15,325 --> 00:26:18,078
Yes, the sand's moist.

169
00:26:18,245 --> 00:26:20,330
Makes it easier.

170
00:26:25,961 --> 00:26:27,754
<i>Basket's ready!</i>

171
00:26:27,921 --> 00:26:29,381
Thanks!

172
00:26:29,506 --> 00:26:31,132
Here it comes.

173
00:26:48,608 --> 00:26:50,402
Let me help.

174
00:27:02,956 --> 00:27:04,541
Clear!

175
00:27:38,366 --> 00:27:39,951
Clear!

176
00:27:49,002 --> 00:27:51,629
Can't be easy for them either.

177
00:27:52,172 --> 00:27:56,843
This village has real local spirit.

178
00:27:57,135 --> 00:27:59,095
What kind of spirit?

179
00:28:00,513 --> 00:28:02,724
Love of our birthplace.

180
00:28:04,934 --> 00:28:07,937
I see.
A good thing, indeed!

181
00:28:14,486 --> 00:28:17,697
- Just how long do you work?
- Until morning.

182
00:28:17,864 --> 00:28:19,449
Morning?

183
00:28:20,492 --> 00:28:23,536
The sand won't wait.

184
00:28:24,204 --> 00:28:25,747
Clear!

185
00:28:56,027 --> 00:28:58,154
What a wreck!

186
00:31:21,881 --> 00:31:23,383
Ouch!

187
00:33:25,672 --> 00:33:29,133
That's strange.
The ladder's gone.

188
00:34:57,722 --> 00:34:59,307
Ma'am.

189
00:35:01,559 --> 00:35:03,895
Could you wake up, please?

190
00:35:17,116 --> 00:35:20,745
Sorry, but could you
get the ladder?

191
00:35:20,912 --> 00:35:22,955
It's not there.

192
00:35:30,087 --> 00:35:32,632
I'd like to be on my way.

193
00:35:33,007 --> 00:35:36,803
I only have three days off.
I can't dawdle.

194
00:35:39,806 --> 00:35:41,432
Wait a minute.

195
00:35:43,184 --> 00:35:46,270
That was a rope ladder!

196
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:50,316
It can only be lowered
from above.

197
00:35:56,155 --> 00:35:58,491
Shit! It was a trap!

198
00:36:30,189 --> 00:36:32,024
I'm sorry.

199
00:36:32,817 --> 00:36:35,862
Sorry?
What do you mean?

200
00:36:41,075 --> 00:36:43,202
I asked what you meant.

201
00:36:43,911 --> 00:36:45,621
I'm sorry.

202
00:36:46,205 --> 00:36:48,374
That's not enough!

203
00:36:48,666 --> 00:36:52,211
I've got a job.
I can't waste time.

204
00:36:53,796 --> 00:36:56,841
But you do understand,
don't you?

205
00:36:57,049 --> 00:36:58,634
Understand?

206
00:36:58,759 --> 00:37:00,803
What's there to understand?

207
00:37:04,015 --> 00:37:05,933
But you know...

208
00:37:07,018 --> 00:37:10,313
this life's really too hard
for a woman alone.

209
00:37:10,438 --> 00:37:12,899
What's that got
to do with me?

210
00:37:16,736 --> 00:37:22,325
The north winds will come soon.
There may be sandstorms too.

211
00:37:24,619 --> 00:37:26,871
You're holding me captive?

212
00:37:26,996 --> 00:37:28,497
I'm terribly sorry.

213
00:37:29,749 --> 00:37:33,544
Is this a joke?
I'm not some homeless bum.

214
00:37:33,711 --> 00:37:37,548
I'm a respected teacher.
I'm registered with the city.

215
00:37:38,591 --> 00:37:41,594
You'll be in trouble
when I'm reported missing.

216
00:37:41,761 --> 00:37:43,930
Illegal confinement
is a serious offense.

217
00:38:00,029 --> 00:38:02,281
If I fall behind,

218
00:38:02,698 --> 00:38:05,284
my house will be buried.

219
00:38:06,285 --> 00:38:08,245
Fine! Let it be!

220
00:38:08,621 --> 00:38:11,123
You can't drag me into this!

221
00:38:16,045 --> 00:38:19,382
Then the house next door
would be next.

222
00:38:19,799 --> 00:38:22,969
They can all get buried,
for all I care!

223
00:38:23,135 --> 00:38:25,137
And what about you?

224
00:38:27,056 --> 00:38:32,228
Why do you cling
to this place?

225
00:38:32,561 --> 00:38:34,647
You must be mad!

226
00:38:42,363 --> 00:38:43,572
Look.

227
00:38:43,864 --> 00:38:48,786
You don't owe
those villagers a damn thing.

228
00:38:49,286 --> 00:38:52,206
I can't share
your sense of self-sacrifice.

229
00:38:52,415 --> 00:38:55,626
Let them deal
with the sand scientifically,

230
00:38:55,751 --> 00:38:58,087
with tree fences or something.

231
00:38:58,254 --> 00:39:02,967
They calculated
that it's much cheaper this way.

232
00:39:04,593 --> 00:39:06,929
Fine! Whatever you say!

233
00:39:07,054 --> 00:39:09,223
Just call the man in charge!

234
00:39:09,390 --> 00:39:12,476
I'll tell him
how stupid all this is!

235
00:39:15,229 --> 00:39:17,356
What are you waiting for?

236
00:39:17,857 --> 00:39:21,277
There must be
some way to call them.

237
00:39:22,194 --> 00:39:25,197
Bang on the oil can
or something!

238
00:39:30,244 --> 00:39:32,163
Why don't you say anything?

239
00:40:20,961 --> 00:40:24,090
It's not impossible.

240
00:40:24,465 --> 00:40:27,593
I'm going with
the natural slope of the sand.

241
00:41:18,561 --> 00:41:20,312
Son of a bitch!

242
00:42:43,395 --> 00:42:47,608
<i>What's that sound</i>

243
00:42:48,734 --> 00:42:52,947
<i>A little bell</i>

244
00:42:53,614 --> 00:42:57,618
<i>Splish, splash</i>

245
00:42:58,410 --> 00:43:02,665
<i>What's that sound</i>

246
00:43:03,332 --> 00:43:07,169
<i>A demon's voice</i>

247
00:43:13,467 --> 00:43:17,930
<i>Splish, splash</i>

248
00:43:18,931 --> 00:43:23,310
<i>What's that sound</i>

249
00:43:29,566 --> 00:43:32,069
Mister, are you awake?

250
00:43:56,969 --> 00:43:59,138
How do you feel?

251
00:44:00,889 --> 00:44:02,558
Could be worse.

252
00:44:02,808 --> 00:44:05,144
Let me wipe your back.

253
00:44:35,632 --> 00:44:37,551
Stop that! It hurts!

254
00:44:37,718 --> 00:44:38,886
It hurts?

255
00:44:39,011 --> 00:44:40,679
Yes.

256
00:44:48,103 --> 00:44:49,813
Shall I massage you?

257
00:44:49,938 --> 00:44:53,025
Are you serious?
I may have broken something.

258
00:44:53,192 --> 00:44:56,320
If you're so concerned,
call a doctor.

259
00:45:05,204 --> 00:45:07,247
Isn't my underwear dry yet?

260
00:45:07,373 --> 00:45:10,084
You shouldn't wear
anything in bed.

261
00:45:10,250 --> 00:45:11,502
Why not?

262
00:45:12,628 --> 00:45:14,713
You'll get rashes from the sand.

263
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:16,673
Rashes?

264
00:45:17,424 --> 00:45:20,135
The sand draws moisture.

265
00:45:42,241 --> 00:45:45,160
Keep quiet!
Don't resist!

266
00:46:20,904 --> 00:46:23,657
You'll have
to endure it a while.

267
00:46:23,907 --> 00:46:26,577
Now we can both say
we've been deceived.

268
00:46:26,743 --> 00:46:28,954
You reap what you sow.

269
00:46:31,540 --> 00:46:34,376
Men aren't dogs.

270
00:46:35,294 --> 00:46:38,714
You can't put them on a leash.

271
00:47:31,475 --> 00:47:34,019
Hey, What's going on?

272
00:47:34,561 --> 00:47:36,897
Hurry up down there!

273
00:47:37,022 --> 00:47:39,024
We're waiting!

274
00:47:41,693 --> 00:47:45,030
Pull me up!
I'm not letting go!

275
00:47:45,155 --> 00:47:47,157
She's tied up inside!

276
00:47:47,282 --> 00:47:50,118
If you want to help her,
pull me up!

277
00:48:58,145 --> 00:48:59,521
No.

278
00:49:00,939 --> 00:49:03,025
They haven't won yet.

279
00:49:03,483 --> 00:49:05,902
The battle's just begun.

280
00:49:06,820 --> 00:49:09,740
They're going to be
in big trouble.

281
00:49:55,869 --> 00:49:58,330
There's nothing to fear.

282
00:49:59,247 --> 00:50:02,250
I've got the upper hand.

283
00:50:03,627 --> 00:50:06,463
This is actually
a good experience.

284
00:50:06,672 --> 00:50:10,842
Maybe I'll write about it
when I get back.

285
00:51:22,748 --> 00:51:25,167
It's <i>shochu.</i>

286
00:51:27,502 --> 00:51:29,796
How thoughtful...

287
00:51:29,921 --> 00:51:32,966
giving me booze
to celebrate in advance.

288
00:51:40,932 --> 00:51:42,934
A coup d'etat, huh?

289
00:51:44,394 --> 00:51:46,772
People can't sit still
for a minute.

290
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:52,277
Want a cigarette?

291
00:51:52,444 --> 00:51:54,029
No.

292
00:51:54,237 --> 00:51:57,115
Smoking dries my throat.

293
00:51:57,449 --> 00:52:00,535
- Water, then?
- I'm fine for now.

294
00:52:01,912 --> 00:52:03,914
Feel free to ask.

295
00:52:04,998 --> 00:52:08,919
I have nothing personal
against you.

296
00:52:10,504 --> 00:52:12,297
Does it hurt?

297
00:52:14,633 --> 00:52:16,718
We must be careful.

298
00:52:16,843 --> 00:52:20,388
Rations only come
once a week.

299
00:52:21,973 --> 00:52:23,475
Rations?

300
00:52:23,642 --> 00:52:25,143
Yes.

301
00:52:25,644 --> 00:52:28,146
Only to households
with a man.

302
00:52:28,313 --> 00:52:31,233
The village council
pays for them.

303
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:43,495
Tell me something.

304
00:52:44,579 --> 00:52:47,749
Has this happened
to men before me?

305
00:52:48,834 --> 00:52:52,128
We're so short of people.

306
00:52:53,004 --> 00:52:55,173
Who else was abducted?

307
00:52:55,507 --> 00:52:57,175
Let's see.

308
00:52:57,467 --> 00:53:01,721
Last fall,
a postcard salesman.

309
00:53:01,888 --> 00:53:03,306
A postcard salesman?

310
00:53:03,473 --> 00:53:07,686
He worked for a company
that made travel postcards.

311
00:53:08,812 --> 00:53:10,522
Any others?

312
00:53:10,772 --> 00:53:13,900
This year...

313
00:53:15,485 --> 00:53:19,531
there was a student
carrying out a survey.

314
00:53:21,658 --> 00:53:25,453
Three houses over.
He's still there.

315
00:53:28,290 --> 00:53:31,334
They pulled up the ladder
on him too, huh?

316
00:53:34,713 --> 00:53:39,050
Young people don't want
to stay in the village.

317
00:53:44,347 --> 00:53:48,059
The pay's better in the cities.

318
00:53:48,977 --> 00:53:54,399
Movie theaters and restaurants
are open year-round, right?

319
00:53:54,524 --> 00:53:56,693
This is lunacy!

320
00:54:01,406 --> 00:54:03,783
What is it?
Does it hurt?

321
00:54:04,367 --> 00:54:09,456
Would you please scratch
behind my right ear?

322
00:54:21,384 --> 00:54:23,219
Like this?

323
00:55:04,260 --> 00:55:06,137
I'm sorry,

324
00:55:06,513 --> 00:55:08,640
but could I have some water?

325
00:55:12,477 --> 00:55:14,604
Water, please!

326
00:55:15,021 --> 00:55:16,815
I'm begging you!

327
00:55:34,541 --> 00:55:37,460
This is all that's left.
When's the next ration?

328
00:55:40,588 --> 00:55:42,173
That's enough!

329
00:55:42,507 --> 00:55:44,300
Not so much!

330
00:55:55,603 --> 00:55:58,481
Shut up!
This is your own doing!

331
00:56:09,367 --> 00:56:11,286
Shall I untie you?

332
00:56:13,913 --> 00:56:17,876
But get this straight:
It's not out of sympathy.

333
00:56:18,251 --> 00:56:21,880
I've just had enough
of your pitiful face.

334
00:56:22,047 --> 00:56:24,466
There's one condition:

335
00:56:24,632 --> 00:56:26,926
no shoveling unless I say so.

336
00:56:27,218 --> 00:56:29,554
You promise me that?

337
00:56:30,055 --> 00:56:32,557
Yes, I promise!

338
00:56:32,849 --> 00:56:35,226
I'll promise anything!

339
00:56:54,079 --> 00:56:56,790
If I suffer, you suffer.

340
00:56:57,749 --> 00:57:00,710
Give that some serious thought.

341
00:57:09,302 --> 00:57:11,221
Where are you going?

342
00:59:17,347 --> 00:59:19,015
Run for it!

343
00:59:39,744 --> 00:59:42,163
Can't we do something?

344
00:59:43,414 --> 00:59:49,712
It's because we haven't
shoveled any sand for two nights.

345
00:59:49,963 --> 00:59:53,174
Water!
I'm talking about water!

346
00:59:53,925 --> 00:59:55,551
Aren't you thirsty?

347
00:59:55,802 --> 01:00:00,098
I was nice enough to untie you.
You could cooperate a little.

348
01:00:00,598 --> 01:00:02,433
Well, you see...

349
01:00:03,268 --> 01:00:06,437
if we just started
working again -

350
01:00:06,604 --> 01:00:08,106
Give me a break!

351
01:00:08,439 --> 01:00:12,318
Who's got the right to force me
into such a rotten deal?

352
01:00:16,614 --> 01:00:20,868
You have to use
the right man for the right job.

353
01:00:23,955 --> 01:00:26,165
I'm a teacher,

354
01:00:26,416 --> 01:00:28,918
and something of a scholar.

355
01:00:29,294 --> 01:00:33,548
They could at least
put my abilities to better use.

356
01:00:36,426 --> 01:00:39,304
We could, for example...

357
01:00:40,346 --> 01:00:44,642
think of some way to exploit
the lure of the dunes.

358
01:00:46,060 --> 01:00:50,481
My fascination with the sand
is what brought me here, after all.

359
01:00:52,317 --> 01:00:54,235
I'm serious.

360
01:00:55,695 --> 01:00:57,822
That postcard salesman

361
01:00:57,989 --> 01:01:01,743
probably came
for the same reason.

362
01:01:02,910 --> 01:01:07,790
Advertise the area.
Develop it into a tourist resort.

363
01:01:09,500 --> 01:01:12,879
Make the sand work for you,
not against you.

364
01:01:14,005 --> 01:01:17,759
But a resort needs

365
01:01:18,509 --> 01:01:21,054
a hot spring.

366
01:01:22,305 --> 01:01:27,018
Well, that was just one idea.

367
01:01:30,897 --> 01:01:34,359
Maybe there are special crops

368
01:01:34,525 --> 01:01:37,236
that grow in the sand.

369
01:01:37,362 --> 01:01:41,991
Yes, the Youth League
grows a few things,

370
01:01:42,700 --> 01:01:46,037
like peanuts and tulips.

371
01:01:47,163 --> 01:01:49,290
They said
the tulip bulbs were so big

372
01:01:49,624 --> 01:01:55,380
that they showed them
at an agricultural fair in Tokyo.

373
01:01:55,671 --> 01:01:57,131
If you saw them -

374
01:01:57,298 --> 01:01:58,758
That's enough!

375
01:02:02,637 --> 01:02:06,849
Even a monkey could be
trained to do this work.

376
01:02:07,975 --> 01:02:10,728
A monkey?

377
01:02:42,343 --> 01:02:44,387
It'll make you sick.

378
01:02:59,944 --> 01:03:02,363
My breath feels like it's on fire.

379
01:03:24,177 --> 01:03:26,137
This is futile.

380
01:03:28,598 --> 01:03:30,641
If it wanted to...

381
01:03:34,020 --> 01:03:38,149
the sand could swallow up cities,
even entire countries.

382
01:03:43,779 --> 01:03:45,823
Did you know that?

383
01:03:46,157 --> 01:03:48,618
A Roman town called Sabrata...

384
01:03:49,243 --> 01:03:52,246
and that one> in
<i>The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam...</i>

385
01:03:53,414 --> 01:03:56,459
both completely buried
under particles

386
01:03:57,043 --> 01:03:59,837
an eighth of a millimeter wide.

387
01:04:02,757 --> 01:04:05,009
You can't fight it!

388
01:04:05,927 --> 01:04:07,803
It's hopeless!

389
01:04:15,811 --> 01:04:17,730
What are you doing?

390
01:04:20,441 --> 01:04:21,943
No!

391
01:04:22,860 --> 01:04:25,154
I'm gonna make a ladder!

392
01:04:25,780 --> 01:04:28,199
You can't do that!

393
01:06:14,221 --> 01:06:17,224
Shall I... brush off the sand?

394
01:06:19,644 --> 01:06:21,312
But...

395
01:06:21,729 --> 01:06:24,732
aren't all the city girls

396
01:06:25,149 --> 01:06:27,318
prettier than me?

397
01:06:27,943 --> 01:06:29,654
Nonsense!

398
01:06:33,366 --> 01:06:34,992
Give me the cloth.

399
01:12:10,160 --> 01:12:11,996
Damn it!

400
01:12:15,624 --> 01:12:17,626
My blood's gonna rot!

401
01:13:43,754 --> 01:13:46,298
What a dirty move!

402
01:13:55,432 --> 01:13:57,434
What should I do?

403
01:13:57,935 --> 01:13:59,895
Do something!

404
01:14:00,312 --> 01:14:02,731
My blood's gonna rot!

405
01:14:02,940 --> 01:14:04,525
You see...

406
01:14:04,858 --> 01:14:09,113
if we just started
working again -

407
01:14:09,363 --> 01:14:10,948
Fine!

408
01:14:11,240 --> 01:14:12,908
I give in!

409
01:14:13,450 --> 01:14:16,245
You win!

410
01:16:09,399 --> 01:16:12,236
What's the matter, mister?

411
01:16:12,402 --> 01:16:15,072
The water's come!

412
01:16:39,596 --> 01:16:41,390
It's my turn.

413
01:17:22,556 --> 01:17:26,768
Hold your left hand lower.

414
01:17:27,019 --> 01:17:31,148
Try using your right hand.
You won't get as tired.

415
01:17:33,483 --> 01:17:35,485
I haven't slept much.

416
01:17:46,204 --> 01:17:50,167
Rest if you want.
It takes getting used to.

417
01:17:50,625 --> 01:17:54,379
This must be how
it would feel if my muscles...

418
01:17:55,130 --> 01:17:57,257
were made of cement.

419
01:17:57,382 --> 01:18:00,260
You'll tire easily
until you're used to it.

420
01:18:00,385 --> 01:18:04,806
I wonder
if I'll ever get used to it.

421
01:18:05,599 --> 01:18:07,517
You will.

422
01:18:09,478 --> 01:18:11,480
I don't get it.

423
01:18:12,522 --> 01:18:16,526
Doesn't all this seem
pointless to you?

424
01:18:16,777 --> 01:18:21,698
Are you shoveling sand to live,
or living to shovel sand?

425
01:18:22,491 --> 01:18:27,037
I know it's not
as fun as Tokyo.

426
01:18:27,162 --> 01:18:30,332
I'm not talking about Tokyo!

427
01:18:35,796 --> 01:18:40,634
How can you stand
being trapped like this?

428
01:18:41,635 --> 01:18:44,388
This is my home.

429
01:18:48,433 --> 01:18:51,520
Then demand your rights.

430
01:18:56,733 --> 01:19:01,363
Me, I'm just biding my time
until I'm rescued.

431
01:19:01,696 --> 01:19:03,407
Rescued?

432
01:19:04,741 --> 01:19:06,493
Of course.

433
01:19:06,618 --> 01:19:10,705
If I miss a week of work,
they'll come looking for me.

434
01:19:11,164 --> 01:19:16,503
They'll see the book
left open in my room

435
01:19:16,711 --> 01:19:20,090
and find the loose change
in my coat pocket.

436
01:19:24,594 --> 01:19:27,681
They're bound to be suspicious.

437
01:19:27,931 --> 01:19:31,351
But you'll live like this forever
if you don't speak up.

438
01:19:32,269 --> 01:19:36,565
But they're buried here.

439
01:19:37,107 --> 01:19:38,733
They?

440
01:19:38,984 --> 01:19:43,155
My husband and daughter.

441
01:19:43,989 --> 01:19:45,824
So you mean...

442
01:19:46,575 --> 01:19:49,244
you'd leave
if they were dug up?

443
01:19:49,369 --> 01:19:51,288
I'll help you do it!

444
01:19:51,455 --> 01:19:56,084
You know how to make them
lower the ladder.

445
01:19:56,334 --> 01:20:00,130
There's nothing for me to do
on the outside.

446
01:20:00,422 --> 01:20:02,757
You could walk around.

447
01:20:03,008 --> 01:20:04,593
Walk around?

448
01:20:04,843 --> 01:20:09,097
Yes! It's great
to walk around freely!

449
01:20:10,891 --> 01:20:15,020
Isn't it exhausting,
just walking around aimlessly?

450
01:20:15,645 --> 01:20:17,314
This isn't funny!

451
01:20:17,481 --> 01:20:20,650
Even dogs go crazy
chained up all day!

452
01:20:21,276 --> 01:20:23,320
And we're human beings!

453
01:20:31,369 --> 01:20:35,540
But you see,
if it weren't for the sand,

454
01:20:35,749 --> 01:20:39,085
no one would bother
about me.

455
01:20:41,338 --> 01:20:42,839
Isn't that right?

456
01:20:43,131 --> 01:20:45,258
Not even you.

457
01:21:52,450 --> 01:21:54,327
Look, here's one.

458
01:21:54,744 --> 01:21:56,955
Don't do that!

459
01:21:57,372 --> 01:22:00,917
This is what brought me here
in the first place.

460
01:22:02,002 --> 01:22:04,963
It's the tiger beetle
I was telling you about.

461
01:22:14,431 --> 01:22:16,099
Got any scissors?

462
01:22:16,224 --> 01:22:17,726
Scissors?

463
01:22:17,976 --> 01:22:21,021
I just want to trim
my whiskers.

464
01:22:22,731 --> 01:22:25,317
I should have some.

465
01:22:41,958 --> 01:22:43,960
They may not be very sharp.

466
01:22:44,085 --> 01:22:46,630
They sure are rusty.

467
01:22:47,213 --> 01:22:49,966
It's because of the sand.

468
01:23:37,597 --> 01:23:40,183
- These are no good.
- No?

469
01:23:40,350 --> 01:23:42,435
Not even close.

470
01:23:46,815 --> 01:23:50,360
Let's ask for a razor
when they bring the rations.

471
01:23:52,529 --> 01:23:56,533
See? The sand makes
my whiskers all scratchy.

472
01:23:58,993 --> 01:24:03,498
That sand just ruins
everything, doesn't it?

473
01:24:18,722 --> 01:24:21,599
<i>Hey, hurry up!</i>

474
01:24:21,933 --> 01:24:23,852
<i>All right! Thanks!</i>

475
01:24:25,478 --> 01:24:27,564
<i>Where's your husband?</i>

476
01:24:27,856 --> 01:24:30,233
<i>Stomachache.
He caught a chill.</i>

477
01:24:30,525 --> 01:24:33,278
<i>Or maybe you gave him
too much lovin'!</i>

478
01:24:39,868 --> 01:24:41,953
<i>Clear!</i>

479
01:26:05,662 --> 01:26:08,164
Need help with the bath?

480
01:26:08,414 --> 01:26:12,126
No bath tonight.
I'm dead tired.

481
01:26:14,671 --> 01:26:16,881
But I'd really like one.

482
01:26:17,173 --> 01:26:19,259
No, you're sick.

483
01:26:20,593 --> 01:26:23,054
I'm sticky with sweat.

484
01:26:24,389 --> 01:26:27,851
Night sweats.
I was too sick to sleep.

485
01:26:28,935 --> 01:26:31,187
I guess I could heat it up.

486
01:26:31,396 --> 01:26:35,400
- Please. I'll help.
- That's okay. I'll do it.

487
01:27:10,727 --> 01:27:13,104
What are you thinking?

488
01:27:13,396 --> 01:27:15,106
Nothing.

489
01:27:17,734 --> 01:27:20,820
I'll take your picture.
Stand there.

490
01:27:20,987 --> 01:27:22,572
I'd rather not.

491
01:27:22,697 --> 01:27:24,240
Come on.

492
01:27:26,409 --> 01:27:28,244
Smile.

493
01:27:43,760 --> 01:27:45,845
You want to go home,
don't you?

494
01:27:45,970 --> 01:27:47,680
Why do you ask?

495
01:27:49,390 --> 01:27:52,936
A radio might take
your mind off things.

496
01:27:56,272 --> 01:27:59,275
You could hear
about the world.

497
01:27:59,442 --> 01:28:01,110
Why bother?

498
01:28:01,778 --> 01:28:06,324
You'd know
what's happening in Tokyo.

499
01:28:06,783 --> 01:28:11,454
I began collecting insects
to get away from all that.

500
01:28:12,872 --> 01:28:15,959
Compared to that
unfathomable way of life,

501
01:28:16,084 --> 01:28:19,796
getting my name in a book
is at least something tangible.

502
01:28:20,880 --> 01:28:24,801
But a radio would be

503
01:28:25,301 --> 01:28:27,136
a nice diversion.

504
01:28:31,307 --> 01:28:33,184
Very well.

505
01:28:33,810 --> 01:28:36,562
Shall we finish off
that <i>shochu?</i>

506
01:28:37,230 --> 01:28:40,817
- You're still sick.
- It helps you sleep.

507
01:28:40,984 --> 01:28:44,821
I'm sleepy enough
without it.

508
01:28:45,989 --> 01:28:48,074
Come on, have some.

509
01:28:55,498 --> 01:28:58,001
I really can't.

510
01:29:04,882 --> 01:29:07,593
Come on.
I feel like celebrating today.

511
01:29:08,678 --> 01:29:11,973
- The water's boiling.
- Come on.

512
01:29:12,598 --> 01:29:14,851
What's gotten into you?

513
01:29:18,229 --> 01:29:20,356
Go ahead, drink up.

514
01:30:57,954 --> 01:31:00,873
It feels good
to finally have a bath.

515
01:31:03,626 --> 01:31:05,586
You're terrible...

516
01:31:05,711 --> 01:31:08,965
making me work like this
when I'm so tired.

517
01:42:24,807 --> 01:42:27,142
Help!

518
01:42:28,143 --> 01:42:31,730
Someone help me!

519
01:42:39,613 --> 01:42:42,241
Help!

520
01:42:49,832 --> 01:42:52,501
<i>Here, grab on to this.</i>

521
01:42:57,756 --> 01:43:01,760
Please pull me out
with this rope.

522
01:43:02,010 --> 01:43:06,056
You fool. We can't pull you out
like some kind of root.

523
01:43:07,391 --> 01:43:09,393
We'll dig you out.

524
01:43:09,518 --> 01:43:11,854
Grab on to the board.

525
01:43:14,481 --> 01:43:17,526
Good thing
we came by in time.

526
01:43:17,818 --> 01:43:20,779
There's a lot of quicksand
around here.

527
01:43:21,029 --> 01:43:23,907
Even the dogs stay away.

528
01:43:24,575 --> 01:43:28,245
How many people
have fallen in before?

529
01:43:28,537 --> 01:43:33,125
Hikers and others
don't know it's here.

530
01:43:33,375 --> 01:43:37,880
If we dug, we might find
something valuable.

531
01:43:38,714 --> 01:43:42,467
Two or three cameras for sure.

532
01:44:53,372 --> 01:44:55,165
Be quiet.

533
01:44:56,166 --> 01:44:58,085
I'm sorry.

534
01:45:06,176 --> 01:45:08,345
Shall I make some tea?

535
01:45:09,638 --> 01:45:11,473
What time is it?

536
01:45:11,723 --> 01:45:13,475
I don't know.

537
01:45:13,809 --> 01:45:16,395
Maybe around 8:30.

538
01:45:22,484 --> 01:45:24,361
I failed.

539
01:45:31,159 --> 01:45:34,204
Complete and utter failure.

540
01:45:37,457 --> 01:45:39,292
Do you have...

541
01:45:41,461 --> 01:45:43,422
a wife?

542
01:45:45,841 --> 01:45:47,509
In Tokyo.

543
01:45:48,677 --> 01:45:51,221
That's no concern of yours.

544
01:45:53,473 --> 01:45:54,808
You're right.

545
01:45:56,935 --> 01:45:59,688
But it's too bad.

546
01:46:01,940 --> 01:46:04,067
If I'd succeeded...

547
01:46:05,193 --> 01:46:08,488
I was going
to send you a radio.

548
01:46:08,864 --> 01:46:10,699
A radio?

549
01:46:10,991 --> 01:46:13,076
You want one, don't you?

550
01:46:15,871 --> 01:46:19,541
That's all right.
You don't have to do that.

551
01:46:21,251 --> 01:46:24,838
I can do piecework
and buy one here.

552
01:46:27,424 --> 01:46:29,676
I failed.

553
01:46:31,261 --> 01:46:33,889
Shall I wipe you off?

554
01:46:37,392 --> 01:46:40,270
I didn't know the geography,
that's why.

555
01:46:51,740 --> 01:46:54,409
<i>But eventually
they'll come looking for me:</i>

556
01:46:55,702 --> 01:46:58,413
<i>my friends...</i>

557
01:46:59,247 --> 01:47:01,083
<i>the union...</i>

558
01:47:02,584 --> 01:47:06,171
<i>the school board, the PTA.</i>

559
01:47:08,423 --> 01:47:11,051
They won't let me die here.

560
01:47:12,844 --> 01:47:15,472
Come. Let me wash you.

561
01:47:36,660 --> 01:47:38,912
What's that?

562
01:47:42,791 --> 01:47:45,877
- My last hope.
- Last hope?

563
01:47:46,378 --> 01:47:48,380
It's a crow trap.

564
01:47:53,718 --> 01:47:56,721
I place the bait on top
of the newspaper.

565
01:47:56,972 --> 01:48:01,560
If a crow goes for the bait,
it'll get sucked into the sand.

566
01:48:02,310 --> 01:48:05,272
Crows are very clever.

567
01:48:05,981 --> 01:48:08,608
Hunger makes them stupid.

568
01:48:14,614 --> 01:48:18,118
Why do you say
it's your last hope?

569
01:48:18,994 --> 01:48:20,829
'Cause it is.

570
01:48:22,164 --> 01:48:27,210
I'll tie a message to its leg
asking for help.

571
01:48:29,754 --> 01:48:31,840
They're not coming, you know.

572
01:48:32,174 --> 01:48:35,135
It's been almost three months.

573
01:48:36,887 --> 01:48:38,430
Who?

574
01:48:38,680 --> 01:48:40,724
Your rescuers.

575
01:48:49,983 --> 01:48:53,486
They probably think you ran away.

576
01:48:54,571 --> 01:48:56,198
Ran away?

577
01:48:58,867 --> 01:49:02,078
That you got sick of your job.

578
01:49:03,538 --> 01:49:05,290
Impossible.

579
01:49:08,210 --> 01:49:11,087
I left my bankbook lying around.

580
01:49:11,880 --> 01:49:15,217
I left an open book on my desk.

581
01:49:15,592 --> 01:49:20,013
Anyone could see the room's
practically screaming for help.

582
01:49:20,680 --> 01:49:22,807
What's there for you?

583
01:49:23,600 --> 01:49:25,393
What do you mean?

584
01:49:25,685 --> 01:49:27,479
In Tokyo.

585
01:49:28,063 --> 01:49:31,191
Why do you think
I said to go see it?

586
01:49:32,067 --> 01:49:34,027
This is too much.

587
01:49:44,913 --> 01:49:47,249
Hey, your rations!

588
01:49:51,920 --> 01:49:55,006
Wait a minute! Wait!

589
01:50:00,470 --> 01:50:03,974
Can't you let me out
once in a while?

590
01:50:04,099 --> 01:50:07,894
Thirty minutes, once a day,
to see the sea?

591
01:50:11,606 --> 01:50:14,859
I promise not to escape.

592
01:50:15,610 --> 01:50:17,862
Twenty minutes!
Even ten!

593
01:50:18,071 --> 01:50:20,615
I've been good
for three months!

594
01:50:20,740 --> 01:50:23,285
Please, I'm going crazy!

595
01:50:25,120 --> 01:50:28,832
The village council
will discuss it and let you know.

596
01:50:29,416 --> 01:50:33,044
Please!
You can keep me under guard!

597
01:52:28,201 --> 01:52:30,245
You're working terribly hard.

598
01:52:30,745 --> 01:52:33,957
Twenty more
and <i>I'll</i> earn 1,000 yen.

599
01:52:47,762 --> 01:52:49,472
“You're being
such a good sport.”

600
01:52:49,764 --> 01:52:52,100
“I keep smiling
through thick and thin!”

601
01:53:05,822 --> 01:53:08,074
I won't be made a fool of!

602
01:53:16,374 --> 01:53:19,836
I refuse to die like a dog!

603
01:53:51,993 --> 01:53:55,622
What good's a radio?
Soon it'll be too late.

604
01:53:57,081 --> 01:53:59,501
They don't care about you.

605
01:54:00,084 --> 01:54:01,920
I know that much.

606
01:54:06,508 --> 01:54:09,469
People only care
about themselves.

607
01:54:10,178 --> 01:54:12,472
Here we are,
ruthlessly exploited,

608
01:54:12,680 --> 01:54:14,849
yet happily wagging our tails.

609
01:54:15,350 --> 01:54:18,895
Before you know it,
they'll abandon us here.

610
01:54:19,020 --> 01:54:22,357
Never!
All the sand is here!

611
01:54:22,607 --> 01:54:26,027
The sand?
What good is that?

612
01:54:26,486 --> 01:54:29,030
It's the source
of all your troubles.

613
01:54:29,155 --> 01:54:31,199
- It sells.
- Where?

614
01:54:31,324 --> 01:54:33,493
At the factories in town.

615
01:54:33,618 --> 01:54:36,871
Are you joking?
It's illegal to use sand this salty.

616
01:54:37,580 --> 01:54:41,000
Under the table, at half price.

617
01:54:41,251 --> 01:54:45,880
Hardly a bargain
when a darn or building collapses.

618
01:54:47,590 --> 01:54:49,842
That's other people's business.

619
01:54:52,804 --> 01:54:54,389
That's right.

620
01:54:54,514 --> 01:54:57,642
That's other people's business.

621
01:54:58,768 --> 01:55:02,522
But someone's
getting rich off this scam.

622
01:55:02,814 --> 01:55:05,191
Why help them?

623
01:55:05,733 --> 01:55:08,486
The union does
the buying and selling.

624
01:55:09,070 --> 01:55:13,199
They treat us very well.

625
01:55:26,921 --> 01:55:29,299
I'll sift the sand.

626
01:55:32,635 --> 01:55:36,598
Living here is like
building a house on water

627
01:55:37,265 --> 01:55:40,143
when a boat
would make more sense.

628
01:55:40,435 --> 01:55:42,437
Such rigid thinking.

629
01:55:42,562 --> 01:55:45,773
It has to be a house
or nothing at all.

630
01:55:46,566 --> 01:55:50,695
But don't you want
to go home too?

631
01:55:51,446 --> 01:55:53,448
That's different.

632
01:56:15,637 --> 01:56:17,639
Even if it's only a lie...

633
01:56:18,973 --> 01:56:21,768
it helps to have hope...

634
01:56:22,644 --> 01:56:26,773
that things
will change tomorrow.

635
01:56:29,901 --> 01:56:33,738
I'm so frightened every morning

636
01:56:34,656 --> 01:56:37,325
when I go to sleep

637
01:56:38,034 --> 01:56:43,623
that I'll wake up alone again.

638
01:56:45,166 --> 01:56:48,670
That really frightens me.

639
01:57:15,863 --> 01:57:18,908
Put them in here.

640
01:57:47,729 --> 01:57:51,107
Hey, mister, working hard?

641
01:57:52,567 --> 01:57:56,612
What's he doing here?
It's too early for the basket.

642
01:57:56,904 --> 01:58:00,491
You said you wanted
to see the sea?

643
01:58:02,243 --> 01:58:03,661
Yes.

644
01:58:04,162 --> 01:58:06,539
Please! Will you let me?

645
01:58:08,416 --> 01:58:11,753
It's a possibility.

646
01:58:11,961 --> 01:58:13,588
Please.

647
01:58:13,713 --> 01:58:15,965
I've learned my lesson.

648
01:58:16,090 --> 01:58:18,593
Just an hour a day?

649
01:58:20,136 --> 01:58:23,306
Okay, but show us
some you-know-what.

650
01:58:23,765 --> 01:58:26,225
Both of you come out...

651
01:58:26,976 --> 01:58:31,564
where everyone can see you.

652
01:58:32,982 --> 01:58:34,317
“You-know-what”?

653
01:58:34,484 --> 01:58:37,195
Yeah, you heard me.

654
01:58:39,113 --> 01:58:42,658
You know, with your old lady.

655
01:58:48,080 --> 01:58:49,957
Like this, man!

656
01:59:14,649 --> 01:59:17,485
We all discussed it.

657
01:59:18,277 --> 01:59:21,656
We all agreed.
This is what you gotta do.

658
01:59:26,536 --> 01:59:28,830
Hey, what's taking so long!

659
01:59:29,080 --> 01:59:31,207
Hurry up!

660
02:00:02,613 --> 02:00:04,740
What should we do?

661
02:00:05,783 --> 02:00:07,451
It's ridiculous!

662
02:00:09,370 --> 02:00:12,498
But it's my only chance.

663
02:00:13,833 --> 02:00:15,501
Just ignore them.

664
02:00:19,422 --> 02:00:24,093
Look, we don't have
to take it so seriously.

665
02:00:24,635 --> 02:00:27,597
What?
We're not perverts!

666
02:02:37,059 --> 02:02:39,937
Who cares?
We're living like animals anyway!

667
02:03:52,968 --> 02:03:56,305
Come on!
We can just pretend!

668
02:04:04,271 --> 02:04:06,148
You idiot!

669
02:04:36,971 --> 02:04:39,640
You idiot!

670
02:06:37,716 --> 02:06:39,635
How did this happen?

671
02:06:45,432 --> 02:06:47,059
That's odd.

672
02:06:56,652 --> 02:07:01,282
It hasn't rained a drop
in over three weeks.

673
02:07:36,150 --> 02:07:38,652
It must be capillary action.

674
02:07:39,987 --> 02:07:41,697
That's it.

675
02:07:55,377 --> 02:07:59,506
If I can perfect the technique,
we'll never worry about water again.

676
02:09:50,617 --> 02:09:56,165
<i>Evaporation at the surface
draws up underground moisture.</i>

677
02:09:57,332 --> 02:09:59,960
<i>The entire dune acts as a pump.</i>

678
02:10:01,462 --> 02:10:05,090
<i>It's as if we're sitting
on top of a suction pump.</i>

679
02:10:08,051 --> 02:10:12,473
<i>I may be able to devise
an even better tank.</i>

680
02:11:10,781 --> 02:11:14,076
This is awful!
I can hardly breathe.

681
02:11:14,576 --> 02:11:16,912
It's almost December.

682
02:12:00,664 --> 02:12:02,291
Well, then.

683
02:12:15,262 --> 02:12:17,097
That again?

684
02:12:18,640 --> 02:12:20,892
Food's scarce when it's cold.

685
02:12:21,018 --> 02:12:23,895
A crow's more likely
to take the bait.

686
02:12:24,354 --> 02:12:27,608
Men!

687
02:12:30,027 --> 02:12:34,323
Sometimes I want to be
the one to set a trap.

688
02:12:40,120 --> 02:12:42,581
If only the radio would arrive,

689
02:12:42,748 --> 02:12:45,375
we could hear
the weather report.

690
02:13:10,150 --> 02:13:11,860
I'm afraid.

691
02:13:33,799 --> 02:13:36,635
I'll bury this
while the water's heating.

692
02:14:21,096 --> 02:14:23,265
Just another day now...

693
02:14:37,738 --> 02:14:39,865
Help!

694
02:14:40,782 --> 02:14:44,745
Someone help!

695
02:15:01,595 --> 02:15:04,639
<i>No... no.</i>

696
02:15:11,646 --> 02:15:13,982
- What's wrong?
- She's in pain.

697
02:15:36,213 --> 02:15:37,756
It's a baby.

698
02:15:38,381 --> 02:15:39,966
A baby?

699
02:15:44,387 --> 02:15:45,931
Since when?

700
02:15:46,181 --> 02:15:48,099
October.

701
02:15:52,604 --> 02:15:53,897
- Any pain here?
- Yes.

702
02:15:54,189 --> 02:15:55,857
- Nausea?
- Yeah.

703
02:15:56,858 --> 02:15:58,568
What about here?

704
02:15:59,945 --> 02:16:04,533
It may be
an ectopic pregnancy.

705
02:16:04,866 --> 02:16:06,493
How do you know
these things?

706
02:16:07,452 --> 02:16:11,164
He used to shoe horses
for the veterinarian!

707
02:16:11,790 --> 02:16:14,417
Never mind that.
Just call a doctor quick!

708
02:16:15,585 --> 02:16:17,754
He wouldn't get here in time.

709
02:16:18,380 --> 02:16:20,507
Doctors nowadays...

710
02:16:21,383 --> 02:16:24,177
Have them bring
the three-wheeler.

711
02:16:47,742 --> 02:16:49,244
Here they come.

712
02:16:55,041 --> 02:16:56,668
I'm afraid.

713
02:17:02,340 --> 02:17:06,511
Has the wind died down?

714
02:17:08,263 --> 02:17:11,349
Yes, quite a bit.

715
02:17:20,692 --> 02:17:23,987
- How do we get her up?
- Wrap her in the futon.

716
02:17:24,237 --> 02:17:25,989
Let's go.

717
02:17:39,461 --> 02:17:41,546
Put a board under her.

718
02:17:44,758 --> 02:17:46,343
Here's your radio.

719
02:17:53,224 --> 02:17:55,143
The radio, huh?

720
02:17:57,729 --> 02:17:59,606
Bad timing.

721
02:18:00,315 --> 02:18:02,317
Shall I open it?

722
02:18:13,870 --> 02:18:15,705
Want to take it?

723
02:18:15,830 --> 02:18:18,625
Wrap it up with her
in the futon.

724
02:18:25,632 --> 02:18:28,134
Have you got another board?

725
02:18:29,427 --> 02:18:32,180
Take one
from the shelf out back.

726
02:18:47,028 --> 02:18:49,531
The one below that.

727
02:19:10,260 --> 02:19:13,054
Okay. One, two...

728
02:19:13,179 --> 02:19:15,015
Lift!

729
02:19:16,057 --> 02:19:18,768
No... no.

730
02:19:23,106 --> 02:19:24,566
Listen.

731
02:19:25,025 --> 02:19:26,526
Wait.

732
02:19:28,570 --> 02:19:30,572
Did you say something?

733
02:19:42,083 --> 02:19:43,668
Never mind.

734
02:19:44,377 --> 02:19:46,087
Some other time.

735
02:20:05,148 --> 02:20:06,900
No...

736
02:20:20,038 --> 02:20:22,123
Okay, pull her up.

737
02:20:25,335 --> 02:20:26,920
No.

738
02:20:29,589 --> 02:20:32,967
No... no!

739
02:20:58,660 --> 02:21:01,079
Pull her in closer.

740
02:21:03,623 --> 02:21:06,960
Take it slow. Don't rush.

741
02:25:45,738 --> 02:25:49,283
<i>There's no need
to rush away just yet.</i>

742
02:25:51,411 --> 02:25:53,496
<i>I have a return ticket.</i>

743
02:25:53,663 --> 02:25:56,833
<i>I'm free to write in
my own origin</i>

744
02:25:56,958 --> 02:25:58,668
<i>and destination.</i>

745
02:26:01,712 --> 02:26:04,006
<i>Besides,
I'm bursting with the desire</i>

746
02:26:04,298 --> 02:26:08,302
<i>to tell someone
about the pump.</i>

747
02:26:09,637 --> 02:26:14,100
<i>And who better to tell
than these villagers?</i>

748
02:26:15,685 --> 02:26:18,938
<i>If not today,
maybe tomorrow.</i>

749
02:26:19,480 --> 02:26:22,567
<i>I'm sure I'll end up
telling somebody.</i>

750
02:26:25,111 --> 02:26:30,074
<i>I can think about escaping
the day after that.</i>
