MEMBER OF ASAKUSA CAFE

16
00:02:23,294 --> 00:02:24,841
PLEASE COME IN

17
00:02:34,305 --> 00:02:37,149
- I'll leave the suspect's photograph here.
- Very good.

18
00:02:37,266 --> 00:02:42,363
- Drink this, it's cold out.
- I shouldn't, but... thanks.

19
00:02:43,064 --> 00:02:45,658
Things are very uncertain
in our line of business.

20
00:02:45,775 --> 00:02:47,777
Caught you in a bad mood, have I?

21
00:02:47,902 --> 00:02:52,032
The government says go right, we go right,
they say go left, we go left.

22
00:02:52,156 --> 00:02:57,913
We pay our taxes promptly
and what do we get? No protection!

23
00:02:58,037 --> 00:03:00,165
Take this place, for instance.

24
00:03:00,289 --> 00:03:03,338
When the Americans arrived
after the war,

25
00:03:03,459 --> 00:03:09,137
they told us we had to provide
protection for innocent women.

26
00:03:09,256 --> 00:03:11,930
So we raised the money
to build this place

27
00:03:12,051 --> 00:03:16,852
and now they're talking about
introducing anti-prostitution laws.

28
00:03:16,972 --> 00:03:19,976
We haven't even paid off our debts yet!

29
00:03:20,101 --> 00:03:23,355
- They can't do this to us.
- You're right, of course.

30
00:03:23,479 --> 00:03:28,155
But this government can't simply
ignore public opinion.

31
00:03:28,275 --> 00:03:30,198
Listen, Officer Miyazaki,

32
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:33,698
my family has been here
for four generations.

33
00:03:33,823 --> 00:03:37,327
And the Yoshiwara District
is over 300 years old.

34
00:03:37,451 --> 00:03:41,046
If prostitution is so unpopular,
how come it's lasted 300 years?

35
00:03:41,163 --> 00:03:42,585
Madam...

36
00:03:42,707 --> 00:03:44,960
Oh... hello, officer.

37
00:03:45,084 --> 00:03:47,303
Hey, Eiko, any good tips for me?

38
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:49,889
Come off it, officer.

39
00:03:50,005 --> 00:03:52,349
I'm going straight now.

40
00:03:52,466 --> 00:03:53,934
It's true!

41
00:03:55,344 --> 00:03:58,723
I'm acting as a guide exclusively now.

42
00:03:58,848 --> 00:04:00,725
Oh. yeah?

43
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:03,729
You don't have to keep tabs
on me anymore.

44
00:04:05,438 --> 00:04:08,817
- Madam, can I have a word?
- All right.

45
00:04:26,417 --> 00:04:29,216
Good morning, sir.

46
00:04:40,264 --> 00:04:44,440
So, what do you girls think
of this anti-prostitution legislation?

47
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,688
I'm all for it!

48
00:04:49,064 --> 00:04:52,443
You can afford to quit,
you've got a man.

49
00:04:52,568 --> 00:04:57,665
But what happens to the likes of us
if they close this place down?

50
00:04:59,033 --> 00:05:02,583
Well, the government said
they'll house you all in...

51
00:05:02,703 --> 00:05:05,798
What are they called? Dormitories.

52
00:05:05,915 --> 00:05:08,168
And they'll give you jobs, too.

53
00:05:08,292 --> 00:05:11,717
Yeah? And will they give me
one of those concrete apartments?

54
00:05:11,837 --> 00:05:15,637
- I don't know!
- Then I can live with my son.

55
00:05:15,758 --> 00:05:17,726
That'd be wonderful.

56
00:05:17,843 --> 00:05:20,972
Then I'll find a young husband.

57
00:05:21,096 --> 00:05:23,599
That's because you're still young,
Yumeko.

58
00:05:24,892 --> 00:05:26,519
In the olden days, though,

59
00:05:26,644 --> 00:05:30,615
we were seen as courtesans,
trained in the arts of poetry,

60
00:05:30,731 --> 00:05:35,237
tea ceremony, flower arranging
and calligraphy,

61
00:05:35,361 --> 00:05:38,956
and we were treated
just like noble women.

62
00:05:40,032 --> 00:05:41,875
Sounds a bit daft to me.

63
00:05:42,827 --> 00:05:46,457
Morning, sir. Are you off out?

64
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:50,005
- I've lots of things to sort out.
- Oh, I see.

65
00:05:50,125 --> 00:05:52,799
I'm really busy.

66
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:58,427
I'm off to the Guild to meet a woman
Diet member on a fact-finding mission.

67
00:05:58,551 --> 00:06:00,224
- I'll leave with you.
- All right.

68
00:06:00,344 --> 00:06:03,223
- See you later.
- See you later!

69
00:06:06,475 --> 00:06:09,820
- Oh, good morning.
- What are you doing here, Shiomi?

70
00:06:09,937 --> 00:06:11,530
- Are they all done?
- Yes.

71
00:06:11,647 --> 00:06:14,196
Why are you having
to deliver them yourself?

72
00:06:14,316 --> 00:06:17,695
I can't get the staff.
It'll be the death of me!

73
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:21,495
- At least you're popular with the girls.
- You're kidding!

74
00:06:21,615 --> 00:06:25,245
Tell the girls to go easy
on their clients today.

75
00:06:25,369 --> 00:06:28,043
Very well. See you later.

76
00:06:28,163 --> 00:06:29,881
Thanks. What do I owe you?

77
00:06:29,999 --> 00:06:34,049
- Pay me another time if you wish.
- Sure? All right.

78
00:06:34,169 --> 00:06:36,092
- Madam?
- What is it?

79
00:06:36,213 --> 00:06:38,636
- Oh, good day.
- Good day, Yasumi.

80
00:06:38,757 --> 00:06:41,306
Madam, maybe I will take
the money now.

81
00:06:41,427 --> 00:06:45,603
Let me see, for fixing the covers
that's six thousand yen exactly.

82
00:06:50,269 --> 00:06:52,567
Oh, thank you, thank you.

83
00:07:00,696 --> 00:07:04,246
- Here's another bill.
- For Mr Aoki, right?

84
00:07:05,117 --> 00:07:10,169
To think that he used to have a thriving
business employing five staff.

85
00:07:10,289 --> 00:07:14,544
He's taken a fast fall
because he leads such a fast life!

86
00:07:14,668 --> 00:07:16,887
- Yasumi...
- Eh?

87
00:07:17,004 --> 00:07:20,429
- You're practically bleeding him dry.
- No way.

88
00:07:22,676 --> 00:07:23,893
Yasumi!

89
00:07:24,011 --> 00:07:26,560
Thanks for taking me out to eat
the other night.

90
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:29,024
It was my pleasure.

91
00:07:29,141 --> 00:07:31,064
Here...

92
00:07:31,185 --> 00:07:34,610
- A little spending money for you.
- Wonderful!

93
00:07:35,731 --> 00:07:38,234
Are you free tonight?

94
00:07:38,359 --> 00:07:41,203
Sorry, there's no way I can do tonight.

95
00:07:42,279 --> 00:07:47,376
My brother's not well, so I have
to go to Ogikubo and see him.

96
00:07:47,493 --> 00:07:49,120
Oh, really?

97
00:07:49,244 --> 00:07:52,088
Well, get him something nourishing
with this.

98
00:07:52,206 --> 00:07:54,504
- I couldn't take that.
- Go on, please!

99
00:07:54,625 --> 00:07:58,095
Really? I'll take it then. Thanks.

100
00:07:58,212 --> 00:08:00,806
- Hey, Yasumi!
- See you later.

101
00:08:23,028 --> 00:08:25,497
Listen, Yasumi,
don't be like that with me.

102
00:08:25,614 --> 00:08:27,787
- Just give me an answer.
- Eh?

103
00:08:27,908 --> 00:08:32,334
- You mean moving in together?
- You don't sound keen.

104
00:08:32,454 --> 00:08:35,003
Well, I can't decide yet.

105
00:08:35,124 --> 00:08:37,673
I can understand why.

106
00:08:37,793 --> 00:08:41,172
You're the number one girl
here at Dreamland,

107
00:08:41,296 --> 00:08:44,516
while I'm just a lowly
knitwear salesman.

108
00:08:44,633 --> 00:08:49,890
What are you talking about?
It just sounds too good to be true.

109
00:08:51,849 --> 00:08:55,729
Yasumi, I've gone and bought
all the household goods.

110
00:08:55,853 --> 00:08:58,948
All I'm waiting for
is for you to move in.

111
00:09:00,649 --> 00:09:02,651
Do you not want to?

112
00:09:04,069 --> 00:09:07,164
Listen... I'll be straight with you.

113
00:09:08,991 --> 00:09:11,710
A woman like me,
working in a place like this,

114
00:09:11,827 --> 00:09:14,956
- I'm up to my neck in debt.
- With loans, you mean?

115
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,548
Yes...

116
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:19,923
to the tune of 150,000 yen.

117
00:09:22,755 --> 00:09:28,888
I just couldn't tell you before
because I thought you'd reject me.

118
00:09:33,098 --> 00:09:34,816
150,000 yen?

119
00:09:37,436 --> 00:09:39,404
I'll get it from somewhere.

120
00:09:41,648 --> 00:09:44,902
Listen... why don't you spend
the day with me?

121
00:09:45,027 --> 00:09:49,203
- No way, I've got to buy some stock.
- Come on, come on.

122
00:09:50,115 --> 00:09:52,584
- No, I can't...
- Come on.

123
00:09:52,701 --> 00:09:55,830
I'm so lonely without you!

124
00:10:01,085 --> 00:10:02,553
Yasumi?

125
00:10:03,962 --> 00:10:05,430
What is it?

126
00:10:06,381 --> 00:10:08,224
Sorry, but...

127
00:10:15,599 --> 00:10:19,445
I'm sorry to have to ask,
but could you lend me 200 yen again?

128
00:10:19,561 --> 00:10:22,405
I've run out of money for make-up.

129
00:10:23,023 --> 00:10:24,900
Thanks ever so much.

130
00:10:25,025 --> 00:10:28,120
I'll give it back to you
with 10% next payday.

131
00:10:37,538 --> 00:10:41,463
Come on in,
come and enjoy yourself.

132
00:10:41,583 --> 00:10:44,257
- Come on.
- You're too old for me!

133
00:10:44,378 --> 00:10:47,348
What did you say? You lout!

134
00:10:51,176 --> 00:10:53,053
What do you think, madam?

135
00:10:53,178 --> 00:10:56,648
She's a real find.
She'd be perfect for this place.

136
00:10:56,765 --> 00:10:58,984
She'll be a gold mine!

137
00:11:07,025 --> 00:11:09,073
Hey, wait here.

138
00:11:19,538 --> 00:11:21,586
Just call me Venus.

139
00:11:26,837 --> 00:11:28,305
Hey!

140
00:11:29,173 --> 00:11:31,301
Come on in!

141
00:11:31,425 --> 00:11:34,520
I'm new in town, come on!

142
00:11:34,636 --> 00:11:37,435
Let go of me! I work here!

143
00:11:41,393 --> 00:11:44,146
- Who the hell is this?
- She's having a laugh!

144
00:11:44,271 --> 00:11:45,898
She scares me.

145
00:11:46,023 --> 00:11:47,525
Mickey! Mickey!

146
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:52,329
This is her, madam.

147
00:11:52,446 --> 00:11:54,744
- I like her look.
- She's a real find.

148
00:11:54,865 --> 00:11:57,288
- Give us a drink, will you?
- No way.

149
00:11:57,409 --> 00:12:01,334
- What kind of a girl is she?
- Come on! She's a good girl.

150
00:12:01,455 --> 00:12:05,130
Mickey's old man has
a trading company in Kobe.

151
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:09,721
But he's a bit of a playboy
so she ran away from home.

152
00:12:09,838 --> 00:12:13,217
Then it was all downhill for her
from there.

153
00:12:13,342 --> 00:12:15,595
She got used and abused
by some American,

154
00:12:15,719 --> 00:12:18,723
and within a year,
she became hard-boiled as hell.

155
00:12:18,847 --> 00:12:20,724
- And then I...
- I've heard enough.

156
00:12:20,849 --> 00:12:23,443
- Stand up for me.
- Hey!

157
00:12:28,315 --> 00:12:29,942
- What do you think?
- Very good.

158
00:12:30,067 --> 00:12:31,910
Beautifully proportioned.

159
00:12:32,027 --> 00:12:33,529
That's my girl!

160
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:43,463
Good evening.

161
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:45,207
It's cold today, isn't it?

162
00:12:45,332 --> 00:12:47,881
- How's your husband?
- Same as usual.

163
00:12:48,001 --> 00:12:52,427
They say there's flu going around.
You have to take care.

164
00:12:52,547 --> 00:12:54,549
Thanks for the advice.

165
00:12:56,009 --> 00:12:58,558
It's tough being married, isn't it?

166
00:12:59,638 --> 00:13:02,858
Your lover makes <i>geta</i> for a living,
right, Yorie?

167
00:13:02,975 --> 00:13:07,481
But business has been bad lately
and he can't afford to visit.

168
00:13:07,604 --> 00:13:09,026
I miss him.

169
00:13:09,147 --> 00:13:15,621
He'd be off like a shot if he knew
that you had debts of 120,000 yen!

170
00:13:18,657 --> 00:13:20,125
I envy you, Yumeko.

171
00:13:20,242 --> 00:13:24,042
Your son's almost grown up,
only another year or so to go.

172
00:13:24,162 --> 00:13:28,838
I hope he'll look after me,
but it might take longer than that.

173
00:13:29,751 --> 00:13:32,630
You with the glasses! Come on in!

174
00:13:33,547 --> 00:13:37,472
All takings are split 60-40.
Are you all right with that?

175
00:13:37,592 --> 00:13:40,846
- It's not much, but here you go.
- Thanks.

176
00:13:40,971 --> 00:13:45,351
- Sorry I'm late.
- Don't worry, I'm used to it.

177
00:13:45,475 --> 00:13:50,322
But watch it, Hanae. You're not exactly
a member of the idle rich!

178
00:13:50,439 --> 00:13:52,533
Sorry.

179
00:13:52,649 --> 00:13:56,870
- That's why I prefer my girls to live here.
- I see what you mean.

180
00:13:59,323 --> 00:14:02,543
- Come on in, boys.
- We'll be back later.

181
00:14:02,659 --> 00:14:06,960
Hello, gentlemen,
won't you come inside?

182
00:14:17,924 --> 00:14:21,019
The gentleman in the raincoat!
Come on inside!

183
00:14:22,262 --> 00:14:24,264
THE DREAM LAND SALON

184
00:14:25,807 --> 00:14:29,778
Hey, want to come in for some fun?
Come on!

185
00:14:29,895 --> 00:14:35,698
Hey, come on, sir!
Won't you come in for just one drink?

186
00:14:35,817 --> 00:14:40,823
Hey, sir! Won't you come inside, sir?
Come on in!

187
00:14:42,324 --> 00:14:46,204
Come on, I'll offer you a special service.
Come on!

188
00:14:48,372 --> 00:14:51,922
Come in for some fun, laddie!

189
00:14:52,042 --> 00:14:54,591
What a cutie you are!

190
00:14:54,711 --> 00:14:58,466
- This is Dreamland, isn't it?
- Yes, this is Dreamland. Let's go!

191
00:14:58,590 --> 00:15:02,140
Can I just ask you,
does Kayo Kadowaki work here?

192
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:04,228
Kadowaki? Who's that?

193
00:15:04,346 --> 00:15:05,768
She's my mother.

194
00:15:05,889 --> 00:15:07,516
Don't be such an idiot!

195
00:15:07,641 --> 00:15:12,192
Kadowaki?
You mean you're Yumeko's kid?

196
00:15:12,312 --> 00:15:16,033
- What?
- You're a good-looking lad, aren't you?

197
00:15:16,149 --> 00:15:17,366
Hanae!

198
00:15:19,194 --> 00:15:22,073
- Come again.
- This is Yumeko's son.

199
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:26,577
Really?

200
00:15:29,704 --> 00:15:31,672
Wait here. I'll go and call her for you.

201
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:37,178
Yumeko?

202
00:15:37,295 --> 00:15:39,263
Your son's here.

203
00:15:39,381 --> 00:15:43,386
I can't see him dressed like this!
Just send him away.

204
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:47,265
- But he came especially.
- I beg you.

205
00:15:47,389 --> 00:15:48,891
Really?

206
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:02,158
Oh, how charming...

207
00:16:02,279 --> 00:16:04,031
- What did you say?
- Ow!

208
00:16:04,156 --> 00:16:10,414
I've been missing you all day.
Come and stay with me.

209
00:16:10,537 --> 00:16:13,416
Yumeko, what's up with you?

210
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:15,338
Sorry about that.

211
00:16:16,334 --> 00:16:19,508
You should've gone out to see him.

212
00:16:19,629 --> 00:16:22,883
Why do you feel so uncomfortable
in front of him?

213
00:16:24,259 --> 00:16:29,390
It's for his sake
that you have to work here, isn't it?

214
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:36,314
You've got yourself in debt
trying to bring him up.

215
00:16:38,648 --> 00:16:44,496
He ought to realise how hard
you have to work to make ends meet.

216
00:16:44,613 --> 00:16:48,243
What's he doing away from home,
anyway?

217
00:16:48,366 --> 00:16:50,710
Maybe he was after
some pocket money.

218
00:16:50,827 --> 00:16:54,297
- He looks like a good kid.
- You think so?

219
00:16:54,414 --> 00:16:58,794
He looks more like
my late husband every day.

220
00:17:02,088 --> 00:17:05,388
I'd like to make him a suit
for New Year.

221
00:17:08,136 --> 00:17:10,980
I'll just have to work harder.

222
00:17:11,097 --> 00:17:13,600
Hey, you in the hat! Are you coming in?

223
00:17:13,725 --> 00:17:15,398
<i>Hey, MN'-!</i>

224
00:17:22,734 --> 00:17:26,159
- Come and have some fun!
- No, leave me alone.

225
00:17:26,279 --> 00:17:29,704
Come on, it'll be fun.

226
00:17:29,824 --> 00:17:31,542
Get off me!

227
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:33,662
Get lost, then.

228
00:17:33,787 --> 00:17:37,963
You, the student!
Come in and have some fun!

229
00:17:38,083 --> 00:17:41,303
- No way!
- Come in.

230
00:17:41,419 --> 00:17:43,968
You give me the creeps!

231
00:17:57,477 --> 00:18:00,196
Oh, long time no see!

232
00:18:01,189 --> 00:18:02,941
It's good to see you.

233
00:18:03,066 --> 00:18:05,194
You can stop the flattery!

234
00:18:05,318 --> 00:18:10,074
Dreamland is my private hotel,
just you remember that.

235
00:18:10,198 --> 00:18:12,326
I'll see you over there.
Take this for me.

236
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:15,329
Hey, are you from Osaka?

237
00:18:15,453 --> 00:18:20,129
Hey... I never expected to hear
a western accent in the Yoshiwara.

238
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:23,220
- You from Osaka?
- No, Kobe.

239
00:18:23,336 --> 00:18:29,343
Kobe? It must be because Kobe's
a port town that your accent's like that.

240
00:18:29,467 --> 00:18:32,346
I stay in Kobe
at least ten days a month.

241
00:18:33,054 --> 00:18:34,897
- Been here long?
- I arrived today.

242
00:18:35,015 --> 00:18:36,858
No way? Let's have a drink.

243
00:18:36,975 --> 00:18:38,602
HEY, a glass!

244
00:18:39,644 --> 00:18:43,444
- Here's to me and you.
- "Me and you"?

245
00:18:43,565 --> 00:18:48,947
- Come see me some time.
- We'll have to see, won't we?

246
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:50,538
What's your name?

247
00:18:51,364 --> 00:18:54,368
- Mickey.
- Sounds like a cartoon character.

248
00:18:54,492 --> 00:18:57,746
Hey! Come on,
let's go up to my room.

249
00:18:58,622 --> 00:19:03,253
It's too early. You go up.
I'm not in the mood yet.

250
00:19:03,376 --> 00:19:07,426
Better luck next time.
Come on, you, let's go up.

251
00:19:07,547 --> 00:19:11,268
- Let me finish this.
- Come on, let's go.

252
00:19:11,384 --> 00:19:13,637
You're such a ball-buster!

253
00:19:44,709 --> 00:19:49,010
- You still here?
- It's been so bad for business.

254
00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:51,758
You should call it a day.
There's always tomorrow.

255
00:19:51,883 --> 00:19:56,138
I guess so. I might try my luck
a little longer, though.

256
00:19:57,764 --> 00:20:01,109
- Take care of yourself.
- See you tomorrow.

257
00:20:16,157 --> 00:20:17,625
Hi, darling.

258
00:20:17,742 --> 00:20:21,622
He's been crying a lot. I don't want
the neighbours to start complaining.

259
00:20:21,746 --> 00:20:23,999
Really?

260
00:20:24,124 --> 00:20:28,630
Listen, sweetie, you mustn't cry
and make your dad fret.

261
00:20:30,130 --> 00:20:32,599
- Have you had supper?
- Not yet.

262
00:20:32,716 --> 00:20:36,937
There's still some leftovers from lunch
so I didn't bother cooking.

263
00:20:38,930 --> 00:20:42,355
Let's go in there
and get something to eat.

264
00:21:01,828 --> 00:21:03,296
Welcome.

265
00:21:03,413 --> 00:21:06,508
- Two bowls of soba, please.
- Two soba!

266
00:21:06,624 --> 00:21:08,092
All right!

267
00:21:18,970 --> 00:21:21,439
Your cheeks are really flushed.

268
00:21:23,391 --> 00:21:26,019
You've got a fever again.

269
00:21:28,104 --> 00:21:33,201
No wonder. You haven't taken
your medicine for ages.

270
00:21:33,318 --> 00:21:38,870
I think the germs might have
built up resistance,

271
00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:41,834
so taking any medicine
may be a waste of time.

272
00:21:44,579 --> 00:21:47,583
I'll get you some tomorrow, anyway.

273
00:21:47,707 --> 00:21:50,551
It costs about 1300 yen, doesn't it?

274
00:21:50,668 --> 00:21:54,468
Don't worry about me, I can do without.

275
00:21:54,589 --> 00:21:59,060
But that's about all we can afford to do.

276
00:22:00,804 --> 00:22:05,150
There's no way I can afford
to send you to hospital.

277
00:22:06,893 --> 00:22:08,736
We'll just have to do what we can.

278
00:22:08,853 --> 00:22:11,072
Sorry to keep you waiting.

279
00:22:24,786 --> 00:22:28,836
- You remember Mr Yamada's wife?
- Mr Yamada...?

280
00:22:28,957 --> 00:22:33,554
He also lost his job with me
during the restructuring at work.

281
00:22:33,670 --> 00:22:36,139
Oh, the one with the beautiful wife?

282
00:22:37,757 --> 00:22:42,604
It turns out, after she was admitted
to the infirmary for TB...

283
00:22:43,721 --> 00:22:46,395
they told her
she's not got long to live.

284
00:22:51,354 --> 00:22:54,073
You know Yumeko from work?

285
00:22:55,859 --> 00:22:58,988
Well, her son came by
to see her today.

286
00:23:01,573 --> 00:23:03,871
She really flew into a panic.

287
00:23:10,164 --> 00:23:12,166
He seems like a really nice lad.

288
00:23:16,504 --> 00:23:18,506
He'll grow up to be like that.

289
00:23:21,342 --> 00:23:26,690
He's so cute... How could we
contemplate suicide now?

290
00:23:28,099 --> 00:23:30,522
He's even saying "mama".

291
00:23:34,731 --> 00:23:38,736
I'm glad now we decided
not to commit suicide.

292
00:23:39,861 --> 00:23:41,488
For sure.

293
00:23:50,163 --> 00:23:53,463
God, it tastes good, this soba.

294
00:24:02,967 --> 00:24:08,690
<i>The Anti-Prostitution Bill,
which has been defeated in recent years</i>

295
00:24:08,806 --> 00:24:12,185
<i>is expected to be presented
to parliament once more.</i>

296
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:15,814
<i>The Lower House Judiciary Committee
summoned numerous people</i>

297
00:24:15,939 --> 00:24:19,159
<i>from a variety of backgrounds
to canvas their opinions.</i>

298
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:23,079
<i>Proponents of the bill
are enthusiastic,</i>

299
00:24:23,196 --> 00:24:27,042
<i>but equally vocal are those
in the trade who oppose the legislation.</i>

300
00:24:27,158 --> 00:24:30,753
<i>Difficulties are expected ahead.</i>

301
00:24:30,870 --> 00:24:34,249
<i>Mrs Takehisa MP, in describing
the proposal, commented...</i>

302
00:24:34,374 --> 00:24:35,842
Welcome back, master.

303
00:24:35,959 --> 00:24:40,931
<i>"Prostitution is an unforgivable evil,
forcing women to sell their bodies."</i>

304
00:24:41,047 --> 00:24:43,846
Business has been so bad
this New Year.

305
00:24:43,967 --> 00:24:46,220
Even our number one, Yasumi,
earned little.

306
00:24:46,344 --> 00:24:47,891
Mickey owes us.

307
00:24:48,012 --> 00:24:52,643
She works hard, that one,
but she fritters all her money away.

308
00:24:52,767 --> 00:24:55,190
Oh, welcome home.

309
00:25:01,484 --> 00:25:05,239
- How did it go at the Diet?
- That's the last time I ever go there.

310
00:25:05,363 --> 00:25:07,491
I was in the visitors' gallery,

311
00:25:07,615 --> 00:25:11,370
and one speaker
from the opposition had the nerve

312
00:25:11,494 --> 00:25:13,496
to call us in the trade "inhuman"!

313
00:25:13,621 --> 00:25:16,625
They couldn't careless
if we starved to death.

314
00:25:16,749 --> 00:25:18,922
Politics is absurd!

315
00:25:19,043 --> 00:25:21,011
Did Mr Awai do anything?

316
00:25:21,129 --> 00:25:24,008
He's just a spineless bastard.

317
00:25:25,049 --> 00:25:28,644
We voted him in
to take care of matters like this.

318
00:25:28,761 --> 00:25:31,810
- Now he's forgotten all his promises.
- Typical.

319
00:25:31,931 --> 00:25:35,356
Madam, what do you think
of this material? Isn't it lovely?

320
00:25:35,476 --> 00:25:36,944
How much?

321
00:25:37,061 --> 00:25:41,066
6000 yen over five months,
and 1000 yen down payment today.

322
00:25:45,194 --> 00:25:47,367
Hey, call all the girls in, will you?

323
00:25:47,488 --> 00:25:50,662
- Thanks.
- I'll keep it till you pay me 1000 yen.

324
00:25:50,783 --> 00:25:53,377
- That's unfair.
- What about you?

325
00:25:53,494 --> 00:25:57,215
- Can you sub me some? I'm flat broke.
- Again?

326
00:25:57,331 --> 00:26:01,131
- I lent you some money only yesterday.
- It's gone. A thousand will do.

327
00:26:01,252 --> 00:26:05,132
You've only been here a month
yet you owe more than all the others!

328
00:26:05,256 --> 00:26:07,224
You can pay it back first.

329
00:26:07,341 --> 00:26:10,265
I could always quit
and make plenty on my own.

330
00:26:10,386 --> 00:26:11,854
Here...

331
00:26:11,971 --> 00:26:15,020
Now that's more like it!

332
00:26:15,141 --> 00:26:18,611
- Do you think that's wise?
- And one more!

333
00:26:18,728 --> 00:26:22,198
It's our responsibility
to take care of our girls.

334
00:26:22,315 --> 00:26:24,488
Is everyone here?

335
00:26:26,861 --> 00:26:30,536
I have something important
to tell you all.

336
00:26:32,116 --> 00:26:35,620
The Anti-Prostitution Bill
is going through parliament right now.

337
00:26:35,745 --> 00:26:38,373
You probably heard about it
on the radio.

338
00:26:38,498 --> 00:26:42,128
They say it's a law that will protect you,
but that's rubbish.

339
00:26:42,251 --> 00:26:44,253
You will be the ones that'll suffer.

340
00:26:44,378 --> 00:26:49,384
How will you survive
if you have to go to jail for soliciting?

341
00:26:51,969 --> 00:26:57,521
Hanae, how will you support
your sick husband and child?

342
00:26:59,519 --> 00:27:03,240
And Yumeko, are you going
to be able to retire?

343
00:27:03,356 --> 00:27:06,951
Yasumi, how are you
going to save any money?

344
00:27:08,402 --> 00:27:12,248
Are you willing to work
as a labourer, Yorie?

345
00:27:12,365 --> 00:27:15,619
Mickey, what will you do
for spending money?

346
00:27:17,203 --> 00:27:20,298
Do you understand what I'm saying?

347
00:27:20,414 --> 00:27:24,385
The only people who really protect you
are us, the brothel keepers.

348
00:27:24,502 --> 00:27:29,554
We run these establishments to provide
you with work so you won't starve.

349
00:27:29,674 --> 00:27:32,473
You don't have to resort to suicide,
any of you.

350
00:27:32,593 --> 00:27:36,939
We make up for this government's
insufficient welfare policies.

351
00:27:37,056 --> 00:27:39,980
We act more like social workers!

352
00:27:40,101 --> 00:27:42,604
They talk of human rights and welfare,

353
00:27:42,728 --> 00:27:48,110
but these politicians don't understand
what you have to endure.

354
00:27:48,234 --> 00:27:50,703
We're the only friends you really have.

355
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:54,165
The politicians don't know
what they're talking about.

356
00:27:54,282 --> 00:27:56,910
Why can't we sell our bodies
if we so choose?

357
00:27:57,034 --> 00:27:59,662
If the business collapses,
we can walk the streets.

358
00:27:59,787 --> 00:28:02,916
We can choose our own clients.
No griping madams hassling us.

359
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:06,715
- Hey!
- Shut up, you silly girl.

360
00:28:06,836 --> 00:28:12,093
So, what I'm saying is,
don't get taken in by all their rhetoric.

361
00:28:12,216 --> 00:28:17,598
Just consider what'll happen to you
if they suppress our business.

362
00:28:17,722 --> 00:28:21,067
Don't let them make fools of you.
Understand?

363
00:28:21,184 --> 00:28:24,734
Right, back to work!
Go and get yourselves ready.

364
00:28:28,191 --> 00:28:30,410
Mickey, there's a client to see you.

365
00:28:30,526 --> 00:28:32,904
I wonder who that is.

366
00:28:33,029 --> 00:28:36,909
A daytime client?
There are some weird guys out there!

367
00:28:51,088 --> 00:28:52,840
What a body!

368
00:28:55,051 --> 00:28:57,520
You're like some pedigree race horse!

369
00:28:57,637 --> 00:29:00,607
I'm off to Osaka tomorrow.
Fancy coming to Atami with me?

370
00:29:00,723 --> 00:29:03,442
Haven't you got an appointment
with Yorie?

371
00:29:03,559 --> 00:29:05,561
I don't care about that old slag!

372
00:29:09,565 --> 00:29:11,909
What? You still around?

373
00:29:12,026 --> 00:29:14,154
The madam told me
you'd gone home sick.

374
00:29:14,278 --> 00:29:17,908
You're a real man about town!
What the hell are you doing here?

375
00:29:18,032 --> 00:29:21,127
Don't get angry!
Get undressed and get in with me.

376
00:29:21,244 --> 00:29:23,246
You bastard!

377
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:26,207
- Bastard!
- What...?

378
00:29:27,250 --> 00:29:29,252
I swallowed a load of water, you whore!

379
00:29:29,377 --> 00:29:32,426
- If I'm a whore, what's that make you?
- I'm the client!

380
00:29:32,546 --> 00:29:35,220
You bastard! Bastard!

381
00:29:35,341 --> 00:29:37,685
All right, I'm going to my room!

382
00:29:41,597 --> 00:29:45,397
Hey, Mickey! You've humiliated me!

383
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:51,532
- You know what our rule is here!
- Rule? What rule would that be?

384
00:29:51,649 --> 00:29:56,871
It's all right to steal money here,
but you never touch another's client!

385
00:29:56,988 --> 00:30:01,585
- Don't forget that!
- All clients are idiots anyway.

386
00:30:01,701 --> 00:30:04,796
If he's that important to you,
put a leash on him.

387
00:30:04,912 --> 00:30:07,756
Yeah... Mickey's right.

388
00:30:09,792 --> 00:30:12,386
I'm ready to face anything.

389
00:30:12,503 --> 00:30:14,722
You can suit yourself.

390
00:30:16,173 --> 00:30:19,473
It's like when you buy fish, right?

391
00:30:19,593 --> 00:30:23,723
It's only natural
that you'd choose the freshest fish.

392
00:30:23,848 --> 00:30:26,442
And it's the customer's right to choose.

393
00:30:28,936 --> 00:30:31,405
You should look at yourself in the mirror.

394
00:30:45,453 --> 00:30:47,626
What happened, Yorie?

395
00:30:48,581 --> 00:30:52,006
Listen, come and have
some tea and cakes with us.

396
00:30:52,126 --> 00:30:57,132
Want some? Madam's angry
because business is so sluggish.

397
00:30:57,256 --> 00:31:01,306
Yorie, you shouldn't be mad at Mickey.

398
00:31:02,595 --> 00:31:05,474
She's not to blame. Come on.

399
00:31:05,598 --> 00:31:09,478
It's not that. I'm fed up with this work.

400
00:31:10,686 --> 00:31:15,442
I'm just a country girl
with nothing but mounting debts.

401
00:31:15,566 --> 00:31:17,568
My life's just wretched.

402
00:31:19,987 --> 00:31:22,615
Oh, I hate it.

403
00:31:23,991 --> 00:31:30,624
How I wish I could just walk out
and go and marry my lover.

404
00:31:38,130 --> 00:31:41,350
Take a look at these.

405
00:31:41,467 --> 00:31:43,265
What's all that?

406
00:31:45,846 --> 00:31:47,894
Are you thinking of opening a shop?

407
00:31:48,015 --> 00:31:50,814
I console myself by buying this stuff,

408
00:31:50,935 --> 00:31:53,233
dreaming of the day
we can get married.

409
00:31:53,354 --> 00:31:56,733
Yorie, do you want
to get married that much?

410
00:31:56,857 --> 00:31:58,700
Yeah...

411
00:31:59,944 --> 00:32:01,742
Then go and get married.

412
00:32:01,862 --> 00:32:03,785
Look at this in yesterday's paper.

413
00:32:03,906 --> 00:32:08,377
The courts have decided
that our debts are null and void.

414
00:32:09,453 --> 00:32:13,083
That means you can quit here
and your debts are cancelled.

415
00:32:13,207 --> 00:32:15,676
However much you owe,
the owners can't collect.

416
00:32:15,793 --> 00:32:18,922
- Is that true?
- Of course it is.

417
00:32:19,046 --> 00:32:23,768
So tonight, you should
pack all your things.

418
00:32:24,885 --> 00:32:27,809
Then you can take them to my place.

419
00:32:27,930 --> 00:32:30,149
Yes, let's do that.

420
00:32:30,975 --> 00:32:34,605
That'll teach that stingy madam a lesson!

421
00:32:34,728 --> 00:32:38,483
But won't it create problems
for us later?

422
00:32:38,607 --> 00:32:41,451
We'll deal with that when it comes.

423
00:32:46,282 --> 00:32:52,790
We really have something to celebrate.
I can party like this any time!

424
00:32:53,956 --> 00:32:57,426
What's so good about marriage
anyway? Nothing.

425
00:32:57,543 --> 00:33:00,547
The only difference is that
it's a long-term contract.

426
00:33:00,671 --> 00:33:02,344
She's off again!

427
00:33:02,465 --> 00:33:06,561
I'm really happy
you've made your decision.

428
00:33:06,677 --> 00:33:09,931
Don't let things get you down,
hang on in there.

429
00:33:10,931 --> 00:33:13,980
Anyway, I've never felt happier.

430
00:33:14,935 --> 00:33:18,985
The women who work at Dreamland
are the scum of the earth.

431
00:33:21,108 --> 00:33:24,783
Just be a good wife

432
00:33:24,904 --> 00:33:27,032
and take good care of your husband.

433
00:33:28,324 --> 00:33:33,330
However hard it gets, don't ever think
about going back to that place.

434
00:33:33,454 --> 00:33:36,674
You must never go back!
Understand?

435
00:33:36,790 --> 00:33:40,010
Of course she can go back
if things don't work out.

436
00:33:40,127 --> 00:33:42,846
No, you mustn't say that!

437
00:33:42,963 --> 00:33:46,763
You must never go back there... ever.

438
00:33:48,886 --> 00:33:50,513
Yorie...

439
00:33:50,638 --> 00:33:53,983
Here... a wedding present from me.

440
00:33:55,726 --> 00:33:57,524
What is it?

441
00:33:57,645 --> 00:33:59,647
It's a travel coupon.

442
00:34:00,898 --> 00:34:05,199
If it all goes wrong,
you can use that to come back.

443
00:34:05,319 --> 00:34:09,916
- What?
- Yorie, don't listen to her.

444
00:34:10,032 --> 00:34:11,750
What a bitch.

445
00:34:11,867 --> 00:34:13,335
Here...

446
00:34:14,119 --> 00:34:16,622
- This is from me.
- What's that?

447
00:34:17,373 --> 00:34:19,842
A set of rice bowls for newlyweds.

448
00:34:19,959 --> 00:34:21,927
What? How old fashioned!

449
00:34:22,044 --> 00:34:24,638
This is from me.

450
00:34:29,051 --> 00:34:30,894
Oh, look!

451
00:34:32,179 --> 00:34:35,524
It's so you don't oversleep
when you get a normal job.

452
00:34:35,641 --> 00:34:38,110
Yorie, here's my present.

453
00:34:38,227 --> 00:34:42,698
It's a savings account
with 500 yen to start you off.

454
00:34:42,815 --> 00:34:45,409
And a seal for your account book.

455
00:34:45,526 --> 00:34:48,871
Great! Now you can save
all your pennies just like Yasumi!

456
00:34:48,988 --> 00:34:51,036
That's the idea.

457
00:34:51,156 --> 00:34:54,706
I feel bad accepting
all of these presents from you.

458
00:34:54,827 --> 00:34:59,378
They're really beautiful rice bowls,
Yumeko.

459
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:05,137
These rice bowls have always
reminded me of my late husband.

460
00:35:05,254 --> 00:35:06,881
It must be 20 years ago

461
00:35:07,006 --> 00:35:10,351
when we were married
at the Manchurian Railways Club.

462
00:35:10,467 --> 00:35:14,893
I was overjoyed when I received
them as a wedding present.

463
00:35:16,223 --> 00:35:18,191
Thank you.

464
00:35:18,309 --> 00:35:21,062
I was so young in those days.

465
00:35:23,772 --> 00:35:30,405
<i>I am a maiden of sixteen years
born in Manchuria</i>

466
00:35:30,529 --> 00:35:36,252
<i>Next March as the spring snow
begins to thaw</i>

467
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:44,173
<i>And the flowers burst into bloom...</i>

468
00:35:44,293 --> 00:35:49,140
<i>Welcoming the spring...</i>

469
00:35:50,549 --> 00:35:56,773
<i>I will leave for the next village
to wed my fiancé...</i>

470
00:35:56,889 --> 00:36:01,486
I'm so happy, the happiest
I've ever felt in my whole life.

471
00:36:01,602 --> 00:36:05,106
But I really hate having to leave you all!

472
00:36:09,693 --> 00:36:12,446
I really envy you.

473
00:36:12,571 --> 00:36:15,324
I remember they were good times.

474
00:36:16,575 --> 00:36:19,670
I'd really like to see my son.

475
00:36:19,787 --> 00:36:23,758
Oh, the car's arrived.
Get ready, get ready.

476
00:36:23,874 --> 00:36:25,717
Come on.

477
00:36:32,549 --> 00:36:34,176
Driver!

478
00:36:44,353 --> 00:36:46,196
Good luck.

479
00:36:46,313 --> 00:36:50,693
Give our best to your husband.
And send us some photographs.

480
00:36:50,818 --> 00:36:54,322
No more servicing customers
back home, you'll soon get caught!

481
00:36:56,448 --> 00:36:58,166
Good luck!

482
00:37:08,752 --> 00:37:11,175
God, I thought that would never end!

483
00:37:57,885 --> 00:38:00,229
Welcome, madam.

484
00:38:00,345 --> 00:38:05,897
I hate the countryside. You have
to wait an hour for the next bus!

485
00:38:06,018 --> 00:38:08,771
It's so inconvenient.

486
00:38:11,732 --> 00:38:15,657
Well... I'll have a bowl
of noodles, please.

487
00:38:15,778 --> 00:38:17,405
All right.

488
00:38:36,465 --> 00:38:39,309
I'm just borrowing your mirror.

489
00:39:17,881 --> 00:39:21,260
Which village are you heading to?

490
00:39:21,385 --> 00:39:25,265
No village in particular.
I come around these parts sometimes.

491
00:39:42,739 --> 00:39:45,288
You can wipe off your rouge,

492
00:39:45,409 --> 00:39:48,913
but you can't disguise your trade
as a working girl.

493
00:40:09,266 --> 00:40:11,689
- Good evening.
- You've come!

494
00:40:11,810 --> 00:40:14,905
Sorry I haven't been in touch recently.

495
00:40:17,274 --> 00:40:19,493
How's father's sickness?

496
00:40:19,610 --> 00:40:22,614
He's still bed-ridden as usual.

497
00:40:22,738 --> 00:40:24,581
Poor thing.

498
00:40:25,616 --> 00:40:31,714
You're only my daughter-in-law,
yet you take such good care of us.

499
00:40:31,830 --> 00:40:34,128
Oh, it's a pleasure.

500
00:40:34,249 --> 00:40:36,752
Come on in.

501
00:40:36,877 --> 00:40:42,475
You're always in such good health,
you're very lucky.

502
00:40:42,591 --> 00:40:46,471
Tell me, is Shuichi getting along
all right in Tokyo?

503
00:40:47,846 --> 00:40:53,319
It's good for him that he works in Tokyo
rather than hanging around here.

504
00:40:53,435 --> 00:40:58,612
I hear that the toy factory
pays him quite well.

505
00:40:58,732 --> 00:41:00,734
You mean, he isn't here?

506
00:41:00,859 --> 00:41:04,113
Didn't he go to see you, then?

507
00:41:04,237 --> 00:41:06,239
When was that?

508
00:41:06,365 --> 00:41:09,744
It must be almost a month now.

509
00:41:09,868 --> 00:41:13,873
He said he had something
to discuss with you in Tokyo.

510
00:41:16,124 --> 00:41:19,845
He sent us a postcard
only the other day, as well.

511
00:41:21,171 --> 00:41:23,014
I wonder why he hasn't seen you.

512
00:41:23,131 --> 00:41:26,135
- Do you still have the postcard?
- Yes.

513
00:41:26,259 --> 00:41:29,559
It should be over there,
in his desk drawer.

514
00:41:58,458 --> 00:42:00,210
Hello?

515
00:42:00,335 --> 00:42:02,463
Eh?

516
00:42:02,587 --> 00:42:05,841
You're the owner of the factory? Hello...

517
00:42:05,966 --> 00:42:09,186
lam Shuichi Kadowaki's mother.

518
00:42:09,302 --> 00:42:11,851
He's an employee at your factory.

519
00:42:12,931 --> 00:42:16,902
I hear that you're treating him very well,
sir, thank you very much.

520
00:42:17,019 --> 00:42:20,023
Well, he's such an inexperienced kid.

521
00:42:20,147 --> 00:42:22,195
A mere country lad...

522
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:25,869
Thank you so much, sir.

523
00:42:25,986 --> 00:42:28,330
Yes. Thank you, sir.

524
00:42:34,911 --> 00:42:37,209
Do come again, sir.

525
00:42:37,330 --> 00:42:39,958
Government offices are
always busy after New Year.

526
00:42:40,083 --> 00:42:41,801
I can't believe that.

527
00:42:41,918 --> 00:42:44,137
I think you're just being hen-pecked.

528
00:42:44,254 --> 00:42:49,260
Don't joke about that.
I lost my wife and child in an air-raid.

529
00:42:49,384 --> 00:42:52,103
I'm a widower.

530
00:42:52,220 --> 00:42:54,473
It's a sad life being a widower.

531
00:42:54,598 --> 00:42:56,692
Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that.

532
00:42:56,808 --> 00:43:00,062
I'll be sure to give you
the special "wife service" next time!

533
00:43:00,187 --> 00:43:03,407
- I'll hold you to that!
- Drop by again soon.

534
00:43:50,278 --> 00:43:52,076
What are you doing?

535
00:43:53,281 --> 00:43:54,999
You fool!

536
00:43:58,078 --> 00:44:00,831
Why can't you understand?

537
00:44:01,998 --> 00:44:06,595
Can't you see the misery I go through
having to sell my body?

538
00:44:06,711 --> 00:44:09,134
You ought to understand by now!

539
00:44:10,382 --> 00:44:12,726
I'm no good.

540
00:44:12,843 --> 00:44:17,815
I'm not good enough to accept
the sacrifices you make.

541
00:44:17,931 --> 00:44:21,105
So why do we keep struggling along?

542
00:44:24,104 --> 00:44:28,154
Listen to me,
we haven't stolen anything,

543
00:44:29,109 --> 00:44:31,658
we've committed no crime.

544
00:44:33,363 --> 00:44:36,708
But we couldn't survive
if I didn't sell my body.

545
00:44:52,465 --> 00:44:55,264
How can we call Japan
a civilized country

546
00:44:57,888 --> 00:45:00,516
when I cannot buy
even the baby's milk?

547
00:45:02,934 --> 00:45:06,359
I'll live to see how the country fares.

548
00:45:07,564 --> 00:45:10,488
And I will live to witness,
with my very own eyes,

549
00:45:13,236 --> 00:45:17,207
the eventual downfall of prostitution!

550
00:45:17,324 --> 00:45:21,545
With my own eyes, I'll see it!

551
00:45:31,171 --> 00:45:34,095
Oh, this whole thing's
really starting to vex me!

552
00:45:34,216 --> 00:45:39,143
All you hear is the Diet and the press
constantly denouncing us.

553
00:45:39,262 --> 00:45:43,517
No customers are dropping by,
and no girls want to risk working.

554
00:45:44,935 --> 00:45:49,361
How can we afford to work
to an 11:00 pm curfew?

555
00:45:49,481 --> 00:45:52,701
You girls have got to sell
yourselves more!

556
00:45:52,817 --> 00:45:55,946
Yasumi, you're the top earner.

557
00:45:56,071 --> 00:45:58,039
Not much to choose between the others.

558
00:45:58,156 --> 00:46:02,332
Yumeko, why don't you work harder
if you've a son to support?

559
00:46:03,536 --> 00:46:05,413
Nothing for you, Mickey.

560
00:46:05,538 --> 00:46:07,666
You're in even more debt.

561
00:46:07,791 --> 00:46:10,419
Another sub, please!

562
00:46:10,543 --> 00:46:15,014
- Hello. When did you get here?
- Sorry I'm so late.

563
00:46:15,131 --> 00:46:18,476
- Anything wrong?
- No, nothing.

564
00:46:18,593 --> 00:46:23,064
Here, five days' pay for you,
which comes to 1200 yen.

565
00:46:23,181 --> 00:46:26,435
But you still can't pay back
the installments, can you?

566
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:31,941
Listen, do something about
your scruffy appearance, too.

567
00:46:32,065 --> 00:46:34,784
You're supposed to be for sale.

568
00:46:34,901 --> 00:46:36,995
I shall, madam.

569
00:46:40,323 --> 00:46:41,950
Mickey!

570
00:46:46,871 --> 00:46:49,920
You owe me 1500 yen, remember?

571
00:46:50,041 --> 00:46:52,043
I'm flat broke.

572
00:46:53,628 --> 00:46:56,552
- I'll take this ring, then.
- You will, will you?

573
00:46:56,673 --> 00:47:00,177
It only cost me 1000 yen.
Oh, well, I've made 500 yen!

574
00:47:00,302 --> 00:47:01,849
Bitch!

575
00:47:04,306 --> 00:47:07,480
And for your trip to the country,
you owe me 2000 yen.

576
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:11,821
Look, I'm sorry,
but can you wait for the rest?

577
00:47:11,938 --> 00:47:15,158
I've only got 200 yen left. Please.

578
00:47:16,526 --> 00:47:19,450
I'm fed up of hearing your excuses.

579
00:47:21,239 --> 00:47:24,914
Before you have to ask,
here's what I owe you for medicine.

580
00:47:25,035 --> 00:47:27,379
Thank you. Any time.

581
00:47:27,495 --> 00:47:29,748
And your interest...

582
00:47:31,291 --> 00:47:32,918
50 yen, right?

583
00:47:34,085 --> 00:47:36,383
- Where is he?
- Welcome.

584
00:47:36,504 --> 00:47:39,849
Master, it's Mr Nomura
from the union for you!

585
00:47:41,343 --> 00:47:44,893
I refuse to talk to any more
politicians and reporters...

586
00:47:45,013 --> 00:47:47,607
I'm here to tell you
the quilt-maker has left town.

587
00:47:47,724 --> 00:47:50,773
- The quilt-maker?
- Yes. And he's in debt to many people.

588
00:47:50,894 --> 00:47:54,194
- Does he owe you?
- I lent him 30,000 yen for new stock.

589
00:47:54,314 --> 00:47:56,066
Little cheating bastard!

590
00:47:56,191 --> 00:47:58,569
It's happening all over the place!

591
00:48:25,136 --> 00:48:26,809
Welcome!

592
00:48:41,444 --> 00:48:42,946
Oh!

593
00:48:44,406 --> 00:48:46,625
- Good day.
- Good day.

594
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:51,747
Who was that?

595
00:48:51,871 --> 00:48:55,876
Her? She's in the typing pool
at the office. She looks after me.

596
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,423
She's dressed pretty smartly.

597
00:48:58,545 --> 00:49:00,843
Her father owns a restaurant.

598
00:49:00,964 --> 00:49:02,432
What's her name?

599
00:49:02,549 --> 00:49:05,803
Why do you need to know her name?

600
00:49:05,927 --> 00:49:08,771
Miss...? Miss Yasuhara.

601
00:49:09,848 --> 00:49:12,271
I'll go and say hello to her.

602
00:49:14,811 --> 00:49:17,940
So you're Miss Yasuhara...

603
00:49:18,064 --> 00:49:20,692
lam Mr Kaneda's wife.

604
00:49:20,817 --> 00:49:24,447
I wanted to thank you for all the kind
assistance you give to my husband.

605
00:49:24,571 --> 00:49:30,044
Not at all. I'm indebted to Mr Kaneda
for his generosity.

606
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:31,753
Welcome!

607
00:49:31,870 --> 00:49:34,373
I hope he's always
well-mannered towards you.

608
00:49:34,497 --> 00:49:36,374
Of course.

609
00:49:36,499 --> 00:49:38,672
Please excuse me.

610
00:49:43,590 --> 00:49:45,558
Mr Aoki...

611
00:49:45,675 --> 00:49:47,643
Here's the 150,000 yen I promised you.

612
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:51,310
Oh! You've made me so happy!

613
00:49:51,431 --> 00:49:55,436
I won't forget this. You don't know
how much you've helped me out.

614
00:49:57,353 --> 00:50:02,575
I am so lucky
to have a man like you in my life.

615
00:50:02,692 --> 00:50:07,664
Listen, when can you quit Dreamland?
You can come round to mine tonight.

616
00:50:08,948 --> 00:50:10,791
Well, you see,

617
00:50:10,909 --> 00:50:13,628
it's difficult to explain.

618
00:50:13,745 --> 00:50:17,045
What is it? Not more debts, I hope.

619
00:50:17,165 --> 00:50:19,839
I only got out of hospital two days ago.

620
00:50:21,794 --> 00:50:24,263
I'd been brought in
with kidney trouble.

621
00:50:24,380 --> 00:50:26,428
- In hospital?
- Yes.

622
00:50:26,549 --> 00:50:29,177
And now you have more debts?

623
00:50:29,302 --> 00:50:30,929
Sorry.

624
00:50:32,805 --> 00:50:37,732
Yasumi, 150,000 yen is a lot of money
for a man on my wage.

625
00:50:39,395 --> 00:50:41,693
I have no more to give you.

626
00:50:42,774 --> 00:50:47,871
I only started back at Dreamland today,
so come tonight.

627
00:50:49,739 --> 00:50:51,707
You're angry with me.

628
00:50:53,451 --> 00:50:57,547
All right, from now on
I won't trouble you ever again.

629
00:50:59,499 --> 00:51:01,968
I couldn't possibly ask you
for any more.

630
00:51:04,003 --> 00:51:05,926
How much do you need?

631
00:51:08,299 --> 00:51:09,926
100,000 yen.

632
00:51:11,135 --> 00:51:13,229
100,000, eh?

633
00:51:18,268 --> 00:51:20,270
- Good evening.
- Welcome.

634
00:51:20,395 --> 00:51:23,148
Powdered baby milk, please.

635
00:51:24,566 --> 00:51:27,866
- This vitamin-enriched one is 270 yen.
- That should cover it.

636
00:51:27,986 --> 00:51:30,865
I always have to buy the stock in
with cash, though...

637
00:51:30,989 --> 00:51:32,787
- Welcome.
- Thanks.

638
00:51:32,907 --> 00:51:35,706
I'd like some of your cold cream.

639
00:51:35,827 --> 00:51:38,000
- This one?
- Yeah.

640
00:51:38,955 --> 00:51:40,548
And this...

641
00:51:53,386 --> 00:51:56,515
I'll take this as well. Put it on my tab.

642
00:51:56,639 --> 00:51:58,812
Let me see, Mickey...

643
00:51:58,933 --> 00:52:02,483
- Look, you still owe me 1600 yen.
- I know!

644
00:52:04,188 --> 00:52:08,159
Come over and see me after
closing time. I'll do you for special.

645
00:52:30,840 --> 00:52:34,845
Hey... Is that you, Yorie?

646
00:52:37,847 --> 00:52:39,565
What happened to you?

647
00:52:50,068 --> 00:52:52,196
Quickly, come inside.

648
00:53:00,119 --> 00:53:01,587
Welcome.

649
00:53:02,705 --> 00:53:04,707
You look so thin.

650
00:53:04,832 --> 00:53:06,675
It's been awful.

651
00:53:08,294 --> 00:53:10,547
It didn't work out
with your new husband?

652
00:53:10,672 --> 00:53:13,266
You're back so soon? That was quick.

653
00:53:14,717 --> 00:53:17,061
It was just a wild dream.

654
00:53:17,178 --> 00:53:19,226
I only realised afterwards.

655
00:53:21,516 --> 00:53:24,941
He didn't want me,
he just wanted someone to help him.

656
00:53:27,313 --> 00:53:31,614
He couldn't afford to hire anyone
but I was free.

657
00:53:32,902 --> 00:53:36,623
I ended up working till midnight
every night.

658
00:53:36,739 --> 00:53:42,667
I was exhausted with all the cooking
and cleaning as well.

659
00:53:44,539 --> 00:53:48,169
- He treated me like a slave.
- But you married him.

660
00:53:48,292 --> 00:53:50,386
You have to expect a little hard work.

661
00:53:50,503 --> 00:53:53,302
You should've realised that beforehand!

662
00:53:54,882 --> 00:53:56,680
I know, I was such a fool!

663
00:53:57,552 --> 00:54:00,021
But he was so poor.

664
00:54:00,138 --> 00:54:04,894
No matter how much he worked,
he couldn't even afford a kimono.

665
00:54:05,017 --> 00:54:08,487
Then I started thinking
about returning here

666
00:54:08,604 --> 00:54:12,279
where at least
I could earn my own money.

667
00:54:13,443 --> 00:54:18,370
Once you get into the habit,
it's very difficult to turn down.

668
00:54:18,489 --> 00:54:21,789
Please forgive me.

669
00:54:21,909 --> 00:54:24,913
At first I tried to get a decent job.

670
00:54:25,037 --> 00:54:28,758
I really tried hard, but I couldn't
get anything that would pay.

671
00:54:28,875 --> 00:54:31,754
Nothing over 5000 yen, right?

672
00:54:31,878 --> 00:54:34,597
I even went down
to the Employment Offices,

673
00:54:34,714 --> 00:54:37,684
but they said
there was no legal business

674
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:39,928
in which a woman
could earn 15,000 yen.

675
00:54:40,052 --> 00:54:41,679
That's true!

676
00:54:41,804 --> 00:54:46,776
All I can do is to have a word
with the madam for you.

677
00:55:03,910 --> 00:55:10,418
Yasumi, here's this month's interest
that the yak/tori restaurant owes you.

678
00:55:10,541 --> 00:55:12,885
It was like getting blood out of a stone.

679
00:55:13,002 --> 00:55:16,802
Really? Thank you.
There's your tip.

680
00:55:18,007 --> 00:55:20,556
That's a lot of money.

681
00:55:20,676 --> 00:55:22,303
Don't touch it.

682
00:55:22,428 --> 00:55:24,851
That's not a very safe place.

683
00:55:28,100 --> 00:55:30,569
Listen, it'd be better in here.

684
00:55:30,686 --> 00:55:34,907
It'll be fine in here until you go
to the bank tomorrow morning.

685
00:55:35,024 --> 00:55:36,776
Good idea.

686
00:55:41,155 --> 00:55:43,624
Is all this money yours?

687
00:55:43,741 --> 00:55:48,247
I've struggled with poverty all my life...

688
00:55:48,371 --> 00:55:53,252
Listen, do you know they call you
"Miss Moneybags" around here?

689
00:55:53,376 --> 00:55:56,255
They can say what they want.

690
00:55:56,379 --> 00:56:00,600
It's amazing that a girl your age
can be so organised like this.

691
00:56:00,716 --> 00:56:03,560
There's nothing amazing about it.

692
00:56:04,887 --> 00:56:07,686
The reason I came here

693
00:56:07,807 --> 00:56:11,778
was to make bail for my father who
got mixed up in a corruption scandal.

694
00:56:11,894 --> 00:56:14,522
I had to make the 200,000-yen bail.

695
00:56:16,941 --> 00:56:21,663
My life was ruined for just 200,000 yen!

696
00:56:21,779 --> 00:56:23,577
Just for money!

697
00:56:25,491 --> 00:56:27,789
I hate poverty!

698
00:56:39,088 --> 00:56:42,718
Mickey!

699
00:56:42,842 --> 00:56:47,222
What?
I'll have something to eat later.

700
00:56:47,346 --> 00:56:48,893
It's not food.

701
00:56:49,015 --> 00:56:51,894
Eiko's brought a client along for you.

702
00:56:55,479 --> 00:56:58,574
Is it busy already today?

703
00:57:02,570 --> 00:57:05,414
Two idiot clients
before I even have lunch?

704
00:57:09,035 --> 00:57:11,584
Hey, grey-haired romancer...

705
00:57:14,415 --> 00:57:16,042
Papa?

706
00:57:29,138 --> 00:57:31,357
Have you come for me?

707
00:57:33,100 --> 00:57:35,523
You're such a disrespectful daughter!

708
00:57:37,605 --> 00:57:41,485
Rumours about you
have been spreading like wildfire.

709
00:57:41,609 --> 00:57:44,328
Everyone at home knows
you're here in the Yoshiwara.

710
00:57:47,531 --> 00:57:49,829
Pack your things at once.

711
00:57:51,869 --> 00:57:53,371
You don't want to?

712
00:57:56,999 --> 00:57:59,798
Your mother was worried sick about you.

713
00:58:01,045 --> 00:58:03,389
Is mother still mad at me?

714
00:58:04,632 --> 00:58:07,055
She's dead.

715
00:58:07,176 --> 00:58:08,894
What?

716
00:58:09,011 --> 00:58:11,560
What did you say?

717
00:58:11,681 --> 00:58:13,775
Your mother died last spring.

718
00:58:14,976 --> 00:58:17,900
You drove her to an early grave.

719
00:58:19,105 --> 00:58:20,982
She's dead?

720
00:58:33,327 --> 00:58:35,500
- And that's her father?
- Yeah.

721
00:58:35,621 --> 00:58:40,001
Add up all her debts
and stick 10% on top.

722
00:58:40,126 --> 00:58:42,424
It's not like I've done anything wrong.

723
00:58:42,545 --> 00:58:44,263
Mickey isn't a juvenile,

724
00:58:44,380 --> 00:58:46,178
and I didn't kidnap her!

725
00:58:46,298 --> 00:58:52,396
Father or no father, he can't just turn up
suddenly and snatch a girl back!

726
00:58:52,513 --> 00:58:55,608
He doesn't settle the matter
simply by paying off her debts.

727
00:58:55,725 --> 00:58:57,648
70,200 yen in all.

728
00:58:58,519 --> 00:59:00,317
Hey, Tasuko...

729
00:59:04,984 --> 00:59:06,611
Listen, Michiko...

730
00:59:07,737 --> 00:59:12,117
I came for you because
your sister Takako is getting married.

731
00:59:14,035 --> 00:59:19,963
One of my customers is
a good match for your sister.

732
00:59:21,667 --> 00:59:26,264
He might overlook the fact
that you're a delinquent,

733
00:59:26,380 --> 00:59:28,758
but if he hears
you're in the Yoshiwara

734
00:59:28,883 --> 00:59:31,056
then the marriage would be off.

735
00:59:32,178 --> 00:59:37,810
Your elder brother graduated
from college with honours,

736
00:59:37,933 --> 00:59:41,813
yet he can't get a government post
because of you!

737
00:59:44,023 --> 00:59:47,277
Really? So that means
I've got to come home?

738
00:59:47,401 --> 00:59:49,495
Exactly.

739
00:59:49,612 --> 00:59:52,991
We're an old, established family in Kobe.

740
00:59:53,115 --> 00:59:56,745
My trading company's doing really well.

741
00:59:58,746 --> 01:00:01,340
But people have started talking.

742
01:00:01,457 --> 01:00:04,677
If you were to come home,
everything would be all right again.

743
01:00:06,629 --> 01:00:10,054
Also, I got remarried recently...

744
01:00:10,174 --> 01:00:12,973
What? You got remarried?

745
01:00:14,095 --> 01:00:16,974
And less than a year after mother's death?

746
01:00:17,932 --> 01:00:21,186
Who is she, then?
Not that geisha from Kyoto?

747
01:00:21,310 --> 01:00:24,063
Is it that slut from Osaka?

748
01:00:24,188 --> 01:00:27,317
Any mistress would do you!

749
01:00:27,441 --> 01:00:29,864
Something you wouldn't understand

750
01:00:29,985 --> 01:00:33,535
is that the wife is the axis
of the household.

751
01:00:33,656 --> 01:00:40,039
The public just won't trust
a family-run business with no wife.

752
01:00:40,162 --> 01:00:41,960
Axis of the household, you say?

753
01:00:42,081 --> 01:00:44,800
Your business won't prosper
without a wife?

754
01:00:44,917 --> 01:00:48,091
So why didn't you treat mother better?

755
01:00:48,212 --> 01:00:51,591
She was always in tears over you
and your hedonistic lifestyle.

756
01:00:51,715 --> 01:00:55,060
Why didn't you change your ways
while she was alive?

757
01:00:58,139 --> 01:01:00,562
Remember how I begged you, in tears?

758
01:01:09,358 --> 01:01:13,955
Why are you putting on
such airs of respectability now?

759
01:01:14,071 --> 01:01:17,701
You know what?
I'm only following your example.

760
01:01:19,660 --> 01:01:23,085
I've been having a good time
just like you, Papa.

761
01:01:23,205 --> 01:01:27,255
You have no right to stop me
from doing anything.

762
01:01:27,376 --> 01:01:30,255
I don't give a damn
if Takako remains a spinster.

763
01:01:30,379 --> 01:01:32,723
You're the one to blame!

764
01:01:36,427 --> 01:01:39,431
Now it's your turn to suffer, Papa.

765
01:01:39,555 --> 01:01:43,355
You can suffer and cry out
all you want.

766
01:01:43,475 --> 01:01:46,729
Then maybe you'll understand
how mother felt.

767
01:01:49,273 --> 01:01:52,072
And you can stop
this pathetic father-figure act.

768
01:01:57,072 --> 01:02:03,546
And don't try telling me you've never
visited the Yoshiwara before, Papa.

769
01:02:04,455 --> 01:02:06,799
Don't look at me like that!

770
01:02:06,916 --> 01:02:09,795
Do you fancy trying it again?

771
01:02:09,919 --> 01:02:12,092
Only 1500 yen for you!

772
01:02:12,213 --> 01:02:14,591
It'd be the last word in debauchery.

773
01:02:14,715 --> 01:02:18,891
You won't forget it
for the rest of your life! Come on!

774
01:02:19,929 --> 01:02:22,432
What do you think you're doing?

775
01:02:23,933 --> 01:02:25,981
Not up for it?

776
01:02:26,101 --> 01:02:30,231
In that case, you can get out!
Get out!

777
01:02:30,356 --> 01:02:33,200
I'm staying here!

778
01:02:33,317 --> 01:02:36,366
If you force me,
then I'll go and join mother!

779
01:02:45,162 --> 01:02:47,164
Sir, just one thing...

780
01:02:48,249 --> 01:02:51,253
Bastard! What a melodrama!

781
01:02:52,586 --> 01:02:56,432
I'm going to have a bath
and watch a Marilyn Monroe film!

782
01:03:08,560 --> 01:03:11,154
Yes? This is Dreamland.

783
01:03:11,272 --> 01:03:13,195
One moment please.

784
01:03:13,315 --> 01:03:15,568
Yumeko, it's for you.

785
01:03:15,693 --> 01:03:18,071
- For me?
- Some young man.

786
01:03:18,195 --> 01:03:20,493
Chance would be a fine thing!

787
01:03:22,116 --> 01:03:24,869
Hello? This is Yumeko...

788
01:03:24,994 --> 01:03:28,749
Sorry, but I'm booked up this evening...

789
01:03:30,582 --> 01:03:33,631
Shuichi? Is that you, Shuichi?

790
01:03:33,752 --> 01:03:37,757
Why do you keep phoning me here?
What do you want?

791
01:03:37,881 --> 01:03:41,181
I can't stand it any more.
Stop calling me.

792
01:03:41,302 --> 01:03:43,976
Don't be like that.

793
01:03:44,096 --> 01:03:47,020
Why didn't you tell me
that you were coming to Tokyo?

794
01:03:47,141 --> 01:03:48,814
You idiot.

795
01:03:48,934 --> 01:03:52,529
Listen, Shuichi, I'd really like to meet up.
Where are you?

796
01:03:57,985 --> 01:04:01,785
There's something
I need to discuss with you.

797
01:04:01,905 --> 01:04:03,532
Where are you?

798
01:04:05,117 --> 01:04:07,916
I can't discuss it over the phone.

799
01:04:08,037 --> 01:04:10,586
Please can we meet?

800
01:04:10,706 --> 01:04:15,587
Stop going on!
All right, all right, I'll see you.

801
01:04:15,711 --> 01:04:19,591
I'll wait for you outside the factory
tomorrow afternoon, around 3:00.

802
01:04:27,097 --> 01:04:32,354
Listen, just now I got a call from my son.
He wants to see me tomorrow.

803
01:04:33,228 --> 01:04:35,822
He probably wants me
to move in with him.

804
01:04:35,939 --> 01:04:39,113
Isn't it wonderful having a son?

805
01:04:39,234 --> 01:04:41,282
You're so lucky.

806
01:05:17,731 --> 01:05:19,699
Mama!

807
01:05:19,817 --> 01:05:22,616
Mama, over here! What are you doing?

808
01:05:22,736 --> 01:05:24,955
Oh, Shuichi!

809
01:05:27,324 --> 01:05:30,954
I'm so glad to see you, so glad.

810
01:05:31,078 --> 01:05:36,130
I've been really worried about you,
I just wanted to see you again.

811
01:05:36,250 --> 01:05:40,380
You've no idea how worried I was
not to see you at Grandpa's.

812
01:05:42,840 --> 01:05:47,596
It's great to see
that you've found work.

813
01:05:48,387 --> 01:05:50,936
I have to work or I'd starve!

814
01:05:51,056 --> 01:05:53,525
Well, of course you have to.

815
01:05:57,938 --> 01:06:01,192
My, how you've grown.

816
01:06:03,902 --> 01:06:08,373
It feels a bit strange
walking alongside you like this.

817
01:06:12,244 --> 01:06:14,087
Is work interesting?

818
01:06:15,873 --> 01:06:17,750
How much are you earning a month?

819
01:06:17,875 --> 01:06:20,378
The pay is low when you start.

820
01:06:20,502 --> 01:06:23,676
But that's fine with me.
I'll make my own living.

821
01:06:24,756 --> 01:06:27,680
I'm studying at night school
to be an electrician.

822
01:06:29,178 --> 01:06:30,646
Really?

823
01:06:31,847 --> 01:06:33,474
Is that true?

824
01:06:34,475 --> 01:06:36,978
You want to become an electrician?

825
01:06:37,102 --> 01:06:39,275
An electrician, eh?

826
01:06:39,396 --> 01:06:41,899
That's wonderful.

827
01:06:42,024 --> 01:06:45,449
You'll be able to live with me, then,
won't you?

828
01:06:45,569 --> 01:06:48,413
Business isn't going too well for me.

829
01:06:51,742 --> 01:06:53,744
The future looks bleak.

830
01:07:00,542 --> 01:07:02,385
And I'm getting on.

831
01:07:03,504 --> 01:07:07,259
I'll get into trouble
if you keep phoning the factory.

832
01:07:07,382 --> 01:07:12,388
Why? Surely you're allowed
a phone call from your mother?

833
01:07:12,513 --> 01:07:15,892
They're ever so polite to me
on the phone.

834
01:07:16,016 --> 01:07:19,816
Everyone at home knows
what you do for a living!

835
01:07:19,937 --> 01:07:24,408
I was too ashamed to stay there,
that's why I left.

836
01:07:24,525 --> 01:07:26,994
What are you on about now?

837
01:07:27,110 --> 01:07:29,989
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?

838
01:07:30,113 --> 01:07:32,161
You know what you are?

839
01:07:34,618 --> 01:07:38,998
How dare you speak
to your mother like that!

840
01:07:39,122 --> 01:07:45,380
I have to do what I do at my age,
because I wanted to raise you!

841
01:07:45,504 --> 01:07:48,599
- Don't you criticize me!
- Isn't it your duty to raise me?

842
01:07:48,715 --> 01:07:50,342
What?

843
01:08:07,234 --> 01:08:09,202
Listen, Shuichi,

844
01:08:09,319 --> 01:08:12,323
I won't be allowed
to work much longer.

845
01:08:13,865 --> 01:08:16,744
There'll be laws to stop me working.

846
01:08:19,705 --> 01:08:24,211
What will become of me then?
You're the only one I can turn to.

847
01:08:24,334 --> 01:08:30,012
I've been waiting a long time
to be able to live together.

848
01:08:30,132 --> 01:08:34,638
Listen, I'm begging you,
don't be angry with me.

849
01:08:36,972 --> 01:08:39,521
This is the last time you'll ever see me.

850
01:08:40,267 --> 01:08:43,020
I never want to see you again.

851
01:08:43,145 --> 01:08:45,398
I'm no longer your child!

852
01:08:45,522 --> 01:08:49,993
Shuichi! How can you be
so cruel to your mother?

853
01:08:50,110 --> 01:08:51,578
I hate you!

854
01:08:51,695 --> 01:08:54,244
- Shuichi!
- Dirty whore!

855
01:09:19,723 --> 01:09:22,476
Hey, you! Come in for some fun!

856
01:09:22,601 --> 01:09:28,028
- Sorry to keep you waiting.
- Oh, it's here! Come on, it's my treat.

857
01:09:28,148 --> 01:09:30,025
Really? Thank you.

858
01:09:31,943 --> 01:09:35,447
Yumeko, Mickey's treating us.
Come and eat.

859
01:09:48,126 --> 01:09:50,174
Thank you so much.

860
01:09:50,295 --> 01:09:54,391
I think Yumeko's gone a bit strange
since her son disowned her.

861
01:09:55,425 --> 01:09:57,553
What a terrible son.

862
01:09:57,678 --> 01:09:59,351
They're all so selfish.

863
01:09:59,471 --> 01:10:05,149
They only acknowledge their parents
when it's convenient for them.

864
01:10:05,268 --> 01:10:07,691
Untrustworthy fools, the lot of them.

865
01:10:09,147 --> 01:10:13,869
Hey, go ahead and eat that,
it's for you.

866
01:10:13,985 --> 01:10:16,079
Go on, it's for you.

867
01:10:17,906 --> 01:10:20,284
Go on, eat it.

868
01:10:23,787 --> 01:10:25,585
Thank you.

869
01:10:39,511 --> 01:10:41,138
Tastes good!

870
01:10:42,097 --> 01:10:44,191
Best food I've ever had!

871
01:10:44,307 --> 01:10:48,357
- Funny girl!
- Where are you from?

872
01:10:48,478 --> 01:10:49,946
I'm from Kyushu.

873
01:10:50,689 --> 01:10:51,906
Iizuka City.

874
01:10:52,023 --> 01:10:54,151
Eh, Kyushu?

875
01:10:54,276 --> 01:10:56,825
What are you doing
in a place like this?

876
01:10:56,945 --> 01:10:59,539
My dad had a terrible accident
down a coal mine

877
01:11:00,490 --> 01:11:02,117
and now can't work.

878
01:11:04,536 --> 01:11:08,291
You poor thing. She'll fall into
the clutches of clients soon enough.

879
01:11:08,415 --> 01:11:14,718
Wasn't it the same for all of us?
I was sold as a teenager for 2000 yen.

880
01:11:14,838 --> 01:11:16,715
Hey, Yorie!

881
01:11:16,840 --> 01:11:18,683
Oh!

882
01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:21,303
- Good evening, gents!
- Where's Yumeko?

883
01:11:21,428 --> 01:11:23,601
She's over there. Yumeko?

884
01:11:23,722 --> 01:11:26,145
Yumeko, I've missed you.

885
01:11:26,266 --> 01:11:29,520
What's wrong?
Had the hysterics again?

886
01:11:29,644 --> 01:11:32,488
I'll cheer you up, come on.

887
01:11:32,606 --> 01:11:35,485
I've been bored to death,
stuck in the mountains lately.

888
01:11:35,609 --> 01:11:39,989
I need the full service tonight.
Your master's back!

889
01:11:40,113 --> 01:11:42,912
Don't look so down.
I've plenty of money...

890
01:11:44,951 --> 01:11:48,581
lam the wife of Mr Osamu Kadowaki.
Yes, I am...

891
01:11:49,998 --> 01:11:56,882
<i>lam a maiden of sixteen years
born in Manchuria</i>

892
01:11:57,005 --> 01:12:03,388
<i>Next March as the spring snow
begins to thaw</i>

893
01:12:03,512 --> 01:12:09,690
<i>And the flowers burst into bloom...</i>

894
01:12:09,810 --> 01:12:11,904
<i>Welcoming the spring...</i>

895
01:12:12,020 --> 01:12:15,069
Yumeko?
Master! Master!

896
01:12:15,190 --> 01:12:16,692
Master!

897
01:12:16,817 --> 01:12:19,036
Madam!

898
01:12:19,152 --> 01:12:22,372
Yumeko!

899
01:12:22,489 --> 01:12:28,167
<i>He'll be waiting for me there...</i>

900
01:12:30,038 --> 01:12:31,915
Shuichi... Shuichi.

901
01:12:34,125 --> 01:12:37,675
- Come here, it's dangerous.
- Yumeko! Yumeko!

902
01:12:37,796 --> 01:12:39,389
She's completely gone.

903
01:12:39,506 --> 01:12:42,851
Call the doctor, quickly!
And get Officer Miyazaki.

904
01:12:44,678 --> 01:12:51,277
<i>They'll welcome me with
crashing gongs and beating drums...</i>

905
01:12:51,393 --> 01:12:56,991
<i>When I arrive in my carriage
festooned with ﬂowers...</i>

906
01:13:08,034 --> 01:13:10,787
- What's all that about?
- It's nothing.

907
01:13:10,912 --> 01:13:12,539
Really?

908
01:13:19,129 --> 01:13:21,882
- Yasumi, did you pay off your debts?
- Yes. All of them.

909
01:13:22,007 --> 01:13:23,634
That's good.

910
01:13:25,135 --> 01:13:28,184
Let's pack and go on honeymoon then.

911
01:13:28,305 --> 01:13:30,228
That's a bit sudden.

912
01:13:30,348 --> 01:13:34,603
Look, I've already bought
the tickets to Beppu.

913
01:13:34,728 --> 01:13:37,026
Tomorrow, we'll be relaxing
in the sand baths.

914
01:13:37,147 --> 01:13:39,946
- Mr Aoki...
- What is it?

915
01:13:40,066 --> 01:13:43,570
I would never make a good wife for you.

916
01:13:43,695 --> 01:13:45,163
<i>WW not'?</i>

917
01:13:45,280 --> 01:13:48,284
I'm a woman who has sold her body.

918
01:13:48,408 --> 01:13:51,161
You'd regret it later, I know you would.

919
01:13:51,286 --> 01:13:55,007
Don't be so silly,
I'm not that kind of guy.

920
01:13:55,123 --> 01:13:57,251
I won't do it, I won't go.

921
01:14:01,504 --> 01:14:04,599
Yasumi, have you deceived me
all along?

922
01:14:04,716 --> 01:14:08,516
I scraped together 300,000 yen
to buy somewhere to live with you.

923
01:14:08,637 --> 01:14:11,390
Listen, honey,

924
01:14:11,514 --> 01:14:15,815
I asked you for money
to help me get out of this business.

925
01:14:17,187 --> 01:14:21,738
You can't give money to girls like me
and grumble about it afterwards.

926
01:14:21,858 --> 01:14:25,078
So, you never had any intention
of marrying me?

927
01:14:25,195 --> 01:14:29,041
- You deceitful bitch!
- If you want to hit me, then hit me.

928
01:14:31,868 --> 01:14:34,371
You're a businessman, right?

929
01:14:34,496 --> 01:14:38,501
Well, I sell my body
just like you sell your wares.

930
01:14:38,625 --> 01:14:41,504
It's just a business transaction, isn't it?

931
01:14:41,628 --> 01:14:45,383
So stop whinging
over a little lost money.

932
01:14:51,304 --> 01:14:55,229
All that money I gave you
was from my business!

933
01:14:55,350 --> 01:14:59,071
I wanted to marry you so much
that I embezzled it all!

934
01:15:00,146 --> 01:15:04,697
And I chose Beppu far away
so I could escape the authorities.

935
01:15:04,818 --> 01:15:07,947
Please, run away with me! Please!

936
01:15:08,071 --> 01:15:11,075
I wouldn't have accepted the money
if I'd known that.

937
01:15:11,199 --> 01:15:12,621
What?

938
01:15:14,911 --> 01:15:18,666
Give it back! That 300,000 yen
is worth more than my life!

939
01:15:18,790 --> 01:15:21,259
That money's important to me, too.

940
01:15:21,376 --> 01:15:24,630
If you really loved me,
you'd let me keep it.

941
01:15:24,754 --> 01:15:30,102
At least give me my money!
I can't lose both you and the money!

942
01:15:31,261 --> 01:15:35,141
Stop it!
I can't bear weak men like you!

943
01:15:35,265 --> 01:15:37,233
And don't visit me again.

944
01:15:38,309 --> 01:15:40,732
Madam, help!

945
01:15:40,854 --> 01:15:44,154
Master!

946
01:15:44,274 --> 01:15:45,821
He'll me!

947
01:16:09,632 --> 01:16:11,475
He's killed her.

948
01:16:11,593 --> 01:16:13,345
Yasumi!

949
01:16:13,470 --> 01:16:15,347
Quick, get a doctor!

950
01:16:16,639 --> 01:16:18,892
Hold on, Yasumi.

951
01:16:22,520 --> 01:16:26,070
Yasumi! Yasumi!

952
01:16:32,781 --> 01:16:34,499
Just popping out.

953
01:16:38,328 --> 01:16:40,751
Come and see me sometime.

954
01:16:40,872 --> 01:16:42,590
Goodbye.

955
01:17:00,350 --> 01:17:05,197
A murderer and a lunatic in one night?
It's enough to drive you mad.

956
01:17:06,397 --> 01:17:09,196
Let's call it a night.

957
01:17:16,699 --> 01:17:21,170
<i>The Anti-Prostitution Bill
has been defeated once again.</i>

958
01:17:21,287 --> 01:17:24,587
<i>Review of the controversial bill
came to its final phase...</i>

959
01:17:24,707 --> 01:17:27,085
And she's registered in...

960
01:17:27,210 --> 01:17:28,928
Thank you for your help.

961
01:17:29,045 --> 01:17:32,174
- Shimane Prefecture?
- Yes.

962
01:17:32,298 --> 01:17:33,766
Thank you, doctor.

963
01:17:33,883 --> 01:17:37,183
Sorry for the trouble, doctor.
How is she?

964
01:17:37,303 --> 01:17:40,728
Let her rest tonight.
She'll be back at work tomorrow.

965
01:17:40,849 --> 01:17:43,898
- Really? Thank you.
- Thank you so much.

966
01:17:44,018 --> 01:17:47,443
- Hey, has Yumeko gone?
- Yes, finally.

967
01:17:47,564 --> 01:17:51,319
Yumeko will have her very own
concrete apartment now, won't she?

968
01:17:51,442 --> 01:17:55,447
- Right, we'll get after this guy.
- Thank you, officer.

969
01:17:55,572 --> 01:17:59,748
- Otane, I'm going up to bed.
- Very well.

970
01:18:00,910 --> 01:18:04,380
<i>Thus the Anti-Prostitution Bill
has been killed off</i>

971
01:18:04,497 --> 01:18:07,296
<i>much to the consternation
of its proponents</i>

972
01:18:07,417 --> 01:18:12,423
<i>who see it as nothing less than
a betrayal of Japanese women...</i>

973
01:18:12,547 --> 01:18:14,891
See? It's failed again.

974
01:18:15,008 --> 01:18:18,433
- The public would never have it.
- Course not.

975
01:18:19,470 --> 01:18:23,020
<i>This issue will have far-reaching
political ramifications</i>

976
01:18:23,141 --> 01:18:27,567
<i>and any further developments
on the bill will be closely scrutinized.</i>

977
01:18:27,687 --> 01:18:29,781
- Tasuko, crack open a bottle.
- All right.

978
01:18:29,898 --> 01:18:33,402
- And get some sushi for the girls.
- Let's celebrate.

979
01:18:34,986 --> 01:18:39,913
- Bring some sake!
- See, girls? Didn't I tell you?

980
01:18:40,950 --> 01:18:46,002
Hanae, now you can look
after your sick husband and your baby.

981
01:18:46,122 --> 01:18:48,216
Yorie doesn't have
to work as a labourer.

982
01:18:48,333 --> 01:18:52,338
And Mickey, you can have
whatever spending money you need.

983
01:18:54,589 --> 01:19:00,221
We make up for the inadequate policies
of this government!

984
01:19:00,345 --> 01:19:03,098
We're more like social workers!

985
01:19:03,223 --> 01:19:08,525
The politicians are all talk. They have
no idea of the hardships you endure.

986
01:19:08,645 --> 01:19:12,024
We are the only ones
who look out for you!

987
01:19:12,148 --> 01:19:14,071
Understand?

988
01:19:14,192 --> 01:19:18,572
Right, from tomorrow you'll have
to get cracking, girls. All right?

989
01:19:18,696 --> 01:19:19,993
- Yes.
- Yes.

990
01:19:20,114 --> 01:19:23,243
- Hanae, there's someone for you.
- Me?

991
01:19:23,368 --> 01:19:25,416
- What about the sushi?
- Oh, yes.

992
01:19:25,536 --> 01:19:29,291
Phone for a five-person set, will you?

993
01:19:29,415 --> 01:19:31,884
- Have a drink yourself.
- For me?

994
01:19:40,551 --> 01:19:44,181
Listen, I told you never
to come here, didn't I?

995
01:19:44,305 --> 01:19:46,683
The landlord has evicted us.

996
01:19:46,808 --> 01:19:52,611
And we can't sleep rough
because the baby will catch cold.

997
01:19:52,730 --> 01:19:55,199
Please, I don't need to hear this.

998
01:19:55,316 --> 01:19:56,943
Sorry...

999
01:19:57,068 --> 01:20:00,163
We'll be in the kids' playground.

1000
01:20:01,614 --> 01:20:03,082
Listen...

1001
01:20:05,118 --> 01:20:07,416
I'll come home with you.

1002
01:20:12,542 --> 01:20:17,013
I'll ask the master to lend us
some money for the rent.

1003
01:20:17,130 --> 01:20:18,757
Really?

1004
01:20:35,148 --> 01:20:37,992
FURNITURE, FUTONS, BEDDING

1005
01:20:43,573 --> 01:20:47,544
Oh, hello, master. Welcome.

1006
01:20:47,660 --> 01:20:52,211
Many thanks for the wonderful flowers
that you sent.

1007
01:20:52,332 --> 01:20:55,711
- You've got plenty of stock.
- Please have a seat.

1008
01:20:55,835 --> 01:20:58,463
- It's very impressive.
- Thanks to you.

1009
01:20:58,588 --> 01:21:01,842
You're a great success,
you deserve the praise.

1010
01:21:01,966 --> 01:21:05,516
- I wish the women MPs could see this.
- Not at all.

1011
01:21:05,636 --> 01:21:07,638
- Mistress...
- Are the kimono packed?

1012
01:21:07,764 --> 01:21:09,391
Yes, madam.

1013
01:21:11,809 --> 01:21:13,982
Pack these covers, too.

1014
01:21:14,103 --> 01:21:16,731
Please, make yourself comfortable.

1015
01:21:24,781 --> 01:21:27,660
I want something more colourful
to suit a young girl.

1016
01:21:27,784 --> 01:21:29,786
Well, how about this?

1017
01:21:29,911 --> 01:21:31,834
It doesn't appeal to me.

1018
01:21:31,954 --> 01:21:35,003
She's got to look really pretty
on her debut.

1019
01:21:35,124 --> 01:21:37,422
Afternoon, madam.

1020
01:21:37,543 --> 01:21:41,093
- Thank you so much for the flowers.
- Not at all.

1021
01:21:41,214 --> 01:21:46,186
- How's business?
- I'm doing my best, thank you.

1022
01:21:46,302 --> 01:21:48,680
And thanks for placing
your orders with us.

1023
01:21:48,805 --> 01:21:51,058
How much are the cushion covers?

1024
01:21:51,182 --> 01:21:53,435
- Do we get a discount?
- Of course.

1025
01:21:53,559 --> 01:21:57,655
Let's call it 7000 yen.
And you can pay later.

1026
01:21:57,772 --> 01:22:00,491
This is a present for you
on our first day of business.

1027
01:22:00,608 --> 01:22:02,451
Oh, thank you.

1028
01:22:02,568 --> 01:22:06,948
- Give them the winter covers, too.
- Thank you, madam.

1029
01:22:07,073 --> 01:22:09,542
- See to that.
- Yes, madam.

1030
01:22:09,659 --> 01:22:13,914
- Thank you for the business, madam.
- Good luck.

1031
01:22:14,038 --> 01:22:16,040
Thank you.

1032
01:22:20,169 --> 01:22:21,921
Here.

1033
01:22:22,046 --> 01:22:23,514
Mickey.

1034
01:22:23,631 --> 01:22:25,099
Excuse me!

1035
01:22:25,216 --> 01:22:30,518
I hope you will patronize
my new business, ladies.

1036
01:22:35,184 --> 01:22:40,031
We can also arrange loans,
should you require the service.

1037
01:22:40,982 --> 01:22:42,575
How does she do it?

1038
01:22:42,692 --> 01:22:47,789
She ruins that guy that owns the quilt shop
and then buys his business.

1039
01:22:47,905 --> 01:22:49,748
And Aoki, as well.

1040
01:22:49,866 --> 01:22:53,962
Well, she won't sleep well at night
having deceived so many men.

1041
01:22:54,078 --> 01:22:56,001
Deceive or be deceived.

1042
01:22:56,122 --> 01:23:00,502
The only way to quit this life
is to do what Yasumi has done.

1043
01:23:00,626 --> 01:23:02,720
She's smart.

1044
01:23:02,837 --> 01:23:06,558
- Thank you.
- That's Yumeko's futon.

1045
01:23:06,674 --> 01:23:09,974
It's cursed, that's why
they're getting it recovered.

1046
01:23:10,094 --> 01:23:14,770
- I wonder how Yumeko is doing.
- Having sweet dreams, I hope.

1047
01:23:18,060 --> 01:23:23,157
Young girls look so attractive
in make-up, don't you agree?

1048
01:23:23,274 --> 01:23:27,404
The prettier the clothes,
the more money you'll make.

1049
01:23:30,531 --> 01:23:32,454
Listen, Shizuko,

1050
01:23:32,575 --> 01:23:36,705
you're no longer a child
so I know that you understand.

1051
01:23:38,122 --> 01:23:41,001
It's not me that's forcing you
into this business.

1052
01:23:41,918 --> 01:23:45,639
You know, don't you?
Your mother wants this.

1053
01:23:45,755 --> 01:23:51,558
She needs you to start
sending money to her as soon as you can.

1054
01:23:52,553 --> 01:23:55,978
It's against our wishes, mind you,
but that's what she wants.

1055
01:23:56,098 --> 01:23:59,568
We'll just have to see how you get on.

1056
01:24:01,145 --> 01:24:04,615
To be honest, we don't make
a habit of hiring virgins.

1057
01:24:14,116 --> 01:24:16,539
What a lovely girl.

1058
01:24:23,501 --> 01:24:25,128
Hungry?

1059
01:24:29,006 --> 01:24:31,850
Fate can't be helped, can it?

1060
01:24:31,968 --> 01:24:34,391
There's no way out now.

1061
01:24:35,388 --> 01:24:38,392
Listen, you've got to lose
your virginity some time,

1062
01:24:38,516 --> 01:24:43,113
so you may as well charge
some idiot for the privilege.

1063
01:24:43,229 --> 01:24:46,233
Copy what I do and look lively!

1064
01:24:46,941 --> 01:24:50,411
You, sir, in the beard!
Come in and have some fun!

1065
01:24:51,988 --> 01:24:53,990
Come on in...

1066
01:24:54,657 --> 01:24:56,284
Idiot!

1067
01:25:28,399 --> 01:25:30,493
Please... come in...
