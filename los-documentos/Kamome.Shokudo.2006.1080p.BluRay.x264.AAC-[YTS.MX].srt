00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:53,277
My brother loved that cartoon,
we watched it together.

180
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:54,882
I'm so lucky.

181
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:56,000
That song kept repeating in
my head a million times.

182
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:57,001
That song kept repeating in
my head a million times.

183
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:58,002
That song kept repeating in
my head a million times.

184
00:09:58,014 --> 00:10:00,054
That song kept repeating in
my head a million times.

185
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:02,887
But why that one?

186
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,976
I run a diner here in town.

187
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:07,136
Some kid asked me
for the lyrics the song.

188
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:08,137
Some kid asked me
for the lyrics the song.

189
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:09,138
Some kid asked me
for the lyrics the song.

190
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:10,336
Some kid asked me
for the lyrics the song.

191
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,349
I just couldn't remember them.

192
00:10:11,361 --> 00:10:12,817
I just couldn't remember them.

193
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:14,982
What a relief that is.

194
00:10:15,156 --> 00:10:16,145
It's like finally scratching
that itchy spot.

195
00:10:16,157 --> 00:10:17,146
It's like finally scratching
that itchy spot.

196
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:18,918
It's like finally scratching
that itchy spot.

197
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:19,941
- Thank you so much.
- Not at all.

198
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:20,942
- Thank you so much.
- Not at all.

199
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:22,274
- Thank you so much.
- Not at all.

200
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:29,242
So you run a diner here?

201
00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:30,414
Yes, I do.

202
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:31,577
With your husband?

203
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:32,714
No.

204
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:35,498
By yourself?

205
00:10:35,677 --> 00:10:36,677
Yes.

206
00:10:37,512 --> 00:10:38,797
That's great.

207
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:39,919
It's just a tiny little place.

208
00:10:39,931 --> 00:10:41,341
It's just a tiny little place.

209
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:43,631
Are you a tourist?

210
00:10:44,853 --> 00:10:45,853
No.

211
00:10:45,937 --> 00:10:47,177
Business trip?

212
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:48,348
No, not really.

213
00:10:48,523 --> 00:10:50,138
Come to see the trolls?

214
00:10:50,525 --> 00:10:51,685
Not at all.

215
00:10:56,281 --> 00:10:57,896
A stab in the dark.

216
00:10:58,032 --> 00:10:58,896
Stab in the dark?

217
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:00,318
Yes, that's it.

218
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:05,194
I wanted to go somewhere
far away.

219
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:06,992
I wanted to go somewhere
far away.

220
00:11:07,542 --> 00:11:08,531
I spread a world map and
closed my eyes...

221
00:11:08,543 --> 00:11:09,532
I spread a world map and
closed my eyes...

222
00:11:09,544 --> 00:11:11,184
I spread a world map and
closed my eyes...

223
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:12,201
Then I stabbed my finger
and I hit Finland.

224
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:13,202
Then I stabbed my finger
and I hit Finland.

225
00:11:13,214 --> 00:11:14,203
Then I stabbed my finger
and I hit Finland.

226
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:15,895
Then I stabbed my finger
and I hit Finland.

227
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:20,209
I got here yesterday.

228
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:21,381
I got here yesterday.

229
00:11:21,973 --> 00:11:22,962
That's why I'm here now.

230
00:11:22,974 --> 00:11:24,339
That's why I'm here now.

231
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:25,885
That's amazing.

232
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:27,049
- Not really.
- A very rare case.

233
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:28,392
- Not really.
- A very rare case.

234
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:29,845
You think so?

235
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:32,184
I have a question.

236
00:11:32,317 --> 00:11:33,306
If you'd pointed at Alaska,
would you have gone there?

237
00:11:33,318 --> 00:11:34,307
If you'd pointed at Alaska,
would you have gone there?

238
00:11:34,319 --> 00:11:35,308
If you'd pointed at Alaska,
would you have gone there?

239
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,440
If you'd pointed at Alaska,
would you have gone there?

240
00:11:37,614 --> 00:11:38,614
Yes.

241
00:11:46,331 --> 00:11:47,320
If Tahiti,
would you have travelled there?

242
00:11:47,332 --> 00:11:48,321
If Tahiti,
would you have travelled there?

243
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:49,973
If Tahiti,
would you have travelled there?

244
00:11:50,585 --> 00:11:51,585
Of course.

245
00:11:58,051 --> 00:11:59,416
I see.

246
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:03,419
But I really had to do it.
There was no other choice.

247
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:04,420
But I really had to do it.
There was no other choice.

248
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:05,421
But I really had to do it.
There was no other choice.

249
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:06,422
But I really had to do it.
There was no other choice.

250
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:08,514
But I really had to do it.
There was no other choice.

251
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:10,676
When you're determined,
there is no choice.

252
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:11,677
When you're determined,
there is no choice.

253
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:13,334
When you're determined,
there is no choice.

254
00:12:13,358 --> 00:12:14,894
I felt the same way.

255
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:17,271
So you came?

256
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:18,434
Yes, and here I am.

257
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:20,061
Yes, and here I am.

258
00:12:21,199 --> 00:12:22,188
So, welcome to Finland.

259
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,440
So, welcome to Finland.

260
00:12:27,247 --> 00:12:28,236
I've tentatively booked a hotel
for a week.

261
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:29,237
I've tentatively booked a hotel
for a week.

262
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:30,851
I've tentatively booked a hotel
for a week.

263
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:31,864
But I don't know what to do.

264
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:33,241
But I don't know what to do.

265
00:12:34,212 --> 00:12:35,201
I walked around
and found this book store.

266
00:12:35,213 --> 00:12:37,124
I walked around
and found this book store.

267
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:39,084
So I came in.

268
00:12:40,051 --> 00:12:41,040
How long will you stay?

269
00:12:41,052 --> 00:12:42,417
How long will you stay?

270
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:45,295
I haven't decided yet.

271
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,465
Well...

272
00:12:50,061 --> 00:12:51,050
As a token of my thanks to you,

273
00:12:51,062 --> 00:12:52,302
as a token of my thanks to you,

274
00:12:52,397 --> 00:12:53,386
you're welcome to
stay at my place.

275
00:12:53,398 --> 00:12:54,934
You're welcome to
stay at my place.

276
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:16,325
Thanks. That was a good bath.

277
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:17,504
Great.

278
00:13:23,094 --> 00:13:24,083
The land of the midnight sun.

279
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:25,801
The land of the midnight sun.

280
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:26,919
It's still light outside.

281
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:28,171
It's still light outside.

282
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:30,381
Quite strange, isn't it?

283
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:34,510
Don't be afraid to ask
for my help.

284
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:35,511
Don't be afraid to ask
for my help.

285
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:36,883
Don't be afraid to ask
for my help.

286
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:38,514
Not at all.
Please make yourself at home.

287
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:39,515
Not at all.
Please make yourself at home.

288
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:40,516
Not at all.
Please make yourself at home.

289
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:42,128
Not at all.
Please make yourself at home.

290
00:13:48,786 --> 00:13:50,697
Thank you for everything.

291
00:13:50,872 --> 00:13:52,328
Let's sit down.

292
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:55,948
Have as much as you like.

293
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,370
Have as much as you like.

294
00:13:57,545 --> 00:13:58,545
I partake.

295
00:13:58,629 --> 00:14:00,039
I partake.

296
00:14:01,591 --> 00:14:02,580
Sorry you came all this way
to eat Japanese food.

297
00:14:02,592 --> 00:14:03,581
Sorry you came all this way
to eat Japanese food.

298
00:14:03,593 --> 00:14:05,513
Sorry you came all this way
to eat Japanese food.

299
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:36,243
Thank you.

300
00:14:54,102 --> 00:14:55,091
You serve Japanese food
at your diner?

301
00:14:55,103 --> 00:14:56,718
You serve Japanese food
at your diner?

302
00:14:59,524 --> 00:15:01,435
But why Finland?

303
00:15:01,776 --> 00:15:02,765
I thought I didn't have to
do it in Japan.

304
00:15:02,777 --> 00:15:03,766
I thought I didn't have to
do it in Japan.

305
00:15:03,778 --> 00:15:05,418
I thought I didn't have to
do it in Japan.

306
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:07,441
So you came to Finland?

307
00:15:07,782 --> 00:15:08,771
I thought the Finns would
appreciate good, basic food.

308
00:15:08,783 --> 00:15:09,772
I thought the Finns would
appreciate good, basic food.

309
00:15:09,784 --> 00:15:10,773
I thought the Finns would
appreciate good, basic food.

310
00:15:10,785 --> 00:15:12,012
I thought the Finns would
appreciate good, basic food.

311
00:15:12,036 --> 00:15:13,276
Why was that?

312
00:15:15,706 --> 00:15:16,695
Well look, with Italy you think
of pizza, or pasta.

313
00:15:16,707 --> 00:15:17,696
Well look, with Italy you think
of pizza, or pasta.

314
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:18,697
Well look, with Italy you think
of pizza, or pasta.

315
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:20,709
Well look, with Italy you think
of pizza, or pasta.

316
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:23,460
What about Germany?

317
00:15:24,132 --> 00:15:25,622
Sausages?

318
00:15:26,968 --> 00:15:28,458
In Korea it'd be spicy cabbage.

319
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:29,625
In India, it's the curries.

320
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:31,252
In India, it's the curries.

321
00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:32,711
Thailand, Tom yam and
America, hamburgers.

322
00:15:32,723 --> 00:15:33,712
Thailand, Tom yam and
America, hamburgers.

323
00:15:33,724 --> 00:15:34,952
Thailand, Tom yam and
America, hamburgers.

324
00:15:34,976 --> 00:15:36,762
What about Finland?

325
00:15:37,979 --> 00:15:39,139
Salmon?

326
00:15:39,313 --> 00:15:40,473
Of course.

327
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:42,304
Just think, what is a typical
Japanese breakfast?

328
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:43,305
Just think, what is a typical
Japanese breakfast?

329
00:15:43,317 --> 00:15:44,306
Just think, what is a typical
Japanese breakfast?

330
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:45,307
Just think, what is a typical
Japanese breakfast?

331
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:47,047
Just think, what is a typical
Japanese breakfast?

332
00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:48,106
Broiled salmon.

333
00:15:48,239 --> 00:15:49,228
See? That's my point.

334
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,320
See? That's my point.

335
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:51,480
Both Japanese and Finns
love salmon.

336
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:52,481
Both Japanese and Finns
love salmon.

337
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:53,983
Both Japanese and Finns
love salmon.

338
00:15:54,162 --> 00:15:55,493
Of course.

339
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:56,652
Actually, I just made
that up now.

340
00:15:56,664 --> 00:15:57,653
Actually, I just made
that up now.

341
00:15:57,665 --> 00:15:58,985
Actually, I just made
that up now.

342
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:02,450
To tell the truth,
I thought I'd do well here.

343
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:03,451
To tell the truth,
I thought I'd do well here.

344
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:04,452
To tell the truth,
I thought I'd do well here.

345
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:06,264
To tell the truth,
I thought I'd do well here.

346
00:16:07,008 --> 00:16:07,997
I thought Finland
would be the place.

347
00:16:08,009 --> 00:16:09,840
I thought Finland
would be the place.

348
00:16:10,678 --> 00:16:11,667
But not yet.
I haven't had many customers.

349
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:12,668
But not yet.
I haven't had many customers.

350
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,320
But not yet.
I haven't had many customers.

351
00:16:15,766 --> 00:16:16,755
The main thing I offer
is seasoned rice balls.

352
00:16:16,767 --> 00:16:17,756
The main thing I offer
is seasoned rice balls.

353
00:16:17,768 --> 00:16:19,568
The main thing I offer
is seasoned rice balls.

354
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:21,685
Rice balls...?

355
00:17:44,021 --> 00:17:45,021
Good day.

356
00:17:46,607 --> 00:17:47,972
Welcome.

357
00:17:49,694 --> 00:17:50,683
This is the chap who
speaks Japanese.

358
00:17:50,695 --> 00:17:52,135
This is the chap who
speaks Japanese.

359
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:53,185
How are you?

360
00:17:53,197 --> 00:17:54,232
How are you?

361
00:17:54,365 --> 00:17:55,354
Very well, thank you.

362
00:17:55,366 --> 00:17:56,446
Very well, thank you.

363
00:17:56,617 --> 00:17:57,606
This is my friend, midori.

364
00:17:57,618 --> 00:17:58,607
This is my friend, midori.

365
00:17:58,619 --> 00:17:59,950
This is my friend, midori.

366
00:18:00,121 --> 00:18:01,110
I'm tommi hilthen.

367
00:18:01,122 --> 00:18:03,113
I'm tommi hilthen.

368
00:18:03,291 --> 00:18:04,781
Midori.

369
00:18:06,377 --> 00:18:07,366
She knows the lyrics
of that song.

370
00:18:07,378 --> 00:18:08,959
She knows the lyrics
of that song.

371
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:10,119
The gatchaman song?

372
00:18:10,131 --> 00:18:11,621
The gatchaman song?

373
00:18:12,717 --> 00:18:13,706
I'd better be off.

374
00:18:13,718 --> 00:18:14,798
I'd better be off.

375
00:18:14,969 --> 00:18:16,584
See you later.

376
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:22,809
Where's she going?

377
00:18:22,977 --> 00:18:24,638
Sightseeing.

378
00:19:07,021 --> 00:19:08,010
Hello. Did you have a good time?

379
00:19:08,022 --> 00:19:09,512
Hello. Did you have a good time?

380
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:10,679
I saw almost all the
sightseeing spots.

381
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:11,680
I saw almost all the
sightseeing spots.

382
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:13,353
I saw almost all the
sightseeing spots.

383
00:19:14,362 --> 00:19:15,852
You must be tired.

384
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:17,030
How about coffee?

385
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:18,320
Don't bother.

386
00:19:18,449 --> 00:19:19,985
I've nothing else to do.

387
00:19:20,117 --> 00:19:21,197
Sugar and milk?

388
00:19:22,203 --> 00:19:24,194
I'll have milk, please.

389
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:49,514
Here you are.

390
00:19:53,651 --> 00:19:54,640
Look, I've had a bit of a think.

391
00:19:54,652 --> 00:19:56,358
Look, I've had a bit of a think.

392
00:19:58,072 --> 00:19:59,061
Could I possibly help out
at the diner?

393
00:19:59,073 --> 00:20:00,062
Could I possibly help out
at the diner?

394
00:20:00,074 --> 00:20:02,065
Could I possibly help out
at the diner?

395
00:20:02,827 --> 00:20:03,816
I can't just sponge off you.

396
00:20:03,828 --> 00:20:05,364
I can't just sponge off you.

397
00:20:05,496 --> 00:20:07,236
I can clean, anything.

398
00:20:08,499 --> 00:20:10,035
And I...

399
00:20:11,252 --> 00:20:13,038
No, you wouldn't have to pay me.

400
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:15,081
I have my own money.

401
00:20:15,256 --> 00:20:16,712
It's actually boring.

402
00:20:18,676 --> 00:20:20,041
But are you sure?

403
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:21,417
I'm positive.

404
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:26,755
In that case, you're hired.

405
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:28,098
In that case, you're hired.

406
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:29,591
Thank you.
I really appreciate it.

407
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:30,592
Thank you.
I really appreciate it.

408
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:32,219
Thank you.
I really appreciate it.

409
00:20:48,706 --> 00:20:49,695
There's another one here now.

410
00:20:49,707 --> 00:20:51,243
There's another one here now.

411
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:52,364
Yes, you're right.

412
00:20:52,376 --> 00:20:53,582
Yes, you're right.

413
00:20:53,753 --> 00:20:54,742
It's a big one this time.

414
00:20:54,754 --> 00:20:55,743
It's a big one this time.

415
00:20:55,755 --> 00:20:57,120
It's a big one this time.

416
00:21:28,162 --> 00:21:29,151
Here's some cartoon trivia.

417
00:21:29,163 --> 00:21:30,323
Here's some cartoon trivia.

418
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:33,572
"Snufkin" is brother
to "little my."

419
00:21:33,584 --> 00:21:34,573
"Snufkin" is brother
to "little my."

420
00:21:34,585 --> 00:21:35,574
"Snufkin" is brother
to "little my."

421
00:21:35,586 --> 00:21:37,122
"Snufkin" is brother
to "little my."

422
00:21:39,089 --> 00:21:40,078
But different fathers, though.

423
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:41,330
But different fathers, though.

424
00:21:41,509 --> 00:21:42,498
They're half-brothers.

425
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:43,670
They're half-brothers.

426
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:44,844
No way!

427
00:21:44,929 --> 00:21:46,294
You didn't know that?

428
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:50,339
There's so much we never
get to learn.

429
00:21:50,351 --> 00:21:51,340
There's so much we never
get to learn.

430
00:21:51,352 --> 00:21:53,308
There's so much we never
get to learn.

431
00:21:55,689 --> 00:21:56,678
May I ask you a question?

432
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:57,850
May I ask you a question?

433
00:21:59,276 --> 00:22:00,265
Why did you take in a
total stranger like myself?

434
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:01,266
Why did you take in a
total stranger like myself?

435
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:02,267
Why did you take in a
total stranger like myself?

436
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:03,268
Why did you take in a
total stranger like myself?

437
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,269
Why did you take in a
total stranger like myself?

438
00:22:04,281 --> 00:22:06,201
Why did you take in a
total stranger like myself?

439
00:22:08,202 --> 00:22:09,658
Well, because...

440
00:22:11,789 --> 00:22:12,778
Anyone who can remember
that song can't be bad.

441
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:13,779
Anyone who can remember
that song can't be bad.

442
00:22:13,791 --> 00:22:14,780
Anyone who can remember
that song can't be bad.

443
00:22:14,792 --> 00:22:16,752
Anyone who can remember
that song can't be bad.

444
00:22:17,294 --> 00:22:18,500
Perhaps...

445
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:20,452
Is that something you
just made up?

446
00:22:20,464 --> 00:22:22,329
Is that something you
just made up?

447
00:22:22,466 --> 00:22:23,876
You can tell?

448
00:22:33,394 --> 00:22:34,383
That's a perfect theme.
You've really hit the spot.

449
00:22:34,395 --> 00:22:35,384
That's a perfect theme.
You've really hit the spot.

450
00:22:35,396 --> 00:22:37,396
That's a perfect theme.
You've really hit the spot.

451
00:22:37,898 --> 00:22:38,898
You think so?

452
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:40,639
It suits the diner's
atmosphere perfectly.

453
00:22:40,651 --> 00:22:41,640
It suits the diner's
atmosphere perfectly.

454
00:22:41,652 --> 00:22:43,292
It suits the diner's
atmosphere perfectly.

455
00:22:48,742 --> 00:22:49,742
Hello.

456
00:22:49,994 --> 00:22:50,994
Welcome.

457
00:22:51,078 --> 00:22:52,534
Midori, you serve.

458
00:23:13,183 --> 00:23:14,172
Here you are.

459
00:23:14,184 --> 00:23:15,219
Here you are.

460
00:23:24,695 --> 00:23:25,684
Please write my name for me.

461
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:27,061
Please write my name for me.

462
00:23:27,197 --> 00:23:29,108
- In script...
- Ideographs?

463
00:23:29,283 --> 00:23:30,272
In Chinese characters?

464
00:23:30,284 --> 00:23:31,399
In Chinese characters?

465
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:38,621
Tommi hiltnen.

466
00:23:38,792 --> 00:23:40,748
Tommi hiltnen...

467
00:23:59,855 --> 00:24:00,844
Ton mi hil then

468
00:24:00,856 --> 00:24:01,845
ton mi hil then

469
00:24:01,857 --> 00:24:03,457
ton mi hil then

470
00:24:10,324 --> 00:24:11,609
What are you doing?

471
00:24:11,825 --> 00:24:12,814
It's a form of aikido.

472
00:24:12,826 --> 00:24:13,941
It's a form of aikido.

473
00:24:14,078 --> 00:24:15,784
A basic squat.

474
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:17,819
I've done it since
I was a child.

475
00:24:17,831 --> 00:24:19,111
I've done it since
I was a child.

476
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:20,155
It's something I do every night.

477
00:24:20,167 --> 00:24:21,657
It's something I do every night.

478
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:23,909
I used to practise yoga.

479
00:24:23,921 --> 00:24:24,910
I used to practise yoga.

480
00:24:24,922 --> 00:24:25,957
I used to practise yoga.

481
00:24:27,508 --> 00:24:28,497
This is a pose called
"lotus flower in early bloom."

482
00:24:28,509 --> 00:24:29,498
This is a pose called
"lotus flower in early bloom."

483
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:30,499
This is a pose called
"lotus flower in early bloom."

484
00:24:30,511 --> 00:24:31,500
This is a pose called
"lotus flower in early bloom."

485
00:24:31,512 --> 00:24:33,239
This is a pose called
"lotus flower in early bloom."

486
00:24:33,263 --> 00:24:35,003
I can see it.

487
00:24:39,687 --> 00:24:40,676
Look, about the diner...

488
00:24:40,688 --> 00:24:41,677
Look, about the diner...

489
00:24:41,689 --> 00:24:43,475
Look, about the diner...

490
00:24:45,526 --> 00:24:46,515
Since we don't have many
customers,

491
00:24:46,527 --> 00:24:47,937
since we don't have many
customers,

492
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:49,059
why not put ads in
the Helsinki guide books?

493
00:24:49,071 --> 00:24:50,060
Why not put ads in
the Helsinki guide books?

494
00:24:50,072 --> 00:24:51,792
Why not put ads in
the Helsinki guide books?

495
00:24:52,366 --> 00:24:53,355
Now, tommi is our only customer.

496
00:24:53,367 --> 00:24:55,323
Now, tommi is our only customer.

497
00:24:55,452 --> 00:24:57,363
But in fact, he's not really.

498
00:24:57,538 --> 00:24:59,494
He gets his coffee for free.

499
00:24:59,623 --> 00:25:00,612
But he was my first customer.

500
00:25:00,624 --> 00:25:01,613
But he was my first customer.

501
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:02,831
But he was my first customer.

502
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:03,949
He gets it free forever.

503
00:25:03,961 --> 00:25:05,371
He gets it free forever.

504
00:25:08,382 --> 00:25:09,371
I reckon most Japanese think
our food is the world's best.

505
00:25:09,383 --> 00:25:10,372
I reckon most Japanese think
our food is the world's best.

506
00:25:10,384 --> 00:25:11,373
I reckon most Japanese think
our food is the world's best.

507
00:25:11,385 --> 00:25:12,374
I reckon most Japanese think
our food is the world's best.

508
00:25:12,386 --> 00:25:14,364
I reckon most Japanese think
our food is the world's best.

509
00:25:14,388 --> 00:25:16,174
And I agree with that.

510
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:17,379
Any Japanese in a
foreign country

511
00:25:17,391 --> 00:25:18,847
any Japanese in a
foreign country

512
00:25:18,976 --> 00:25:19,965
must surely miss Japanese food.

513
00:25:19,977 --> 00:25:21,717
Must surely miss Japanese food.

514
00:25:21,895 --> 00:25:22,884
If they knew about our diner,

515
00:25:22,896 --> 00:25:24,386
if they knew about our diner,

516
00:25:24,565 --> 00:25:25,554
we'd get far more customers.

517
00:25:25,566 --> 00:25:26,772
We'd get far more customers.

518
00:25:30,654 --> 00:25:31,643
But the thing is, I don't want to
cater to homesick Japanese

519
00:25:31,655 --> 00:25:32,644
but the thing is, I don't want to
cater to homesick Japanese

520
00:25:32,656 --> 00:25:33,645
but the thing is, I don't want to
cater to homesick Japanese

521
00:25:33,657 --> 00:25:34,646
but the thing is, I don't want to
cater to homesick Japanese

522
00:25:34,658 --> 00:25:35,969
but the thing is, I don't want to
cater to homesick Japanese

523
00:25:35,993 --> 00:25:36,982
or Finns who are after
stereotypes like Sushi or sake.

524
00:25:36,994 --> 00:25:37,983
Or Finns who are after
stereotypes like Sushi or sake.

525
00:25:37,995 --> 00:25:38,984
Or Finns who are after
stereotypes like Sushi or sake.

526
00:25:38,996 --> 00:25:40,473
Or Finns who are after
stereotypes like Sushi or sake.

527
00:25:40,497 --> 00:25:41,486
They want different things.

528
00:25:41,498 --> 00:25:42,487
They want different things.

529
00:25:42,499 --> 00:25:43,705
They want different things.

530
00:25:43,917 --> 00:25:45,248
Different flavors?

531
00:25:45,419 --> 00:25:46,408
It's a diner, not a restaurant.

532
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:48,081
It's a diner, not a restaurant.

533
00:25:48,255 --> 00:25:49,244
It's much more informal.

534
00:25:49,256 --> 00:25:50,541
It's much more informal.

535
00:25:50,924 --> 00:25:51,913
I want passers-by
to drop in and eat.

536
00:25:51,925 --> 00:25:52,914
I want passers-by
to drop in and eat.

537
00:25:52,926 --> 00:25:54,382
I want passers-by
to drop in and eat.

538
00:25:56,263 --> 00:25:57,252
If we keep working steadily
we will get customers.

539
00:25:57,264 --> 00:25:58,253
If we keep working steadily
we will get customers.

540
00:25:58,265 --> 00:25:59,254
If we keep working steadily
we will get customers.

541
00:25:59,266 --> 00:26:01,226
If we keep working steadily
we will get customers.

542
00:26:01,935 --> 00:26:02,924
If not...

543
00:26:02,936 --> 00:26:04,051
If not...

544
00:26:06,607 --> 00:26:07,596
Then I'll just have
to close up shop.

545
00:26:07,608 --> 00:26:08,597
Then I'll just have
to close up shop.

546
00:26:08,609 --> 00:26:10,049
Then I'll just have
to close up shop.

547
00:26:10,611 --> 00:26:11,600
But it will work out.

548
00:26:11,612 --> 00:26:13,443
But it will work out.

549
00:26:15,199 --> 00:26:16,279
Listen, midori.

550
00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:17,439
If the world ended tomorrow,
what would you do?

551
00:26:17,451 --> 00:26:18,440
If the world ended tomorrow,
what would you do?

552
00:26:18,452 --> 00:26:19,441
If the world ended tomorrow,
what would you do?

553
00:26:19,453 --> 00:26:20,442
If the world ended tomorrow,
what would you do?

554
00:26:20,454 --> 00:26:22,294
If the world ended tomorrow,
what would you do?

555
00:26:22,539 --> 00:26:23,619
If it ended tomorrow?

556
00:26:23,791 --> 00:26:25,122
Give me an idea.

557
00:26:31,298 --> 00:26:32,287
Well, first I'd want something
delicious to eat.

558
00:26:32,299 --> 00:26:33,288
Well, first I'd want something
delicious to eat.

559
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:34,289
Well, first I'd want something
delicious to eat.

560
00:26:34,301 --> 00:26:35,695
Well, first I'd want something
delicious to eat.

561
00:26:35,719 --> 00:26:36,754
I knew it.

562
00:26:37,137 --> 00:26:38,126
I'd want something grand for
my last meal, too.

563
00:26:38,138 --> 00:26:39,127
I'd want something grand for
my last meal, too.

564
00:26:39,139 --> 00:26:41,130
I'd want something grand for
my last meal, too.

565
00:26:41,308 --> 00:26:42,297
I'd buy the finest produce
and make many dishes.

566
00:26:42,309 --> 00:26:43,298
I'd buy the finest produce
and make many dishes.

567
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:44,299
I'd buy the finest produce
and make many dishes.

568
00:26:44,311 --> 00:26:46,122
I'd buy the finest produce
and make many dishes.

569
00:26:46,146 --> 00:26:47,135
I'd invite all the people I love
to a big party.

570
00:26:47,147 --> 00:26:48,136
I'd invite all the people I love
to a big party.

571
00:26:48,148 --> 00:26:49,137
I'd invite all the people I love
to a big party.

572
00:26:49,149 --> 00:26:50,960
I'd invite all the people I love
to a big party.

573
00:26:50,984 --> 00:26:52,440
Well...

574
00:26:54,571 --> 00:26:55,560
Would you invite me, too?

575
00:26:55,572 --> 00:26:56,937
Would you invite me, too?

576
00:26:58,659 --> 00:26:59,648
Anyone who can recall the
gatchaman song can't be all bad.

577
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:00,649
Anyone who can recall the
gatchaman song can't be all bad.

578
00:27:00,661 --> 00:27:01,650
Anyone who can recall the
gatchaman song can't be all bad.

579
00:27:01,662 --> 00:27:02,651
Anyone who can recall the
gatchaman song can't be all bad.

580
00:27:02,663 --> 00:27:04,944
Anyone who can recall the
gatchaman song can't be all bad.

581
00:27:47,124 --> 00:27:48,364
Welcome sir.

582
00:28:04,892 --> 00:28:05,892
Coffee, please.

583
00:28:06,059 --> 00:28:07,390
Certainly.

584
00:28:46,767 --> 00:28:47,802
Delicious.

585
00:28:52,773 --> 00:28:54,309
But it could be better.

586
00:28:56,276 --> 00:28:57,276
Pardon?

587
00:28:58,278 --> 00:28:59,267
Shall I teach you how to
make delicious coffee?

588
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:00,268
Shall I teach you how to
make delicious coffee?

589
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:01,269
Shall I teach you how to
make delicious coffee?

590
00:29:01,281 --> 00:29:03,121
Shall I teach you how to
make delicious coffee?

591
00:29:17,214 --> 00:29:18,294
What's that?

592
00:29:19,049 --> 00:29:20,038
/t was there before I took over.

593
00:29:20,050 --> 00:29:21,039
/t was there before I took over.

594
00:29:21,051 --> 00:29:22,040
/t was there before I took over.

595
00:29:22,052 --> 00:29:23,332
/t was there before I took over.

596
00:29:53,333 --> 00:29:54,618
"Kopi luak.”

597
00:29:55,419 --> 00:29:56,659
What?

598
00:29:58,171 --> 00:29:59,832
It's a charm.

599
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,625
"Kopi luak.”

600
00:31:19,669 --> 00:31:21,079
Good, isn't it?

601
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:24,829
/t tastes better when someone
makes it for you.

602
00:31:24,841 --> 00:31:25,830
/t tastes better when someone
makes it for you.

603
00:31:25,842 --> 00:31:27,707
/t tastes better when someone
makes it for you.

604
00:32:21,064 --> 00:32:22,053
How about some smoked fish?

605
00:32:22,065 --> 00:32:23,646
How about some smoked fish?

606
00:32:32,576 --> 00:32:34,487
Can I help you?

607
00:32:35,412 --> 00:32:37,277
Reindeer?

608
00:32:37,914 --> 00:32:39,450
This one?

609
00:32:39,583 --> 00:32:40,572
- Reindeer?
- Yes, reindeer meat.

610
00:32:40,584 --> 00:32:41,864
- Reindeer?
- Yes, reindeer meat.

611
00:32:42,002 --> 00:32:43,492
It's very delicious.

612
00:32:45,005 --> 00:32:46,836
Young and beautiful.

613
00:32:47,007 --> 00:32:47,996
So tender and juicy.

614
00:32:48,008 --> 00:32:49,168
So tender and juicy.

615
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:50,748
We have many meats. Take a look.

616
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:51,749
We have many meats. Take a look.

617
00:32:51,761 --> 00:32:53,297
We have many meats. Take a look.

618
00:33:01,021 --> 00:33:02,010
"Kopi luak.”

619
00:33:02,022 --> 00:33:03,182
"Kopi luak.”

620
00:33:35,138 --> 00:33:36,503
Sorry I'm late.

621
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:38,046
Hi there.

622
00:33:38,642 --> 00:33:39,631
Would you like a coffee?

623
00:33:39,643 --> 00:33:41,508
Would you like a coffee?

624
00:33:41,645 --> 00:33:43,226
Sure, thanks.

625
00:34:04,751 --> 00:34:06,412
Here you are.

626
00:34:14,928 --> 00:34:15,917
Did you change the beans?
It's much better.

627
00:34:15,929 --> 00:34:16,918
Did you change the beans?
It's much better.

628
00:34:16,930 --> 00:34:17,919
Did you change the beans?
It's much better.

629
00:34:17,931 --> 00:34:19,611
Did you change the beans?
It's much better.

630
00:34:27,774 --> 00:34:28,774
Welcome.

631
00:34:28,942 --> 00:34:30,273
Hello.

632
00:34:42,789 --> 00:34:44,404
Here you are.

633
00:34:47,961 --> 00:34:49,121
Thank you.

634
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:04,640
Listen, sachie.

635
00:35:05,312 --> 00:35:06,301
Look, about the rice balls...

636
00:35:06,313 --> 00:35:07,302
Look, about the rice balls...

637
00:35:07,314 --> 00:35:08,303
Look, about the rice balls...

638
00:35:08,315 --> 00:35:10,101
Look, about the rice balls...

639
00:35:11,818 --> 00:35:12,807
Even in Japan these days
the young people

640
00:35:12,819 --> 00:35:14,775
even in Japan these days
the young people

641
00:35:14,904 --> 00:35:15,893
go for more exotic
fillings in rice balls.

642
00:35:15,905 --> 00:35:16,894
Go for more exotic
fillings in rice balls.

643
00:35:16,906 --> 00:35:18,546
Go for more exotic
fillings in rice balls.

644
00:35:19,159 --> 00:35:20,148
New varieties far
outsell traditional ones.

645
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:21,991
New varieties far
outsell traditional ones.

646
00:35:22,162 --> 00:35:23,151
Doesn't that apply to
Finns, too?

647
00:35:23,163 --> 00:35:24,619
Doesn't that apply to
Finns, too?

648
00:35:25,665 --> 00:35:26,654
We should offer
local ingredients.

649
00:35:26,666 --> 00:35:28,497
We should offer
local ingredients.

650
00:35:31,755 --> 00:35:33,165
Crayfish.

651
00:35:34,758 --> 00:35:36,168
Herrings.

652
00:35:38,595 --> 00:35:39,584
And reindeer meat.

653
00:35:39,596 --> 00:35:40,836
And reindeer meat.

654
00:35:45,101 --> 00:35:46,090
I really want to see
business pick up.

655
00:35:46,102 --> 00:35:47,091
I really want to see
business pick up.

656
00:35:47,103 --> 00:35:48,331
I really want to see
business pick up.

657
00:35:48,355 --> 00:35:49,344
I want them to like our food.

658
00:35:49,356 --> 00:35:50,516
I want them to like our food.

659
00:35:55,612 --> 00:35:56,601
I understand.
Let's give it a try.

660
00:35:56,613 --> 00:35:58,524
I understand.
Let's give it a try.

661
00:36:16,633 --> 00:36:17,622
Let's try them out.

662
00:36:17,634 --> 00:36:18,874
Let's try them out.

663
00:36:20,053 --> 00:36:21,714
Start with reindeer.

664
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:34,889
The Finns like
creamy stew dishes.

665
00:36:34,901 --> 00:36:36,892
The Finns like
creamy stew dishes.

666
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:38,059
But this is a mismatch.

667
00:36:38,071 --> 00:36:39,561
But this is a mismatch.

668
00:36:39,906 --> 00:36:41,862
Maybe not. They may like it.

669
00:36:41,991 --> 00:36:42,980
Even if we Japanese don't,
they might.

670
00:36:42,992 --> 00:36:43,981
Even if we Japanese don't,
they might.

671
00:36:43,993 --> 00:36:45,473
Even if we Japanese don't,
they might.

672
00:36:51,084 --> 00:36:52,073
I don't think it's working.

673
00:36:52,085 --> 00:36:53,245
I don't think it's working.

674
00:36:55,422 --> 00:36:56,411
Then let's try herring next.

675
00:36:56,423 --> 00:36:58,379
Then let's try herring next.

676
00:37:09,602 --> 00:37:10,591
Now that goes very well
with rice balls.

677
00:37:10,603 --> 00:37:11,592
Now that goes very well
with rice balls.

678
00:37:11,604 --> 00:37:13,595
Now that goes very well
with rice balls.

679
00:37:13,773 --> 00:37:14,762
No, it's far better
just by itself.

680
00:37:14,774 --> 00:37:15,763
No, it's far better
just by itself.

681
00:37:15,775 --> 00:37:16,764
No, it's far better
just by itself.

682
00:37:16,776 --> 00:37:18,136
No, it's far better
just by itself.

683
00:37:18,445 --> 00:37:19,434
With rice, you really get
that fishy smell.

684
00:37:19,446 --> 00:37:20,435
With rice, you really get
that fishy smell.

685
00:37:20,447 --> 00:37:21,436
With rice, you really get
that fishy smell.

686
00:37:21,448 --> 00:37:23,128
With rice, you really get
that fishy smell.

687
00:37:34,461 --> 00:37:35,450
Crayfish doesn't do it
for me, either.

688
00:37:35,462 --> 00:37:36,451
Crayfish doesn't do it
for me, either.

689
00:37:36,463 --> 00:37:37,943
Crayfish doesn't do it
for me, either.

690
00:37:38,047 --> 00:37:39,253
No good?

691
00:37:39,382 --> 00:37:41,088
Not with rice, no.

692
00:37:41,217 --> 00:37:42,206
The traditional fillings
are best.

693
00:37:42,218 --> 00:37:43,207
The traditional fillings
are best.

694
00:37:43,219 --> 00:37:44,629
The traditional fillings
are best.

695
00:37:44,804 --> 00:37:45,793
Here, too. Not just in Japan.

696
00:37:45,805 --> 00:37:47,386
Here, too. Not just in Japan.

697
00:38:10,246 --> 00:38:11,486
Can we talk?

698
00:38:13,917 --> 00:38:14,906
Sorry about today.
I was too forward.

699
00:38:14,918 --> 00:38:15,907
Sorry about today.
I was too forward.

700
00:38:15,919 --> 00:38:17,705
Sorry about today.
I was too forward.

701
00:38:17,837 --> 00:38:18,917
Not at all.

702
00:38:19,047 --> 00:38:20,036
We gave it a try,
so all is not wasted.

703
00:38:20,048 --> 00:38:21,037
We gave it a try,
so all is not wasted.

704
00:38:21,049 --> 00:38:22,630
We gave it a try,
so all is not wasted.

705
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:25,249
Will you teach me that?
What is it?

706
00:38:25,261 --> 00:38:26,250
Will you teach me that?
What is it?

707
00:38:26,262 --> 00:38:27,627
Will you teach me that?
What is it?

708
00:38:27,764 --> 00:38:29,004
A squat.

709
00:38:29,349 --> 00:38:30,384
Please.

710
00:38:30,517 --> 00:38:32,098
Sure. Come over here.

711
00:38:37,774 --> 00:38:38,763
First, get totally relaxed.

712
00:38:38,775 --> 00:38:40,515
First, get totally relaxed.

713
00:38:40,693 --> 00:38:41,682
Breathe from the
center of your body.

714
00:38:41,694 --> 00:38:42,683
Breathe from the
center of your body.

715
00:38:42,695 --> 00:38:44,135
Breathe from the
center of your body.

716
00:38:45,615 --> 00:38:46,604
Just below your navel. Ok?

717
00:38:46,616 --> 00:38:48,356
Just below your navel. Ok?

718
00:38:49,118 --> 00:38:50,699
It's difficult.

719
00:38:51,538 --> 00:38:52,527
Nature and your spirit must
become one flowing unit.

720
00:38:52,539 --> 00:38:53,528
Nature and your spirit must
become one flowing unit.

721
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:54,529
Nature and your spirit must
become one flowing unit.

722
00:38:54,541 --> 00:38:56,581
Nature and your spirit must
become one flowing unit.

723
00:38:57,877 --> 00:38:58,866
You must be aware
of your center.

724
00:38:58,878 --> 00:39:00,368
You must be aware
of your center.

725
00:39:00,547 --> 00:39:01,832
My center...

726
00:39:01,965 --> 00:39:03,705
The center of your body.

727
00:39:07,136 --> 00:39:08,216
On the right.

728
00:39:09,389 --> 00:39:10,389
On the left.

729
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:12,380
On the right.

730
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:14,675
Midori.

731
00:39:14,811 --> 00:39:15,800
Let's make
cinnamon rolls tomorrow.

732
00:39:15,812 --> 00:39:17,393
Let's make
cinnamon rolls tomorrow.

733
00:40:45,234 --> 00:40:46,940
What a lovely smell!

734
00:40:47,236 --> 00:40:48,817
Delicious.

735
00:40:54,035 --> 00:40:55,821
Let's try them.

736
00:41:06,339 --> 00:41:07,670
Welcome.

737
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:08,920
Welcome.

00:41:11,427 --> 00:41:12,416

739
00:41:12,428 --> 00:41:13,417
- Coffee and cinnamon rolls.

740
00:41:13,429 --> 00:41:14,949
- Coffee and cinnamon rolls.
- Me, too.

741
00:41:15,014 --> 00:41:16,345
Certainly.

742
00:41:26,109 --> 00:41:27,349
Here you are.

743
00:41:55,221 --> 00:41:57,007
Finally, some customers.

744
00:42:03,312 --> 00:42:04,301
Carnation

745
00:42:04,313 --> 00:42:05,849
carnation

746
00:42:06,649 --> 00:42:07,638
amongst all flowers,
I love the carnation best

747
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:08,639
amongst all flowers,
I love the carnation best

748
00:42:08,651 --> 00:42:09,640
amongst all flowers,
I love the carnation best

749
00:42:09,652 --> 00:42:10,641
amongst all flowers,
I love the carnation best

750
00:42:10,653 --> 00:42:12,564
amongst all flowers,
I love the carnation best

751
00:42:13,239 --> 00:42:14,228
the carnation is my
very favorite flower

752
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:15,229
the carnation is my
very favorite flower

753
00:42:15,241 --> 00:42:16,230
the carnation is my
very favorite flower

754
00:42:16,242 --> 00:42:18,073
the carnation is my
very favorite flower

755
00:43:49,752 --> 00:43:51,617
Can I get another coffee?

756
00:43:51,754 --> 00:43:53,085
Me, too.

757
00:43:53,589 --> 00:43:54,453
Sure.

758
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:55,579
Midori, more coffee here.

759
00:43:55,591 --> 00:43:56,626
Midori, more coffee here.

760
00:44:02,765 --> 00:44:03,845
Thank you.

761
00:44:18,865 --> 00:44:19,650
Hello.

762
00:44:19,782 --> 00:44:20,817
Welcome.

763
00:44:21,117 --> 00:44:22,323
Samurai spirit?

764
00:44:22,451 --> 00:44:23,440
Yes, that's right.

765
00:44:23,452 --> 00:44:24,532
Yes, that's right.

766
00:44:46,559 --> 00:44:47,548
Listen, tommi.

767
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:49,175
Listen, tommi.

768
00:44:49,645 --> 00:44:50,634
Why don't you bring
your friends?

769
00:44:50,646 --> 00:44:51,926
Why don't you bring
your friends?

770
00:44:52,064 --> 00:44:53,349
My friends?

771
00:44:54,066 --> 00:44:55,055
Don't you have any friends?

772
00:44:55,067 --> 00:44:56,352
Don't you have any friends?

773
00:45:00,990 --> 00:45:02,571
I bet you don't.

774
00:45:15,504 --> 00:45:17,369
Sachie, look outside.

775
00:45:33,773 --> 00:45:34,762
She seemed to be angry.

776
00:45:34,774 --> 00:45:36,059
She seemed to be angry.

777
00:46:51,851 --> 00:46:53,466
Ready to serve.

778
00:47:00,359 --> 00:47:01,815
Here you are.

779
00:47:02,028 --> 00:47:03,313
Thank you.

780
00:47:32,892 --> 00:47:34,553
It's that woman again.

781
00:47:45,488 --> 00:47:46,819
There's one more!

782
00:48:10,346 --> 00:48:11,381
Welcome.

783
00:48:11,555 --> 00:48:12,590
Welcome.

784
00:48:28,197 --> 00:48:29,607
Coffee, please.

785
00:48:29,949 --> 00:48:31,064
Certainly.

786
00:48:54,723 --> 00:48:56,429
Here you are.

787
00:48:57,810 --> 00:48:58,810
Well...

788
00:48:58,978 --> 00:48:59,978
Yes?

789
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:02,428
My luggage went missing.

790
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:03,771
My luggage went missing.

791
00:49:05,401 --> 00:49:07,441
I heard that it happens
sometimes when you transfer.

792
00:49:11,824 --> 00:49:12,813
But I never expected it would
happen to me.

793
00:49:12,825 --> 00:49:14,505
But I never expected it would
happen to me.

794
00:49:15,411 --> 00:49:17,322
That was bad luck.

795
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:21,989
But I don't think
it's lost forever.

796
00:49:22,001 --> 00:49:23,662
But I don't think
it's lost forever.

797
00:49:23,836 --> 00:49:24,825
They're sure to locate it.

798
00:49:24,837 --> 00:49:26,122
They're sure to locate it.

799
00:49:26,338 --> 00:49:27,327
Give them a couple of days.

800
00:49:27,339 --> 00:49:29,000
Give them a couple of days.

801
00:49:29,258 --> 00:49:30,998
This is the third day.

802
00:49:33,095 --> 00:49:34,960
Is that right?

803
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:42,509
How long do you plan to stay?

804
00:49:42,521 --> 00:49:44,182
How long do you plan to stay?

805
00:49:45,274 --> 00:49:46,855
I haven't decided.

806
00:49:47,776 --> 00:49:49,516
Aren't you a tourist?

807
00:49:49,778 --> 00:49:50,767
Let me see...

808
00:49:50,779 --> 00:49:51,768
Let me see...

809
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:53,645
Let me see...

810
00:49:54,283 --> 00:49:55,272
I suppose I could be.
But then again, maybe not.

811
00:49:55,284 --> 00:49:56,273
I suppose I could be.
But then again, maybe not.

812
00:49:56,285 --> 00:49:57,274
I suppose I could be.
But then again, maybe not.

813
00:49:57,286 --> 00:49:58,275
I suppose I could be.
But then again, maybe not.

814
00:49:58,287 --> 00:50:00,287
I suppose I could be.
But then again, maybe not.

815
00:50:00,956 --> 00:50:02,696
I haven't decided yet.

816
00:50:17,389 --> 00:50:18,378
I'm enquiring if
my luggage has turned up.

817
00:50:18,390 --> 00:50:19,379
I'm enquiring if
my luggage has turned up.

818
00:50:19,391 --> 00:50:20,380
I'm enquiring if
my luggage has turned up.

819
00:50:20,392 --> 00:50:22,348
I'm enquiring if
my luggage has turned up.

820
00:50:36,909 --> 00:50:38,194
Hello.

821
00:50:38,327 --> 00:50:39,692
Welcome.

822
00:50:46,252 --> 00:50:48,038
Geisha girl?

823
00:50:59,098 --> 00:51:00,087
That's a geisha.
Here's your coffee.

824
00:51:00,099 --> 00:51:01,088
That's a geisha.
Here's your coffee.

825
00:51:01,100 --> 00:51:02,089
That's a geisha.
Here's your coffee.

826
00:51:02,101 --> 00:51:03,328
That's a geisha.
Here's your coffee.

827
00:51:03,352 --> 00:51:04,387
Thanks.

828
00:51:12,695 --> 00:51:13,684
Here she is again.
What does she want?

829
00:51:13,696 --> 00:51:14,685
Here she is again.
What does she want?

830
00:51:14,697 --> 00:51:15,686
Here she is again.
What does she want?

831
00:51:15,698 --> 00:51:17,178
Here she is again.
What does she want?

832
00:51:24,123 --> 00:51:25,112
Why does she have to
stare at us like that?

833
00:51:25,124 --> 00:51:26,113
Why does she have to
stare at us like that?

834
00:51:26,125 --> 00:51:27,769
Why does she have to
stare at us like that?

835
00:51:27,793 --> 00:51:28,782
What is her problem?

836
00:51:28,794 --> 00:51:29,909
What is her problem?

837
00:51:31,297 --> 00:51:32,286
Midori, what's the matter?

838
00:51:32,298 --> 00:51:33,583
Midori, what's the matter?

839
00:51:34,049 --> 00:51:35,630
Nothing at all.

840
00:51:50,733 --> 00:51:51,973
Welcome.

841
00:51:53,319 --> 00:51:55,150
I'm back.

842
00:51:57,156 --> 00:51:58,987
No sign of your luggage yet?

843
00:51:59,158 --> 00:52:00,147
No.
I called them earlier, but no luck.

844
00:52:00,159 --> 00:52:01,148
No.
I called them earlier, but no luck.

845
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:02,680
No.
I called them earlier, but no luck.

846
00:52:06,165 --> 00:52:08,121
Coffee, please.

847
00:52:13,088 --> 00:52:14,077
That's too bad.
All your valuables, I suppose.

848
00:52:14,089 --> 00:52:15,078
That's too bad.
All your valuables, I suppose.

849
00:52:15,090 --> 00:52:16,890
That's too bad.
All your valuables, I suppose.

850
00:52:20,679 --> 00:52:21,668
My valuables?
I wonder if I have such things?

851
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:22,669
My valuables?
I wonder if I have such things?

852
00:52:22,681 --> 00:52:23,670
My valuables?
I wonder if I have such things?

853
00:52:23,682 --> 00:52:24,671
My valuables?
I wonder if I have such things?

854
00:52:24,683 --> 00:52:26,674
My valuables?
I wonder if I have such things?

855
00:52:34,610 --> 00:52:36,020
Here you are.

856
00:52:36,195 --> 00:52:37,526
Thank you.

857
00:52:38,113 --> 00:52:40,024
What about clean clothes?

858
00:52:40,866 --> 00:52:41,855
I have some you can wear.

859
00:52:41,867 --> 00:52:42,982
I have some you can wear.

860
00:52:44,203 --> 00:52:45,192
I'm sorry if I've made
you worry, too.

861
00:52:45,204 --> 00:52:46,193
I'm sorry if I've made
you worry, too.

862
00:52:46,205 --> 00:52:47,194
I'm sorry if I've made
you worry, too.

863
00:52:47,206 --> 00:52:48,686
I'm sorry if I've made
you worry, too.

864
00:52:48,832 --> 00:52:50,197
Not at all.

865
00:52:57,549 --> 00:52:58,914
This is delicious.

866
00:52:59,635 --> 00:53:01,171
Thank you for that.

867
00:53:20,406 --> 00:53:21,395
How come you're running
a diner here?

868
00:53:21,407 --> 00:53:22,396
How come you're running
a diner here?

869
00:53:22,408 --> 00:53:23,898
How come you're running
a diner here?

870
00:53:24,785 --> 00:53:26,776
I just help out.

871
00:53:26,912 --> 00:53:27,992
It's sachie's business.

872
00:53:28,122 --> 00:53:29,111
Well, I'm hoping to meet
good looking men.

873
00:53:29,123 --> 00:53:30,112
Well, I'm hoping to meet
good looking men.

874
00:53:30,124 --> 00:53:31,910
Well, I'm hoping to meet
good looking men.

875
00:53:32,501 --> 00:53:34,037
I'm kidding.

876
00:53:35,921 --> 00:53:36,910
I envy you.
Doing exactly what you want.

877
00:53:36,922 --> 00:53:37,911
I envy you.
Doing exactly what you want.

878
00:53:37,923 --> 00:53:39,663
I envy you.
Doing exactly what you want.

879
00:53:40,759 --> 00:53:41,748
No, I just don't do
what I don't like.

880
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:43,250
No, I just don't do
what I don't like.

881
00:53:53,939 --> 00:53:54,928
I can't keep wearing these clothes,
can I?

882
00:53:54,940 --> 00:53:55,929
I can't keep wearing these clothes,
can I?

883
00:53:55,941 --> 00:53:57,581
I can't keep wearing these clothes,
can I?

884
00:54:12,791 --> 00:54:14,622
I shall go buy some.

885
00:54:15,794 --> 00:54:17,580
Thanks for the coffee.

886
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:20,245
Thank you very much.

887
00:54:25,971 --> 00:54:26,960
Still no sign of my luggage?

888
00:54:26,972 --> 00:54:27,961
Still no sign of my luggage?

889
00:54:27,973 --> 00:54:29,463
Still no sign of my luggage?

890
00:54:51,580 --> 00:54:53,286
- You want one?
- Yes.

891
00:55:01,256 --> 00:55:02,462
Here you are.

892
00:55:02,591 --> 00:55:03,671
Thanks.

893
00:55:13,936 --> 00:55:15,096
Welcome.

894
00:55:15,521 --> 00:55:17,182
Where's that from?

895
00:55:17,856 --> 00:55:18,845
I bought it.
A tad too colorful for me, perhaps?

896
00:55:18,857 --> 00:55:19,846
I bought it.
A tad too colorful for me, perhaps?

897
00:55:19,858 --> 00:55:20,847
I bought it.
A tad too colorful for me, perhaps?

898
00:55:20,859 --> 00:55:22,739
I bought it.
A tad too colorful for me, perhaps?

899
00:55:22,778 --> 00:55:24,689
Not at all. It looks great.

900
00:55:24,947 --> 00:55:26,027
Really?

901
00:55:28,283 --> 00:55:29,989
Want a cinnamon roll?

902
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:31,195
Yes, please.

903
00:55:47,386 --> 00:55:48,671
Here you are.

904
00:56:28,093 --> 00:56:29,424
Welcome.

905
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:36,089
Koskenkorva, please.

906
00:56:36,101 --> 00:56:37,557
Koskenkorva, please.

907
00:56:38,437 --> 00:56:39,768
Certainly.

908
00:57:16,475 --> 00:57:17,464
Sorry, but I can't drink
strong spirits.

909
00:57:17,476 --> 00:57:19,216
Sorry, but I can't drink
strong spirits.

910
00:58:38,056 --> 00:58:39,045
Sorry for all this.

911
00:58:39,057 --> 00:58:40,217
Sorry for all this.

912
00:58:40,726 --> 00:58:41,715
Never mind.
I had no other plans, anyway.

913
00:58:41,727 --> 00:58:42,716
Never mind.
I had no other plans, anyway.

914
00:58:42,728 --> 00:58:44,514
Never mind.
I had no other plans, anyway.

915
00:58:44,813 --> 00:58:46,678
This must be it.

916
00:58:46,815 --> 00:58:47,815
Here?

917
00:59:02,330 --> 00:59:03,695
Get some water.

918
00:59:09,337 --> 00:59:10,918
Ok, I'll go now.

919
00:59:12,591 --> 00:59:13,922
Thank you for that.

920
00:59:22,684 --> 00:59:24,049
Some water.

921
00:59:52,714 --> 00:59:53,703
Very shy, but ever so kind.

922
00:59:53,715 --> 00:59:54,795
Very shy, but ever so kind.

923
00:59:55,884 --> 00:59:56,873
And always so relaxed.

924
00:59:56,885 --> 00:59:58,625
And always so relaxed.

925
00:59:59,387 --> 01:00:00,376
That was my image of
Finnish people.

926
01:00:00,388 --> 01:00:02,299
That was my image of
Finnish people.

927
01:00:04,059 --> 01:00:05,048
But a sad person is sad
in any country.

928
01:00:05,060 --> 01:00:06,049
But a sad person is sad
in any country.

929
01:00:06,061 --> 01:00:07,050
But a sad person is sad
in any country.

930
01:00:07,062 --> 01:00:08,582
But a sad person is sad
in any country.

931
01:00:09,981 --> 01:00:11,596
Of course.

932
01:00:12,984 --> 01:00:13,973
Anywhere you go, sad is sad.

933
01:00:13,985 --> 01:00:15,771
Anywhere you go, sad is sad.

934
01:00:15,904 --> 01:00:16,893
And the lonely ones are lonely.

935
01:00:16,905 --> 01:00:18,145
And the lonely ones are lonely.

936
01:00:21,993 --> 01:00:22,982
When the world ends,
be sure you invite me along.

937
01:00:22,994 --> 01:00:23,983
When the world ends,
be sure you invite me along.

938
01:00:23,995 --> 01:00:24,984
When the world ends,
be sure you invite me along.

939
01:00:24,996 --> 01:00:26,916
When the world ends,
be sure you invite me along.

940
01:00:29,167 --> 01:00:30,156
Your reservation is confirmed.

941
01:00:30,168 --> 01:00:31,368
Your reservation is confirmed.

942
01:00:34,422 --> 01:00:35,411
There's no real reason.

943
01:00:35,423 --> 01:00:37,334
There's no real reason.

944
01:00:37,509 --> 01:00:38,498
I just get so depressed.

945
01:00:38,510 --> 01:00:39,499
I just get so depressed.

946
01:00:39,511 --> 01:00:40,500
I just get so depressed.

947
01:00:40,512 --> 01:00:41,672
I just get so depressed.

948
01:00:42,097 --> 01:00:43,086
All I think is what to do...

949
01:00:43,098 --> 01:00:44,087
All I think is what to do...

950
01:00:44,099 --> 01:00:45,088
All I think is what to do...

951
01:00:45,100 --> 01:00:46,089
All I think is what to do...

952
01:00:46,101 --> 01:00:47,682
All I think is what to do...

953
01:00:48,436 --> 01:00:49,425
Can you understand that?

954
01:00:49,437 --> 01:00:51,018
Can you understand that?

955
01:00:52,274 --> 01:00:53,263
I don't know what to do.

956
01:00:53,275 --> 01:00:55,186
I don't know what to do.

957
01:01:00,532 --> 01:01:01,521
One day her husband told her
he was leaving her.

958
01:01:01,533 --> 01:01:02,522
One day her husband told her
he was leaving her.

959
01:01:02,534 --> 01:01:03,523
One day her husband told her
he was leaving her.

960
01:01:03,535 --> 01:01:04,524
One day her husband told her
he was leaving her.

961
01:01:04,536 --> 01:01:06,416
One day her husband told her
he was leaving her.

962
01:01:07,038 --> 01:01:08,027
She asked why and he said
he just needed to be alone.

963
01:01:08,039 --> 01:01:09,028
She asked why and he said
he just needed to be alone.

964
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:10,029
She asked why and he said
he just needed to be alone.

965
01:01:10,041 --> 01:01:11,030
She asked why and he said
he just needed to be alone.

966
01:01:11,042 --> 01:01:12,603
She asked why and he said
he just needed to be alone.

967
01:01:12,627 --> 01:01:13,616
She doesn't know what
brought it about.

968
01:01:13,628 --> 01:01:14,617
She doesn't know what
brought it about.

969
01:01:14,629 --> 01:01:16,149
She doesn't know what
brought it about.

970
01:01:16,381 --> 01:01:17,370
She doesn't know what
she should do now.

971
01:01:17,382 --> 01:01:18,371
She doesn't know what
she should do now.

972
01:01:18,383 --> 01:01:19,943
She doesn't know what
she should do now.

973
01:01:21,553 --> 01:01:22,884
Is that right?

974
01:01:27,058 --> 01:01:28,047
By the way masako,
do you speak Finnish?

975
01:01:28,059 --> 01:01:30,050
By the way masako,
do you speak Finnish?

976
01:01:31,730 --> 01:01:33,186
No, I don't.

977
01:01:59,174 --> 01:02:00,174
Hello.

978
01:02:00,258 --> 01:02:01,258

Not at all.

993
01:02:49,307 --> 01:02:50,296
I was impressed by your
nursing skills.

994
01:02:50,308 --> 01:02:51,297
I was impressed by your
nursing skills.

995
01:02:51,309 --> 01:02:52,703

Much appreciated.

997
01:02:53,895 --> 01:02:55,635
I was glad to help.

998
01:02:55,814 --> 01:02:57,145
A cup of coffee?

999
01:03:20,297 --> 01:03:21,127
Here you are.

1000
01:03:21,256 --> 01:03:22,666
Thank you.

1001
01:03:26,177 --> 01:03:27,166
Did you work in
health care back in Japan?

1002
01:03:27,178 --> 01:03:28,167
Did you work in
health care back in Japan?

1003
01:03:28,179 --> 01:03:30,170
Did you work in
health care back in Japan?

1004
01:03:30,432 --> 01:03:31,421
No, but my parents
were chronically ill.

1005
01:03:31,433 --> 01:03:32,422
No, but my parents
were chronically ill.

1006
01:03:32,434 --> 01:03:34,015
No, but my parents
were chronically ill.

1007
01:03:34,185 --> 01:03:35,174
I was their full-time nurse.

1008
01:03:35,186 --> 01:03:36,346
I was their full-time nurse.

1009
01:03:36,896 --> 01:03:38,852
I see.

1010
01:03:39,190 --> 01:03:40,179
Then I lost my mother
two years ago.

1011
01:03:40,191 --> 01:03:41,180
Then I lost my mother
two years ago.

1012
01:03:41,192 --> 01:03:42,461
Then I lost my mother
two years ago.

1013
01:03:42,485 --> 01:03:43,474
And my father died last year.

1014
01:03:43,486 --> 01:03:44,475
And my father died last year.

1015
01:03:44,487 --> 01:03:45,647
And my father died last year.

1016
01:03:46,281 --> 01:03:48,146
How can I put it?

1017
01:03:48,283 --> 01:03:49,272
After 20 years I was freed
from my burden.

1018
01:03:49,284 --> 01:03:50,273
After 20 years I was freed
from my burden.

1019
01:03:50,285 --> 01:03:52,025
After 20 years I was freed
from my burden.

1020
01:03:52,454 --> 01:03:53,443
That must have been
very trying for you.

1021
01:03:53,455 --> 01:03:54,444
That must have been
very trying for you.

1022
01:03:54,456 --> 01:03:56,162
That must have been
very trying for you.

1023
01:03:58,543 --> 01:03:59,532
I was changing dad's
diaper one day,

1024
01:03:59,544 --> 01:04:00,944
I was changing dad's
diaper one day,

1025
01:04:01,046 --> 01:04:02,035
while Finland was on the TV.

1026
01:04:02,047 --> 01:04:03,708
While Finland was on the TV.

1027
01:04:04,299 --> 01:04:05,709
On the news?

1028
01:04:06,134 --> 01:04:07,123
Yes, an air-guitar contest.

1029
01:04:07,135 --> 01:04:08,545
Yes, an air-guitar contest.

1030
01:04:10,138 --> 01:04:11,127
I was really impressed.

1031
01:04:11,139 --> 01:04:12,379
I was really impressed.

1032
01:04:12,807 --> 01:04:13,796
What's an air-guitar contest?

1033
01:04:13,808 --> 01:04:14,797
What's an air-guitar contest?

1034
01:04:14,809 --> 01:04:16,015
What's an air-guitar contest?

1035
01:04:17,145 --> 01:04:18,134
Contestants pretend they're
playing imaginary guitars.

1036
01:04:18,146 --> 01:04:19,135
Contestants pretend they're
playing imaginary guitars.

1039
01:04:22,150 --> 01:04:23,139
One becomes the champion.

1040
01:04:23,151 --> 01:04:24,231
One becomes the champion.

1041
01:04:26,488 --> 01:04:27,477
And a "carry the wife" race.

1042
01:04:27,489 --> 01:04:28,609
And a "carry the wife" race.

1043
01:04:28,740 --> 01:04:29,729
Cell phone throwing
and sauna endurance contests.

1044
01:04:29,741 --> 01:04:30,730
Cell phone throwing
and sauna endurance contests.

1045
01:04:30,742 --> 01:04:32,662
Cell phone throwing

1046
01:04:34,329 --> 01:04:35,318
I was so impressed that people
took such stupid games so seriously.

1047
01:04:35,330 --> 01:04:36,319
I was so impressed that people
took such stupid games so seriously.

1050
01:04:38,333 --> 01:04:40,728
I was so impressed that people
took such stupid games so seriously.

1051
01:04:40,752 --> 01:04:42,112
They all looked to be so carefree.

1052
01:04:45,423 --> 01:04:46,412
Free from the
bonds of this world.

1053
01:04:46,424 --> 01:04:47,755
Free from the
bonds of this world.

1054
01:04:48,927 --> 01:04:49,916
They all looked so calm
and peaceful.

1055
01:04:49,928 --> 01:04:50,917

1057
01:04:54,682 --> 01:04:55,671
That's why I came.

1058
01:04:55,683 --> 01:04:57,093
That's why I came.

1059
01:04:57,352 --> 01:04:58,341
No other purpose.

1060
01:04:58,353 --> 01:04:59,593
No other purpose.

1061
01:05:02,690 --> 01:05:03,679
Masako, just take it easy
and do nothing while you're here.

1062
01:05:03,691 --> 01:05:04,680
Masako, just take it easy
and do nothing while you're here.

1063
01:05:04,692 --> 01:05:05,681
Masako, just take it easy

1064
01:05:05,693 --> 01:05:08,013
Masako, just take it easy
and do nothing while you're here.

1065
01:05:13,118 --> 01:05:14,107
But actually, it's difficult
to just do nothing at all.

1066
01:05:14,119 --> 01:05:15,108
But actually, it's difficult
to just do nothing at all.

1067
01:05:15,120 --> 01:05:16,109
But actually, it's difficult
to just do nothing at all.

1068
01:05:16,121 --> 01:05:17,110
But actually, it's difficult
to just do nothing at all.

1069
01:05:17,122 --> 01:05:18,111
But actually, it's difficult
to just do nothing at all.

1070
01:05:18,123 --> 01:05:20,283
But actually, it's difficult
to just do nothing at all.

1071
01:05:21,209 --> 01:05:22,198
It sure is.
We tend to get distracted.

1072
01:05:22,210 --> 01:05:23,199
It sure is.
We tend to get distracted.

1073
01:05:23,211 --> 01:05:24,792
It sure is.
We tend to get distracted.

1074
01:05:26,965 --> 01:05:27,954
Then why are the Finns so
calm and laid back?

1075
01:05:27,966 --> 01:05:28,955
Then why are the Finns so
calm and laid back?

1076
01:05:28,967 --> 01:05:29,956
Then why are the Finns so
calm and laid back?

1077
01:05:29,968 --> 01:05:30,957
Then why are the Finns so
calm and laid back?

1078
01:05:30,969 --> 01:05:31,958
Then why are the Finns so
calm and laid back?

1079
01:05:31,970 --> 01:05:32,959
Then why are the Finns so
calm and laid back?

1080
01:05:32,971 --> 01:05:34,731
Then why are the Finns so
calm and laid back?

1081
01:05:35,557 --> 01:05:37,468
I wonder.

1082
01:05:38,226 --> 01:05:39,466
The forests.

1083
01:05:42,564 --> 01:05:43,564
Forests?

1084
01:05:44,232 --> 01:05:46,223
We have our forests.

1085
01:06:09,757 --> 01:06:11,668
I shall go to the forest.

1086
01:06:12,760 --> 01:06:14,671
Thanks for the coffee.

1087
01:08:00,451 --> 01:08:02,112
Ready to go.

1088
01:08:08,209 --> 01:08:10,120
Here you are.

1089
01:08:14,966 --> 01:08:16,297
Please.

1090
01:08:46,331 --> 01:08:47,992
- Hello.

1091
01:08:48,249 --> 01:08:49,249
Welcome.

1092
01:08:49,334 --> 01:08:50,334
Hi there.

1093
01:08:51,085 --> 01:08:52,825
How was the forest?

1094
01:08:53,838 --> 01:08:55,169
I enjoyed it.

1095
01:08:58,843 --> 01:09:00,458
Did you get mushrooms?

1096
01:09:00,595 --> 01:09:01,675
Yes, I did.

1097
01:09:04,682 --> 01:09:05,671
I got lots of mushrooms.

1098
01:09:05,683 --> 01:09:07,139
I got lots of mushrooms.

1099
01:09:08,853 --> 01:09:10,684
But I lost them all.

1100
01:09:11,105 --> 01:09:12,345
You lost them?

1101
01:09:12,940 --> 01:09:13,929
They disappeared before I knew it.

1102
01:09:13,941 --> 01:09:15,522
They disappeared before I knew it.

1103
01:09:16,527 --> 01:09:18,358
I see.

1104
01:09:19,530 --> 01:09:21,521
Want something to eat?

1105
01:09:21,866 --> 01:09:22,855
Yes, I'll have rice balls.

1106
01:09:22,867 --> 01:09:24,823
Yes, I'll have rice balls.

1107
01:09:25,536 --> 01:09:26,525
Sachie, rice balls please.

1108
01:09:26,537 --> 01:09:28,198
Sachie, rice balls please.

1109
01:09:28,623 --> 01:09:29,863
Certainly.

Thank you.

1111
01:11:09,056 --> 01:11:10,796
Thank you very much.

1112
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:13,640
I enjoyed the food.

1113
01:11:13,811 --> 01:11:14,971
Me, too.

1114
01:11:35,500 --> 01:11:36,580
Welcome.

1115
01:11:38,252 --> 01:11:39,241
Sorry about the other day.

1116
01:11:39,253 --> 01:11:40,834
Sorry about the other day.

1117
01:11:41,672 --> 01:11:43,003
Are you ok now?

1118
01:11:43,257 --> 01:11:44,246
Much better, thank you.

1119
01:11:44,258 --> 01:11:45,668
Much better, thank you.

1120
01:11:47,094 --> 01:11:48,083

1124
01:12:00,942 --> 01:12:01,931
You're here, too?

1125
01:12:01,943 --> 01:12:03,023
You're here, too?

1126
01:12:06,113 --> 01:12:07,102
Yes, I'm helping out.

1127
01:12:07,114 --> 01:12:09,025
Yes, I'm helping out.

1128
01:12:09,450 --> 01:12:10,986
I see.

1129
01:12:14,038 --> 01:12:15,027
Make yourself at home.

1130
01:12:15,039 --> 01:12:16,245
Make yourself at home.

1131
01:12:23,339 --> 01:12:24,328
I have something to ask you.

1132
01:12:24,340 --> 01:12:26,080
I have something to ask you.

1133
01:12:26,217 --> 01:12:27,377
Yes, what is it?

1134
01:12:27,510 --> 01:12:28,499
Do you cast spells in Japan?

1135
01:12:28,511 --> 01:12:30,092
Do you cast spells in Japan?

1136
01:12:30,513 --> 01:12:31,593
Spells?

1137
01:12:31,722 --> 01:12:32,711
Yes, a way of cursing someone.

1138
01:12:32,723 --> 01:12:33,712
Yes, a way of cursing someone.

1139
01:12:33,724 --> 01:12:34,713
Yes, a way of cursing someone.

1140
01:12:34,725 --> 01:12:36,215
Yes, a way of cursing someone.

1141
01:12:37,854 --> 01:12:38,843
She's asking about curses.

1142
01:12:38,855 --> 01:12:40,391
She's asking about curses.

1143
01:12:40,565 --> 01:12:41,771
Curses?

1144
01:12:42,191 --> 01:12:43,180
Nails in a straw dummy?

1145
01:12:43,192 --> 01:12:44,432
Nails in a straw dummy?

1146
01:12:47,530 --> 01:12:48,519
Make a dummy and pretend
it's someone you want to curse.

1147
01:12:48,531 --> 01:12:49,520
Make a dummy and pretend
it's someone you want to curse.

1148
01:12:49,532 --> 01:12:50,521
Make a dummy and pretend
it's someone you want to curse.

1149
01:12:50,533 --> 01:12:51,522
Make a dummy and pretend
it's someone you want to curse.

1150
01:12:51,534 --> 01:12:52,719
Make a dummy and pretend
it's someone you want to curse.

1151
01:12:52,743 --> 01:12:53,732
Then stab it with a
long, fat nail, or needle.

1152
01:12:53,744 --> 01:12:54,733
Then stab it with a
long, fat nail, or needle.

1153
01:12:54,745 --> 01:12:55,734

1154
01:12:55,746 --> 01:12:56,735
Then stab it with a
long, fat nail, or needle.

1155
01:12:56,747 --> 01:12:58,350
Then stab it with a
long, fat nail, or needle.

1156
01:12:58,374 --> 01:12:59,363
It's an old, traditional curse.

1157
01:12:59,375 --> 01:13:00,364
It's an old, traditional curse.

1158
01:13:00,376 --> 01:13:01,786
It's an old, traditional curse.

1159
01:13:04,046 --> 01:13:05,035
Have you ever tried it?

1160
01:13:05,047 --> 01:13:06,412
Have you ever tried it?

1161
01:13:06,549 --> 01:13:07,959
No, never.

1162
01:13:08,092 --> 01:13:09,081
No one does it, right?

1163
01:13:09,093 --> 01:13:10,629
No one does it, right?

1164
01:14:03,064 --> 01:14:04,053
Closed

1165
01:14:04,065 --> 01:14:05,054
closed

1166
01:14:05,066 --> 01:14:06,397
closed

1167
01:14:56,534 --> 01:14:58,070
My little kukka.

1168
01:14:59,203 --> 01:15:00,192
She died just after
my husband left me.

1169
01:15:00,204 --> 01:15:01,193
She died just after
my husband left me.

1170
01:15:01,205 --> 01:15:02,866
She died just after
my husband left me.

1171
01:15:03,541 --> 01:15:05,247
She so looked like...

1172
01:15:05,543 --> 01:15:06,578
Like what?

1173
01:15:07,003 --> 01:15:08,209
Like you.

1174
01:15:09,005 --> 01:15:09,994
Every time I saw you working
at the diner,

1175
01:15:10,006 --> 01:15:10,995
every time I saw you working
at the diner,

1176
01:15:11,007 --> 01:15:12,647
every time I saw you working
at the diner,

1177
01:15:12,675 --> 01:15:13,664
I thought about my dog.

1178
01:15:13,676 --> 01:15:15,041
I thought about my dog.

1179
01:15:15,177 --> 01:15:16,417
I see.

1180
01:15:18,055 --> 01:15:19,044
But I must pull myself together.

1181
01:15:19,056 --> 01:15:20,045
But I must pull myself together.

1182
01:15:20,057 --> 01:15:21,337
But I must pull myself together.

1183
01:15:24,228 --> 01:15:25,217
That diner suits you very well.

1184
01:15:25,229 --> 01:15:26,218
That diner suits you very well.

1185
01:15:26,230 --> 01:15:27,561
That diner suits you very well.

1186
01:15:35,448 --> 01:15:36,437
Let's take a sauna later.

1187
01:15:36,449 --> 01:15:37,609
Let's take a sauna later.

1188
01:15:38,576 --> 01:15:39,565
Want to go to a sauna?

1189
01:15:39,577 --> 01:15:40,612
Want to go to a sauna?

1190
01:15:41,746 --> 01:15:43,577
Sauna?

1191
01:15:50,046 --> 01:15:51,035
Masako is really tough.

1192
01:15:51,047 --> 01:15:52,253
Masako is really tough.

1193
01:15:53,591 --> 01:15:54,580
Over 20 minutes
in that sauna is a miracle.

1194
01:15:54,592 --> 01:15:55,581
Over 20 minutes
in that sauna is a miracle.

1195
01:15:55,593 --> 01:15:56,903
Over 20 minutes
in that sauna is a miracle.

1196
01:15:56,927 --> 01:15:57,916
You can enter the sauna
contest next year.

1197
01:15:57,928 --> 01:15:58,917
You can enter the sauna
contest next year.

1198
01:15:58,929 --> 01:16:00,569
You can enter the sauna
contest next year.

1199
01:16:01,724 --> 01:16:02,713
She says you should enter.

1200
01:16:02,725 --> 01:16:04,215
She says you should enter.

1201
01:16:04,393 --> 01:16:05,382
I was thinking about
the air guitar contest.

1202
01:16:05,394 --> 01:16:06,383
I was thinking about
the air guitar contest.

1203
01:16:06,395 --> 01:16:07,581
I was thinking about
the air guitar contest.

1204
01:16:07,605 --> 01:16:09,095
You? Really?

1205
01:16:09,231 --> 01:16:10,471
Shouldn't 1?

1206
01:16:10,733 --> 01:16:11,722
You'd make a cool air guitarist.

1207
01:16:11,734 --> 01:16:13,014
You'd make a cool air guitarist.

1208
01:16:14,570 --> 01:16:16,481
Maybe I'll try, too.

1209
01:16:24,872 --> 01:16:26,157
It's open.

1210
01:17:13,337 --> 01:17:14,827
You...?

1211
01:17:24,974 --> 01:17:25,963
He used to run a shop here.

1212
01:17:25,975 --> 01:17:27,681
He used to run a shop here.

1213
01:17:27,810 --> 01:17:29,391
He made great coffee.

1214
01:17:31,021 --> 01:17:32,010
You only came for what is yours.

1215
01:17:32,022 --> 01:17:33,011
You only came for what is yours.

1216
01:17:33,023 --> 01:17:34,292
You only came for what is yours.

1217
01:17:34,316 --> 01:17:35,305
But why sneak in like a thief?

1218
01:17:35,317 --> 01:17:36,306
But why sneak in like a thief?

1219
01:17:36,318 --> 01:17:37,558
But why sneak in like a thief?

1220
01:17:40,656 --> 01:17:41,645
How are your wife and
daughter doing?

1221
01:17:41,657 --> 01:17:42,646
How are your wife and
daughter doing?

1222
01:17:42,658 --> 01:17:43,647
How are your wife and
daughter doing?

1223
01:17:43,659 --> 01:17:45,570
How are your wife and
daughter doing?

1224
01:17:56,172 --> 01:17:57,161
Everyone has problems.

1225
01:17:57,173 --> 01:17:58,162
Everyone has problems.

1226
01:17:58,174 --> 01:17:59,414
Everyone has problems.

1227
01:18:05,181 --> 01:18:06,546
I'm hungry.

1228
01:18:45,763 --> 01:18:47,253
What's that?

1229
01:18:49,266 --> 01:18:50,266
It's a rice ball.

1230
01:18:50,434 --> 01:18:51,423
Japanese soul food.

1231
01:18:51,435 --> 01:18:52,470
Japanese soul food.

1232
01:19:11,580 --> 01:19:12,569
Make sure to take back
what is yours.

1233
01:19:12,581 --> 01:19:13,570
Make sure to take back
what is yours.

1234
01:19:13,582 --> 01:19:15,022
Make sure to take back
what is yours.

1235
01:19:31,433 --> 01:19:32,673
I partake.

1236
01:19:32,935 --> 01:19:34,175
I partake.

1237
01:19:37,940 --> 01:19:39,350
I partake.

1238
01:21:55,077 --> 01:21:56,066
Have you heard of the
"phantom of the coffee?"

1239
01:21:56,078 --> 01:21:57,067
Have you heard of the
"phantom of the coffee?"

1240
01:21:57,079 --> 01:21:58,944
Have you heard of the
"phantom of the coffee?"

1241
01:21:59,289 --> 01:22:00,278
"Phantom of the coffee?"

1242
01:22:00,290 --> 01:22:01,655
"Phantom of the coffee?"

1243
01:22:03,627 --> 01:22:04,616
A small animal called a luak.

1244
01:22:04,628 --> 01:22:05,993
A small animal called a luak.

1245
01:22:06,130 --> 01:22:07,119
They choose to eat only
the sweetest coffee beans.

1246
01:22:07,131 --> 01:22:08,120
They choose to eat only
the sweetest coffee beans.

1247
01:22:08,132 --> 01:22:09,121
They choose to eat only
the sweetest coffee beans.

1248
01:22:09,133 --> 01:22:10,610
They choose to eat only
the sweetest coffee beans.

1249
01:22:10,634 --> 01:22:11,623
The beans are refined in their
stomachs and then excreted.

1250
01:22:11,635 --> 01:22:12,624
The beans are refined in their
stomachs and then excreted.

1251
01:22:12,636 --> 01:22:13,625
The beans are refined in their
stomachs and then excreted.

1252
01:22:13,637 --> 01:22:15,365
The beans are refined in their
stomachs and then excreted.

1253
01:22:15,389 --> 01:22:17,300
They make the best coffee beans.

1254
01:22:18,809 --> 01:22:19,798
But many luaks were caught
and they're rare now.

1255
01:22:19,810 --> 01:22:20,799
But many luaks were caught
and they're rare now.

1256
01:22:20,811 --> 01:22:22,455
But many luaks were caught
and they're rare now.

1257
01:22:22,479 --> 01:22:23,468
They're the
"phantom of the coffee."

1258
01:22:23,480 --> 01:22:25,311
They're the
"phantom of the coffee."

1259
01:22:27,317 --> 01:22:28,306
I got some of those
precious beans from matti.

1260
01:22:28,318 --> 01:22:29,307
I got some of those
precious beans from matti.

1261
01:22:29,319 --> 01:22:30,308
I got some of those
precious beans from matti.

1262
01:22:30,320 --> 01:22:31,309
I got some of those
precious beans from matti.

1263
01:22:31,321 --> 01:22:32,310
I got some of those
precious beans from matti.

1264
01:22:32,322 --> 01:22:33,311
I got some of those
precious beans from matti.

1265
01:22:33,323 --> 01:22:35,123
I got some of those
precious beans from matti.

1266
01:22:35,159 --> 01:22:36,148
Matti? You mean the thief?

1267
01:22:36,160 --> 01:22:37,149
Matti? You mean the thief?

1268
01:22:37,161 --> 01:22:38,150
Matti? You mean the thief?

1269
01:22:38,162 --> 01:22:39,202
Matti? You mean the thief?

1270
01:22:41,498 --> 01:22:43,159
Let's try some.

1271
01:22:43,292 --> 01:22:44,532
Okay.

1272
01:23:02,519 --> 01:23:04,180
"Kopi luak.”

1273
01:23:05,189 --> 01:23:06,679
What's that?

1274
01:23:07,357 --> 01:23:08,346
A charm to make it taste better.

1275
01:23:08,358 --> 01:23:09,723
A charm to make it taste better.

1276
01:23:21,872 --> 01:23:22,861
What a beautiful fragrance.

1277
01:23:22,873 --> 01:23:24,534
What a beautiful fragrance.

1278
01:23:53,195 --> 01:23:54,605
You want coffee?

1279
01:23:54,738 --> 01:23:56,399
Thank you.

1280
01:24:15,717 --> 01:24:16,706
It really is delicious.

1281
01:24:16,718 --> 01:24:17,753
It really is delicious.

1282
01:24:18,762 --> 01:24:20,127
It's great.

1283
01:24:28,063 --> 01:24:29,052
I've long wanted to ask you.

1284
01:24:29,064 --> 01:24:30,270
I've long wanted to ask you.

1285
01:24:30,399 --> 01:24:31,605
Ask me what?

1286
01:24:31,900 --> 01:24:32,889
Why choose rice balls
as your main dish?

1287
01:24:32,901 --> 01:24:33,890
Why choose rice balls
as your main dish?

1288
01:24:33,902 --> 01:24:35,462
Why choose rice balls
as your main dish?

1289
01:24:36,280 --> 01:24:37,269
Because rice balls are
the Japanese soul food.

1290
01:24:37,281 --> 01:24:38,270
Because rice balls are
the Japanese soul food.

1291
01:24:38,282 --> 01:24:39,271
Because rice balls are
the Japanese soul food.

1292
01:24:39,283 --> 01:24:41,083
Because rice balls are
the Japanese soul food.

1293
01:24:47,624 --> 01:24:48,613
I lost my mom early on,
so I looked after the house.

1294
01:24:48,625 --> 01:24:49,614
I lost my mom early on,
so I looked after the house.

1295
01:24:49,626 --> 01:24:50,615
I lost my mom early on,
so I looked after the house.

1296
01:24:50,627 --> 01:24:51,771
I lost my mom early on,
so I looked after the house.

1297
01:24:51,795 --> 01:24:52,784
My dad made rice balls
twice a year for me.

1298
01:24:52,796 --> 01:24:53,785
My dad made rice balls
twice a year for me.

1299
01:24:53,797 --> 01:24:55,628
My dad made rice balls
twice a year for me.

1300
01:24:56,633 --> 01:24:57,633
Why twice?

1301
01:24:59,136 --> 01:25:00,125
On sports' day
and school excursions.

1302
01:25:00,137 --> 01:25:01,577
On sports' day
and school excursions.

1303
01:25:02,806 --> 01:25:03,795
He said they always taste better
when someone else makes them.

1304
01:25:03,807 --> 01:25:04,796
He said they always taste better
when someone else makes them.

1305
01:25:04,808 --> 01:25:05,797
He said they always taste better
when someone else makes them.

1306
01:25:05,809 --> 01:25:06,798
He said they always taste better
when someone else makes them.

1307
01:25:06,810 --> 01:25:09,250
He said they always taste better
when someone else makes them.

1308
01:25:09,313 --> 01:25:10,974
He never made anything else.

1309
01:25:11,148 --> 01:25:12,137
No pretty lunches like
all my friends.

1310
01:25:12,149 --> 01:25:13,138
No pretty lunches like
all my friends.

1311
01:25:13,150 --> 01:25:14,460
No pretty lunches like
all my friends.

1312
01:25:14,484 --> 01:25:15,473
Just salmon, plum
and bonito rice balls.

1313
01:25:15,485 --> 01:25:16,474
Just salmon, plum
and bonito rice balls.

1314
01:25:16,486 --> 01:25:18,046
Just salmon, plum
and bonito rice balls.

1315
01:25:19,114 --> 01:25:20,103
They were huge and badly shaped.

1316
01:25:20,115 --> 01:25:21,104
They were huge and badly shaped.

1317
01:25:21,116 --> 01:25:22,396
They were huge and badly shaped.

1318
01:25:22,826 --> 01:25:23,815
But they were so delicious.

1319
01:25:23,827 --> 01:25:25,158
But they were so delicious.

1320
01:25:44,306 --> 01:25:45,295
Still no sign of my luggage?

1321
01:25:45,307 --> 01:25:46,296
Still no sign of my luggage?

1322
01:25:46,308 --> 01:25:47,297
Still no sign of my luggage?

1323
01:25:47,309 --> 01:25:48,674
Still no sign of my luggage?

1324
01:25:55,025 --> 01:25:56,025
What?

1325
01:26:11,875 --> 01:26:12,910
Good morning.

1326
01:26:13,043 --> 01:26:14,374
Good morning.

1327
01:26:18,382 --> 01:26:20,043
They found it.

1328
01:26:22,219 --> 01:26:23,208
My luggage finally turned up.

1329
01:26:23,220 --> 01:26:25,211
My luggage finally turned up.

1330
01:26:26,848 --> 01:26:27,837
So maybe it's time for me
to go back to Japan.

1331
01:26:27,849 --> 01:26:28,838
So maybe it's time for me
to go back to Japan.

1332
01:26:28,850 --> 01:26:30,841
So maybe it's time for me
to go back to Japan.

1333
01:27:05,095 --> 01:27:06,756
Ever heard this?

1334
01:27:08,765 --> 01:27:09,754
"Hattivatit" needs electricity to live.

1335
01:27:09,766 --> 01:27:10,755
"Hattivatit" needs electricity to live.

1336
01:27:10,767 --> 01:27:11,756
"Hattivatit" needs electricity to live.

1337
01:27:11,768 --> 01:27:13,328
"Hattivatit" needs electricity to live.

1338
01:27:16,273 --> 01:27:18,264
You didn't know, right?

1339
01:27:18,942 --> 01:27:20,478
Electricity, eh?

1340
01:27:22,279 --> 01:27:23,268
There's so much we
never get to learn.

1341
01:27:23,280 --> 01:27:24,269
There's so much we
never get to learn.

1342
01:27:24,281 --> 01:27:25,270
There's so much we
never get to learn.

1343
01:27:25,282 --> 01:27:26,988
There's so much we
never get to learn.

1344
01:27:28,285 --> 01:27:29,274
All creatures need something
to live on.

1345
01:27:29,286 --> 01:27:30,275
All creatures need something
to live on.

1346
01:27:30,287 --> 01:27:31,847
All creatures need something
to live on.

1347
01:27:36,460 --> 01:27:37,449
Will masako go back to Japan?

1348
01:27:37,461 --> 01:27:39,122
Will masako go back to Japan?

1349
01:27:41,590 --> 01:27:42,579
That's totally up to her.

1350
01:27:42,591 --> 01:27:44,172
That's totally up to her.

1351
01:27:45,469 --> 01:27:46,458
Either way,
we should be happy for her.

1352
01:27:46,470 --> 01:27:47,459
Either way,
we should be happy for her.

1353
01:27:47,471 --> 01:27:48,460
Either way,
we should be happy for her.

1354
01:27:48,472 --> 01:27:49,461
Either way,
we should be happy for her.

1355
01:27:49,473 --> 01:27:50,993
Either way,
we should be happy for her.

1356
01:27:51,641 --> 01:27:53,347
I agree.

1357
01:28:08,492 --> 01:28:09,481
Look, this may sound strange.

1358
01:28:09,493 --> 01:28:10,482
Look, this may sound strange.

1359
01:28:10,494 --> 01:28:11,483
Look, this may sound strange.

1360
01:28:11,495 --> 01:28:13,360
Look, this may sound strange.

1361
01:28:13,497 --> 01:28:14,532
What?

1362
01:28:16,500 --> 01:28:17,489
If I decided to go back to Japan,

1363
01:28:17,501 --> 01:28:18,991
if I decided to go back to Japan,

1364
01:28:19,336 --> 01:28:21,327
would you miss me?

1365
01:28:22,839 --> 01:28:23,874
Are you going?

1366
01:28:24,007 --> 01:28:25,497
No, only if I did.

1367
01:28:28,011 --> 01:28:29,000
I wonder.

1368
01:28:29,012 --> 01:28:30,218
I wonder.

1369
01:28:30,639 --> 01:28:31,628
I've been by myself
from the beginning.

1370
01:28:31,640 --> 01:28:33,160
I've been by myself
from the beginning.

1371
01:28:33,266 --> 01:28:34,255
You have your own life.

1372
01:28:34,267 --> 01:28:35,677
You have your own life.

1373
01:28:37,020 --> 01:28:38,760
So you wouldn't miss me?

1374
01:28:38,897 --> 01:28:40,762
I didn't say that.

1375
01:28:41,191 --> 01:28:43,022
So you won't miss me?

1376
01:28:43,151 --> 01:28:44,766
Of course I'd miss you.

1377
01:28:44,903 --> 01:28:46,188
That's enough.

1378
01:28:49,699 --> 01:28:50,688
But, eventually,
everything must change.

1379
01:28:50,700 --> 01:28:51,689
But, eventually,
everything must change.

1380
01:28:51,701 --> 01:28:53,261
But, eventually,
everything must change.

1381
01:28:55,872 --> 01:28:56,861
Everyone will change.

1382
01:28:56,873 --> 01:28:58,409
Everyone will change.

1383
01:29:00,043 --> 01:29:01,032
I hope it's for the better.

1384
01:29:01,044 --> 01:29:02,534
I hope it's for the better.

1385
01:29:04,673 --> 01:29:05,662
Everything will work out.
Perhaps.

1386
01:29:05,674 --> 01:29:06,663
Everything will work out.
Perhaps.

1387
01:29:06,675 --> 01:29:07,995
Everything will work out.
Perhaps.

1388
01:29:09,803 --> 01:29:11,259
I hope so, too.

1389
01:30:17,287 --> 01:30:18,276
Something's wrong
with my luggage.

1390
01:30:18,288 --> 01:30:19,277
Something's wrong
with my luggage.

1391
01:30:19,289 --> 01:30:20,278
Something's wrong
with my luggage.

1392
01:30:20,290 --> 01:30:22,121
Something's wrong
with my luggage.

1393
01:30:23,460 --> 01:30:24,666
Yes...

1394
01:30:27,297 --> 01:30:28,286
Well, there's no doubt that
it's my luggage, no.

1395
01:30:28,298 --> 01:30:29,287
Well, there's no doubt that
it's my luggage, no.

1396
01:30:29,299 --> 01:30:30,288
Well, there's no doubt that
it's my luggage, no.

1397
01:30:30,300 --> 01:30:32,300
Well, there's no doubt that
it's my luggage, no.

1398
01:30:32,969 --> 01:30:33,958
But somehow,
something is very different.

1399
01:30:33,970 --> 01:30:34,959
But somehow,
something is very different.

1400
01:30:34,971 --> 01:30:35,960
But somehow,
something is very different.

1401
01:30:35,972 --> 01:30:37,572
But somehow,
something is very different.

1402
01:31:28,358 --> 01:31:29,848
What's up?

1403
01:31:32,028 --> 01:31:33,017
A strange man gave me a cat.
So now I can't go home.

1404
01:31:33,029 --> 01:31:34,018
A strange man gave me a cat.
So now I can't go home.

1405
01:31:34,030 --> 01:31:35,019
A strange man gave me a cat.
So now I can't go home.

1406
01:31:35,031 --> 01:31:37,071
A strange man gave me a cat.
So now I can't go home.

1407
01:31:37,993 --> 01:31:38,982
I think I'll stay here
for a while longer.

1408
01:31:38,994 --> 01:31:39,983
I think I'll stay here
for a while longer.

1409
01:31:39,995 --> 01:31:41,701
I think I'll stay here
for a while longer.

1410
01:31:42,330 --> 01:31:43,319
Can I continue to help out here?

1411
01:31:43,331 --> 01:31:44,320
Can I continue to help out here?

1412
01:31:44,332 --> 01:31:46,243

Hello.

1431
01:34:07,267 --> 01:34:09,053
You look pretty today.

1432
01:34:12,480 --> 01:34:13,469
My husband suddenly turned up.

1433
01:34:13,481 --> 01:34:14,667
My husband suddenly turned up.

1434
01:34:14,691 --> 01:34:15,680
He couldn't live without me
after all.

1435
01:34:15,692 --> 01:34:16,681

01:35:50,620 --> 01:35:52,531

01:35:52,664 --> 01:35:54,620
Is full at last

1445
01:36:28,950 --> 01:36:30,315
Did you notice?

1446
01:36:32,328 --> 01:36:33,317
Masako bows far too politely,
doesn't she?

1447
01:36:33,329 --> 01:36:34,318
Masako bows far too politely,
doesn't she?

1448
01:36:34,330 --> 01:36:35,319

Let me show you how.

1451
01:36:45,508 --> 01:36:47,169
Welcome.

1452
01:36:47,302 --> 01:36:48,382
See?

1453
01:36:50,138 --> 01:36:51,548
Is that too polite?

1454
01:36:51,681 --> 01:36:52,670
No. Being polite is good.

1455
01:36:52,682 --> 01:36:54,013
No. Being polite is good.

1456
01:36:54,809 --> 01:36:55,798
But midori's bow is
way too rough.

1457
01:36:55,810 --> 01:36:56,799
But midori's bow is
way too rough.

1458
01:36:56,811 --> 01:36:57,800
But midori's bow is

1460
01:36:59,188 --> 01:37:00,894

1462
01:37:05,862 --> 01:37:07,022

1463
01:37:07,864 --> 01:37:09,855
See? What do you think?

1464
01:37:09,991 --> 01:37:10,980
It's alright. It suits her.

1465
01:37:10,992 --> 01:37:12,232
It's alright. It suits her.

1466
01:37:13,536 --> 01:37:14,525

1471
01:37:20,835 --> 01:37:22,575
Indeed, it is.

1472
01:37:22,712 --> 01:37:23,701
Your "welcome" is excellent.

1473
