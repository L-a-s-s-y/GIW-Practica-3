1
00:00:43,461 --> 00:00:46,797
In India,
to honor guests on special occasions...

2
00:00:46,881 --> 00:00:51,135
Women decorate the floors
of their homes with rice flour and water.

3
00:00:51,219 --> 00:00:55,181
With this rangoli, we welcome you
to this motion picture...

4
00:00:55,264 --> 00:00:58,976
Filmed entirely in India, in bengal...

5
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:01,270
Where the story really happened.

6
00:02:35,906 --> 00:02:38,284
It is the story of m y first lo ve...

7
00:02:38,367 --> 00:02:41,537
About growing up
on the banks of a wide river.

8
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:44,332
First love must be the same anyplace...

9
00:02:44,415 --> 00:02:46,959
And it might ha ve been
in america, eng/and..

10
00:02:47,043 --> 00:02:49,670
New Zealand or timbuktu.

11
00:02:49,754 --> 00:02:53,007
Though they do not, of course,
have rivers in timbuktu.

12
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:56,594
But the fla vor of m y story
would have been different in each...

13
00:02:56,677 --> 00:02:59,305
And the flavor of the people
who live by the river...

14
00:02:59,388 --> 00:03:01,474
Would have been different.

15
00:03:01,557 --> 00:03:04,518
J'j'

16
00:03:26,665 --> 00:03:30,586
J'j'

17
00:03:37,802 --> 00:03:40,346
J'j'

18
00:04:16,757 --> 00:04:20,010
It was one of the many holy rivers.

19
00:04:20,094 --> 00:04:24,181
Its waters came from
the eternal snows of the himalayas...

20
00:04:24,265 --> 00:04:26,767
And emptied into the bay of bengal

21
00:04:27,935 --> 00:04:30,187
the river had its own life...

22
00:04:30,271 --> 00:04:33,774
Fishes and porpoise,
turtles and birds...

23
00:04:33,858 --> 00:04:37,862
And people who were born
and lived and died on it.

24
00:04:37,945 --> 00:04:41,782
It fio wed s/o w/y between
banks of mud and white sand..

25
00:04:41,866 --> 00:04:44,326
Rice fields and jute fields.

26
00:04:45,327 --> 00:04:47,538
The jute grew in fiat marshes...

27
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:49,748
Nourished by monsoon fioods.

28
00:04:50,749 --> 00:04:55,671
Country boats of all shapes and sizes
brought the jute to the factories.

29
00:04:55,754 --> 00:04:59,633
Some of them came fiom as faraway
as assam and chittagong...

30
00:04:59,717 --> 00:05:02,052
And the borders of Burma...

31
00:05:02,136 --> 00:05:04,305
Through the winding arteries
of the delta.

32
00:05:05,681 --> 00:05:08,225
The workmen carried their heavy loads.

33
00:05:08,309 --> 00:05:10,478
For each load, a seashell.

34
00:05:10,561 --> 00:05:14,023
So many shells, so many loads.

35
00:05:14,106 --> 00:05:16,650
Jute was the reason we lived in India.

36
00:05:16,734 --> 00:05:18,652
Our whole life depended on it.

37
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:22,531
My father was in charge
of a jute press.

38
00:05:22,615 --> 00:05:24,533
He was a fi'iendly man...

39
00:05:24,617 --> 00:05:27,578
And after work he always came home
through the bazaar...

40
00:05:27,661 --> 00:05:29,622
Though it was much the longer way

41
00:05:29,705 --> 00:05:32,249
he liked people,
and people liked him.

42
00:05:34,502 --> 00:05:36,712
I want to buy a kite.

43
00:05:54,605 --> 00:05:56,982
That's fine.

44
00:05:58,108 --> 00:06:00,110
How much? — four Anna.

45
00:06:04,907 --> 00:06:09,537
The days fol/o wed
one another in the even tenor of bengal

46
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:13,832
along the river were vrllages
and people living and working...

47
00:06:13,916 --> 00:06:18,462
Content in their traditions which
had not changed for thousands of years.

48
00:06:24,552 --> 00:06:26,971
In the dry season,
when the river was low...

49
00:06:27,054 --> 00:06:30,474
Lazy buffalo grazed
just outside our garden wall.

50
00:06:30,558 --> 00:06:35,896
J“ hi-ho, the derry-o
the farmer's in the Dell j“

51
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:38,649
come on, you little frogs.
Come and get 'em.

52
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:41,569
- Here, bogey boy. That's for you.
- — Daddy! Daddy!

53
00:06:43,654 --> 00:06:47,825
We were five children —
Four girls and my brother boge y ..

54
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:49,910
The only male among us females.

55
00:06:50,911 --> 00:06:53,914
Our family was very much
like any other family

56
00:06:53,998 --> 00:06:58,877
still, / think living in India
gave us a special fia vor.

57
00:06:58,961 --> 00:07:02,464
Of course, in the family
we included nan, our nurse...

58
00:07:02,548 --> 00:07:06,093
A few fiiends, our servants
and se vera/ pets.

59
00:07:06,176 --> 00:07:10,598
There was always chattering,
laughter, piano music, songs.

60
00:07:10,681 --> 00:07:12,850
Time slipped away unnoticed

61
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:15,394
ducky.

62
00:07:15,477 --> 00:07:18,022
Bogey, come back and learn
your spelling like Elizabeth.

63
00:07:18,105 --> 00:07:20,858
I don't like spelling.
I like turtles.

64
00:07:20,941 --> 00:07:23,193
One day you'll have to learn
how to spell.

65
00:07:23,277 --> 00:07:26,864
Imagine a man who couldn't go to office
and sign letters and read the newspaper.

66
00:07:26,947 --> 00:07:29,074
I don't want to be any of those men.

67
00:07:30,284 --> 00:07:32,786
Bogey's best fiiend was kanu.

68
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:34,788
They had a life separate fiom ours.

69
00:07:35,873 --> 00:07:39,460
Boge y didn't like toys.
He played with lizards and turtles.

70
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:43,797
All wrapped up in hoppity,
her rabbit, was little I/ictoria.

71
00:07:43,881 --> 00:07:46,884
Victoria, what are you doing to hoppity?

72
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:49,887
Hoppity is my baby.
He's just been born.

73
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:52,014
But you had it born last week.

74
00:07:52,097 --> 00:07:55,809
Babies can be born again
and again, can't they?

75
00:07:55,893 --> 00:07:57,895
And then there was Valerie.

76
00:07:57,978 --> 00:08:00,064
But she wasn't one of us.

77
00:08:00,147 --> 00:08:02,107
Her father owned the jute press.

78
00:08:02,191 --> 00:08:05,027
She'd been to school in england
they were iich.

79
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:08,572
She was an only child
and came every day to play with us.

80
00:08:08,656 --> 00:08:11,533
- Good afternoon, sir and madam.
- — hello.

81
00:08:11,617 --> 00:08:14,161
- — Hello, Valerie.
- How are your mother and father?

82
00:08:14,244 --> 00:08:15,996
Very well, thank you.

83
00:08:17,081 --> 00:08:19,166
My sisters were much younger.

84
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:21,168
The twins, mufiy and mouse...

85
00:08:21,251 --> 00:08:23,462
- And Elizabeth, the pianist.
- — oh!

86
00:08:23,545 --> 00:08:25,923
Good heavens!

87
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:28,092
Whose filthy little children are those?

88
00:08:28,175 --> 00:08:30,135
Yours.

89
00:08:30,219 --> 00:08:32,513
Mother. She was beautiful.

90
00:08:32,596 --> 00:08:34,973
She lo ved music.

91
00:08:35,057 --> 00:08:39,436
And there was also ram Singh,
the children's fiiend and protector.

92
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,689
He was a sikh fiom the punjab —
— j'j'

93
00:08:41,772 --> 00:08:45,025
And before being our gateman
he'd been a Valiant soldier.

94
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:48,404
But nan was the bridge to life...

95
00:08:48,487 --> 00:08:50,989
Bringing us back
fiom dreams to reality...

96
00:08:51,073 --> 00:08:53,033
Fiom reality to dreams.

97
00:08:53,117 --> 00:08:55,327
Harriet! Come here.

98
00:08:55,411 --> 00:08:57,371
I found your shoes
in the middle of the stairs.

99
00:08:57,454 --> 00:09:00,749
But, nan, the grass tickles my toes
and makes me think.

100
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:03,961
You'll get hookworm.
Why can't you be obedient like Elizabeth?

101
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:06,714
It's easy for her to be good.
She is good.

102
00:09:06,797 --> 00:09:11,260
Nan — always filling
our heads with tales of romance...

103
00:09:11,343 --> 00:09:14,138
Setting the stage for the arrival of lo ve.

104
00:09:14,221 --> 00:09:16,724
And / see myself...

105
00:09:16,807 --> 00:09:20,018
An ugly duckling
determined to be a swan.

106
00:09:20,102 --> 00:09:23,355
“Saw roses red
that comforted her heart...

107
00:09:23,439 --> 00:09:26,525
And saw their crimson petals
plop apart.”

108
00:09:30,028 --> 00:09:33,157
Then, as the ii ver brought e veiything...

109
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:36,118
It brought a young man
on the weekly steamer.

110
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:41,457
Harriet! Valerie!

111
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:43,500
He's come! — Who?

112
00:09:43,584 --> 00:09:47,129
The American! Mr. John's cousin.

113
00:09:47,212 --> 00:09:49,506
I had a string
in my cup of tea this morning.

114
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:52,634
I knew. It's always right.
Come. Let's have a look at him.

115
00:09:52,718 --> 00:09:55,304
- Come on, Harriet.
- Shh. Not so loud.

116
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:58,599
Don't leave me.
Don't leave me behind.

117
00:09:58,682 --> 00:10:01,226
- — They're looking at something.
- Somebody's coming.

118
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:03,687
Perhaps it's nan's stranger.

119
00:10:06,315 --> 00:10:08,484
I hope nan's stranger plays bridge.

120
00:10:10,444 --> 00:10:11,945
Look.

121
00:10:15,324 --> 00:10:17,534
Hey. Get down. Get down.
Don't let him see you.

122
00:10:17,618 --> 00:10:19,536
Elizabeth. Elizabeth, come down.

123
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:22,289
Get down.

124
00:10:22,372 --> 00:10:24,708
We knew very little about him...

125
00:10:24,792 --> 00:10:27,211
But nan had told us
he was coming fiom ameiica...

126
00:10:27,294 --> 00:10:30,714
To visit his cousin,
our neighbor, Mr. John.

127
00:10:30,798 --> 00:10:33,091
His name was also John.

128
00:10:33,175 --> 00:10:35,052
Captain John.

129
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:37,971
- He's beautiful.
- Men can't be beautiful.

130
00:10:38,055 --> 00:10:39,973
Yes, they can.

131
00:10:40,057 --> 00:10:45,145
What kind destiny to have brought
him all alone right to our doorstep.

132
00:10:45,229 --> 00:10:48,732
Usually visitors fiom abroad
were old and married

133
00:10:48,816 --> 00:10:51,193
another redhead.

134
00:10:51,276 --> 00:10:54,196
Harriet, one. Valerie, two.
Now there's three.

135
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:56,198
That means trouble.

136
00:10:56,281 --> 00:10:59,409
As they disappeared into Mr. John's yard..

137
00:10:59,493 --> 00:11:01,829
We thought that he had a slight limp.

138
00:11:05,082 --> 00:11:08,252
Nan, do you know what?
He's only got one leg.

139
00:11:08,335 --> 00:11:10,420
He's got two legs. I saw them.

140
00:11:10,504 --> 00:11:13,423
You little silly.
One's a pretending one.

141
00:11:13,507 --> 00:11:17,678
Valerie, if you come now,
we shall stop working and start talking.

142
00:11:23,934 --> 00:11:26,103
Well, let's hear from you.

143
00:11:26,186 --> 00:11:28,856
- Captain John was wounded in the war.
- Father was wounded too.

144
00:11:28,939 --> 00:11:31,525
- A leg's worse than an eye.
- An eye's worse than a leg.

145
00:11:31,608 --> 00:11:33,944
- I love a hero.
- Heroes don't have pretending legs.

146
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:37,865
Ah, with one leg he'll get
double pension. And in dollars too.

147
00:11:37,948 --> 00:11:39,408
It's so romantic.

148
00:11:39,491 --> 00:11:41,952
I saw a spider this morning.
That's lucky.

149
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:45,455
- How could it be lucky?
- Spiders' legs — that mean riches.

150
00:11:45,539 --> 00:11:47,958
But why did he want to come?

151
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:49,293
Why?

152
00:11:49,376 --> 00:11:50,794
Yes, why?

153
00:11:50,878 --> 00:11:53,171
Children.
Captain John was so brave.

154
00:11:53,255 --> 00:11:55,757
He stayed there in the battle
till his leg was shot off.

155
00:11:55,841 --> 00:11:59,303
Why didn't he stay there
till the other leg was shot off?

156
00:11:59,386 --> 00:12:01,930
Victoria!

157
00:12:02,014 --> 00:12:05,851
If you ask me, he should be invited
to your diwali party.

158
00:12:05,934 --> 00:12:08,770
I write the best.
I'll write a letter for you all.

159
00:12:14,902 --> 00:12:18,697
- — I'll ask Mr. John as well.
- To ask a stranger in April is very bad.

160
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:20,657
But this isn't April.

161
00:12:20,741 --> 00:12:23,493
I'll sign it
“Valerie and the big house children.”

162
00:12:23,577 --> 00:12:25,537
No. “The big house children and Valerie.”

163
00:12:25,621 --> 00:12:27,998
Wait. I've got to put his name.

164
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:31,543
“Captain John.”

165
00:12:31,627 --> 00:12:33,587
“The little house.”

166
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:37,215
Our village, bengal, India,
the eastern hemisphere and the world!

167
00:12:37,299 --> 00:12:40,344
- I'll take it.
- No, I will. It's my house, and it's my party.

168
00:12:40,427 --> 00:12:43,931
Don't leave me out.
Let's all go to the wall and have a look.

169
00:12:46,058 --> 00:12:50,187
For such an
important visit / had to put on my shoes.

170
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:52,564
The shortest way
was over the garden wall

171
00:12:52,648 --> 00:12:55,484
I 'd taken it many times
to visit Mr. John.

172
00:12:55,567 --> 00:12:58,028
Fascinating expeditions.

173
00:12:58,111 --> 00:13:01,406
Since the death of his wife,
a beautiful hindu woman...

174
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:04,618
India had absorbed
our neighbor completely

175
00:13:04,701 --> 00:13:07,162
his house was full of Indian fiiends...

176
00:13:07,245 --> 00:13:09,873
Indian books and Indian music.

177
00:13:09,957 --> 00:13:13,627
Often the sound of a vina
came through the open windows.

178
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:17,547
- — J'j' - And he had a
daughter a little older than /.

179
00:13:17,631 --> 00:13:20,801
Melanie! Melanie! Melanie!

180
00:13:22,803 --> 00:13:24,721
Melanie, you've come at last.

181
00:13:24,805 --> 00:13:27,432
Yes. Finished, Harriet.
No more school.

182
00:13:27,516 --> 00:13:29,476
- — I am grown up now.
- Quick!

183
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:31,895
- Father! — Melanie, Melanie!

184
00:13:31,979 --> 00:13:35,565
- Father!
- — oh, Melanie, Melanie, Melanie, Melanie!

185
00:13:35,649 --> 00:13:38,819
You look well, but too thin.

186
00:13:38,902 --> 00:13:41,196
You look well...

187
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:43,198
But too thin.

188
00:13:43,281 --> 00:13:46,368
We've been starving
for the sight of each other.

189
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:56,837
This is my daughter, Melanie,
home from her convent. Meet your cousin.

190
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,964
- — From america.
- How are you?

191
00:13:59,047 --> 00:14:02,843
- And this is Harriet from the big house.
- — hello, Harriet.

192
00:14:02,926 --> 00:14:05,470
Excuse me. I have to go now.

193
00:14:07,347 --> 00:14:09,266
Would you come a little way with me?

194
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:11,476
Go with him, Melanie.

195
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:16,064
I like that Indian greeting more
every time I see it.

196
00:14:16,148 --> 00:14:18,608
It's more graceful than a handshake.

197
00:14:18,692 --> 00:14:23,447
Melanie's mother was an Indian.
One day she'll discover that.

198
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:25,741
I didn't even know you had a daughter.

199
00:14:25,824 --> 00:14:29,494
In the west you believe we orientals expose
our girl children rather than keep them.

200
00:14:29,578 --> 00:14:31,538
It isn't true.

201
00:14:31,621 --> 00:14:35,208
Anil was a devoted fiiend of Mr. John 's...

202
00:14:35,292 --> 00:14:38,420
And had known Melanie
since they were both children.

203
00:14:38,503 --> 00:14:42,132
He had grown used to the idea
that one day he would marry her...

204
00:14:42,215 --> 00:14:45,135
And he was anxious
to give this girl without caste...

205
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:47,345
His name and nobility.

206
00:14:48,346 --> 00:14:51,308
Do you mean that
you can't show me one man...

207
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:54,144
Throwing a rope into the air
and climbing up to disappear?

208
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:56,188
- — No.
- Tsk, tsk, tsk.

209
00:14:56,271 --> 00:15:00,067
How about the famous Indian bed of nails?
My bed is very comfortable.

210
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:02,360
- I'm a bad host. —hmm.

211
00:15:02,444 --> 00:15:04,905
I have a letter for you.

212
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:11,536
It's to ask you
to our diwali party — all of you.

213
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:15,832
You always give a party for diwali because it's
the beginning of winter, and that's the best time.

214
00:15:15,916 --> 00:15:18,960
Ram Singh has brought the lamps,
and we light them before you come.

215
00:15:19,044 --> 00:15:22,231
Then we have ice cream and fireworks in
the garden, and we wear our new frocks...

216
00:15:22,255 --> 00:15:25,175
And we dance, and mother
makes us gold and silver crowns.

217
00:15:25,258 --> 00:15:27,177
Will you come?

218
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:30,097
That's all very nice.
But what is diwali?

219
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:31,932
The hindu festival of lights.

220
00:15:32,015 --> 00:15:35,685
Hundreds and thousands of little lamps
burning everywhere.

221
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:40,315

222
00:15:42,609 --> 00:15:45,737
I can still see the little oil lamps.

223
00:15:45,821 --> 00:15:49,199
”Diwali ” means gar/and of lights.

224
00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:51,743
They're lit in memory of a great war...

225
00:15:51,827 --> 00:15:55,539
The old eternal war
between good and evil

226
00:15:55,622 --> 00:15:59,626
for each life given in this war,
a light is lit.

227
00:16:00,627 --> 00:16:05,173
On the darkest night of October,
millions of lights burn all over India.

228
00:16:05,257 --> 00:16:08,051

J'j'

230
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:12,073
For hindus, all the universe is god

231
00:17:12,157 --> 00:17:16,244
and since god is everywhere,
it is only natural to worship a tree...

232
00:17:16,328 --> 00:17:18,455
A stone, a river.

233
00:17:18,538 --> 00:17:21,541
They all declare the presence
of the one supreme.

234
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:24,961
At our house we were all excited

235
00:17:25,045 --> 00:17:26,630
Captain John had arrived

236
00:17:26,713 --> 00:17:29,132
we played shy
and ran away into the garden...

237
00:17:29,216 --> 00:17:31,593
Screaming loudly, showing off..

238
00:17:31,676 --> 00:17:34,596
Wildly determined
to attract his attention.

239
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:37,265

seemed so wonderful

00:17:40,227 --> 00:17:42,479
This is a house of women.

242
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:46,942
I'm glad you've come to keep us company.
Bogey and I were getting unbearably vain.

243
00:17:48,902 --> 00:17:52,572
If you stay long enough, we'll arrange
a camp and get you a shot at a tiger.

244
00:17:52,656 --> 00:17:54,574
Oh, I should like that very much.

245
00:17:54,658 --> 00:17:57,327
But would the tiger?

246
00:17:57,410 --> 00:18:00,497
We lit the gorgeous I/ishnu chakra...

247
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:02,749
Ram had chosen for us.

248
00:18:02,832 --> 00:18:05,502
They burst forth
into a fountain of sparks...

249
00:18:05,585 --> 00:18:08,213
And all our emotions burst with them.

250
00:18:08,296 --> 00:18:10,423
It was a fairy tale come true.

251
00:18:10,507 --> 00:18:12,467
Nan was tiiumphant.

252
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:14,761
Although they were
too young to understand..

253
00:18:14,844 --> 00:18:17,973
Even the little ones
were caught in the spell

254

Valerie and / pretended
not to be aware of his presence...

255
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:25,438
But we knew perfectly well
that his eyes were on us.

256
00:18:36,283 --> 00:18:39,202
Hindus believe in one god..

257
00:18:39,286 --> 00:18:43,123
But they worship different symbols
which they regard as the embodiments...

258
00:18:43,206 --> 00:18:46,126
Of virtues and qualities
of the supreme being.

259
00:18:48,837 --> 00:18:53,842
That is why there are many kinds
of temples and images all 0 ver India.

260
00:18:53,925 --> 00:18:56,845
Among these symbols is Kali...

261
00:18:56,928 --> 00:19:00,056
Goddess of eternal destruction
and creation...

262
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:03,268
Creation being impossible
without destruction.

263
00:19:04,269 --> 00:19:08,064
In our vrllage on that night
there were many Kali pujas.

264
00:19:08,148 --> 00:19:12,360
The great, terrifying Kali
held court in all her magnificence...

265
00:19:12,444 --> 00:19:14,446
And the villagers gathered
to ask protection...

Kali returns to the river.

342
00:25:43,209 --> 00:25:46,087
Clay goes back to Clay.

343
00:25:53,261 --> 00:25:55,722
J'j'

344
00:26:11,779 --> 00:26:13,781
J'j'

345
00:26:20,621 --> 00:26:24,459
My dear. For a moment
I didn't recognize you.

346
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:28,421
- — You like it?
- I do.

347
00:26:28,504 --> 00:26:31,048
You look so much like your mother.

348
00:26:31,132 --> 00:26:33,092
I'm glad.

349
00:26:33,176 --> 00:26:36,012
I am going to wear a sari always, father.

350
00:26:36,095 --> 00:26:38,097
Always.

351
00:26:38,181 --> 00:26:40,141
Wonderful.

352
00:26:40,224 --> 00:26:42,852
Changed into a pretty little butterfly.

353
00:26:42,935 --> 00:26:44,937
From a grub.

354
00:26:48,274 --> 00:26:51,110
Oh, I do hope I'm loved
as much as Cleopatra.

355
00:26:51,194 --> 00:26:54,489
I shouldn't like to be loved
out loud like Cleopatra.

356
00:26:54,572 --> 00:26:57,366
I should. The louder the better.

357
00:26:57,450 --> 00:26:59,660
I want everyone to know about me...

358
00:26:59,744 --> 00:27:02,955
And I want to be loved
by hundreds of men.

359
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:05,708
One person's love
is enough for one person.

360
00:27:05,792 --> 00:27:07,710
What person?

361
00:27:07,794 --> 00:27:10,838
What person? Tell me.

362
00:27:18,304 --> 00:27:22,391
Anil is here. He wants particularly
to see you, Melanie.

363
00:27:22,475 --> 00:27:24,435
Go on, Melanie. See him.

364
00:27:24,519 --> 00:27:26,687
Do you want me to see him, father?

365
00:27:26,771 --> 00:27:29,482
I? I don't know.

366
00:27:29,565 --> 00:27:31,567
Now, now. Don't laugh at me. I...

367
00:27:31,651 --> 00:27:33,945
I'm trying to be a practical man.

368
00:27:34,695 --> 00:27:37,406
But you are not a practical man.

369
00:27:37,490 --> 00:27:40,576
If you marry anil,
he can give you so much.

370
00:27:41,577 --> 00:27:43,996
I've put you nowhere.

371
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,249
Suppose I like to be nowhere.

372
00:27:46,332 --> 00:27:48,334
Then let's go out and see him.

373
00:27:49,502 --> 00:27:52,922
- I can't.
- But you see him every day.

374
00:27:53,005 --> 00:27:55,508
I couldn't see him now.

375
00:27:58,010 --> 00:28:00,221
I'd better give the poor young man
a cup of tea.

376
00:28:00,304 --> 00:28:02,723
- Yes, go.

377
00:28:19,031 --> 00:28:22,118
Wouldn't you rather marry an American?

378
00:28:22,201 --> 00:28:24,328
I don't understand them.

379
00:28:27,456 --> 00:28:30,001
J'j'

380
00:28:31,002 --> 00:28:32,753
Show me.

381
00:28:33,838 --> 00:28:36,340
Mother, am I beautiful?

382
00:28:36,424 --> 00:28:39,969
You have an interesting little face,
full of character.

383
00:28:40,052 --> 00:28:42,680
And you have nice eyes and hair.

384
00:28:42,763 --> 00:28:45,975
Why should people be made
some pretty and some ugly?

385
00:28:46,058 --> 00:28:47,977
No one's ugly.

386
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:51,480
When you really look at them,
the most surprising people are beautiful.

387
00:28:51,564 --> 00:28:53,900
- Look at nan. — nan?

388
00:28:53,983 --> 00:28:57,111
She is nice. Now say hoppity.

389
00:28:57,194 --> 00:28:58,905
Hoppity's delicious.

390
00:28:58,988 --> 00:29:00,907
And so is Victoria.

391
00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:03,618
And bogey has such dear little bones.

392
00:29:03,701 --> 00:29:06,662
You're beautiful, mother.
Of course, you're old.

393
00:29:06,746 --> 00:29:09,749
And Elizabeth.
Of course, she's young.

394
00:29:09,832 --> 00:29:13,002
- Let me look at the other hand.
- And captain John.

395
00:29:13,085 --> 00:29:15,004
Captain John.

396
00:29:15,087 --> 00:29:18,215
Mother, I want to be
outstandingly beautiful.

397
00:29:18,299 --> 00:29:20,676
Beautiful for him.

398
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:24,555
I didn't realize that this boy
was faced with bitter reality...

399
00:29:24,639 --> 00:29:29,644
That he had no room in his thoughts for
the romantic dreams of a silly little girl

400
00:29:29,727 --> 00:29:34,690
only now do / understand
why he had traveled so far fiom his home.

401
00:29:34,774 --> 00:29:37,902
As many other boys,
he'd been uprooted by the war...

402
00:29:37,985 --> 00:29:40,488
And had become a stranger
to his own people...

403
00:29:40,571 --> 00:29:43,366
Partly their fault and partly his.

404
00:29:43,449 --> 00:29:46,118
He 'd fought bra very,
and the y'd g/oiified him...

405
00:29:46,202 --> 00:29:49,580
Parades, waving fiags, women's smiles.

406
00:29:49,664 --> 00:29:53,042
He 'd been caught
in an exciting, unreal current.

407
00:29:53,125 --> 00:29:55,044
But when a war is ended..

408
00:29:55,127 --> 00:29:58,923
Yesterday's hero
is only a man with one leg.

409
00:29:59,006 --> 00:30:02,134
He was proud
and had run away fiom pity

410
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:31,372
Father told us that he came
to see him at the jute works.

411
00:30:32,373 --> 00:30:36,252
- — Oh, hello.
- I just want to see how you spend your days.

412
00:30:36,335 --> 00:30:39,463
Well, this is my sweatshop.

413
00:30:40,756 --> 00:30:42,675
What do they do with this stuff?

414
00:30:42,758 --> 00:30:44,677
What do they use jute for anyway?

415
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:47,888
- Doormats. — vitally important.

416
00:30:47,972 --> 00:30:50,266
Must teach men to wipe their feet.

417
00:30:51,809 --> 00:30:55,521
It's just like beautiful fiaxen hair.
Why don't they keep it like that?

418
00:30:55,604 --> 00:30:58,482
The world would stop.
Think — no string.

419
00:30:59,567 --> 00:31:01,944
The jute didn't interest captain John...

420
00:31:02,028 --> 00:31:03,988
Which surprised father.

421
00:31:04,071 --> 00:31:06,615
The jute works
were very important to my father.

422
00:31:06,699 --> 00:31:09,452
He loved the fibrous jute...

423
00:31:09,535 --> 00:31:13,581
And the ne ver-ending procession of men
carrying it piled on their heads.

424
00:31:42,693 --> 00:31:45,196
Captain John went fiom place to place...

425
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:47,406
Not kno wing what to do with himself

426
00:31:47,490 --> 00:31:49,408
he wandered along the ii ver...

427
00:31:49,492 --> 00:31:52,036
And on its shores
he found a different life...

428
00:31:52,119 --> 00:31:55,748
A life new to him,
although thousands of years old

429
00:31:55,831 --> 00:31:57,875
everything was peaceful there.

430
00:31:57,958 --> 00:31:59,835
Men meditating under holy trees...

431
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:02,880
Offering prayers to the sun.

432
00:32:02,963 --> 00:32:06,133
And as e veiywhere and always,
children at their play.

433
00:32:06,217 --> 00:32:09,261
Everyone tranquil
in the security of their faith.

434
00:32:09,345 --> 00:32:14,100
But if captain John thought of religion
as an answer to his unrest...

435
00:32:14,183 --> 00:32:16,227
He did not talk about it.

436
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:18,354
He stayed within himself..

437
00:32:18,437 --> 00:32:22,191
Asking questions,
but ne ver opening his heart.

438
00:32:22,274 --> 00:32:25,820
And he seemed to be
avoiding us girls and our curiosity

439
00:32:26,821 --> 00:32:28,781
is this your place of meditation?

440
00:32:28,864 --> 00:32:31,534
Meditation is hard work.

441
00:32:31,617 --> 00:32:36,372
I'm too lazy for the big philosophies,
so I invent little ones of my own.

442
00:32:38,624 --> 00:32:41,877
- Such as?
- Oh, digestivism.

443
00:32:42,878 --> 00:32:45,589
There's a magnificent pipal tree.

444
00:32:45,673 --> 00:32:48,884
I look at it and digest what I see.

445
00:32:48,968 --> 00:32:51,011
Didn't you ever do any work?

446
00:32:51,095 --> 00:32:53,556
Oh, I did once,
but I earned too much money.

447
00:32:53,639 --> 00:32:55,724
- You see, I'm rich. — how rich?

448
00:32:55,808 --> 00:32:58,060
Hmm, for you...

449
00:32:58,144 --> 00:33:00,104
For me...

450
00:33:00,187 --> 00:33:03,774
To have so much, I had to learn
not to add but to subtract.

451
00:33:03,858 --> 00:33:05,901
That's a bit of a paradox, isn't it?

452
00:33:05,985 --> 00:33:07,903
A paradox can be true.

453
00:33:07,987 --> 00:33:12,741
Listen. Once two men stood on the middle
of the golden gate bridge.

454
00:33:12,825 --> 00:33:16,787
One jumped off, quietly swam home.

455
00:33:16,871 --> 00:33:19,165
The other didn'tjump and dropped dead.

456
00:33:20,583 --> 00:33:22,626
You think I should learn how to jump?

457
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:26,505
I'm your cousin, not your teacher.

458
00:33:28,674 --> 00:33:31,886
J'j'

459
00:33:38,976 --> 00:33:40,978
J'j'

460
00:35:13,779 --> 00:35:16,532
I want cobra! I want cobra!

461
00:35:19,952 --> 00:35:22,913
I knew the bazaar intimately.

462
00:35:22,997 --> 00:35:27,334
I knew the stand where they sold
paper garlands and painted cups.

463
00:35:27,418 --> 00:35:31,714
I knew the cloth shops where
endless yards of silk reflected the sun...

464
00:35:31,797 --> 00:35:35,634
The shop with baskets piled high
with many varieties of grains...

465
00:35:35,718 --> 00:35:38,387
Which the housewives grind
to make curry...

466
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:42,683
The vendors selling chickens and mangoes,
papa yas and coconut milk...

467
00:35:42,766 --> 00:35:45,436
Candies, betel nuts and soda water...

468
00:35:45,519 --> 00:35:48,355
And the cows
which wandered everywhere.

469
00:35:48,439 --> 00:35:50,399
I caught a glimpse of captain John...

470
00:35:50,482 --> 00:35:52,943
Passing the stall
where one could buy beauty

471
00:35:53,027 --> 00:35:54,945
black mai for the eyes...

472
00:35:55,029 --> 00:35:58,073
Red powder for beauty spots
gracing the forehead..

473
00:35:58,157 --> 00:36:01,827
Tiny bottles of perfumed oils
and Jasmine.

474
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:04,246
And / knew the fortune-teller
who came every week...

475
00:36:04,330 --> 00:36:07,416
With his tale of good luck and riches.

476
00:36:31,815 --> 00:36:34,902
J'j'

477
00:36:40,199 --> 00:36:42,868
I wanted to break through his indifference.

478
00:36:42,951 --> 00:36:44,870
I wanted to impress him...

479
00:36:44,953 --> 00:36:48,040
Tell him that/ was an author, a poet.

480
00:36:52,294 --> 00:36:55,422
Silly girl / couldn't utter a word

481
00:36:55,506 --> 00:36:57,925
j'j'

482
00:37:16,568 --> 00:37:19,571
I wonder what
the other fishes are thinking.

483
00:37:19,655 --> 00:37:23,951
Oh, they just go on swimming,
wiggling, thinking.

484
00:37:24,034 --> 00:37:28,497
They have to. But what must it feel like
right in the middle of your family?

485
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:30,916
Things do happen.

486
00:37:30,999 --> 00:37:33,419
Ah, they're only fishes.

487
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:36,338
Only fishes.

488
00:37:36,422 --> 00:37:40,509
Only fishes. Only birds. Only girls.

489
00:37:40,592 --> 00:37:43,220
I would ne ver understand men.

490
00:37:43,303 --> 00:37:46,348
But / guess you have to
accept them as they are...

491
00:37:46,432 --> 00:37:48,934
And / had decided to conquer him.

492
00:37:49,017 --> 00:37:51,353
I'd like to show you something.
It's a secret.

493
00:37:51,437 --> 00:37:55,732
Bogey knows it, and mother knows it too,
and Valerie and nan and ram Singh.

494
00:37:55,816 --> 00:37:58,694
It's a secret. Will you come?

495
00:37:58,777 --> 00:38:00,279
Fine.

496
00:38:02,531 --> 00:38:05,033
- — Hey, I'm a fairy! I'm a fairy!
- J'j'

497
00:38:05,117 --> 00:38:07,870
There. Come on.

498
00:38:07,953 --> 00:38:10,706
Play with nan. Go on.

499
00:38:10,789 --> 00:38:13,500
J'j'

500
00:38:13,584 --> 00:38:15,752
This is my secret place.

501
00:38:33,103 --> 00:38:35,105
These are my poems.

502
00:38:36,523 --> 00:38:38,817
Don't — don't breathe all over it.

503
00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:45,073
“Big river, big river.

504
00:38:58,879 --> 00:39:01,006
And in my river there are pearls.”

505
00:39:06,470 --> 00:39:09,097
Did you write this all by yourself?

506
00:39:09,181 --> 00:39:11,391
Nobody helped you?

507
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:20,484
Beautiful, Harriet.
— It is, isn't it?

508
00:39:25,697 --> 00:39:29,535
Uh, I'll finish reading them
some other time, huh?

509
00:39:47,177 --> 00:39:49,596
I hate her.

510
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:53,225
I hate her. I hate her.

511
00:39:58,730 --> 00:40:01,900
He's helping her off
as if she were a grown-up person.

512
00:40:09,408 --> 00:40:12,703
J'j'

513
00:40:19,334 --> 00:40:24,131
Valerie, captain John likes you best.
You can have him.

514
00:40:24,214 --> 00:40:26,508
What? A man with one leg?

515
00:40:26,592 --> 00:40:30,012
Oh, Valerie, you are cruel.

516
00:40:30,095 --> 00:40:32,014
I like to be cruel.

517
00:40:34,683 --> 00:40:38,020
No, I don't, Harriet. I like him.

518
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:48,196
I sought seclusion fiom my inward
despair on the roof of the house...

519
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:51,241
And comforted myself fiying kites.

520
00:40:51,325 --> 00:40:55,537
But one day, he suddenly appeared beside me
and helped me to fly the kite.

521
00:40:56,622 --> 00:41:00,542
He was close to me.
It was wonderful

522
00:41:00,626 --> 00:41:03,378
the kite and captain John.

523
00:41:03,462 --> 00:41:05,380
What mingled emotions.

524
00:41:05,464 --> 00:41:08,300
Ff

525
00:41:29,696 --> 00:41:31,698
Ff

526
00:41:52,469 --> 00:41:55,555
I'm going to give you
all my turtles, muffy.

527
00:41:55,639 --> 00:41:57,265
I'm mouse.

528
00:42:04,648 --> 00:42:08,276
There was a pipal tree
in the midst of our garden wall

529
00:42:09,611 --> 00:42:13,490
from its branches grew tentacles
deep into the ground

530
00:42:13,573 --> 00:42:15,575
the tree was like a dwelling...

531
00:42:15,659 --> 00:42:18,370
A lab ynnth where
many mysteries were hidden.

532
00:42:19,371 --> 00:42:22,582
There is one there.
I'm sure there is.

533
00:42:24,167 --> 00:42:27,254
The other side.
That's where they put the milk.

534
00:42:33,176 --> 00:42:37,013
The pipal tree
is sacred to hindus for many reasons.

535
00:42:37,097 --> 00:42:41,059
It was under such a tree that
prince gautama sat in meditation...

536
00:42:41,143 --> 00:42:43,687
And Rose to the highest heights
of enlightenment...

537
00:42:43,770 --> 00:42:45,647
To become the lord Buddha.

538
00:42:45,731 --> 00:42:49,276
Hindu women come
to the tree to worship...

539
00:42:49,359 --> 00:42:51,987
And to pray for the blessing of a son.

540
00:42:52,070 --> 00:42:55,323
J'j'

541
00:43:25,687 --> 00:43:28,565
J'j'

542
00:44:58,905 --> 00:45:02,909
No, it's not very good.
But I like to do it.

543
00:45:02,993 --> 00:45:05,245
It's part of your inheritance
from your mother...

544
00:45:05,328 --> 00:45:07,247
And your grandmother...

545
00:45:07,330 --> 00:45:09,791
And her mother's mother's mother.

546
00:45:10,792 --> 00:45:13,712
Why did you send me
to a western school?

547
00:45:13,795 --> 00:45:16,214
Because you've
a western inheritance too.

548
00:45:17,215 --> 00:45:21,720
It's a puzzle.
I don't know where you belong.

549
00:45:21,803 --> 00:45:24,848
Sometimes I think
I've put you in a frightful position.

550
00:45:25,849 --> 00:45:28,768
Perhaps you never
should have been born.

551
00:45:28,852 --> 00:45:30,979
But I am born.

552
00:45:31,062 --> 00:45:33,899
Someday I shall find out where I belong.

553
00:45:38,153 --> 00:45:41,156
“The river runs, the round world spins.

554
00:45:41,239 --> 00:45:44,659
Dawn and lamplight, midnight, noon.

555
00:45:44,743 --> 00:45:48,914
Sun follows day,
night, stars and moon.

556
00:45:48,997 --> 00:45:53,001
The day ends, the end begins. ”

557
00:45:53,084 --> 00:45:55,545
Lhad written this poem
for captain John.

558
00:45:55,629 --> 00:45:59,925
It didn't sound like any poem /d e ver
read, and/ was afiaid he wouldn't like it.

559
00:46:00,008 --> 00:46:02,719
But / felt alive
and curiously powerful ..

560
00:46:02,802 --> 00:46:05,597
Unconcerned if it were good or bad

561
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:09,851
I wanted to write more and more —
E verything about the river.

562
00:46:09,935 --> 00:46:11,895
I wanted to tell captain John...

563
00:46:11,978 --> 00:46:15,440
Howpeop/e depended on the river
spiritually as well as physically...

564
00:46:16,441 --> 00:46:19,903
River people and village people...

565
00:46:19,986 --> 00:46:24,032
How jute workers cooled off
in the river after a hard day...

566
00:46:24,115 --> 00:46:26,785
And men washed their clothes...

567
00:46:26,868 --> 00:46:30,330
About old men
warming themselves in the sun...

568
00:46:30,413 --> 00:46:33,375
Children swimming,
splashing in the water...

569
00:46:33,458 --> 00:46:36,169
And others wondering and meditating...

570
00:46:36,252 --> 00:46:40,048
Learning the wisdom of India
on the banks of the river.

571
00:46:40,131 --> 00:46:43,635
I wanted to tell about
the endless, humble daily chores...

572
00:46:43,718 --> 00:46:47,973
And about the skillful mo vements
of the men in their fiail fioating huts...

573
00:46:48,056 --> 00:46:51,142
About the market boats
filled with fiuit and vegetable...

574
00:46:51,977 --> 00:46:56,564
And about fishermen Lea ving to wards
the south, down to the sundarbans...

575
00:46:56,648 --> 00:46:58,692
And boats looking like igloos...

576
00:46:58,775 --> 00:47:01,486
Where people sleep and cook
and live in little holes...

577
00:47:01,569 --> 00:47:03,613
Dug in the mountains of rice straw...

578
00:47:04,614 --> 00:47:06,741
And about the hurried flight of birds...

579
00:47:06,825 --> 00:47:11,246
And the slow movements of boats
and the slow life on them.

580
00:47:11,329 --> 00:47:14,124
I thought about the magic
of the innumerable ghats...

581
00:47:14,207 --> 00:47:16,876
Steps leading
fiom a noisy, harassed world..

582
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:20,005
To the calm, purifying waters
of the river.

583
00:47:20,088 --> 00:47:22,132
I/o ved those steps.

584
00:47:22,215 --> 00:47:26,594
Some proud and new —
So new that they were left alone...

585
00:47:26,678 --> 00:47:30,598
And the age-worn steps
fiom which people didn't want to part...

586
00:47:30,682 --> 00:47:34,102
Rich steps dedicated
to the people by the rich...

587
00:47:34,185 --> 00:47:38,106
And poor steps given them
by long-forgotten men.

588
00:47:38,189 --> 00:47:43,278
I o very slender steps...
And steps leading to temples.

589
00:47:43,361 --> 00:47:46,614
And as the steps were punctuating
the banks of the river...

590
00:47:46,698 --> 00:47:50,452
So were the hindu festivals
punctuating the days of the year.

591
00:47:51,453 --> 00:47:56,124
The time came for the image man
to put color on the statue of Saras vatl ..

592
00:47:56,207 --> 00:47:58,585
Goddess of wisdom and arts.

593
00:47:58,668 --> 00:48:02,338
Iasked her to give me words
to charm captain John.

594
00:48:02,422 --> 00:48:04,466
As scheherazade of
the arabian nights...

595
00:48:04,549 --> 00:48:06,968
Won her life with a thousand tales...

596
00:48:07,052 --> 00:48:10,805
I decided to win his heart
with tales about India.

597
00:48:12,557 --> 00:48:15,602
I'll write a song in praise
of the lord krishna.

598
00:48:15,685 --> 00:48:17,771
You don't know anything
about krishna.

599
00:48:17,854 --> 00:48:20,148
I know everything about him.

600
00:48:20,231 --> 00:48:22,484
How do you spell him?

601
00:48:26,988 --> 00:48:34,988
K-r-i-s-h-n-a.

602
00:48:37,832 --> 00:48:41,544
Once upon a time
in a small village...

603
00:48:42,879 --> 00:48:45,965
A young wife went
with her mother to the river...

604
00:48:46,049 --> 00:48:48,760
To ask for the blessing of a child

605
00:48:51,262 --> 00:48:53,723
they offered prayers and fio wers.

606
00:48:55,475 --> 00:49:00,146
After the right number of months,
they had a little girl

607
00:49:00,230 --> 00:49:03,066
they were disappointed
because she was not a boy.

608
00:49:04,609 --> 00:49:07,529
They were disappointed
because she was not a boy.

609
00:49:08,947 --> 00:49:11,407
Oh, that's nice, Harriet. Go on.

610
00:49:13,451 --> 00:49:16,496
They had to think about
getting a dowry for the baby.

611
00:49:18,289 --> 00:49:20,500
Do we have to have them?

612
00:49:20,583 --> 00:49:22,669
What? Babies?

613
00:49:22,752 --> 00:49:26,756
No, dowries.
I mean really, not in the story.

614
00:49:32,053 --> 00:49:36,432
They had to work harder and harder
every day to get this dowry.

615
00:49:49,988 --> 00:49:54,075
They loved the baby,
and she was very well looked after.

616
00:49:54,159 --> 00:49:56,619
J'j'

617
00:49:59,247 --> 00:50:01,624
She was indeed a lo very child

618
00:50:13,136 --> 00:50:15,847
And soon she began
to help her parents.

619
00:50:26,566 --> 00:50:29,194
J'j'

620
00:50:42,165 --> 00:50:45,627
Every day, she grew bigger and bigger.

621
00:50:45,710 --> 00:50:47,712
J'j'

622
00:50:52,550 --> 00:50:55,261
She also had her river...

623
00:50:55,345 --> 00:50:59,140
And like the river,
her life fiowed on and on...

624
00:51:00,475 --> 00:51:02,769
Until she was a grown-up person.

625
00:51:08,233 --> 00:51:10,818
She was not only beautiful
on the outside...

626
00:51:10,902 --> 00:51:12,946
But on the inside as well

627
00:51:13,029 --> 00:51:14,906
better be careful, Harriet.

628
00:51:14,989 --> 00:51:17,909
If she's as good as all that, you
won't be able to find a husband for her.

629
00:51:17,992 --> 00:51:21,496
- — Yes, she will. What's he like?
- Like anil.

630
00:51:21,579 --> 00:51:24,415
- What's she like?
- — Melanie.

631
00:51:25,541 --> 00:51:28,044
Melanie and anil.

632
00:51:28,127 --> 00:51:29,629
Of course.

633
00:51:29,712 --> 00:51:33,508
One day near an old temple
she saw a young man.

634
00:51:37,345 --> 00:51:42,058
He was so beautiful she thought
he was the lord krishna come down to earth.

635
00:51:43,601 --> 00:51:47,397
Then her father told her
she had to marry a man of his choice.

636
00:51:48,648 --> 00:51:50,733
That's the ancient custom.

637
00:51:52,944 --> 00:51:55,154
She was terribly unhappy..

638
00:51:55,238 --> 00:51:59,367
Because she could not help remembering
the young man she had seen at the temple.

639
00:52:01,119 --> 00:52:04,122
But an Indian girl
ne ver contradicts her father.

640
00:52:05,456 --> 00:52:08,167
She made herself ready
for the wedding...

641
00:52:08,251 --> 00:52:11,212
And worked hard
to make it really beautiful

642
00:52:12,213 --> 00:52:14,674
the courtyard was painted
with rice flour.

643
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:18,386
The house was decorated

644
00:52:18,469 --> 00:52:21,180
the guests came.

645
00:52:21,264 --> 00:52:23,182
The bridegroom arrived

646
00:52:23,266 --> 00:52:26,185
j'j'

647
00:52:42,577 --> 00:52:44,829
The bride's mother welcomed him.

648
00:52:48,499 --> 00:52:50,918
She was very unhappy

649
00:52:52,587 --> 00:52:55,590
j'j'

650
00:53:21,199 --> 00:53:25,036
She was carried around the bridegroom
to tie the knot for life.

651
00:53:26,204 --> 00:53:28,331
He was hidden by a veil

652
00:53:29,665 --> 00:53:31,876
then the veil was lifted

653
00:53:38,132 --> 00:53:41,803
And when she removed the mango leaves
co vering her eyes...

654
00:53:41,886 --> 00:53:43,930
She saw his face.

655
00:53:45,890 --> 00:53:49,602
Lo and behold,
he was the young man she loved

656
00:53:56,734 --> 00:53:58,820
She was very happy

657
00:53:58,903 --> 00:54:02,031
he was transformed
into the lord krishna.

658
00:54:03,116 --> 00:54:06,035
She was transformed
into the lady padha.

659
00:54:08,871 --> 00:54:13,000
The real radha, who lived
thousands and thousands of years ago...

660
00:54:13,084 --> 00:54:15,002
Was also a country girl

661
00:54:15,086 --> 00:54:18,047
the love of the god
made her a goddess.

662
00:54:22,427 --> 00:54:25,721
She danced to express
her lo ve for him.

663
00:54:31,352 --> 00:54:33,938
J'j'

664
00:55:38,461 --> 00:55:41,422
With her hands and her eyes
she says to him...

665
00:55:41,506 --> 00:55:43,549
”O krishna...

666
00:55:43,633 --> 00:55:46,636
You are as beautiful
as a monsoon cloud

667
00:55:46,719 --> 00:55:49,430
your eyes are like
the lotus in bloom...

668
00:55:49,514 --> 00:55:51,432
O krishna.

669
00:55:51,516 --> 00:55:55,353
I want to be always
in your presence, o krishna.”

670
00:55:55,436 --> 00:55:57,438
J'j'

671
00:56:43,734 --> 00:56:46,779
The lady padha became
the vrllage bride again.

672
00:56:46,862 --> 00:56:50,992
The lord krishna again
became the bridegroom.

673
00:56:55,413 --> 00:56:58,666
And the young wife
went with her mother to the river...

674
00:56:58,749 --> 00:57:01,252
To ask for the blessing of a child

675
00:57:02,336 --> 00:57:04,922
I thought you said
it was about krishna.

676
00:57:05,006 --> 00:57:07,383
It's about any little girl.

677
00:57:07,466 --> 00:57:09,343
How do you spell “conclusion”?

678
00:57:09,427 --> 00:57:11,887
Why not just put “the end”?

679
00:57:11,971 --> 00:57:14,807
It isn't the end. It's endless.

680
00:57:14,890 --> 00:57:17,602
It begins all over again
with the new baby.

681
00:57:20,688 --> 00:57:24,275
Valerie, not that side.
That's my private diary.

682
00:57:24,358 --> 00:57:27,528
Valerie!

683
00:57:29,614 --> 00:57:32,491
“Captain John's face
is like Antony...

684
00:57:32,575 --> 00:57:35,536
Who made Cleopatra die.”

685
00:57:35,620 --> 00:57:38,039
Not only Antony...

686
00:57:38,122 --> 00:57:40,207
Antinotis the beautiful god.

687
00:57:40,291 --> 00:57:43,711
Listen to this.
“His face is like a sensitive plant.”

688
00:57:43,794 --> 00:57:46,964
Oh, Harry. A sensitive flower. Please.

689
00:57:52,762 --> 00:57:55,014
Harry, gently, gently.

690
00:57:57,141 --> 00:57:59,310
I'll never forgive you! Never!

691
00:57:59,393 --> 00:58:01,395
I could kill you both.

692
00:58:04,774 --> 00:58:07,568
You shouldn't have done that, Valerie.
It was her secret book.

693
00:58:08,653 --> 00:58:10,613
I didn't think that of you.

694
00:58:10,696 --> 00:58:12,907
I don't care.

695
00:58:12,990 --> 00:58:15,326
I don't care what you think of me.

696
00:58:25,294 --> 00:58:27,213
Wouldn't you like to play with me?

697
00:58:28,297 --> 00:58:30,591
No. No, thanks. — why not?

698
00:58:30,675 --> 00:58:32,760
I just don't feel like it.

699
00:58:32,843 --> 00:58:35,388
- Can you play?
- Of course.

700
00:58:56,617 --> 00:58:58,536
Aaah!

701
00:59:03,874 --> 00:59:05,876
Leave me alone.

702
00:59:09,630 --> 00:59:11,549
Get away from me, I said!

703
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:17,680
Leave me alone.

704
00:59:17,763 --> 00:59:20,099
Don't touch me.

705
00:59:49,170 --> 00:59:52,965
Valerie. Valerie, what did you do?

706
00:59:53,048 --> 00:59:55,676
He wouldn't let me touch him.

707
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:57,762
He wouldn't let me come near.

708
01:00:00,014 --> 01:00:03,309
U

709
01:00:39,053 --> 01:00:42,515
Ashes on the head for mourning, Harriet.
Not bare feet.

710
01:00:42,598 --> 01:00:44,892
You will get hookworm.

711
01:00:44,975 --> 01:00:47,311
I don't care.
I don't care what I get.

712
01:00:47,394 --> 01:00:51,065
Now I know why Cleopatra
killed herself.

713
01:00:53,651 --> 01:00:55,653
Hello, Vixen.

714
01:00:56,821 --> 01:00:58,823
Hello, darling.

715
01:01:02,993 --> 01:01:04,745
Who's that?

716
01:01:04,829 --> 01:01:06,580
Captain John.

717
01:01:10,501 --> 01:01:14,004
Well, give it to nan
to frame as a keepsake.

718
01:01:16,048 --> 01:01:19,468
We've a pretty collection of females
in this house, I must say.

719
01:01:19,552 --> 01:01:21,679
And they look half—dead with misery.

720
01:01:21,762 --> 01:01:24,640
Not all of them.
Victoria's all right.

721
01:01:24,723 --> 01:01:27,768
There. Now you're a Princess.

722
01:01:27,852 --> 01:01:31,939
The little one's for hoppity. You take it
and give it to him. He can be the prince.

723
01:01:32,022 --> 01:01:34,066
Harriet, Elizabeth.

724
01:01:34,149 --> 01:01:36,235
Nan's the ringleader, of course.

725
01:01:36,318 --> 01:01:38,571
Captain John is going away.

726
01:01:38,654 --> 01:01:40,573
Why the fuss?

727
01:01:40,656 --> 01:01:42,575
Boys are easy.

728
01:01:42,658 --> 01:01:45,160
If anything goes wrong,
you paste their bottoms for them.

729
01:01:45,244 --> 01:01:48,873
Girls. They're behaving
like tragedy queens in love.

730
01:01:48,956 --> 01:01:53,294
They are in love. They've all of them fallen
head over heels in love with captain John.

731
01:01:53,377 --> 01:01:57,882
I know, but it's ridiculous,
absurd, horrible. John?

732
01:01:57,965 --> 01:02:00,676
- Why, they're babies.
- They're not babies.

733
01:02:00,759 --> 01:02:03,554
And it may be absurd,
but it's not horrible. It's lucky.

734
01:02:03,637 --> 01:02:05,639
Lucky.

735
01:02:05,723 --> 01:02:09,727
Lucky that it is captain John.
He's so nice and so handy.

736
01:02:11,729 --> 01:02:14,315
You make him sound like
a gadget for the kitchen.

737
01:02:14,398 --> 01:02:16,317
Did you ever behave like this?

738
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:19,737
I did. When I was Harriet's age,
it was Byron.

739
01:02:19,820 --> 01:02:23,490
Then it was Valentino, I think.
Then I fell in love with the milkman.

740
01:02:23,574 --> 01:02:26,952
But John's here,
almost one of the family. A friend.

741
01:02:27,036 --> 01:02:29,288
So was the milkman.

742
01:02:29,371 --> 01:02:32,875
What I like about it most
is that it's doing the captain good too.

743
01:02:32,958 --> 01:02:34,919
It's giving him a private revolution...

744
01:02:35,002 --> 01:02:37,046
Besides breaking the children in.

745
01:02:37,129 --> 01:02:39,214
Breaking them in? I'd like to...

746
01:02:40,215 --> 01:02:43,427
I never knew I was so primitive.
If I feel like this now...

747
01:02:43,510 --> 01:02:45,846
What shall I do when
it's Tom, dick and Harry?

748
01:02:45,930 --> 01:02:47,973
You'll hold my hand...

749
01:02:48,057 --> 01:02:50,643
And let them marry
Tom, dick and Harry.

750
01:02:50,726 --> 01:02:55,356
We shall have boys buzzing round them
like mosquitoes. I can't bear it.

751
01:02:55,439 --> 01:02:57,858
I shall never know
what they'll be up to next.

752
01:02:57,942 --> 01:03:00,444
If I were in love with a man
and he was sick...

753
01:03:00,527 --> 01:03:03,197
I should at least
take him some flowers.

754
01:03:25,719 --> 01:03:28,305
U

755
01:03:44,822 --> 01:03:47,700
Bogey. Bogey!

756
01:03:47,783 --> 01:03:49,410
What are you doing?

757
01:03:49,493 --> 01:03:52,204
What are you looking at?

758
01:03:52,287 --> 01:03:54,289
Cobra.

759
01:03:56,917 --> 01:03:59,586
You mean there really is one?

760
01:03:59,670 --> 01:04:04,383
We must tell father. We must always tell
when we see snakes in the garden.

761
01:04:04,466 --> 01:04:06,635
Bogey. I'm talking to you.

762
01:04:06,719 --> 01:04:08,762
Do you see it? Do you touch it?

763
01:04:08,846 --> 01:04:11,140
Only poke it.

764
01:04:11,223 --> 01:04:13,517
You go straight back
to the house and tell.

765
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:15,519
I can't come now. I'm busy.

766
01:04:15,602 --> 01:04:17,521
Go straight now to nan.

767
01:04:17,604 --> 01:04:19,940
I didn't like nan. I like cobra.

768
01:04:20,024 --> 01:04:21,942
Go now.

769
01:04:38,834 --> 01:04:40,836
J'j'

770
01:05:16,705 --> 01:05:20,084
J'j'

771
01:05:31,053 --> 01:05:33,430
J'j'

772
01:05:34,598 --> 01:05:36,600
- Gopal.
- Yes?

773
01:06:30,362 --> 01:06:32,281
You don't want to talk to me.

774
01:06:33,407 --> 01:06:35,784
You are always at the big house.

775
01:06:36,785 --> 01:06:40,497
Well, I'm here now.
I barely even catch a glimpse of you.

776
01:06:43,292 --> 01:06:46,545
You and your father
are so happy together.

777
01:06:46,628 --> 01:06:49,089
Sometimes I feel that I've spoiled it.

778
01:06:53,802 --> 01:06:56,388
Never mind.
I — I'm going anyway.

779
01:07:00,934 --> 01:07:03,770
Where will you go?

780
01:07:03,854 --> 01:07:07,274
Anywhere from... China to Peru.

781
01:07:08,734 --> 01:07:13,906
- It makes no difference?
- No. It's the same story anywhere I go.

782
01:07:13,989 --> 01:07:16,450
I spoil everything.

783
01:07:16,533 --> 01:07:18,660
I can't seem to help it.

784
01:07:18,744 --> 01:07:21,413
I'm a stranger.
You know what that means?

785
01:07:21,496 --> 01:07:23,415
A stranger.

786
01:07:25,876 --> 01:07:28,128
Valerie thinks she taught me a lesson.

787
01:07:28,212 --> 01:07:30,631
Well, I don't accept it.

788
01:07:30,714 --> 01:07:33,133
I refuse to be bound by this!

789
01:07:33,217 --> 01:07:35,677
I'm a normal man in any country.

790
01:07:37,179 --> 01:07:40,474
Where will you find
a country of one-legged men?

791
01:07:40,557 --> 01:07:42,726
Don't tell me I...

792
01:07:48,023 --> 01:07:50,108
Please forgive me.

793
01:07:50,192 --> 01:07:52,569
I — I didn't mean it.

794
01:07:54,404 --> 01:07:56,573
It's not only this.

795
01:07:56,657 --> 01:07:59,618
I can't seem to keep
my thoughts steady. They...

796
01:07:59,701 --> 01:08:01,787
I ask and I ask and...

797
01:08:05,874 --> 01:08:07,876
I — I'm sorry.

798
01:08:08,961 --> 01:08:12,130
I don't know what I'm saying.
I have a stupid headache.

799
01:08:15,342 --> 01:08:17,261
Can I help you?

800
01:08:19,388 --> 01:08:21,390
Can anyone?

801
01:08:24,768 --> 01:08:26,895
I thought you disliked me.

802
01:08:31,108 --> 01:08:33,026
Do you?

803
01:08:35,279 --> 01:08:37,656
It is not you I dislike.

804
01:08:38,907 --> 01:08:40,826
Who is it?

805
01:08:49,293 --> 01:08:51,211
Who is it?

806
01:08:51,295 --> 01:08:53,255
Myself.

807
01:08:57,134 --> 01:09:00,178
I was caught in an unexpected intrigue...

808
01:09:00,262 --> 01:09:04,266
But my adolescent pride
would not let me turn back.

809
01:09:04,349 --> 01:09:08,437
The magic of the moment
absorbed Valerie too.

810
01:09:08,520 --> 01:09:11,064
Only Melanie resisted ..

811
01:09:11,148 --> 01:09:15,360
For an Indian girl knows better
the seriousness of lo ve.

812
01:09:15,444 --> 01:09:18,780
When she gives her heart,
it is forever.

813
01:09:19,781 --> 01:09:23,035
The enchantment
began and ended in the gro ve.

814
01:09:23,118 --> 01:09:26,121
Suddenly we were running away
fiom childhood..

815
01:09:27,831 --> 01:09:29,833
Rushing to ward lo ve.

816
01:09:56,151 --> 01:09:58,153
Melanie.

817
01:10:58,547 --> 01:11:03,510
Melanie, like a Doe — hesitant, be wrldered

818
01:11:03,593 --> 01:11:05,846
was she sorry she had run away?

819
01:11:05,929 --> 01:11:08,098
Captain John, moody and disturbed ..

820
01:11:08,181 --> 01:11:10,100
Back in his whirl of doubt.

821
01:11:10,183 --> 01:11:13,228
I, with my elaborate bouquet...

822
01:11:13,311 --> 01:11:15,188
Awaiting my chance.

823
01:11:15,272 --> 01:11:18,483
Valerie, so impetuous.

824
01:11:27,826 --> 01:11:30,287
You didn't want to see me anymore...

825
01:11:30,370 --> 01:11:32,289
But I came.

826
01:11:41,882 --> 01:11:43,967
I was rude to you.

827
01:11:45,469 --> 01:11:46,970
Yes.

828
01:11:48,138 --> 01:11:50,056
I shouted at you.

829
01:11:51,308 --> 01:11:52,809
Yes.

830
01:11:55,353 --> 01:11:57,272
And still you come.

831
01:11:59,983 --> 01:12:01,485
Yes.

832
01:12:24,841 --> 01:12:28,970
The kiss on her lips —
Terrifying and fascinating...

833
01:12:29,054 --> 01:12:31,515
Burned into my heart and hurt.

834
01:12:32,599 --> 01:12:34,935
It was my first kiss...

835
01:12:35,018 --> 01:12:37,521
But received by another.

836
01:12:37,604 --> 01:12:39,523
I couldn't bear it.

837
01:12:45,779 --> 01:12:47,364
Don't cry.

838
01:12:49,157 --> 01:12:51,243
Ah, you mustn't cry.

839
01:12:53,703 --> 01:12:55,914
I am going, but...

840
01:13:03,380 --> 01:13:07,175
I'm not crying because you're going.

841
01:13:08,260 --> 01:13:11,221
I'm crying because it is going.

842
01:13:11,304 --> 01:13:12,806
It?

843
01:13:14,933 --> 01:13:16,434
What “it”?

844
01:13:19,813 --> 01:13:22,607
This... being together...

845
01:13:22,691 --> 01:13:24,609
In the garden.

846
01:13:25,610 --> 01:13:28,905
All of us happy,
and you with us here.

847
01:13:30,407 --> 01:13:32,993
I didn't want it to change...

848
01:13:33,076 --> 01:13:35,787
And it's changed.

849
01:13:35,870 --> 01:13:38,373
I didn't want it to end...

850
01:13:38,456 --> 01:13:40,417
And it's gone.

851
01:13:41,418 --> 01:13:43,420
It was like something in a dream.

852
01:13:44,504 --> 01:13:46,506
Now you've made it real.

853
01:13:57,601 --> 01:13:59,603
I didn't want to be real.

854
01:14:43,688 --> 01:14:45,690
Harriet.

855
01:14:55,575 --> 01:14:57,077
Harriet.

856
01:15:07,504 --> 01:15:09,422
Harriet.

857
01:15:09,506 --> 01:15:11,424
Come here.

858
01:15:17,681 --> 01:15:20,517
Ever since diwali,
everything's been different.

859
01:15:20,600 --> 01:15:23,687
I feel so funny,
as if I were being stretched.

860
01:15:23,770 --> 01:15:26,439
Nan says they're growing pains.

861
01:15:26,523 --> 01:15:28,441
Perhaps nan's right.

862
01:15:28,525 --> 01:15:30,443
I didn't know it hurt to grow.

863
01:15:30,527 --> 01:15:33,905
Harriet, how much
do you know about life?

864
01:15:33,988 --> 01:15:38,201
Life? Oh, you mean babies
being born and growing up?

865
01:15:38,284 --> 01:15:40,495
Everything.

866
01:15:40,578 --> 01:15:43,373
But there are so many
different kinds of love.

867
01:15:43,456 --> 01:15:47,794
No. Only one.
From Cleopatra right down to you.

868
01:15:47,877 --> 01:15:49,796
Did Cleopatra have a baby?

869
01:15:49,879 --> 01:15:52,048
I'm sure she did. Dozens.

870
01:15:52,132 --> 01:15:54,592
I never thought of that.

871
01:15:54,676 --> 01:15:56,761
Having a baby hurts you terribly.

872
01:15:56,845 --> 01:15:58,763
No more than it ought.

873
01:15:58,847 --> 01:16:01,474
It's meant to make you think and feel.

874
01:16:01,558 --> 01:16:03,476
Justfikelove.

875
01:16:03,560 --> 01:16:06,855
In a few weeks' time, Harriet,
I shall be having our baby.

876
01:16:07,939 --> 01:16:11,359
When snowball had her foal,
her eyes looked scared, and she screamed.

877
01:16:11,443 --> 01:16:13,486
I don't know how
you can bear it, mother.

878
01:16:13,570 --> 01:16:15,822
I love father.

879
01:16:15,905 --> 01:16:17,949
Come here.

880
01:16:18,032 --> 01:16:19,993
Having children for the man you love...

881
01:16:20,076 --> 01:16:23,329
Is a precious, sanctified work.

882
01:16:23,413 --> 01:16:25,749
It's the meaning of a woman.

883
01:16:25,832 --> 01:16:28,084
And as you know, Harriet,
as you grow older...

884
01:16:28,168 --> 01:16:30,628
Your body changes to get ready for it.

885
01:16:31,629 --> 01:16:33,715
I think that's what's happening to you.

886
01:16:33,798 --> 01:16:36,426
- — To me?
- Yes, Harriet.

887
01:16:37,427 --> 01:16:40,680
I wish I were a cabin boy
and could run away to sea.

888
01:16:40,764 --> 01:16:42,682
I wanted to be an explorer.

889
01:16:42,766 --> 01:16:44,851
I hate bodies.

890
01:16:44,934 --> 01:16:48,396
If I were you, Harriet,
I'd go and have a good play with bogey.

891
01:16:48,480 --> 01:16:51,524
Play? I shall never play again.

892
01:18:28,329 --> 01:18:29,831
Bogey.

893
01:18:34,878 --> 01:18:36,379
Kanu.

894
01:18:48,224 --> 01:18:50,393
Kanu.kanu.

895
01:18:51,519 --> 01:18:53,021
Kanu!

896
01:19:14,584 --> 01:19:16,502
Kanu.

897
01:19:16,586 --> 01:19:19,714
Kanu! Kanu!

898
01:19:52,997 --> 01:19:55,249
Bogey.bogey.

899
01:19:55,333 --> 01:19:57,335
Bogey, bogey, bogey.

900
01:20:02,048 --> 01:20:05,593
J'j'

901
01:20:23,987 --> 01:20:26,322
J'j'

902
01:20:28,324 --> 01:20:31,577
J'j'

903
01:20:47,927 --> 01:20:50,430
J'j'

904
01:21:01,441 --> 01:21:03,443
J'j'

905
01:22:04,212 --> 01:22:06,214
J'j'

906
01:23:23,082 --> 01:23:24,584
Thanks.

907
01:23:29,672 --> 01:23:31,674
I drink to the children.

908
01:23:34,177 --> 01:23:38,723
We should celebrate
that a child died a child.

909
01:23:38,806 --> 01:23:40,808
That one escaped.

910
01:23:42,476 --> 01:23:44,478
We lock them in our schools.

911
01:23:45,479 --> 01:23:48,691
We teach them our stupid taboos.

912
01:23:49,775 --> 01:23:52,111
We catch them in our wars...

913
01:23:52,195 --> 01:23:54,780
And they can't resist.

914
01:23:54,864 --> 01:23:58,034
They've no armor,
and so we kill them.

915
01:23:58,117 --> 01:24:00,369
We massacre the innocents.

916
01:24:01,370 --> 01:24:04,081
And the world is for children —
The real world.

917
01:24:05,082 --> 01:24:07,960
They climb trees
and roll in the grass.

918
01:24:08,044 --> 01:24:10,046
They're close to the ants...

919
01:24:10,129 --> 01:24:12,506
And as free as the birds.

920
01:24:13,633 --> 01:24:16,636
They're like animals.
They're not ashamed.

921
01:24:17,637 --> 01:24:19,889
They know what is important.

922
01:24:20,890 --> 01:24:23,476
A mouse is born...

923
01:24:23,559 --> 01:24:26,270
Or a leaf drops in a pond.

924
01:24:27,688 --> 01:24:30,733
If the world could be made of children...

925
01:24:51,837 --> 01:24:53,839
Try and eat a little, Harriet.

926
01:24:57,510 --> 01:24:59,512
What are you hiding?

927
01:25:03,349 --> 01:25:05,351
We can't keep that.

928
01:25:08,854 --> 01:25:10,940
We don't need to keep things, Harriet.

929
01:25:11,023 --> 01:25:13,359
It's so horrid, so cruel.

930
01:25:13,442 --> 01:25:15,611
Roast potatoes and peas.

931
01:25:15,695 --> 01:25:17,863
As if we had wiped bogey away.

932
01:25:17,947 --> 01:25:20,324
We go on
as if nothing had happened.

933
01:25:20,408 --> 01:25:22,368
No, we don't.

934
01:25:22,451 --> 01:25:24,412
All we do is to go on.

935
01:25:26,956 --> 01:25:29,125
I knew about the cobra, mother.

936
01:25:30,960 --> 01:25:32,962
I know you did.

937
01:25:37,967 --> 01:25:41,178
It's not her fault.
It's the captain's.

938
01:25:41,262 --> 01:25:44,432
If she hadn't had her head full of him,
she would have told.

939
01:25:45,433 --> 01:25:48,352
As soon as I set eyes on him,
I knew there would be trouble.

940
01:25:48,436 --> 01:25:51,314
Dear nan. Please.

941
01:25:57,069 --> 01:25:59,071
I can't!

942
01:25:59,155 --> 01:26:01,657
I can't.

943
01:26:03,743 --> 01:26:05,244
I can't.

944
01:26:11,083 --> 01:26:13,002
Yes, you can.

945
01:26:41,030 --> 01:26:44,325
Bogey, bogey, bogey, bogey, bogey.

946
01:26:54,627 --> 01:26:56,629
Where did bogey go?

947
01:26:59,465 --> 01:27:02,093
Bogey is in heaven.

948
01:27:02,176 --> 01:27:06,013
- He's a little angel.
- — I lent him my wings.

949
01:27:26,826 --> 01:27:29,954
J'j'

950
01:27:44,093 --> 01:27:46,971
J'j'

951
01:28:37,980 --> 01:28:39,982
J'j'

952
01:29:13,807 --> 01:29:15,309
Bogey.

953
01:29:15,851 --> 01:29:18,354
Yes. Bogey.

954
01:29:22,441 --> 01:29:24,360
Melanie, what do we do?

955
01:29:26,862 --> 01:29:28,364
Consent.

956
01:29:30,741 --> 01:29:33,827
- — To what?
- To everything.

957
01:29:34,828 --> 01:29:37,790
You don't like being a man with one leg...

958
01:29:37,873 --> 01:29:40,417
But you have only one leg.

959
01:29:40,501 --> 01:29:42,503
I don't like...

960
01:29:43,671 --> 01:29:45,673
You don't like?

961
01:29:47,383 --> 01:29:49,969
Never mind.

962
01:29:50,052 --> 01:29:53,097
Why do we quarrel
with things all the time?

963
01:29:56,976 --> 01:29:59,520
In my case, it was not a quarrel.

964
01:29:59,603 --> 01:30:01,647
It was a rebellion.

965
01:30:03,691 --> 01:30:06,151
So, I thought, was mine.

966
01:30:06,235 --> 01:30:08,988
Now I know it was only a quarrel.

967
01:30:17,580 --> 01:30:20,708
Melanie, I'm not a stranger anymore.

968
01:30:30,134 --> 01:30:31,635
Harriet's gone.

969
01:30:34,847 --> 01:30:39,018
There were so many unsaid
things I'd forgotten to tell boge y ..

970
01:30:39,101 --> 01:30:41,854
And now / would ne ver tell him.

971
01:30:41,937 --> 01:30:45,107
The fishermen saw me
swept down with the current.

972
01:30:46,233 --> 01:30:49,486
Later, in their boat,
I came back to life.

973
01:30:49,570 --> 01:30:52,823
They warmed me
and offered to take me home...

974
01:30:52,906 --> 01:30:55,034
But / refused

975
01:30:55,117 --> 01:30:58,203
j'j'

976
01:31:34,323 --> 01:31:36,492
People like me ought to die.

977
01:31:40,913 --> 01:31:42,873
Ah, I can't reach it.

978
01:31:42,956 --> 01:31:45,542
Hand me a light
like a good girl, will ya, Harry?

979
01:31:51,340 --> 01:31:53,342
I don't think you're the type.

980
01:32:06,188 --> 01:32:09,525
People like you
just don't lie down and die.

981
01:32:09,608 --> 01:32:11,652
What will I do then?

982
01:32:12,736 --> 01:32:15,280
You'll begin again.

983
01:32:15,364 --> 01:32:17,950
You know what I think?

984
01:32:18,033 --> 01:32:20,119
I think with everything
that happens to you...

985
01:32:20,202 --> 01:32:22,955
With every person you meet
who is important to you...

986
01:32:23,038 --> 01:32:26,375
You either die a little bit
or are born.

987
01:32:27,543 --> 01:32:30,337
Someone said something
like that to me once.

988
01:32:30,421 --> 01:32:32,756
It must have been someone very wise.

989
01:32:33,757 --> 01:32:36,218
Oh, I remember.
It was little Victoria.

990
01:32:38,387 --> 01:32:41,932
- Did you ever die?
- Two or three times.

991
01:32:42,015 --> 01:32:45,060
You won't tell anybody. Promise?

992
01:32:46,645 --> 01:32:48,981
Promise.

993
01:32:58,949 --> 01:33:00,951
Just think, Harry.

994
01:33:01,034 --> 01:33:05,622
One of your poems might still
be alive in, say, 4000 ad.

995
01:33:08,250 --> 01:33:10,377
Captain John, I love you.

996
01:33:21,054 --> 01:33:24,224
Now you've kissed me,
as well as Valerie.

997
01:33:29,354 --> 01:33:31,899
Come on. I'll take you home now.

998
01:33:37,321 --> 01:33:41,533
Hey. Gonna have to help me.
You know I've only got one leg.

999
01:33:42,534 --> 01:33:45,204
Who's important to you,
captain John?

1000
01:33:45,287 --> 01:33:46,789
Everybody.

1001
01:33:57,007 --> 01:33:59,551
The new wind came, and it was spring.

1002
01:33:59,635 --> 01:34:04,056
The joyful, unchanged rites,
symbolic of the temptation of man.

1003
01:34:04,139 --> 01:34:06,767
Hindus celebrate the new season.

1004
01:34:11,313 --> 01:34:14,775
- J'j' - — j'j'

1005
01:34:27,162 --> 01:34:30,165
- J'j' - J'j'

1006
01:36:35,540 --> 01:36:37,542
Harriet.

1007
01:36:37,626 --> 01:36:39,628
Melanie and Valerie.

1008
01:36:47,094 --> 01:36:49,012
- — Where's nan?
- In the summer house.

1009
01:36:49,096 --> 01:36:51,223
Nan. — Nan. Quick_

1010
01:36:51,306 --> 01:36:55,185
Our baby, our baby, our baby, our baby!

1011
01:36:55,268 --> 01:36:57,354
You're wanted, nan. In there.

1012
01:36:57,437 --> 01:36:59,690
Our baby, our baby!

1013
01:37:00,732 --> 01:37:02,734
Letters from america.

1014
01:37:13,370 --> 01:37:15,664
- Captain John!
- Captain John.

1015
01:37:15,747 --> 01:37:19,751
Semper fide/is.
He still keeps the apple.

1016
01:37:19,835 --> 01:37:21,753
What apple?

1017
01:37:21,837 --> 01:37:25,465
The same old apple. Paris's, Eve's.

1018
01:37:25,549 --> 01:37:27,801
Once you've tasted it,
you're never the same.

1019
01:37:28,927 --> 01:37:31,013
It'll be your turn next.

1020
01:37:31,096 --> 01:37:34,057
- Does it taste nice?
- Too nice.

1021
01:37:35,142 --> 01:37:37,310
Now you run along and play
in the summer house.

1022
01:37:37,394 --> 01:37:39,521
Go on, darling.

1023
01:37:58,540 --> 01:38:00,459
It's a girl.

1024
01:38:06,048 --> 01:38:08,050
Shh.

1025
01:38:11,511 --> 01:38:13,638
No, no, no, no. You must wait.

1026
01:38:30,197 --> 01:38:32,365
Ten minutes ago she wasn't born...

1027
01:38:32,449 --> 01:38:34,493
And tomorrow we'll be used to her.

1028
01:38:34,576 --> 01:38:36,745
- And yesterday we —
- Bother yesterday.

1029
01:38:36,828 --> 01:38:39,664
- This is today.
- And today.

1030
01:38:39,748 --> 01:38:43,168
Here is the baby,
the baby and us...

1031
01:38:43,251 --> 01:38:47,005
The big river, the whole world
and everything.

1032
01:38:52,385 --> 01:38:55,097
J'j'

1033
01:38:55,180 --> 01:38:57,933
The river runs, the round world spins.

1034
01:38:58,016 --> 01:39:01,186
Dawn and lamplight,
midnight, noon.

1035
01:39:01,269 --> 01:39:05,357
Sun follows day,
night, stars and moon.

1036
01:39:05,440 --> 01:39:08,819
The day ends. The end begins.
